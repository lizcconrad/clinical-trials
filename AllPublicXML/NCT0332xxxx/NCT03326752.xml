  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion trial is designed to evaluate the
      safety and preliminary efficacy of inhaled DV281 in combination with an approved anti-PD-1
      inhibitor for the treatment of NSCLC and to select a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical studies support the proposed dosing schema to be tested and a potential benefit
      of the combination of inhaled DV281 with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor for subjects with
      advanced NSCLC. This study (DV9-NSC-01) is designed for establishing an immunologically
      optimal RP2D for inhaled DV281 in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor. This
      trial, studying the potential to enhance the efficacy of an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor in
      subjects with advanced NSCLC, addresses an unmet need for NSCLC patients having tumors that
      do not respond or do not respond adequately to anti-PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy.
