  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      MK-7252 in healthy adults. Participants receive ascending doses of MK-7252 over five
      treatment periods. Each treatment period is separated by a 7-day washout period.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE. The number of participants who experience an AE will be presented.</description>
