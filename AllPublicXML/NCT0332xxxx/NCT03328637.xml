  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Smartphone has been adopted faster than any other device in the history of digital
      electronics. Hence it is estimated that in 2016, 2.1 billion were found registered Smartphone
      users in the world and Pakistan was ranked 10th in the list of top 10 countries with largest
      number of mobile phone subscribers. Despite of its useful and timely utilization, the
      excessive use of Smartphone coerce the Individual to be dependent on the use of Smartphone
      psychologically and even physically. Furthermore, among the users, adolescents and young
      adults used Smartphone (90%) more than any other age groups. Moreover, this prevalence is
      expected to rise in the future due to the easy availability and swift changes and addition of
      new applications to Smartphone technology. Subsequently, the excessive and irrational use of
      Smartphone leads to Smartphone addiction which impact on individual mental health, physical
      health, and disrupt social, economic and educational functions. So, this study aims to assess
      the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as an evidence based remedy in the
      treatment of Smartphone addiction. The study will comprise of two groups; one will receive
      CBT (intervention group) and the other one will be on Treatment As Usual (TAU). The aim of
      the study is to assess the effectiveness of CBT primarily by measuring the addictive
      smartphone usage assessed by Smart Phone Addiction Scale (SAS) and also on secondary outcomes
      including time management, academic performance and social functioning of adolescents. These
      assessments will be conducted before intervention (on the baseline assessment sessions),
      during the Intervention and after the intervention (on follow up assessment sessions). A
      total of 120 students were calculated on the basis of 80% statistical power required to
      detect the effect as indicated by previous study and will be selected from different
      educational institutions. SPSS 23.0 will be used for data analysis. The primary analysis will
      be mixed ANOVA to compare the between group and within group means differences on measures
      used in the study. Multiple Hierarchical Regression analysis will also be used for the
      prediction of outcome variables from the demographics. The total duration of the study is one
      year.

      This study primarily aims to assess the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      as an evidence based remedy in the treatment for Smartphone addiction. The basic purpose is
      to minimize the severity of Smartphone addiction up to manageable level. Furthermore, there
      are certain psychiatric symptoms that are found to be associated with the addictive usage of
      Smartphone like stress, depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, attention deficits and conduct
      problems. The study design will also allow to assess the effectiveness of CBT on such
      outcomes: (a) The depression, anxiety and stress level of the participants (b) The time
      management of the participants (c) The emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity
      and attention deficit problems, peer relationship problems and pro-social behavior aspects of
      the participants (d) The satisfaction level of the participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS; Assessing Change)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline (after the screening), 6th week (1/2 month) after the baseline, 12th week (3rd month) after the baseline and at 6th month. The purpose of the outcome measure is to asses the change from baseline to follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) is used to asses the severity of smartphone dependency and addiction. It consists of 33 items (Kwon et al., 2013). Individuals have to respond on the Likert scale between 1-6, where 1 indicates strongly disagree and 6 indicates strongly agree. The amounts of answers were divided to three levels of addiction: low (1-66), medium (67-132) and high (133-198). Internal reliability of SAS was found to be Î± = .99. This scale will be used as a primary outcome and will be included in the baseline and follow ups assessment to assess the degree of change from baseline to 3rd month and 6th month follow-ups.</description>

    <measure>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline (after the screening), 6th week (1/2 month) after the baseline, 12th week (3rd month) after the baseline and at 6th month.</time_frame>
    <description>It is 42 items scale developed by Levibond and Levibond (1995). It has three subscales and each of them contains 14 items. The depression scale, the anxiety scale and the stress scale. There are cut off scores established to categorize the individual scores in the mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe categories. It has 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 (Did not apply to me at all) to 4 (Applies to me most of the time). This questionnaire will be used in the baseline and follow-ups assessment sessions.</description>

    <measure>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline (after the screening), 6th week (1/2 month) after the baseline, 12th week (3rd month) after the baseline and at 6th month.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has 25 items in all and uses a 3 point Likert scale supporting five factors: 'emotional symptoms', 'conduct problems', 'hyperactivity and attention deficit problems', 'peer relationship problems' and 'prosocial behavior' (Goodman, 1997). For the first four factors, the lower the score, the better, and for the last factor the higher the score, the better. This question will be also used in the baseline and follow-ups assessment sessions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline (after the screening), 6th week (1/2 month) after the baseline, 12th week (3rd month) after the baseline and at 6th month.</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLC) is a 5-item scale designed to measure the global cognitive judgements of one's life satisfaction (Diener, Emmons, Larsen &amp; Griffin, 1985). Participants indicate how much they agree or disagree with each of the five items using a 7-point scale that ranges from 7 strongly agree to 1 strongly disagree. The higher score indicates higher satisfaction. This scale will be used in our baseline and follow-ups assessment sessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire will be employed on the 6th week (1/2 month) after the baseline, 12th week (3rd month) after the baseline and at 6th month</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire is a brief and simple scale to measure the patient satisfaction with mental health services (Gani, Saeed, Minhas, Anjuman, Waleed &amp; Fatima, 2011). The questionnaire has 8 items and the participants have to respond on 4 point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4. The total score of participant ranges from 8 to 32 where minimum score 8 reflects dissatisfaction and a maximum score 32 reflects maximum satisfaction. This questionnaire will be used after all of the intervention (CBT) sessions.</description>

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will be provided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a common psychological intervention based on the notion that thoughts trigger the emotions. In CBT patients are trained to monitor their thoughts and identify those that trigger addictive feelings and actions while they learn new coping skills and ways to prevent a relapse (Beck, Wright, Newman &amp; Liese, 2001). The treatment period of CBT is three months consisting of a weekly session and total 12 sessions. Initial stage of therapy is behavioral, centering on specific behaviors and situations. Latter on there is more of a focus on the cognitive assumptions and distortions that have developed and the effects of these on behavior.</description>
