  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention for insulin injection
      initiation based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) for insulin-naïve patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) proposed by Prochaska and Diclemente, people
      will experience different stages of change before the actual behavioral change takes place.
      Ineffectiveness of intervention to instigate behavioral change is largely due to failure to
      take into account the stage of change in which individuals are. The TTM suggests that
      decisional balance, which reflects the relative difference between pros and cons, is
      important for influencing the stage of change. In order to achieve behavioral change, the
      perceived pros of changing must be strengthened to outweigh the cons. In addition, individual
      must be self-convinced that the behavioral change is important for themselves. Furthermore,
      the process for behavioral change can be provided to facilitate behavioral change in
      individuals. The theory of TTM has yet been used to improve the behavior of insulin
      initiation in insulin-naïve patients with T2DM. Thus, this study aims to assess the
      effectiveness of an intervention for insulin injection initiation based on the TTM in
      insulin-naïve patients with T2DM.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with T2DM at a clinic in southern Taiwan are assigned to the intervention arm, whereas patients with T2DM at the endocrinology department of a hospital in northern Taiwan are placed in the control arm. Eligible patients that match the inclusion criteria are recommended by doctors to initiate insulin treatment. Research assistants will explain the objectives of this study to eligible participants. Subsequently, baseline data will be collected from participants by research assistants after the participants sign the consent forms. Afterwards, the participants in the intervention arm will receive the intervention. For the control arm, the participants will receive regular patient education originally administered at the hospital.</intervention_model_description>
