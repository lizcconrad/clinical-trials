  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is literature to support both the need for and efficacy of brief interventions for
      depressive symptoms, particularly among college students.Brief behavioral activation
      interventions (BATD) have gained recognition as efficacious treatments for depression; yet a
      recent study evidenced a substantial (39%) non-response rate (Kuyken et al., 2017). In
      accordance with behavioral models of depression, the treatment involves increasing activity
      and positive experience, to break the negative reinforcement cycle maintaining depressed
      mood. Thus, strategies that may facilitate increasing activity may improve BATD outcomes. The
      objective of the current study is to examine whether briefly practicing a target activity
      during an activity planning session (modified single session of BATD) increases the
      likelihood of completing the activity during the upcoming week. We hypothesized that guided
      activity practice may improve self-efficacy within session and activity completion in the
      upcoming week. We further aim to explore whether activity completion mediates depressive
      symptom change.

    <measure>Percent Activity Completion Between Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete daily surveys for seven days following the initial visit. Participants will answer whether or not the activity was completed that day. Data will be collected using Qualtrics survey software. The outcome variable is the percentage of days the participant completed the activity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Efficacy in Response to Therapist Guided Activity Practice</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Following the activity planning portion of the initial visit, participants rate the degree of self-efficacy (confidence in ability to complete the goal) on a scale from 0 (no confidence) to 100 (complete confidence). Participants randomized to Enhanced Activity Practice condition will complete a second rating following the activity practice. The pre-to-post difference score in self-efficacy will be examined as a primary outcome.</description>
