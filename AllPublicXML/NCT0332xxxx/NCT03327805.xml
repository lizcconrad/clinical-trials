  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite produced by gut microbial metabolism of dietary
      choline, has recently been causally linked to atherosclerosis in animal models and has been
      shown to be predictive of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in some but not all cohort
      studies. The relevance of observations in animals to humans is unclear and little information
      is available on the mechanisms linking TMAO to increased CVD risk. Vascular dysfunction plays
      a critical role in the initiation and progression of atherothrombotic disease. Whether TMAO
      impairs vascular function in humans is not known. The purpose of this study is to determine
      if acute supplementation of dietary choline, which increases TMAO, impairs vascular function.

    <measure>Change in brachial artery function after supplementation</measure>
    <time_frame>30-minute measurement in laboratory</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery function or flow mediated dilation (FMD), the blood flow and diameter of the brachial artery in the forearm (fMD), will be measured using a duplex ultrasound machine before and after the inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the forearm for 5 minutes and after placing a nitroglycerine tablet (0.4 mg) under the participant's tongue. This test will be conducted once at baseline and then once after each 5-day period of the randomly-assigned supplement (choline or placebo), including a 1-week washout period (crossover design). Off-line analysis of baseline and post-reactive hyperemic diameters and velocities will be performed using edge detection software (Vascular Analysis Tools, Medical Imaging Applications, Inc.).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in arterial stiffness after supplementation</measure>
    <time_frame>45-minute measurement in laboratory</time_frame>
    <description>The blood flow and diameter in the common arteries in the neck will be measured from the image obtained from an ultrasound unit (GE Vivid S6) equipped with a high resolution linear array transducer. For applanation tonometry, the carotid, brachial, radial and femoral artery pressure waveform and amplitude will be obtained by a fingertip probe incorporating a high-fidelity strain gauge transducer. Each of these measures are used to calculate arterial stiffness. These tests will be conducted once at baseline and then once after each 5-day period of the randomly-assigned supplement (choline or placebo), including a 1-week washout period (crossover design).</description>
