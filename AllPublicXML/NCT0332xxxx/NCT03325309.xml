      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a home-based cycling program for patients
      with lumbar spinal stenosis is a feasible and acceptable

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling condition in elderly individuals. Lumbar
      spinal stenosis results in lumbar and/or radicular leg pain when standing and walking, while
      symptoms regress in lumbar flexion positions and at rest. The inability to stand or walk
      impairs functioning and health-related quality of life of elders, and has an important
      healthcare cost. The 2 main treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis are conservative or
      surgical. Laminectomy may be more effective on pain and function than conservative therapy.
      However, the benefit-risk balance of surgery should be considered in this population with
      numerous co-morbidities, and evidence is inconsistent. Therefore, conservative therapy is
      usually the first line option to avoid or delay surgery. Data regarding exercise therapy are
      scarce. Lumbar-flexion-based exercises are usually recommended. A pilot study suggested that
      lumbar-flexion-based endurance training, namely cycling, could be an effective and safe
      method to improve pain, function and health-related quality of life in elderly patients with
      chronic low back pain but barriers to adhering to the program were detected. Investigators
      aim to assess barriers and facilitators to a 3-month home-based cycling program in lumbar
      spinal stenosis.
