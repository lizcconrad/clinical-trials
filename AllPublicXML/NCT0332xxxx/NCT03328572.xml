      1. RATIONALE All-ceramic endocrowns are bonded to the tooth using adhesive resins creating
           strong bonds to the tooth structure resulting in strengthening effect and reducing the
           need for post and core. various CAD/CAM materials can be used for the fabrication of
           endocrowns including lithium-disilicate reinforced glass-ceramics, feldspathic ceramics,
           in ceram alumina and in ceram spinell as well as hybrid ceramics and composites.

           Fewer data are available on the clinical performance of the different materials used for
           endocrowns. With the rapid innovation in the dental restorative materials clinicians are
           sometimes confused when selecting the best restorative material to restore an
           endodontically treated tooth with an endocrown. This is due to lack of data with regard
           to clinical performance of these restorations as well as the degree of patient
           satisfaction.

      II. Introduction 6.a. Background and rational 6.a.1. Background Endodontically treated teeth
      often show marked coronal mutilation,(1) which influence the structural integrity of such
      teeth and pose a higher risk of biomechanical failure than vital teeth.(2)

      Traditionally those teeth are restored using post retained full coverage crowns.(3) Such
      treatment was thought to be the ideal way of restoring endodontically treated teeth while
      reinforcing the remaining tooth structure.(4) However, it was reported by many authors that
      placing a post can enhance the retention of the coronal restoration and the crown but at the
      same time carrying out the preparation for post insertion can weaken the remaining tooth
      structure, and hence increasing the risk of catastrophic tooth fracture.(5)

      All-ceramic endocrowns are bonded to the tooth using adhesive resins creating strong bonds to
      the tooth structure resulting in strengthening effect and reducing the need for post and
      core.(6) various CAD/CAM materials can be used for the fabrication of endocrowns including
      lithium-disilicate reinforced glass-ceramics, feldspathic ceramics, in ceram alumina and in
      ceram spinell as well as hybrid ceramics and composites.(7)

      6.a.2 Description of research question

      Formulated question:

      In patients with endodontically treated molar teeth requiring endocrown restorations, what
      are the clinical performance and the level of patient satisfaction of cerasmart endocrown
      versus lithium disilicate (e-max) ceramic endocrowns? 6.a.3 Justification for undertaking the
      trial: In 2016 Borgia et al. in their retrospective study to report the clinical performance
      of 11 endocrowns over a period of 9-18 years concluded that Endocrown being a conservative
      and aesthetic approach can be used to restore posterior endodontically treated teeth, mainly
      molars, with a very good biomechanical and functional performance, and very acceptable
      longevity. (22) Also the clinical performance of ceramic endocrowns showed a survival rate of
      99 % and the success rate of 89.9 % in a 10 year retrospective study done by Bellflamme et
      al. 2017, where lithium disilicate (IPS Empress 2 or e-max) constituted 84.8 % of the
      functioning endocrowns while 12.1 % for polymer infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic) and only 3
      % for artisanal indirect composite.(7)

      However, lithium disilicate ceramics have disadvantages that may influence the outcome of the
      endocrowns, among which is the high stiffness and rigidity owing to the higher modulus of
      elasticity (67.2 GPa)(18) compared to natural dentin (18.6 GPa)(19) which may affect the
      marginal adaptation.(12) Moreover, high stress values will be induced with a detrimental
      effect on the biomechanical behavior of the restorative system when used to replace
      dentin.(20)

      Rationale:

      From a biomimetic point of view, the less brittle composite CAD/CAM blocks offer mechanical
      properties that are closely related to those of human dentin.(6) Nano ceramic material being
      more resilient and having lower stiffness and lower elastic modulus (12.1 GPa)(23) comparable
      to that of human dentin (18.6)(24) can act as a cushion and offer force absorption qualities
      thus reducing the stresses transferred to the adhesive junction.(25)

      Benefits of the research to the patient:

      Patient will receive a restoration with superior marginal adaptation and quality.

      It will provide the patient with long-term predictable prosthetic outcome.

      Benefits of the research to the clinician:

      Practitioner will have the advantage to assess a new material that can be used in different
      situations for better marginal adaptation outcomes and bio integration.

      It will improve patient's confidence with the dentist.

      6.b. Explanation for choice of comparators: Ceramic material used for endocrown fabrication
      should be of acid etchable quality in order to obtain the necessary retention for such
      restoration through the adhesive cementation system.(15) thus lithium disilicate either
      machined or pressed seem to be the best restorative options in this case.(26)

      In 2012 Biacchi and Basting reported that lithium disilicate ceramics possess a high bonding
      capacity to the dental structure which makes them the best restorative materials for
      endocrowns.(27)

      Moreover lithium disilicates have been reported to offer high mechanical strength combined
      with exceptional esthetics which mimics greatly natural tooth appearance.(15) 7.a.
      Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance and patient
      satisfaction of new flexible ceramic material Cerasmart compared to lithium disilicate
      endocrowns.

      7.b. Research hypothesis: Cerasmart endocrowns may have better clinical performance if
      compared with Lithium disilicate ceramic endocrown restorations.

      8. Trial design: Randomized Clinical Trail (parallel group with 1:1 allocation ratio) A
      Superiority trial. III. A. Methods: Participants, interventions, and outcomes 9. Study
      setting: This study will be carried out on patients enrolled from the Outpatient clinic in
      fixed prosthodontics clinic, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University.

      10. Eligibility criteria:

      11. Interventions: 11.a. Main procedures: Methods

        1. Patients collecting:

           (E.M) will select no of patients from outpatient clinic in fixed prosthodontic
           department clinic regarding previously mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria.

           Suitable participants will be informed about the experimental trial and the possible
           complications that could occur during the period of this experiment. Each participant
           will be asked to sign informed consents, which will be provided in patient native
           language.

        2. Tooth preparation and restoration placement:

      (E.M) is responsible for all clinical procedure that will be conducted in this study

      Pre-operative phase:

      - Clinical records will be taken including history, clinical examination and clinical
      photographs

        -  Radiographs will be taken for the proposed abutments.

        -  Primary impressions will be taken and poured to obtain the study casts.

             1. st visit: (E.M) will call all selected participant before tooth preparation
                procedure for X-ray reviewing and pre-operative photographing using a digital
                camera also; primary impression will be taken using alginate impression material *
                for study cast analysis combined with suitable size stock tray**.

             2. nd visit: (Tooth preparation) After performing adequate disinfection and
                sterilization procedures for each instrument and tool that will be used in this
                trial, endocrown preparation will be carried out following the principles of
                endocrown preparation with a circumferential butt joint margin (of 1.5-2 mm
                thickness) with a reduction of at least 2 mm in the axial direction and a central
                retention cavity (of 3mm depth) making the coronal pulp chamber and the endodontic
                access cavity continuous. Walls less than 2 mm thick will be removed. 1-2 mm of
                Flowable composite resin base will be used to fill the undercuts. 2 observers will
                select visually the appropriate shade. Secondary impressions will be taken for each
                participant in each group using silicon rubber base impression material ***
                combined with suitable size tray Impressions will be removed from patient mouth
                after final setting and will be checked for accuracy

      This will be followed by temporization using temporary filling material **** and will be left
      till the placement of endocrown in the next visit.

      Impressions will be sent to the lab, which will be poured with extra hard stone material,
      after final setting of casts; it will be removed from the impression.

      Casts will then be scanned using a scanning unit and then data will be saved on the computer.

      Restoration fabrication:

      Using Cerec in Lab software 4.2, a design of the desired e-max and cerasmart endocrowns will
      be planned in the form of a fully anatomical molar with a standardized proposal from the
      software this proposal will then be saved on the computer.

      The e-max block as well as the cerasmart block will be fixed into its place in the wet
      milling machine, then the milling preview will be screened to check for any further
      adjustment, and finally an order will be given to the milling machine to mill the endocrowns.

      3rd visit: Participants will be called again for final cementation. Temporary filling will be
      removed and abutments will be cleaned of any residues using pumice slurry ***** applied with
      bristle brush and rubber cup under water irrigation.

      Proper isolation will be done before cementation then permanent resin cement ******will be
      used for luting of the endocrowns according to the manufacturer instructions. The patients
      will be requested to hold the endocrowns under occlusal compression until luting cement
      polymerization. After 5 minutes, excess cement will be removed.

      Measuring of different outcomes will be in this visit for all patients. 11.b. Criteria for
      discontinuing interventions Conditions for discontinuing the prosthetic treatment include
      disappearance of the patient with loss of contact or patient's own request.

      11.c. Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocol: Face-to-Face adherence
      reminder session will take place in the initial visit. This session will include: the patient
      should be informed about the study steps and maintain oral hygiene. Subsequent sessions will
      occur at the follow-up visits. Participants will be asked about any problems they are having
      like pain, and oral hygiene.

      11.d. Relevant concomitant care and interventions that are Permitted or prohibited during the
      trial: Motivation and maintenance of oral hygiene measures.

      12. OUTCOMES

      The following assessment surveys (clinical evaluations) will be carried out for both groups:

      T1 = immediately after restoration delivery periapical radiograph. T2 = postoperatively:
      assessment of the restoration for patient satisfaction. The primary outcomes including
      retention, marginal adaptation, anatomic form, secondary caries, and surface texture will be
      examined using sharp explorer.

      The secondary outcomes including modified gingival bleeding index and gingival periodontal
      index will be assessed and measured using periodontal explorer.

      Both the primary as well as the secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, after 1
      month, then after 3 months and finally after 6 months (28) which will be enough for any color
      change or soft tissue response to take place.(29) Patients will be asked to give their
      restorations a grade out of 10 in order to indicate the level of their satisfaction.

      All the grades of all the patients in both groups will be collected (for the alpha, bravo and
      Charlie) and the scores for the modified gingival index and the gingival periodontal index
      and aggregation will be done for the results.

      For the clinical performance outcome, aggregates of all the alpha grades will be grouped as
      well as for the bravo and Charlie grades, then a percentage will be calculated for each
      grade.

      For the soft tissue response outcome, the discrete scores will be gathered and grouped (0-4)
      for the modified gingival index and (0-5) for the gingival periodontal index and a percentage
      will be calculated for each group.

      For the patient satisfaction outcome, the results will be grouped in five groups (0-2, 3-4,
      5-6, 7-8 and 9-10) and a median will be drawn for each group.

      13. Participant timeline:

      The patient will be treated in visits designated as follows:

        -  Visit (1): Preoperative records, signing consents, clinical, radiographic examination
           and primary impression for diagnostic cast construction.

        -  Visit (2): Teeth preparation, secondary impression and temporary restorations.

        -  Visit (3): try in

Alpha (Excellent) ideal.
Bravo (Acceptable) less than ideal but no modifications required
Charlie (Acceptable but modifications needed) staining or other shade modifications required.
All the grades of all the patients in both groups will be collected (for the alpha, bravo and Charlie) and the scores for the modified gingival index and the gingival periodontal index and aggregation will be done for the results.
For the clinical performance outcome, aggregates of all the alpha grades will be grouped as well as for the bravo and Charlie grades, then a percentage will be calculated for each grade.</description>
