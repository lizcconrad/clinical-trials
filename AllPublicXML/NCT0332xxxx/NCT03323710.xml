    <description>Change from baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) v3.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range from 0 to 100. High score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning. High score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL. High score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems. Scoring these scales include the following steps:
Estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale (the raw score).
Use the linear transformation to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, or a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>

The PSS is a validated psychological tool for assessing the perception of stress. Patient responses to all of the 10 questions present in the PSS questionnaire range from 0 to 4. To obtain a total result:
Reverse scores for questions 4, 5, 7, and 8.
Add up scores for each question to get a total result. Individual total scores range from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher perceived stress.</description>
