  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a chronic inflammation of the small
      bowel mucosa, triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains.

      The diagnosis of celiac disease was initially based on duodenal biopsies obtained from upper
      endoscopy. Since 1990, the availability of serological tests has contributed to a different
      perception of the disease. Serological testing is now considered fundamental for celiac
      disease screening, even if duodenal biopsies remain the gold standard. Celiac markers usually
      include anti-TG2 antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies, anti-gliadin antibodies and
      anti-reticulin antibodies. Recently, several studies showed that deamidated products of
      gliadin may enhance T-cell stimulatory activity and improve the reactivity of anti-gliadin
      antibodies. Thus, detection of anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies has been introduced
      into the wide spectrum of serological tests for celiac disease.

      The aim was to assess the clinical relevance of anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies
      compared with the other common celiac markers.
