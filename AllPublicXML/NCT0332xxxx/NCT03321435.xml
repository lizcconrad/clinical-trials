  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta previa is a placenta that implants at lower uterine segment, it occurs in about
      0.3-0.5% of pregnancies at term. It is a significant risk for development of maternal
      morbidity, as well as maternal mortality secondary to maternal hemorrhage . Also, this
      abnormal placenta has a negative concern about fetal well being due to prematurity and
      perinatal mortality, in addition to its undesirable effect on fetal growth. Several factors
      may be behind of the effect of placenta previa on fetal growth. Firstly, the blood supply to
      the lower uterine segment is less than at the upper segment apparently resulting in less
      feto-placental blood perfusion . Secondly, recurrent bleeding attacks from placental previa
      may affect fetal oxygenation and fetal growth.

      In spite of above evidences; many studies in literature denied the relation between placenta
      previa and fetal growth and concluded that the association between low birth weight and
      placenta previa is mainly due to preterm delivery and to a lesser extent with fetal growth
      restriction. However; the major drawback of all these studies is lacking of reporting the
      effect of placenta previa of feto-maternal blood flow representing in studying of Doppler
      blood flow in both uterine and umbilical artery in those patients. The uterine artery blood
      flow is usually affected by the presence of placenta previa and placenta accreta which
      reflected on feto-placental blood flow. So the uterine artery Doppler velocimetry is a useful
      tool for predicting placenta accreta .

      So in the light of above evidences; we aimed, in the current study, not only to investigate
      the effect on placenta previa on fetal weight but also to walk around the effect of placenta
      previa on the uterine and umbilical arteries blood flow in trial to explore this conflicting
      issue. To our knowledge, no previous trial had studied this interesting subject before.
