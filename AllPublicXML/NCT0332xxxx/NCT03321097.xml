    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine and compare the motor learning process, immediate
      and long-term effects of combined Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection between condensed
      and distributed robot-assisted training (RT) programs in patients with spastic hemiplegic
      stroke. Spasticity, a common impairment after stroke, has a profound impact on activity and
      participation for patients. According to the result of the investigator's ongoing study, the
      investigators found BoNT-A injection combined with robot-assisted training is recommended to
      enhance functional recovery for patients with spastic hemiplegic stroke. However, the optimal
      program as considering the RT frequency is unknown.

      The aims of this study are to determine and compare the motor learning processes and
      immediate and longer-term effects between condensed and distributed programs of RT following
      BoNT-A injection in subjects with spastic hemiplegic stroke .

      To estimate the sample size,the investigators conducted a power analysis based on the
      findings of the previous research. If the investigators take WMFT-quality into account, with
      an overall effect size of 0.72, a power set at 0.80, and a two-sided type I error of 0.05,
      the sample size calculation resulted in 32 participants per group. If the investigators take
      WMFT-time into account, with an overall effect size of 1.66, a power set at 0.80, and a
      two-sided type I error of 0.05, the sample size calculation resulted in 7 participants per
      group. Based on the above results and taking into account the possible 10 % dropout rate, the
      investigators plan to recruit 35 participants for each group resulting in a total sample size
      of 70 patients with stroke.

      At least 70 participants with chronic spastic hemiplegic stroke will be recruited and
      randomly assigned to either condensed or distributed RT groups post BoNT-A injection. Each
      training session included 40 minutes RT, followed by 40-minute functional training. The
      condensed group will receive 4 sessions per week, for 6 weeks, the distributed group 2
      sessions per week, for 12 weeks. Body function and structures outcome measures include
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Modified Ashworth Scale, myometer (Myoton-3), actigraph. Activity and
      participation measures include Wolf Motor Function Test, Ten meter walk test, Motor Activity
      Log, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Canadian Occupational
      Performance Measure. In addition, to directly reflect a patient's unique needs and goals,
      Goal Attainment Scaling will be assessed. Evaluators will be blind to group allocation. The
      outcome will be measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-week follow-up. The
      investigators will also use the movement time of robot without powered assistance and surface
      EMG to determine the motor learning processes of patients receiving the two practice
      frequencies of RT.

      This comparative efficacy study will be the first to examine and compare the motor learning
      processes and immediate and long-term effects between condensed and distributed RT post BoNT
      injection. The results may provide clinicians with the appropriate methods to scheduling RT
      following BoNT-A injection to improve upper limb functions for patients with hemiplegic
      spasticity stroke. From the socioeconomic perspectives, identify the optimal frequency of
      Robotic therapy post BoNT-A injection may reduce medical resource utilization, expenditures,
      and care-giver burden.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The upper-extremity (UE) subscale of the FMA will be used to assess neuromusculoskeletal and movement related functions. It consists of 33 upper extremity items for the reflexes and movement of shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, and coordination/speed. They are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0-cannot perform, 1-performs partially, 2-performs fully)(Fugl Meyer et al., 1975). Higher score indicates better motor function of UE, and the maximum score is 66.
Satisfactory psychometric properties of the FMA have been demonstrated(Hsueh &amp;amp; Hsieh, 2002;Platz et al., 2005).
The outcome will be measured at 4 time points: 1 week before intervention, 5 weeks after injection (in the middle of intervention), 1 week after intervention (post-intervention), 6 weeks after intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity motor ability through timed and functional tasks (Uswatte, Taub, Stuss, Winocur, &amp;amp; Robertson, 1999). The WMFT includes 17 tasks (15 function-based and 2 strength-based). Performances were timed and rated by using a 6-point ordinal scale. The WMFT has good interrater reliability and criterion validity in patients with UE hemiparesis (Morris, Uswatte, Crago, Cook, &amp;amp; Taub, 2001; Whitall, Savin, Harris-Love, &amp;amp; Waller, 2006) .
The outcome will be measured at 4 time points: 1 week before intervention, 5 weeks after injection (in the middle of intervention), 1 week after intervention (post-intervention), 6 weeks after intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (Masiero et al.)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity of skeletal muscle in upper extremity will be evaluated by using the MAS scale (Bohannon &amp;amp; Smith, 1987). It uses a 6-point scale to score the average resistance to passive movement for each join with higher score indicating higher spasticity. The MAS has shown good reliability and validity (Pandyan et al., 1999).
The outcome will be measured at 4 time points: 1 week before intervention, 5 weeks after injection (in the middle of intervention), 1 week after intervention (post-intervention), 6 weeks after intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM, a semi-structured interview, will be used to assess a participant's perception of the performance in the areas of self-care, productivity and leisure (Dedding, Cardol, Eyssen, &amp;amp; Beelen, 2004). The COPM can capture information about activities that the participant wants, needs or is expected to perform. The participant will be asked to rate five most important activities on a 10-point scale for performance, ranging from 1 (not at all able) to 10 (able to perform extremely well), and for satisfaction, ranging from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied)(Dedding et al.,2004). The COPM is a reliable, valid, and responsive outcome measure for practitioners and researchers (Carswell et al., 2004).
The outcome will be measured at 4 time points: 1 week before intervention, 5 weeks after injection (in the middle of intervention), 1 week after intervention (post-intervention), 6 weeks after intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal attainment scale (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS is a useful measure of participants' individual goals that could be achieved in the course of intervention (L. Turner-Stokes, 2009). In the first session, the therapist will discuss with the participants and their families to define the goals. Each goal will be rated on a 5-point scale ranging from -2 to +2 in the last session. The GAS enables the data to be placed on a quantitative measurement scale and can be helpful for qualitative interpretation (L. Turner-Stokes, 2009).
Evidence of validity and responsiveness for the GAS was reported in previous studies(Gordon, Powell, &amp;amp; Rockwood, 1999; Rockwood, Stolee, &amp;amp; FoxP, 1993). The outcome will be measured at 4 time points: 1 week before intervention, 5 weeks after injection (in the middle of intervention), 1 week after intervention (post-intervention), 6 weeks after intervention.</description>
