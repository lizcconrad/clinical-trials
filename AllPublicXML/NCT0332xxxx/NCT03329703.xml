  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Project
      UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) is a group telephone
      program designed to improve depression for people with epilepsy. Project UPLIFT uses
      evidence-based approaches of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based
      cognitive therapy to help people manage and prevent symptoms of depression.

      For people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, there are few treatment options for
      depression that address the relationship between mood and seizures. There is evidence that
      mindfulness-based therapy and cognitive therapy are both effective for people with
      non-epileptic seizures, both in treating depression and reducing seizure frequency. In this
      study, Project UPLIFT will be offered to patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.

      Project UPLIFT is facilitated by a trained clinician to groups of 4-8 patients over the
      telephone. The group will meet at a regular time, once a week, for 8 consecutive weeks.
      Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: an immediate-treatment or a waitlist
      control group which will begin Project UPLIFT 3 months after enrolling in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon enrollment in the study, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an
      immediate-treatment group, or a 3-month waitlist control group. Both groups will be given
      surveys to complete online, and a seizure calendar to keep track of auras, seizures, and
      events. The immediate-treatment group will be scheduled to start Project UPLIFT with their
      trained facilitator. Each of the eight weekly sessions will take place at the same day of the
      week and at the same time, and will last approximately one hour. Participants will have the
      option of using a fake-name during the telephone calls to conceal their identity during the
      group telephone calls.

      After the 8 weekly sessions, both groups will be given a second set of online surveys to
      complete individually. At this time, the waitlist control group will be scheduled to start
      Project UPLIFT with the trained facilitator. After the waitlist group completes the final
      session of Project UPLIFT, both groups will complete a third and final set of online surveys,
      thus concluding all study procedures.
