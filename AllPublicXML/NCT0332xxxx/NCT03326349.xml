    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of Guttmann NeuroPersonalTrainer (GNPT), a
      tele-rehabilitation platform developed as a tool for the cognitive rehabilitation of chronic
      stroke patients. All patients will receive this treatment but in different order: half will
      receive GNPT and the other half will receive sham cognitive training; after a washout period
      of three months, crossover will occur and participants from the GNPT condition will receive
      sham cognitive training, while participants originally from the control intervention will
      receive GNPT.

    <description>Guttmann NeuroPersonalTrainer (GNPT) is a telerehabilitation platform. GNPT consists of a set of computerized cognitive exercises covering different cognitive functions and subfunctions. Every task has been specifically based on cognitive paradigms to address specific cognitive subfunction. The rehabilitation process starts by assigning a patient to a therapist responsible for the treatment. The therapist has then to perform the initial neuropsychological assessment, consisting of a set of validated tests used to attention, memory and executive functions prior to the treatment. The results of these tests will be stored in GNPT system. Then, the cognitive profile is calculated using these results, and taking into account the patient's age and study level. Using this profile, the program assigns a set of computerized tasks to a certain day, configuring the input parameters of each task in order to personalize treatments.</description>

    <description>An online domain which provides a daily session of one hour of duration. Each session consists of four ten-minute videos. After each video, the participant must complete a three-question quiz about the contents of the video (for example, &quot;What animal appears in in the video?&quot;). The difficulty level is minimal, and does not vary depending on the execution of the participant.</description>
