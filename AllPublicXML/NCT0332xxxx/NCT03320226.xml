  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose as well as the aim of this project is to understand the effect of probiotics on
      gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation that are found
      during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.

      The primary objective of this project is to uncover whether probiotics have an effect on GI
      functional disorders.

      The secondary objective is to identify the microbiota associated with probiotic intake.

      The tested hypothesis is that gut microbiota influences the GI functions and may influence
      constipation, nausea, and vomiting during pregnancy.

    <description>The suggested dose will be two (2) pills of Probiotic 10 (Nature's Bounty) after dinner daily. Subjects will be asked to take probiotics for six (6) days after providing baseline fecal specimen. Subjects will self-report their daily GI function including the frequency of nausea, vomiting, and bowel movement(s). Then, the subjects will stop taking probiotics for two (2) days and resume taking probiotics for another six (6) days. This six (6)-day on and two (2)- day off cycle is repeated two (2) times.</description>
