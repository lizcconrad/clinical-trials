  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Investigator Initiated, non-commercial, single center, non-randomized, single arm,
      open label pilot study on 194 patients. The patients are affected by prostate cancer but in
      two different clinical settings. The first group is characterized by patients who are going
      to be operated of radical prostatectomy and they will undergo the study imaging
      preoperatively. The second group experiences biochemical relapse after primary treatment.

    <textblock>
      Novel, sensitive tools, such as 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging, have great potential for very early
      disease detection and open the possibility of early curative local salvage treatment (with
      surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of both). This project will moreover provide important
      insights into the biodistribution and dosimetry of 68Ga-PSMA, opening possibilities of
      90-Yttrium or 177-Lutetium-PSMA-based radionuclidetherapy of patients with metastatic PC in
      the future.

      The study consists of 2 work units (WU):

      Work-unit 1: Patients at high risk for nodal involvement prior to radical prostatectomy with
      extended lymph node dissection Work-unit 2: Biochemical recurrence after initial treatment
      with curative intent
