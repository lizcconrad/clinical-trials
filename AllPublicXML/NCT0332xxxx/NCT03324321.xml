  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, 23,000 (15%) of the 150,000 people who suffer a stroke each year have bleeding in
      the brain, also referred to as acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). An Autoregulation Index
      (ARI) can be assigned between 0 and 9 (0 being poor and 9 being the most efficient CA
      observed) to gauge how good the control over blood flow is at a given time. Dynamic CA (dCA)
      is a measure of the response of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to rapid changes in blood pressure
      (BP), and several key studies have shown impaired dCA post-acute ICH. The most recent study
      demonstrated that dCA impairment lasts up to 12 days. This is particularly important to
      understand, since our preliminary work has recently shown that changes in carbon dioxide
      using simple breathing exercises can improve Autoregulation.

      Unfortunately, there are limited non-pharmacological management options and significant
      opportunities to improve patient outcome in ICH. The proposed study addresses this area, by
      investigating whether a simple breathing exercise in survivors of ICH is safe, feasible and
      effective in reducing brain injury by improving cerebral autoregulation.

Two-minute washout periods of normal respiration will be allowed between successive measurements. Each incremental reduction in pCO2 will be repeated on two occasions during the same session. Further assessments will be conducted 10-14 days following baseline assessments.</description>
