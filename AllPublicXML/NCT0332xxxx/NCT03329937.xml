          -  Patient must have recovered to Grade 1 toxicity from prior cancer therapy

          -  Able to take oral medications

          -  Patient (of childbearing potential) is not breastfeeding, has a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to taking study drug, and agrees to abstain from

             last dose of study drug, or is of nonchildbearing potential.

          -  Able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in the study by
