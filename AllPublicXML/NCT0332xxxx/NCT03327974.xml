  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a frequent disease and a serious public health problem, of which suicide is the
      most severe complication. Its treatment is based on the introduction of antidepressant which
      not only proposes a significant delay in the relief of symptoms but also by the phenomenon of
      lifting of inhibition can increase the suicidal risk during the initiation phase. Therefore
      there is a major interest in proposing a monitoring of these dark and suicidal ideas,
      immediately after the implementation of such treatment as well as other symptoms of
      depression. Thus, we aim to identify the mechanisms underlying this increase in dark and
      suicidal ideas in this context.

      We propose to assess, with an ecological momentary assessment method, the evolution of black
      ideas over 30 days following the introduction or switch of an oral antidepressants.

      We will recruit 103 patients suffering from a current major depressive disorder in the
      Montpellier University Hospital.

      Each patient will attend a total of 3 scheduled visits, which will be completed over a period
      of 1 month (inclusion, between 10-15 days, 1 month. During this month, the patient will have
      to complete daily assesments throught a smartphone application &quot;Depasse&quot;.

    <intervention_name>DEPASSE Apllication</intervention_name>
    <description>Application DEPASSE in depressed patients. This application was developed by the laboratory SERVIER, by a scientific committee of psychologists and psychiatrists: Pr. Courtet, Dr Rimlinger and Pr. Swendsen.
Depasse is available for all on the App store and on Googleplay.
This application has several interests:
- The first is the daily monitoring of the symptoms allowing a regular evaluation throught smileys simulating a scale from 1 to 5. The 10 parameters evaluated are: mood, dark ideas, sleep, stress, concentration, social activities, energy, pleasure, motivation and libido.
There is the possibility to generate a graph representing the evolution of these parameters.
Tips adapted to the actual mood are provided related to the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; parameters.</description>
