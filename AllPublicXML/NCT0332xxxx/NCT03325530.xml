  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure impact of improved healthy food access and physical activity opportunities at
      summer Boy Scout camp, a four-week intervention to address nutrition and physical activity
      with youth (n=911) and adults (n=247) was conducted at Bashore Scout Reservation in
      Jonestown, Pennsylvania between June and July of 2016. Intervention components included
      dining hall menu modifications, healthy messaging, introduction of nutritious snacks
      available for purchase, and a physical activity challenge.

      Menu modifications resulted in improved satisfaction scores related to portion sizes (+28%)
      and variety (+14%), decreased plate waste, and consistent food costs. Introduction of
      nutritious snacks at Trading Post resulted in increased satisfaction (+13%) and increased
      sales per person (+20%). Physical activity increased (+22%) as a result of a step competition
      between troops. Small changes towards a healthier camp were widely accepted and successful,
      indicating potential for translation to other camps within the organization.
