  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) complicates about 20% of pregnancies in Singapore. These women are
      at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes years after pregnancy; seven times more likely
      than normal. Achieving a healthy weight post-delivery is key to reduce the risk of future
      diabetes. This study, from a multidisciplinary team, intends to create a unique seamless care
      model to restore optimal weight post-delivery in women with recent GDM. The innovation
      examined in this randomized control trial is an INTERACTIVE SMARTPHONE APP. The APP monitors
      weight, dietary habits, and exercise activity patterns, gives feedback, and provides
      practical personalized lifestyle coaching that is culturally appropriate and customized to
      the Singapore context. If efficacy is confirmed in this RCT, the APP can be easily scaled up
      as a cost-effective way to potentially prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in
      Singaporean women. Additionally, measurement of markers of cardiometabolic risk will give
      indications on future cardiovascular health, utilizing an underused opportunity to improve
      women's health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 20% of pregnant Singaporean women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM),
      defined as the onset of glucose intolerance that is first recognized in pregnancy. These
      women are at seven times higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. About 20 -
      50% of women who were diagnosed with GDM during their pregnancies eventually develop type 2
      diabetes, with resultant huge health care costs for Singapore and other countries globally.
      The Diabetes Prevention Program Study has shown that lifestyle changes resulting in modest
      weight loss are effective in preventing type 2 diabetes in women with a history of GDM. The
      investigators estimate that about 50% of all type 2 diabetes in women in Singapore occurs
      when they have a history of GDM and represent a sizeable subpopulation where primary
      prevention could have a highly significant national impact. Preliminary data indicates that
      after birth, women with GDM are overwhelmed with care for the newborn and tend to neglect
      their own health needs. They welcome reminders and coaching but are time-challenged and
      cannot attend regular on-site lifestyle coaching sessions.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Use of an INTERACTIVE SMARTPHONE APP that can track weight, diet and activity linked to
           an interactive lifestyle coaching intervention can restore optimal weight in women with
           recent GDM. The team hypothesizes that at 4 months post-delivery, participants in the
           intervention arm will have significantly higher probability of returning to weight at
           the start of pregnancy, a significantly improved cardiometabolic status and overall
           lower risk profile for type 2 diabetes development compared with those receiving
           standard care (control).

        2. The use of this INTERACTIVE SMARTPHONE APP is cost-effective from the perspective of the
           Singapore healthcare system.

      Aims:

        1. To conduct a randomized control trial to examine the efficacy of an INTERACTIVE
           SMARTPHONE APP, customized for Singaporean women with recent GDM, in optimizing
           post-delivery weight and metabolic profiles compared with standard care.

           Primary outcome:

             -  Restoration of booking weight if previous booking BMI ≤ 23

             -  Weight loss of 5% with respect to booking weight if BMI &gt; 23

           Secondary outcomes:

           - Improved cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers: fasting and 2h post-glucose load
           plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test, HbA1C, advanced glycation
           end-products, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, lipid profile, liver function, hsCRP, IL-6.

        2. Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of this INTERACTIVE SMARTPHONE APP compared to
           standard care within the Singapore healthcare system in terms of improvements in quality
           of life, feasibility, acceptability, scalability and sustainability.

    <intervention_model_description>A prospective Randomized Control Trial will be conducted to compare an INTERACTIVE SMARTPHONE APP versus STANDARD care to optimize post-delivery weight in women with recent GDM. The aim is to reduce diabetes and cardiometabolic risk.
During the antenatal period, subjects will be informed about the study during regular NUH nurse-led dietary counseling sessions. After delivery, women will be offered the opportunity to join the study. Informed consent will be obtained before discharge from hospital post-delivery. An appointment will be given for the first study visit at 6 weeks post-delivery.</intervention_model_description>

However, recruitment will not be done by them though they will help to improve the awareness of such a study to their patients. There will be no coercion involved as the subjects have the full autonomy to decide if they wish to participate.</masking_description>

    <description>Weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2. Satisfactory weight is defined as return to weight at first booking visit (during 1st trimester) if booking BMI ≤23. If the participant had hyperemesis gravidarum and the booking weight is low (BMI ≤18.5), then the weight target would be a BMI of 19. If the booking weight is high (BMI&gt;23), the goal would be return to weight that is 5% lower than booking weight.</description>

Women found to have impaired fasting glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol/L) or impaired glucose tolerance (2H post glucose of 7.8-11.0 mmol/L) will be issued a letter reinforcing lifestyle changes namely weight loss (if raised BMI), diet, exercise, and encouragement to consult a family physician to discuss the appropriateness of starting medications that can prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes, or restore the blood glucose to normal levels. Those with a normal OGTT result will just be informed that it is normal.</description>
