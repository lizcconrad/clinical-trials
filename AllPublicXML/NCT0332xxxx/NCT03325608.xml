  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a common problem for older patients presenting to emergency departments and for
      the family caregivers who often lack support, understanding, and skills to manage the
      problems related to the need for emergency department visits. The purpose of Program of
      Intensive Support in Emergency Departments for Care Partners of Cognitively Impaired Patients
      (POISED-CPCIP, here on referred to as POISED) randomized controlled trial is to use
      previously established quality improvement methods of root cause analysis to uncover reasons
      for emergency department use and to focus on caregiver activation within a program of
      dementia care management.

      The goals of this study are to reduce recurrent emergency department visits and improve
      caregiver symptoms of depression, anxiety and need for social support.

      POISED, a 4-year study, will test whether a novel care management intervention for family CGs
      of ED users with cognitive impairment and likely Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
      will reduce ED use at 3 and 6 months over the intervention period. ED use and other measures
      will also be examined during a brief follow-up at 12 months (6 months after completed
      intervention).
