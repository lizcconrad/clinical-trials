  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      â€¢ The CARS is based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a validated
      instrument for assessing mental health diagnoses (2). According to the CARS manual, &quot;The
      Computerized Assessment and Referral System (CARS) is the result of a collaboration between
      the Division on Addiction and the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility, a
      nonprofit organization with a focus on preventing driving under the influence (DUI). CARS
      adapts questions from the internationally-recognized Composite International Diagnostic
      Interview (CIDI), a tool designed for lay interviewers who may not have expertise or training
      in mental health assessment.&quot; CARS was piloted at 6 different sites in 2016, all in DUI
      populations. As CARS has not been specifically validated on non-DUI populations,
      investigators will collect alcohol history (see below). The CARS self-assessment version
      (CARS-SA) will be utilized in this study.
