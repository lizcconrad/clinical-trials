  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized trial design, the goal of this project is to prospectively compare
      outcomes from a telemedicine-based model of care to two cohorts: patients who receive
      in-person pediatric physiatrist medical direction (the &quot;gold standard&quot;), and those who
      receive medical oversight from non-specialist community providers. This project will
      determine the impact of this new model of care using telemedicine on parent/guardian
      satisfaction, adherence rates to an evidence-based hip surveillance program, and economic
      efficiency.

      During this study, a novel model of care will be developed and tested using telehealth
      technologies to bring necessary medical expertise to children with special health care needs
      living in rural and underserved communities. This model of care will be implemented in eight
      school-based Medical Therapy Units (MTUs) in northern California using a randomized design.
      The investigators hypothesize that this model of care will result in 1) equal satisfaction of
      the care received in-person from pediatric physiatrists and increased satisfaction of the
      care received from non-pediatric specialists; 2) equal adherence rates to an evidence-based
      hip surveillance program when compared to children who receive care from in-person pediatric
      physiatry care and better adherence than children who receive care from non-pediatric
      specialists; and 3) cost savings when compared to medical direction provided in-person by
      pediatric physiatrists and non-pediatric specialist providers.

      The first 6 months of the project will be a &quot;ramp-up&quot; period during which the protocol will
      be re-reviewed during MTU site visits and necessary contracts and approvals will be in place.
      The last 6 months will be reserved for data analysis, study closeout, and manuscript
      preparation. The intervention phase will include various designs of implementation. For those
      schools currently without pediatric physiatry services, the investigators will provide MTU
      services using telemedicine and add in-person clinics. For those schools where medical
      direction is provided by non-pediatric physiatrists, the investigators will augment current
      services using telemedicine to provide medical direction to some children using pediatric
      physiatrists. For those schools where pediatric physiatrists travel long distances to provide
      medical direction during scheduled clinics, the investigators will similarly add additional
      telemedicine services such that an augmented mixed model of in-person and telemedicine
      pediatric physiatrist medical direction will be provided.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed program will target MTUs and patients in counties were pediatric physiatrists and other multidisciplinary team members are underrepresented. In this proposed model, the investigators will randomly select at least 350 patient encounters: approximately 175 children will receive care using tele-physiatrist medical direction; 101 children will receive care from a pediatric physiatrist who travels to the MTU to provide in-person care; and 74 children will receive care under a non-pediatric specialist's medical directorship. Once the care model has been created at each site, patients from each cohort will be selected using a clustered, clinic based randomization scheme.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent/Guardian Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1 day for each patient</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of providing pediatric physiatrist medical direction across groups will be measured through satisfaction surveys that will be distributed to participating parents and guardians. Satisfaction surveys will utilize a seven-point Likert scale and the investigators will assess the inter-item reliability, dimensionality and construct validity of satisfaction scales using standard multivariable analysis techniques. A higher score represents a higher satisfaction rate. The investigators postulate that a minimally important clinically significant difference is approximately 0.50 points, while a difference of 0.30 is tolerably close for purposes of non-inferiority.</description>

    <measure>Evidence-Based Hip Surveillance Program Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1 day for each patient</time_frame>
    <description>The hip surveillance survey utilizes several Yes/No responses to compare guideline adherence between the three cohorts and the questions are directly linked to the clinical expectations and explicit guidelines for the appropriate timing and frequency of x-rays and exams. Adherence rates will be compared by adjusted odds ratios.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1 day for each patient</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a quality of life assessment tool for measuring &quot;utility.&quot; The &quot;utility&quot; is a comprehensive health measure, ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health), based on an individual's health state in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The utility for a certain health condition is calculated by applying an established formula that assigns weights to each of the levels in each dimension determined by this health condition. These data on a quality of life will be used in a cost-effectiveness analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Economic Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cost analysis will estimate cost changes resulting from the introduction of this new model of care from the perspectives of patients and families, physicians and healthcare providers, and payers. The proposed economic evaluative methods will integrate all of the effectiveness results from patient encounter data and EQ-5D survey data. Cost analysis will estimate return-on-investment indicating the cost-saving amount per $1 investment in telemedicine compared to MTUs without telemedicine.</description>

    <description>Medical direction will be provided to MTUs through a video-based conferencing unit. Each telemedicine unit includes a Rubbermaid medical grade cart with a Polycom RealPresence 500 Series high-resolution video-conferencing unit flat screen to display video. Each cart also comes with an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) to make the unit mobile if needed or to properly shut it down in the event of power failure.</description>
