    <textblock>
      Comparison will be conducted between continuous variable infusions of both drugs
      (Phenylephrine and Norepinephrine) with starting doses of 0.75 mcg/Kg/min and 0.1 mcg/Kg/min
      respectively for prophylaxis against Post-spinal hypotension during cesarean delivery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hypotension is a common complication after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery
      (CD). Many vasopressors have been used for prevention of post-spinal hypotension (PSH) during
      CD; however, the optimum protocol for prophylaxis is not established yet. Phenylephrine (PE)
      is a popular vasopressor used in obstetric anesthesia; however, its use is limited by its
      marked cardiac depressant nature. Norepinephrine (NE) is a potent vasopressor characterized
      by both α adrenergic agonistic activity in addition to a weak β adrenergic agonistic
      activity; thus, NE is considered a vasopressor with minimal cardiac depressant effect; these
      pharmacological properties would make NE an attractive alternative to PE. In this study, the
      investigators will compare continuous variable infusion of both drugs (PE and NE) with doses
      of 0.75 mcg/Kg/min and 0.1 mcg/Kg/min respectively for prophylaxis against PSH during CD.

The rate will be then adjusted according to the patient blood pressure. The infusion will stop in case of reactive hypertension. The infusion will start again when blood pressure returns to normal reading. Infusion will be increased by 20% if hypotension occurred.</description>
