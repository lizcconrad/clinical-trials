  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab obtained European Marketing authorization in June 2015. Before this date, a
      Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU) Program in France for nivolumab was set up between
      September 2014 and August 2015. This program enrolled approximately 600 melanoma patients
      (unresectable or metastatic).

      It appears relevant to conduct a study on patients treated during the ATU to assess
      thoroughly patient characteristics, efficacy, safety, and patterns of use of nivolumab in
      real-life conditions.

      In order to reach goals of this study, collaboration had been established between BMS and the
      RIC-Mel network (network for Research and Clinical Investigational Research on Melanoma)
      (NCT03315468).

      The RIC-Mel network has set up a national database in order to reference the active file of
      melanoma patients in France. The RIC-Mel database, supported by Nantes University Hospital,
      had been approved by French authorities (CCTIRS and CNIL). The RIC-Mel network is coordinated
      by Pr B. DRENO (Nantes University Hospital) and Pr C. LEBBE (Saint-Louis Hospital, AP-HP,
      Paris). Nowadays, 49 centres located all over the country are participating, with more than
      19,000 melanoma patients included in the database. The RIC-Mel database is referred as one of
      the privileged access to any research program on melanoma by the Cancerology Group (GCC) of
      the French Society of Dermatology .

      Based on this, BMS and the RIC-Mel network had established a partnership to set up a study in
      order to estimate the overall survival of melanoma patients treated by Nivolumab during the
      French ATU program.

      Data are collected in the RIC-Mel database by participating centres. Information of centres,
      follow-up of activity, data reviewing and extractions are realized by the RIC-Mel network.
      Data analysis is performed by BMS following a developed statistical protocol.

      Patients included in the study were patients with unresectable or advanced metastatic
      melanoma, which received at least one of Nivolumab, dispensed during the French ATU program.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from index date (initiation of Nivolumab) until date of death due to any cause. Overall survival will be censored on the last date a subject was known to be alive. Estimates of survival rates will be realized for 1-year and 2-year survival. Median time will also be calculated.
Subgroups of interest are described in the description of the first Secondary Outcome Measure.
Safety Issue: No</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distribution of melanoma patients included in the study in all subgroups of interest thanks to their clinical features at the time of treatment initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Subgroups of interest, based on information collected in medical records, were :
ECOG performance status (PF). ECOG PF is attempted to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily life. The classifications were 0, 1 or ≥2.
LDH level. This level is considered as a prognostic factor: higher the LDH level, the worst the prognosis. The classifications were ≤Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), &gt;ULN, &gt;2 ULN or N/R (Unknown).
History of brain metastasis. These metastases are considered as one of the most difficult-to-treat complications of melanoma. The classifications were No or Yes.
Line of therapy. The classifications were 0, 1, 2 or &gt;2.
BRAF status. BRAF is a proto-oncogene. Melanoma patients with BRAF mutation are eligible to targeted therapy.The classifications were Yes (mutated), No (wild-type) and Unknown (no research).
Number of metastatic sites. Safety Issue: No</description>

    <measure>Incidence of select grade 3, 4 and 5 adverse events (AE) in melanoma patients included in the study and related to Nivolumab treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any undesirable experience or manifestation associated with the use of a medical product in a patient. AEs are categorized by grades, which refer to severity : Grade 3 - Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care activities of daily living, Grade 4 - Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated, Grade 5 - Death related to AE. Proportion of patients with at least one or more select AE, distribution, average and median time of AE occurrence, duration and evolution of AEs as well as description of action on Nivolumab treatment will also be assessed.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival of melanoma patients included in the study</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time since Nivolumab initiation to either the first disease progression date or at last known tumour assessment date, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
