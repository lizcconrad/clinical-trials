  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resilient liners were introduced in the1950s and have been used since then as a gold standard
      material to increase the tolerance, retention and comfort of complete dentures. Due to
      drawbacks of conventional resilient liners, their longevity is questionable and they require
      replacement which is time consuming and costly for the dentist and patient respectively.
      Versacryl is a biocompatible intraoral thermo-elastic material. So versatile, it can be used
      to improve esthetics, retention and comfort for the patient. It softens with heat and when it
      is inserted to patient's mouth, it cools to body temperature providing desired rigidity. This
      process can be repeated many times to ensuring the comfort for the patient. Versacryl has a
      reported predictable long term performance, durable bonding to acrylic denture bases, high
      fatigue endurance, excellent wear characteristics and solvent resistance with almost no free
      monomer in the processed material .

      The investigators' trial is done in order to improve the longevity and oral health related
      quality of life of soft liners in comparison to silicone-based soft liners.

    <description>Resilient liners were introduced in the1950s and have been used since then as a gold standard material to increase the tolerance, retention and comfort of complete dentures. Resilient liners also known as 'soft liners' can be classified as temporary or permanent, cold-cured or heat-cured.Resilient liners can be divided into two main types: plasticized acrylic resins and silicone elastomers.</description>

    <description>Versacryl has been used to construct different parts of complete and partial dentures . It can be used as thermo-elastic liner which consistency can be controlled to tailor the reline to each individual case, by adding or subtracting drops of liquid B, as explained in the directions for use. The reline can be re-adapted repeatedly, even by the patient if necessary.</description>
