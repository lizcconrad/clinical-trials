  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) has an
      increase in proteins in a specific pathway called the mTOR pathway within the cancer cells.
      In cancer cells it can encourage untimely cell growth, cell production, and cell survival.
      Everolimus is an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and can decrease the growth and survival of
      cancer cells. It also prevents communication within cells and stops proteins from being made
      that may contribute to leukemia. The main purpose of the study is to find the maximum
      tolerated dose of everolimus when used together with standard chemotherapy.

      T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) has an
      increase in proteins in a specific pathway called the mTOR pathway within the cancer cells.
      In cancer cells it can encourage untimely cell growth, cell production, and cell survival.
      Everolimus is an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and can decrease the growth and survival of
      cancer cells. It also prevents communication within cells and stops proteins from being made
      that may contribute to leukemia.

      Two to six participants will receive the starting dose of everolimus. If the side effects are
      not too severe, the next group of participants will take the study drug at a higher dose
      level. Up to two dose levels of the study drug will be tested. The main purpose of the study
      is to find the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus when used together with standard
      chemotherapy. Everolimus has been found to be safe and effective in adults and children for
      treatment of T- and B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.

                  graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant or organ rejection
                  post-transplant are not eligible for this trial. At least 3 half-lives must have
                  elapsed after the last dose of GVHD meds.

               -  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: Patients who are currently
                  receiving ACE inhibitors are not eligible due to the development of angioneurotic
                  edema-type reactions in some subjects who received concurrent treatment with
                  everolimus + ACE inhibitors. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed after the
                  last dose of ACE inhibitors.

               -  Anti-convulsants: Patients who are currently receiving CYP3A4/PgP enzyme inducing
                  anticonvulsants (eg. phenytoin, phenobarbitol, or carbamazepine) are not
                  eligible. Stabilizing on a non-hepatic inducing metabolizing anti-convulsant (ie:
                  gabapentin or levetiracetam) prior to study entry is acceptable. At least 3
                  half-lives must have elapsed after the last dose of enzyme inducing
                  anti-convulsants.

               -  Inhibitors of everolimus metabolism: Patients receiving treatment with azoles
                  such as fluconazole or voriconazole which are potent inhibitors of everolimus
                  metabolism. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed after the last dose of
                  azoles.

             2.5 Patients with significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or
             social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance with protocol
             treatment or required observations, interfere with consent, study participation,
             follow up, or interpretation of study results.
