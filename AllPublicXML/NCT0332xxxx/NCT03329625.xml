    <textblock>
      A mixed methods randomized control trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of Pathways
      Triple P with child welfare involved families compared to treatment as usual. Outcomes tested
      included parenting behaviors and attitudes, and child behavior problems. 144 families were
      recruited into the study. Data was collected at 4 time points (baseline, 4 months, 9 months,
      and 18 months). Over 70% were retained from baseline to 18 months.
