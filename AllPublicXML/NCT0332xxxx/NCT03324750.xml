  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Nearly 1% of the population is currently treated with long-term corticosteroid
      therapy. When corticosteroids are introduced, patient information concerning the adverse
      effects and the modalities of prevention by the lifestyle changes is usually proposed.
      However, studies have shown an imperfect acquisition of this information about treatment and
      prevention of adverse effects, as well as a difficult implementation on diet and physical
      activity advices. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the difficulties encountered by
      patients with dietary advice in the context of long-term corticosteroids use in order to
      optimize care, drug adherence and the quality of life of patients.

      Methods: We will recruite adult patients from general medicine and rheumatology practice and
      treated by long-term corticosteroids (≥ 3 months, ≥ 5mg/day). We will perform a qualitative
      analysis in a semi-directed interview.

      Prospective Qualitative Study Carried out among patients followed in rheumatology and in
      general medical practice.

      For each voluntary patient, a semi-directed interview was carried out in a consultation room
      after obtaining his agreement.

      The same investigator used a single guide and conducted all the interviews based on
      open-ended questions.

      At the end of the interviews, the entire recorded audio data was converted in written form
      before being analysed thematically.

      Data were analysed using a Fisher's exact test for categorical variables (presented as
      frequencies and percentages), and using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous
      variables (presented as the median and interquartile range, IQR).
