      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of
      Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) opening using transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound in
      conjunction with an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent in patients with Amyotrophic
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).
