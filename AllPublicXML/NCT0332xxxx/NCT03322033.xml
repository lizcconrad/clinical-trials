      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to investigate the outcome of selected
      patients with ascending thoracic aortic pathologies including type A aortic dissection, who
      are suitable for endovascular repair with the Medtronic Valiant PS-IDE Stent Graft System
      with the Captivia Delivery System (or the Valiant PS-IDE Stent Graft).

      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to investigate the outcome of selected
      patients with ascending aortic pathologies including type A aortic dissection, retrograde
      type A aortic dissection, who are suitable for endovascular repair with the Valiant PS-IDE
      Stent Graft device. The investigators propose to study patients with Dissections affecting
      the aorta between the Sinus of Valsalva and the innominate artery orifice (with no
      involvement of aortic valve). In these patients, the ascending aorta will be repaired using
      the stent graft. For patients with type A aortic dissection, the investigators expect to
      reroute the blood to the true lumen by covering the proximal tear. In patients with
      retrograde type A aortic dissection, there might or might not be additional tears in the
      ascending aorta. If they are tears in ascending aorta, these dissections behave similarly
      like a type A aortic dissection, in which all the tears in the ascending aorta need to be
      covered. If the proximal tear is only in the descending thoracic aorta, these patients will
      require coverage in the ascending aorta with the stent graft along with coverage of proximal
      tear in the descending thoracic aorta using Valiant stent graft.

      Patients will be selected from a high-risk surgical cohort. The total number of enrolled
      subjects is planned to be 20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In order to qualify for this physician-sponsored Investigational Device Exemption, the
             patients would have to meet the entire entry criteria listed below, sign a consent
             approved by the FDA and IRB, and agrees to follow-up according to the study protocol.

               -  Patient must have a type A thoracic aortic dissection, retrograde type A thoracic
                  aortic dissection of the ascending thoracic aorta affecting the area between the
                  Sinus of Valsalva and the innominate artery orifice (with no involvement of the
                  aortic valve) and be considered a candidate for endovascular repair;

                    -  The proximal and distal landing zones for placement of graft should be at
                       least 1 cm.

                    -  The proximal landing zone will allow placement of the stent graft as to not
                       inhibit valvular function, occlude a coronary ostium or proximal bypass
                       graft; The aortic root may be dissected, but the proximal tear site must be
                       at least 1cm from the STJ (and within the above listed size criteria).

                    -  Distal landing zone must allow for continued perfusion of critical cerebral
                       vessels;

                    -  The aorta as measured adventitial wall to adventitial wall must be greater
                       than 28 mm and no more than 44 mm maximum diameter at both the proximal and
                       distal landing zone.

                    -  The patient must be high-risk surgical candidate according to the following
                       established criteria: ASA score of IV.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or pediatric patients (younger than 21 years of age);

          -  Patients who have a condition that threatens to infect the stent graft/aortic valve
             prosthesis;

          -  Patients with allergies to the stent graft material;

          -  Patients or their legally authorized representative (LAR) who do not sign the informed
             consent;

          -  Patients with expected survival less than one year due to a condition other than the
             ascending aortic
