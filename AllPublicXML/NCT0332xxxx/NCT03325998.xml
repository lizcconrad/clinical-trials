  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of gait training with the new
      wearable hip assist robot developed by Samsung Advance Institute of Technology (Samsung
      Electronics Co, Ltd, Korea) in elderly adults.

    <textblock>
      Eight elderly adults will participate in this study. All subjects will receive training 3
      times per week for 8 weeks for 24 training sessions. Each session is directed by a licensed
      physical therapist and lasted 60 min (including rest period of 10 min). Brain activity and
      gait assessment will be performed at visits 0 (baseline), 24 (post-test), and at 3 months
      (follow-up) after training.

      Primary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on spatio-temporal
      parameters measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA,
      USA), muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc.,
      Scottsdale, AZ, USA), metabolic energy cost parameters measured by portable cardiopulmonary
      metabolic system (Cosmed K4B2, Rome, Italy) and cortical activation measured by functional
      Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (NIRScout, NIRx, Germany).

      Secondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on motor function
      improvement evaluated by Short Physical Performance Battery Protocol and Score Sheet (SPPB),
      Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Push and
      Release (P&amp;R) test, Functional Reach Test (FRT), Korean version Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES),
      Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Range of Motion (ROM).

    <description>Measure of self selected speeds by measuring the time it takes an individual to walk 10 meters. To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: &quot;Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.&quot;</description>
