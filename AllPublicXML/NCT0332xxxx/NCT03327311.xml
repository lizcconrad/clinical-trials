  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, in vivo proof-of-concept clinical study, where histopathologic
      examinations will be conducted at various timepoints following Bellafill injections.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Visit 1 (day 0): Subjects with pre-planned surgical treatment (mini-abdominoplasty or
      redundant abdominal tissue removal) will be enrolled and will receive a Bellafill Skin Test.

      Visit 2 (Day 28): Each subject receives treatment with Bellafill into 2 identified
      rectangular treatment areas within the pre-planned surgical area (0.1cc injected in the upper
      dermis and 0.1cc injected in the deep dermis at the subcutaneous junction).

      Visit 3 (1 Week, 1 Month, or 2 Months; or, 3 Months or 6 Months): The timing of Visit 3 (the
      final study visit) is dependent on the subject's type of pre-planned surgery. Subjects who
      will undergo abdominoplasty will attend Visit 3 at 1 Week, 1 Month or 2 Months after Visit 2.
      Subjects who will undergo removal of redundant skin (i.e., dog ear) will attend Visit 3 at 3
      Months or 6 Months after Visit 2. Following surgical removal of Bellafill injection sites,
      histopathologic analyses will be conducted.

          -  Have a recent or current history of inflammatory skin disease, infection,
             cancerous/pre-cancerous lesion, unhealed wound or clinically significant acne in the
