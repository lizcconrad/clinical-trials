  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative lesions of the shoulder occur very frequently and their incidence increases with
      age. The Constant-Murley score is currently considered the gold standard in Europe to assess
      the shoulder and is widely used by the orthopaedic community to follow up on shoulder
      pathologies. However, healthcare professionals are taking an increasing interest in
      self-administered patient-reported out-come measures. Several self-administered
      questionnaires are available to assess the shoulder. Among these questionnaires, the OSS
      (Oxford Shoulder Score) is considered to be quick, simple, and reliable for the
      English-speaking population. This score was initially developed at the University of Oxford
      in 1996. It is a self-administered questionnaire designed to evaluate pain and shoulder
      function through 12 questions. This score has since been adapted in different languages but
      not in French.

      The aim was to develop a translation and a transcultural adaptation of the OSS and to assess
      its validity in native French-speaker patients with shoulder pain.

    <measure>Acceptability of the French version of the Oxford Shoulder Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability was analysed using the rate of refusal to participate. It is a 12-item self-administered questionnaire developed for patients with inflammatory or degenerative shoulder disease.
Each question presents five possible responses corresponding to a score of 0 (worst situation) to 4 (best situation). Questionnaire produces a single score with a range from 0 (least difficulties) to 48 (most difficulties).</description>

    <description>Feasibility was analysed using the nonresponse rate. It is a 12-item self-administered questionnaire developed for patients with inflammatory or degenerative shoulder disease.
Each question presents five possible responses corresponding to a score of 0 (worst situation) to 4 (best situation). Questionnaire produces a single score with a range from 0 (least difficulties) to 48 (most difficulties).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Convergent validity of the French version of the Oxford Shoulder Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The convergent validity was studied using correlation between the Oxford Shoulder Score and the Constant score and between the Oxford Shoulder Score and the Subjective Shoulder Score score.</description>

    <measure>test/retest reliability of the French version of the Oxford Shoulder Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Test/retest reliability was analysed using calculation of the intraclass correlation coefficient. An ICC &gt; 0.8 indicates good test/retest reliability.</description>

    <measure>Internal coherence of the French version of the Oxford Shoulder Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The internal coherence was tested using the Cronbach coefficient. The acceptable threshold for internal coherence was a Cronbach coefficient equal or more than 0.7</description>
