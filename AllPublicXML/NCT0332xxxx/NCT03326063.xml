  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of oral ifetroban, a novel
      antagonist of T prostanoid (TP) receptors, as a treatment for patients with
      aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol involves a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-design trial of
      oral ifetroban in patients with AERD. At the end of the 4-week treatment phase (ifetroban or
      placebo) each subject will undergo a graded oral aspirin desensitization procedure in order
      to initiate high-dose aspirin therapy, which is standard-of-care at our institution and is
      the only available therapy known to modify the course of AERD.
