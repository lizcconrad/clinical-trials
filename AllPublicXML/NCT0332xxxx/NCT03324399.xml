  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALS, also known as &quot;Lou Gehrig's&quot; disease, is a neurodegenerative disease which is fatal.
      Treatment for ALS is limited and currently consists of primary symptom relief or support. In
      addition, time from diagnosis to death averages 3-5 years. New Biotic, LLC has submitted an
      Orphan Drug Designation Application for an investigational probiotic and have indicated the
      need for more study of this orphaned drug in ALS patients.

      This will be an exploratory protocol of 10 patients and expect to screen approximately 25-30
      patients.

      The purpose of our study is to examine amino acid levels in plasma pre and post prandial as
      well as longitudinal gut microbiome in ALS patients taking the investigational probiotic.

        1. Purpose: Evaluate the clinical outcomes of muscle strength, clinical global assessments
           and spasticity in patients taking an Investigational probiotic.

        2. Measure changes in questionnaires relating to subjective functional assessments, quality
           of life, and pain levels over 24 weeks.

        3. Describe plasma amino acid levels before and after a protein food challenge in ALS
           patients of spinal and bulbar type.

        4. Evaluate and describe the gut microbiome of patients with ALS.

      Design:

      This is a non-randomized, open-label, two-group pilot study of plasma amino acid levels, gut
      microbiome, and of investigational probiotic use in patients with ALS. Participants will be
      placed into two groups based on certain post-prandial amino acid levels. Patients will be
      stratified for eligibility based on the results of their amino acid profiles.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes will be measured with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -Functional Rating Scale (ALS-FRS).
The ALS-FRS is a 12 item questionnaire to assess bulbar, limb, and respiratory functions. The scores may range from 0, which is the worst function, to 48 which is the best function. This questionnaire is self-administered, and can be completed with assistance from a family member. The scores range from 0-48. The highest scores reflect no changes, or difficulty with tasks assessed. Low scores indicate poor functioning and need for assistance.</description>

    <description>Changes will be measured with the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -Quality of Life questionnaire. The ALS-QOL is a 50-item, self-administered, questionnaire which includes 7 scores. These scores represent six domains and a total average score. The six domains are 1) Negative Emotion, 2) Interaction, 3) Intimacy, 4) Religiosity, 5) Physical and 6) Bulbar.</description>
