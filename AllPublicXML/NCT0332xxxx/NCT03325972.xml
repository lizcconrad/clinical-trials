    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective, double-blind , placebo-controlled trial examining the
      effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion on pain in patients undergoing lumbar
      spinal fusion surgery. One hundred ten subjects (55 in each arm) will be enrolled. Subjects,
      over the age of 18, undergoing lumbar spinal fusion will be considered eligible for
      enrollment. Subjects will receive either intraoperative dexmedetomidine or placebo of normal
      saline infusion. They will be followed for approximately six weeks postoperatively.
