  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis, as a progressive disease is one of the most common causes of pain, motor
      disorder and disability in the elderly. By increasing age, the cartilage is eroded and
      endures degenerative changes due to physiological and biomechanical changes as well as
      metabolic effects and trauma . Non-surgical interventions for pain control of knee
      osteoarthritis include weight loss, exercise, changes in daily activities, physiotherapy,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics .However ,the intra-articular
      injection is recently recommended by many studies such as corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid,
      Growth hormone, dextrose ,and platelet rich plasma.

      Intra-articular injection of platelets are activated and undergo degranulation, releasing a
      range of growth factors, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²), platelet-derived
      growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factors,
      epidermal growth factors and basic fibroblast growth factor 2. These growth factors are
      thought to activate a variety of signaling pathways, which promote healing of bone and soft
      tissue.Also,some minimally invasive therapeutic options have been effective in pain relieve
      in KA, such as ultrasound-guided saphenous nerve block .

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of ultrasound guided saphenous nerve block
      versus platelet rich plasma injection in the management of chronic pain in patients with knee
      OA. This study will be conducted to evaluate which modality is more effective.
