      Phase 3b open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of avatrombopag in
      subjects with thrombocytopenia scheduled for operations to critical sites or operations with
      a high risk of bleeding.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive oral avatrombopag once daily for 5 days beginning on Day 1, followed by
      a wait period prior to the procedure, which will occur on Day 10 to 13. The Follow-up Period
      will include 2 visits; 7 days post-procedure and 30 days after last dose.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women greater than or equal to 18 years of age;

          -  A mean baseline platelet count between 50 × 10^9/L and &lt;100 × 10^9/L;

          -  Participant is scheduled to undergo operations to critical sites (eg, eye surgery,
             neurosurgery) or operations with a high risk of bleeding (eg, major abdominal
             surgery), and, in the opinion of the Investigator, would otherwise require a platelet
             transfusion aiming for a platelet count of at least 100 × 10^9/L to prevent bleeding

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant with a history of arterial or venous thrombosis;

          -  Participant plans to have a platelet transfusion or plans to receive blood products
             containing platelets within 7 days of the Screening Visit;

          -  Use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy;

          -  Use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents;

          -  Participant has a known medical history of genetic prothrombotic syndromes; or

          -  Participant has abnormal hemoglobin levels or prothrombin time/international
             normalized ratio
