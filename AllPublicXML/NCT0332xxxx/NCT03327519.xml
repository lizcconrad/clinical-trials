    <textblock>
      Insomnia is commonly reported by adults with asthma. Insomnia can worsen asthma patients'
      quality of life and increase the risk for asthma attacks.This clinical trial will compare
      sleep and asthma control in adults with asthma and insomnia who receive either an
      internet-based intervention for insomnia or an educational video about insomnia.

    <measure>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 &amp; 6 months from start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing nature, severity and impact of insomnia symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating worse insomnia severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 &amp; 6 months from start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire is a 32-item measure assessing asthma-specific health-related quality of life in 4 domains: activity limitations (ability to carry out daily activities), symptoms (frequency and nature of asthma symptoms such as coughing and chest tightness), emotional distress (intensity of the discomfort, fear, or distress associated with asthma), and environmental stimuli (capacity to manage environmental triggers of asthma such as smoke, dust, and pollution). An overall total score is computed by averaging the scores from the four domains. The total score ranges from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Test (ACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 &amp; 6 months from start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Control Test is a 5-item questionnaire that measures asthma control by assessing interference with activity, shortness of breath, nocturnal symptoms, rescue medication use, and self-rating of asthma control. The total score ranges from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating greater asthma control.</description>
