  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two stage, open label, randomized-sequence, single-crossover Phase 1 study to
      evaluate the relative bioavailability (BA) of niraparib administered as a tablet formulation
      compared to the reference capsule formulation currently marketed in the United States.
      Specifically, a 300 mg niraparib tablet will be compared to 3 niraparib capsules (3 × 100
      mg).The Extension Phase of this study is to enable patients enrolled in the study to continue
      to receive treatment with niraparib tablets if they are tolerating it and, in the
      Investigator's opinion, may receive benefit.

             may benefit from treatment with a PARP inhibitor as assessed by the Investigator.
