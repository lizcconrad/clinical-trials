  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the benefits and harms of screening for monoclonal gammopathy of
      undetermined significance (MGUS). The overall and disease-specific mortality will be compared
      between screened and not screened participants. All individuals registered as inhabitants in
      Iceland and born in 1975 or earlier have been invited to participate. The hypothesis is that
      an early detection of multiple myeloma (MM), through follow-up of MGUS, will improve overall
      survival and decrease complications associated with diagnosis and treatment of MM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic premalignant
      stage that almost always precedes multiple myeloma (MM) and amyloidosis. It is defined by a
      monoclonal-(M)-protein detected on serum protein electrophoresis or immunofixation
      electrophoresis and can be diagnosed with a blood sample. Approximately four percent of
      individuals 50 years or older have MGUS which is associated with a 1-2% annual risk of
      malignant transformation but it is impossible to predict which individuals diagnosed as
      having MGUS will progress and receive a diagnosis of malignant disease.

      To date, no evidence is available on the benefits and harms of population-based screening for
      MGUS and data from prospective studies that assess the optimal follow-up of MGUS are lacking.

      All individuals that are registered as inhabitants in Iceland and born in 1975 or earlier
      have been invited to participate in the study. After signing informed consent, serum from the
      participants will be analysed for MGUS. The participants will not be contacted for blood
      sampling. Instead, an innovative approach will be used by taking advantage of the fact that
      most people 40 years or older do a blood test for various reasons during a three year period.
      The ID-list of participants in the study will be cross-linked with all major laboratories in
      Iceland, covering approximately 90% of all blood sampling in Iceland. When a participant has
      a blood test, a small amount (1 ml) of serum will be sampled and put in a separate test tube
      belonging to the study and used for diagnosis of MGUS.

      Participants diagnosed as having MGUS will be randomized to three different arms, of which
      two arms will be called into a clinical study center for two separate types of follow-up. In
      arm one the participants will be asked to answer an electronic QoL questionnaire annually but
      receive no active follow-up. In arm two and three the participants will be asked to answer
      the QoL questionnaire but also receive follow-up according to the International Myeloma
      Working Group (IMWG) guidelines (arm two) or intensive (arm three) clinical follow-up.
      Participants without MGUS will be asked to answer QoL questionnaire annually.

      Results from two recent, population-based studies shows that early detection of MM through
      follow-up of MGUS is associated with fewer major complications and 13-14% better overall
      survival as compared to individuals presenting with MM without previous diagnosis of MGUS.

      This study aims to assess the benefits and harms of population-based screening for MGUS by
      analyzing overall and disease specific survival, complications associated with screening and
      the effects screening has on the QoL. Furthermore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the
      optimal follow-up strategy of MGUS and the cost-effectiveness of screening for MGUS.

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) used to assess QoL in each group. The PHQ-9 is a questionnaire with 9 questions where the answers to the questions are graded with a score from 0-3. Thus, the total score ranges from 0-27 with higher score indicating more severe depression. When interpreting the PHQ-9 score it can be divided into 5 groups of depression: Normal range (score 0-4), minimal depressive symptoms (score 5-9), major depression, mild severity (score 10-14), major depression, moderate severity (score 15-19) and major depression, severe severity (score 20 or higher).</description>
