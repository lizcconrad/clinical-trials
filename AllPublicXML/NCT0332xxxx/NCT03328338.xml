  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary (familial) amyloidosis arising from the misfolding of a mutated or variant
      transthyretin, is the most frequent form of amyloid cardiomyopathy in the Caribbean basin.
      Affected organs invariably harbor extracellular amyloid deposits in the myocardium.
      Circulating or pre-fibrillar amyloidogenic proteins are implicated in the disruption of cell
      function. Our aim is to demonstrate that transthyretin mediated amyloid disease alter the
      mitochondrial function of cardiac cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic amyloidosis are a family of diseases induced by misfolded and/or misassembled
      proteins. Extracellular deposits of these proteins disrupt vital organ function. Two types of
      amyloid commonly infiltrate the heart: immunoglobulin light-chain amyloid and transthyretin
      (TTR) amyloid. Among the TTR variants that predominantly target the heart, the valine to
      isoleucine substitution at position 122 (V122I or Ile122) is the most common. This TTR
      variant is responsible for the most frequent form of amyloid cardiomyopathy in the Caribbean
      basin. Increasingly study data supports a central role for circulating or pre-fibrillar
      amyloidogenic proteins in the disruption of cardiac function in TTR mediated amyloid disease.
      In vivo exposure of cultured cardiomyocytes to pre-fibrillar an amyloidogenic proteins
      stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species and disrupts calcium fluxes. (Recent
      studies indicate that pre-fibrillar amyloidogenic proteins may also induce apoptosis through
      the mitochondrial pathway, eventually leading to cardiac cell injury). Hence, growing
      evidence suggests that end-organ damage by pre-fibrillar TTR amyloid may be related to
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis can be based on invasive heart
      biopsies or a non-invasive approach including identification of amyloid tissue deposits from
      abdominal fat biopsies. Our aim is to demonstrate that transthyretin mediated amyloid disease
      alters the mitochondrial function of subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes.

      Our objective is to study mitochondrial respiration assessed by oxygraphy in fragments of
      subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsies performed for diagnosis of TTR amyloidosis. Mitochondrial
      respiration will be evaluated in the absence and in the presence of ADP.

      Follow the evaluation of mitochondrial respiration. So, no patient follow-up will be
      performed.

    <description>The mitochondrial respiration of the cells is measured by polarography with a &quot;Clark&quot; type oxygen electrode. The Clark electrode consists of a platinium cathode and a silver anode. When a potential difference of -0.6 volts is applied, the platinium electrode is negatively charged with respect to that of silver and each oxygen molecule dissolved in the medium diffuses through the gas-permeable Teflon membrane, and is reduced at the cathode according to the following reaction: O 2 + 4H + + 4e → 2H 2 O. The current thus generated is proportional to the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The oxygen saturation constant (406 nmol / ml) makes it possible to convert these results into oxygen consumption / minute.</description>

    <description>Rates of oxygen consumption (expressed as pmol O2.s-1.mg of fat tissue) will be recorded in-vivo in different conditions, which include routine respiration and after ADP addition. Carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), tetra methyl-p-phenylenediaminedihydrochloride (TMPD)-ascorbate and oligomycin will be tested in vitro to monitor uncoupled respiration, cytochrome c oxidase activity and leak state respiration by inhibition of ATP synthase, respectively.</description>
