  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common syndrome in patients with severe dementia is agitated behavior, which is
      often characterized by a combination of violent behavior (physical or verbal), restlessness,
      and inappropriate loudness. The treatment options for this syndrome are limited and lead to
      severe side effects. In vivo experiments on animals and clinical studies on adults show that
      cannabinoids could have a beneficial effect on behavioral disorders in general, and in
      dementia-related disorders in particular.

      Additionally, medical cannabis patients have reported that cannabis aids in pain relief,
      increased appetite, and a sense of calm and peace of mind. Elderly patients suffering from
      dementia that experience this syndrome could also benefit from other quality of life aspects
      of the cannabis treatment such as reduction in medication consumption, weight gain and
      improvement of sleep.
