  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GRACE is a randomized 3-arm trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of two remote
      cancer communication interventions: 1) a targeted generic print (TP), or 2) a tailored
      telephone-based counseling and navigation intervention (TCN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that activated and engaged patients who are equipped with
      necessary skills and information are more likely to follow through with recommended care and
      have better health outcomes at reduced costs. Identification of individuals at increased risk
      of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is crucial for cancer survivors and their
      families to benefit from biomedical advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment
      and survivorship. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of two remote interventions aimed at promoting cancer genetic risk assessment
      (CGRA) for HBOC. The randomized controlled trial will have 3 arms: usual care (UC) vs.
      targeted generic print (TP) vs. tailored telephone counseling and navigation intervention
      (TCN).

    <masking_description>Randomization will be single blinded. Research team members who are assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study arm assignment. Research staff who are conducting follow-up interviews will be blinded to group assignment as much as possible. At the beginning of the follow-up interviews, the interviewer will request that the participant does not reveal the study arm they were assigned to.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cancer Genetic Risk Assessment (Genetic Counseling) CGRA</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Participants will be asked whether they have had CGRA, the provider who conducted the CGRA, and the provider's genetics training. CGRA will be medical record verified delivered by the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict for CGRA: SURE Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month; 6 months; or 12 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HBOC Genetic Testing Intention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 month; 6 months; or 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: One item will measure future intention to get genetic testing for HBOC. In follow up surveys, this will only be asked if participant does not report uptake of genetic testing</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HBOC Genetic Testing Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month; 6 months; or 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Participants will be asked if they received the intervention brochure and had telephone coaching. If yes, they will be asked questions regarding their reaction to the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict for HBOC genetic testing: Low Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) SURE Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months; or 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Decisional conflict associated with the HBOC gene test decision will be measured separately with 4 items using the SURE SCALE. Sum the four responses. Range from 0-4, with 0 indicating high decisional conflict.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional satisfaction with CGRA: Satisfaction with Decision Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months; or 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Decisional satisfaction will be assessed using the Satisfaction with Decision Instrument. Five questions assess their personal satisfaction with their decision and two additional items assess how they feel about their CGRA decision in relation to their family. Satisfaction Score: Range 5-25, with 25 indicating high decisional satisfaction. Family Score: Range 2-10, with 10 indicating high consistency with personal values.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Regret Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months; or 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Five items will ask about regret regarding the decision to have or not have CGRA. Range from 0-100, with 100 indicating high decisional regret.</description>

    <description>Participants will be mailed an educational brochure within two weeks of completing the baseline survey that addresses important evidence-based theoretical targets: CGRA guideline (knowledge), threat appraisal (to validate or raise risk perceptions, HBOC seriousness), response efficacy (benefits and expectations about CGRA), self-efficacy messages (CGRA resources, insurance reimbursement, and assistance for those with financial challenges) and possible actions to take (make an appointment and discuss with provider). Both the targeted print and tailored intervention materials were developed using formative community engaged research methods.</description>
