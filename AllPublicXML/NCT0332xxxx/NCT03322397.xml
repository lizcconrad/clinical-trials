  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents will complete a 4-week intervention, during which they will either complete a
      kind act for others, complete a kind act for themselves, or report their daily activities
      three days per week. Psychological and physiological measures will be indexed before and
      after the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress and early adversity have been found to influence immune function via enhanced
      expression of the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) genetic profile.
      Expression of this genetic profile was reduced in adults who completed a prosocial behavior
      intervention. This project aims to implement this intervention in adolescents. 90 high school
      students will be recruited and assigned to one of three groups (30/group). Participants will
      either conduct 3 acts of kindness for themselves, conduct 3 acts of kindness for others, or
      report about their day 3 times per week for 4 weeks. During this intervention, they will
      receive text messages 3 days per week instructing them to complete their respective act.
      Participants will provide a brief description of this act that evening, as well as complete
      brief surveys at the end of the week for each week of the intervention. Participants will
      come into the lab twice, once before and once after the 4-week intervention. During these lab
      sessions participants will complete survey measures, have their heart rate measured, and have
      a blood draw conducted by a trained phlebotomist. Participants' parents will also complete a
      brief survey to provide demographic information and an idea of what prosocial behaviors
      participants witnessed in their home. We will use these data to assess the effects of
      prosocial behavior on health and the psychological mechanisms underlying these effects. At
      the second study visit, participants will be given the opportunity to donate part of their
      study payment to a charity to measure prosociality. Any donations will be vetted with the
      psychology department's accounting group prior to making any donations in the university's
      name. Scott Monatlik, Director, Tax and Information Practices, at smonatlik@finance.ucla.edu
      or (310) 794-6724 will be contacted and information regarding the appropriate steps to take
      to ensure that the donation is made to an acceptable charity prior to any donations. Actual
      helping behavior (donations) is measured to provide an ecologically valid experimental
      evaluation of prosociality rather than traditional metrics of computerized, fictional giving.
      Conceptual frameworks from developmental and health psychology guide the hypothesis that
      prosocial behavior will influence adolescents.

    <measure>Positive Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 5 weeks (administered weekly)</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention efficacy of affect will be assessed by the positive affect subscale of the Affect Adjective Checklist. Participants rate the degree to which they felt positive emotions over the past week on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely much). We take the mean across the 4 items such that higher scores reflect experiencing more positive affect over the week.</description>

    <time_frame>Over 5 weeks (before intervention to 1 week after)</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention efficacy of psychological flourishing assessed by Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Participants rate the degree to which they felt 20 items over the past month on a scale from 1 (never) to 6 (everyday). We take a mean across these items, with higher values representing greater psychological flourishing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 5 weeks (administered weekly)</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention efficacy of affect will be assessed by the negative affect subscale of the Affect Adjective Checklist.
