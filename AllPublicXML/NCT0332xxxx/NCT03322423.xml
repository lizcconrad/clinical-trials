    <time_frame>8-12 days of wear</time_frame>
    <description>Distance binocular high luminance, high contrast visual performance on logMAR (logMAR-Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale will be assessed for each subject after 8-12 days of wear. Visual performance will be recorded OD, OS, and OU. For Distance, Bright Illuminance, ETDRS 3Meter-High Contrast charts will be used. Visual acuity is scored with reference to logMAR-Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution. Each letter has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there are 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR Chart(s) represents a change of 0.1 log units. The score for each line is aggregated for a total visual performance score with that chart and lighting condition.</description>

    <description>Near binocular high luminance, high contrast visual performance on logMAR (logMAR-Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale will be assessed for each subject after 8-12 days of wear. Visual performance will be recorded OD, OS, and OU. For Near, Bright Illuminance, Reduced Guillon-Poling High Contrast and Intermediate (64cm) and Near (40cm) charts will be used. Visual acuity is scored with reference to logMAR-Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution. Each letter has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there are 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR Chart(s) represents a change of 0.1 log units. The score for each line is aggregated for a total visual performance score with that chart and lighting condition.</description>

    <measure>Vision and Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>8-12 days of wear</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Quality of vision and handling scores are assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response (2016).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the
             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

               2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth
                  in this clinical protocol.

               3. The subject must be between at least 40 years of age and not greater than 70
                  years of age.
