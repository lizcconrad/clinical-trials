    <textblock>
      The proposed research project is aimed at further characterization of sleep problems and
      evaluation of their impact in children and adults with TSC, excluding epilepsy as
      contributing factor. Questionnaire-based studies have shown that sleep problems occur in up
      to half of the children and a third of adults with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However,
      there is only limited information on the nature of sleep problems and their impact on
      patients with TSC and their families.

      Questionnaire-based studies have shown that sleep problems occur in up to half of the
      children and a third of adults with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, there is only
      limited information on the nature of sleep problems and their impact on patients with TSC and
      their families. It is known from a questionnaire-based study in children with TSC that they
      often wake early or wake frequently during the night, and that they can be more tired during
      the day. In some children, sleep-problems seem to be related to the presence of seizures
      during the night. This has been confirmed in a study on 10 children with TSC and epilepsy by
      a combination of polysomnography (sleep study) and electroencephalography (EEG). A
      questionnaire-based study in adults also revealed the association with epilepsy features, and
      showed influence of mental health complaints on sleep.

      Sleep structure and quality will be assessed through formal sleep studies (polysomnography
      and actigraphy). The influence of abnormal brain activity on sleep will be mapped by
      simultaneous recording of brain activity by means of EEG. The impact of sleep disorders will
      be determined through interviews with individuals with TSC and their relatives. The
      investigators will also use questionnaires and diaries to supplement their findings.

      Importance: It is expected that the results of this study will 1) improve our understanding
      of sleep problems in TSC, 2) provide additional information on the influence of TSC on sleep,
      3) give a more in-depth view on the impact of sleep problems on the lives of individuals with
      TSC and their families, 4) increase awareness about sleep problems in TSC, and 5) contribute
      to a better management of sleep problems by patients and families.
