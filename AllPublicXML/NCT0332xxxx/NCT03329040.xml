  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia elongates hospital stay and may require treatment. The
      investigators noticed that bilirubin levels were higher among infants of primipara mothers
      than among multipara mothers. As this data is dichotomic and easy to produce, and may
      influence the maintenance, the investigators decided to find out if primiparity is a risk
      factor for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The investigators intend to collect data from patient
      files during one year, and compare the bilirubin levels and length of stay between newborns
      to primipara mothers and multipara mothers.
