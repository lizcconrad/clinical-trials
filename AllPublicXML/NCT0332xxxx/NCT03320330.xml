    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-SEMA4D monoclonal
      antibody VX15/2503 (VX15/2503) and to see how well it works in treating younger patients with
      solid tumors that have come back after treatment, or do not respond to treatment. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as VX15/2503, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose of VX15/2503
      administered as an intravenous infusion every 14 days to children with recurrent or
      refractory solid tumors. (Part A) II. To define and describe the toxicities of VX15/2503
      administered on this schedule. (Parts A-B) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      VX15/2503 in children with recurrent or refractory cancer. (Parts A-B) IV. To preliminarily
      define the antitumor activity of VX15/2503 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory
      osteosarcoma. (Part B) V. To determine if VX15/2503 either improves the disease control rate
      at 4 months in patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma or produces an objective
      response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamics of VX15/2503 through VX15/2503 saturation of T-lymphocytes.

      II. To assess the immunogenicity of VX15/2503 in pediatric patients with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
