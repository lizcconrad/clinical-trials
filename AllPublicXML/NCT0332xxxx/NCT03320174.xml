  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study will involve 600 healthy
      (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase [G6PD] normal) volunteers. Participants who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be randomized (ratio 1:1) to receive a loading dose of either
      tafenoquine 200 mg (2 x 100 mg tablets) or placebo daily for three consecutive days, followed
      by study treatment (tafenoquine 200 mg or placebo) once per week for 51 weeks, with safety
      follow-up visits at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and 52. All participants will return to the clinic at
      Week 64 for an end of study visit. If the participant has an ongoing AE at the Week 64 visit
      will continue to be assessed for up to 3 more times at approximately 12-week intervals or
      until resolution or stabilization of the AE whichever is earlier.
