  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research will be to investigate in stroke patients whether upper limb motor
      function can be maximized in response to sensory stimulation by comparing protocols for the
      application of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the cortical region of S1 and
      Sensory Therapy in the upper limb paretic. Patients will be randomly and randomly allocated
      into four groups, Group 1 (G1) composed of individuals who will receive the protocol for the
      application of rTMS in the ipsilateral S1 cortex and fictitious sensory therapy in the
      paretic upper limb; Group 2 (G2) subjects will receive protocol of Sensory Therapy in the
      upper limb ethical and application of fictitious rTMS in the ipsilesional S1 cortex; Group 3
      (G3): application of the protocol of application of rTMS in the ipsilateral S1 cortex
      associated with Sensory Therapy in the upper limb paretic and, G4 (GSHAM) control group in
      which fictitious rTMS will be performed and fictitious Sensory Therapy in the paretic upper
      limb).

    <measure>change from Fugl-Meyer assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; post-intervention. The re-evaluation will be in the eleventh session on the fourth week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) is considered the gold standard for evaluating the motor function recovery. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning. It is applied within clinical and in research contexts to determine the disease severity, describe motor recovery, and plan and assess interventions. In the present study, the 33-item of the UL section was employed. The items are rated on 3-point ordinal scale, as follows: 0= unable to perform; 1= partial ability to perform; and 2= near normal ability to perform. The UL subscale evaluates motor function recovery in six domains: flexor and extensor synergies, non-synergic movements, wrist and hand movements, and coordination and speed</description>

    <measure>change from The Jebsen-Taylor</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; post-intervention. The re-evaluation will be in the eleventh session on the fourth week</time_frame>
    <description>The Jebsen-Taylor manual function test will be used to assess motor function . This test consists of seven tasks: writing a sentence, turning cards and small common objects, feeding simulation, stacking chips, moving large light objects and large heavy objects. Each task will be timed by the Timer, the test will be done bilaterally, always starting with the healthy hand. Patient errors will also be recorded in numbers in case of misspelled words, for example; Changes in strategy to turn cards; Dropping small objects, beans, checkers or cans.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change from The Motor Activity Long (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; post-intervention. The re-evaluation will be in the eleventh session on the fourth week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Motor Activity Long (MAL) test, validated and adapted to the Portuguese language, takes into account the patient's &quot;learning to not use&quot; upper limb (MAS) and the functional reacquisition of arm and hand skills in daily activities. The test has two ordinal scales, each with six points for the graduation of activities: one scale relates to quantity and the other to the quality of MSA use. On the quantitative scale, scores range from zero (do not use the MSA) to five (use the MSA the same way you used before the stroke). On the qualitative scale, the score also ranges from zero (the MSA is not used at all for the activity) to five (your ability to use the MSA is as good as it was before the stroke). In this qualitative section the score can have intermediate scores as 0.5 or 1.5.</description>

    <measure>change from The Box and Blocks test (TBB)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; post-intervention. The re-evaluation will be in the eleventh session on the fourth week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Box and Blocks test (TBB) is an instrument commonly used in manual dexterity investigations, it can be used in post-stroke patients. At TBB, one hundred and fifty blocks of 2.5-cm wood are arranged in a wooden box in many different orientations. The place in wood has a partition of 15.2 cm of height dividing the space in two. The patient is instructed to carry as many blocks as possible from one space to another. The subject's score is equal to the number of those blocks transported in a partition in one minute. The more blocks transported the better the patient's manual dexterity</description>

    <measure>change from Thermography</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; post-intervention. The re-evaluation will be in the eleventh session on the fourth week.</time_frame>
    <description>To verify the body symmetry of the upper limbs, Thermography will be used. The symmetry will be checked by comparing the heat emission obtained by the work of muscle contraction on both sides of the body. The procedures that will be adopted to capture images will follow the recommendations of the European Association of Thermology. For the delimitation of the Body Regions of Interest (ICR), anatomical points will be adopted in the anterior and posterior regions of the upper limb</description>

    <measure>change from Upper limb cutaneous sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; post-intervention. The re-evaluation will be in the eleventh session on the fourth week.</time_frame>
    <description>For this variable will be used the Sensory Evaluation of Nottingham and Monofilaments from Semmes-Weinstein. The sensory evaluation scale and Nottingham with the aim of identifying the sensory deficits post-stroke and monitor their recovery. It is an instrument for the evaluation of sensory protopathic and epicritic modalities. This instrument tests all body segments and does not require high-cost materials such as pens, pencils, coins, sponges, flannels, scissors, combs, cups and cups. This demonstrates the simplicity of the test without minimizing its efficiency. For the sensitivity test A set of 6 monofilaments (pocket model - &quot;Sensikit&quot;) of nylons number 612, 38 mm in length and different diameters exerting a specific force on the tested area corresponding to the weight variation of 0 , 05 to 300g</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from Functional Independence</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; post-intervention. The re-evaluation will be in the eleventh session on the fourth week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure will be used to measure functional independence during daily activities. In the survey, the test will be done through an interview, where each item is scored from 1 to 7 according to the need for patient care. From the obtained score, it becomes possible to classify the level of dependence: complete (18 to 45 points), moderate independence (46 to 99) and complete independence (100 to 126)</description>

    <description>control The control group received rTMS sham stimulation (same area as the experimental group) in 10 sessions, 5 days per week, and Sham conventional sensory therapy in the paretic upper limb The sham stimulation will be applied so that it is perceived by the patient as real. Thus during the rTMS sessions the same procedures of the active rTMS sessions will be applied, however the stimulation will be performed with two coils: a coil coupled to the stimulator positioned away from the patient's scalp, yet not visible to the patient so that the patient Perceive only the characteristic sound of the stimulation, and the other coil, disconnected from the stimulator positioned on the volunteer's head.
For the SHAM group, all sensory therapy activities will be performed, however only with the non-affected member. Patients will be convinced that a transfer of skills from one member to another can occur through the connections between the hemispheres.</description>
