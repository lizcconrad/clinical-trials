  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Er:YAG ablative fractional laser-assisted methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy
      (AFL-PDT) has shown significantly higher efficacy and a lower recurrence rate at 12 months
      than methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) for treatment of Bowen's disease
      (BD). However, long-term follow up data are not available.

      To compare the long-term efficacy and recurrence rates of AFL-PDT and standard MAL-PDT for

    <measure>Difference of short-term complete response (CR) rate between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT</measure>
    <time_frame>Short-term CR rate was evaluated at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The response was classified as either complete response (complete disappearance of the lesion) or incomplete response (incomplete disappearance of the lesion)</description>

    <measure>Difference of long-term complete response (CR) rate between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT</measure>

    <measure>Difference of long-term recurrence rate between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT at 60 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Recurrent rate was evaluated at 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>In all cases of complete response, the patients were reviewed at 60 months to check for recurrence. Post-therapy punch biopsies were performed when there was doubt concerning incomplete-response and clinical recurrence</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference of the cosmetic outcome between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT</measure>
    <time_frame>Cosmetic outcome was assessed by each investigator for all lesions that achieved a complete response at 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The overall cosmetic outcome was assessed by each investigator for all lesions that achieved complete response at 60 months, and was graded using a 4-point scale: excellent (only slight occurrence of redness or change in pigmentation), good (moderate redness or change in pigmentation), fair (slight to moderate scarring, atrophy, or induration), or poor (extensive scarring, atrophy, or induration)</description>

    <measure>Differences of Adverse events(erythema, burning sensation, swelling, bleeding) between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 60 months after each treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events reported by the patients were noted at each follow-up visit, including severity, duration, and need for additional therapy. All events due to PDT were described as phototoxic reactions(e.g erythema, burning sensation, swelling, bleeding)</description>

    <description>After the anesthetic cream was removed, AFL was performed using a 2940-nm Er:YAG AFL (Joule; Sciton, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a 500 µm ablation depth, level 1 coagulation, 22% treatment density, and a single pulse</description>

    <description>Immediately after the AFL, a 1-mm thick layer of methyl-aminolevulinate (16% Metvix® cream; PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, Norway) was applied to the lesion and to 5 mm of the surrounding healthy tissue. The area was covered with an occlusive dressing (Tegaderm; 3M, Co., Saint Paul, MN, USA) for 3 h, after which the remaining cream was removed with saline gauze, and the red fluorescence of porphyrins was visualized with Wood's light.</description>

    <description>Each treatment area was then separately illuminated using red light-emitting diode lamps (Aktilite CL128; Galderma S.A., Bruchsal, Germany) with peak emission at 632 nm and a total light dose of 37 J/cm2. Areas scheduled to receive MAL-PDT received the second treatment 7 days later. During the illumination, patients were asked to evaluate pain intensity using an 11-point visual analog scale.</description>
