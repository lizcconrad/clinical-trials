  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to investigate the use of 89Zr-trastuzumab as a HER2 imaging agent to determine
      which patients are likely to respond to targeted HER2 agents as single agent therapy. We are
      proposing to perform a pilot study with goals of demonstrating the feasibility of imaging
      breast cancer patients with 89Zr-trastuzumab-PET/MRI, evaluating the relationship between
      tumor 89Zr-trastuzumab uptake and in vitro positivity of HER2, assessing the relationship
      between 89Zr-trastuzumab uptake and response to HER2 therapy.
