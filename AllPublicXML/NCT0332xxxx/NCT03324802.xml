  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well hypofractionated radiation therapy works in
      preventing the return of tumor cells in breast cancer patients following surgery.
      Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter
      period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 24-month complication rate of 5 fraction whole radiotherapy +/-
      concurrent boost as compared to 15 fraction radiotherapy +/- sequential boost.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate acute and late toxicity. II. To estimate the 5-year locoregional control,
      invasive disease-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate fatigue, and other patient-reported outcomes. II. To evaluate clinical
      features, treatment technique, dose-volume parameters, histologic and genetic variants
      associated with fair and poor cosmetic outcomes or unplanned surgical intervention.

      III. To evaluate the costs and comparative effectiveness of treatment. IV. Compare the use of
      photon therapy with spot scanning proton therapy in two different hypo-fractionated whole
      breast schemas.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Within 12 weeks of breast cancer surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo
      radiation therapy in 15 daily fractions for 10 days.

      ARM II: Within 12 weeks of breast cancer surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo
      hypofractionated radiation therapy in 5 daily fractions for 5 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 5 years.
