      We are trying to understand how insulin (a type of hormone in the body that regulates how the
      body regulates how one metabolizes protein and carbohydrates) and exercise alter proteins
      involved in energy production and metabolism in skeletal muscle.

      (Aims 1-3) We are trying to understand how insulin (a type of hormone in the body that
      regulates how the body regulates how one metabolizes protein and carbohydrates) and exercise
      alter proteins involved in energy production and metabolism in skeletal muscle. By studying
      this, they hope to better understand the causes of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes
      Insulin is a hormone that is produced normally in the body and causes blood sugar to return
      to normal after eating. Insulin resistance is a state when the body is not using insulin
      correctly, and more insulin is needed to keep blood sugar concentrations normal. Insulin
      resistance can lead to Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which blood sugar
      levels are too high. Our studies may help to find out why some people develop Type 2 diabetes
      and how exercise may prevent this disease.

      (Aim 4) We are asking patients from aims 1-3 to take part in this research study because they
      have high triglycerides that could be treated anyway with fibrates, and they do not have
      diabetes.

      Triglycerides and cholesterol are the two main kinds of fat that are in blood. People who
      have high triglycerides have some health risks and are sometimes treated with drugs called
      &quot;fibrates&quot;. This drug turns on a protein in ones body that controls the activity of some of
      the genes that make it easier for their liver to get rid of triglycerides. We think that
      maybe this same gene, in ones muscle, can lower the ability of genes in ones muscle to
      respond beneficially to exercise, but we don't know if this is true.

    <description>Aim 1. To determine whether the transcription factor expression response to exercise is dysregulated in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients. We will test the hypothesis that MZF1, NFKB1, RELA, SP1/KLF and EGR1 responses to an acute exercise bout are reduced in insulin resistant patients with type 2 diabetes.</description>

    <description>Aim 2. To determine how insulin resistance changes the response of post-translational modifications of SP1/KLF family and MZF1 transcription factors to acute exercise in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients. We will test the hypothesis that:
SP1/KLF2, 4, and 6 and phosphorylation/acetylation and MZF1 phosphorylation is altered in response to acute exercise.
The response of SP1/KLF2, 4, and 6 phosphorylation and acetylation and MZF1 phosphorylation to acute exercise is abnormal in patients with type 2 diabetes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Aim 3</arm_group_label>
    <description>Aim 3. To define the response of miRNAs to acute exercise in healthy and insulin resistant muscle from obese and type 2 diabetic patients. We will test the hypotheses that:
The exercise-induced increases in expression of miR-378 members and miR-128 are lower in obese and type 2 diabetic muscle than in lean healthy controls.
FOXO1 expression, a target of miR-378 and miR-128, is higher in obese and type 2 diabetic muscle and this is accompanied by decreased FOXO1 phosphorylation.
The exercise-induced increases in expression of miR-30 family members, miR-10a, miR-422a, and miR-532 are lower in obese and type 2 diabetic muscle.
There are novel miRNAs that regulate the transcriptional program induced by acute exercise and are dysregulated in insulin resistance.</description>
