  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to assess the health benefits of almond consumption on gut microbiome
      patterns and their association with circulating disease risk biomarkers, as well as the
      processes that control those pathways. Health benefits will be assessed relative to a
      breakfast/snack bar placebo control.

      Men and women with elevated waist circumference aged between 18-75 yrs will be recruited from
      the Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) area to participate in a two arm crossover, randomized study;
      each treatment period will be 4 weeks in length, with a 4 week washout period separating each
      treatment. Participants will be randomized to consume either i) almonds, or ii) omelettes at
      15% of energy. Each of the treatment products will contain equal levels of calories.

    <description>Bacterial community alpha-diversity measured using richness and diversity indices including Chao1, Shannon, Inverse Simpson.
Bacterial community beta-diversity measured using weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances.
The most abundant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) within the bacterial community identified based on the relative abundances of the OTUs within the community.
Bacterial community composition at the phylum and genus levels described based on the relative abundances of each taxa within the community.
Bacterial community functional capacity measured based on the relative abundances of collected predicted functions of the community members.
Ecological relationships between members of bacterial community assessed using correlation network modelling to identify keystone and foundation members of the bacterial community that have the highest number of positive (supportive) or negative (suppressive) connections (&gt;15) with other members of community.</description>
