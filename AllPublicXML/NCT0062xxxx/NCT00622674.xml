    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib
      together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when
      given together with cetuximab in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given together with cetuximab
           in patients with advanced solid tumors expressing epidermal growth factor receptor
           (EGFR).

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary information about the anti-tumor activity of bortezomib and
           cetuximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cetuximab IV over 60-90
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.

    <description>The standard Phase I design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given with weekly cetuximab. The MTD is defined as the highest dose studied for which the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was less than 33%.</description>
