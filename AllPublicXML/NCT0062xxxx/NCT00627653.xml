    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with a drug called fenofibrate, which
      is a PPAR-alpha agonist and controls how the heart metabolizes fats, will reverse the
      age-related decline in cardiac fat metabolism and mechanical function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In older Americans, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability. It
      has been shown recently that with aging the human heart exhibits a decline in myocardial
      fatty acid utilization (MFAU) and oxidation (MFAO) and that these metabolic changes are
      paralleled by a decline in mechanical function. It has also been shown that peroxisome
      proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) activates the expression of the genes
      encoding enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid transport and oxidation. There is both
      indirect and direct evidence that PPAR-alpha-mediated responses decrease with age.
      Consequently, we hypothesize that changes in fatty acid in the aging heart may be mediated,
      at least in part, via a decline in PPAR-alpha-mediated responses. Thus, administration of a
      PPAR-alpha agonist to older humans will result in a shift in cardiac fatty acid metabolism to
      that more closely seen in younger humans and this shift will be paralleled by an improvement
      in cardiac mechanical function.

      To prove or disprove this hypothesis, we will determine, in aged and young healthy
      volunteers, whether stimulation of PPAR-alpha using the partial agonist, fenofibrate, shifts
      myocardial substrate utilization by increasing MFAU and MFAO, and whether these changes are
      associated with an increase in left ventricular function. Study participants will have 4
      clinic visits, each lasting approximately 5 hours.
