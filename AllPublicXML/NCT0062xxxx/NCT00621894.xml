  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of LGD-4665 given daily by mouth to
      increase platelet counts in the treatment of patients with ITP (immune thrombocytopenic
      purpura). LGD-4665 increased platelet counts safely and tolerably compared to placebo in
      healthy volunteers. This study will examine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 7.5 mg
      capsules of LGD-4665 to increase platelets compared to placebo, randomized 2:1, during
      blinded treatment for 6 weeks. Evaluation of platelet counts, bleeding scores and safety
      parameters will be done weekly. All patients are eligible to continue on active, open
      LGD-4665 treatment for an additional 12 weeks with optimal adjustment of dose for each
      patient.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIA study with two parts to the design.

        -  Part 1 is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled treatment of 7.5 mg/day
           LGD-4665 versus placebo in approximately 24 patients with ITP who have been treated with
           at least one prior therapy for ITP. Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:2
           (placebo: 7.5 mg/day LGD-4665) for 6 weeks of treatment. Platelet counts, bleeding
           scores, vital signs, physical exams and laboratory tests will be assessed weekly.
           Treatment groups will be analyzed for efficacy by the percentage of patients with
           platelet counts two times baseline and ≥ 50,000/uL at 6 weeks of treatment, and for
           safety by adverse events, vital signs, physical exams, laboratory tests and use of ITP
           rescue medications or transfusions.

        -  Part 2 is an extension of study treatment with open label LGD-4665. All patients who
           participate in the Part 1 randomized double-blind treatment of this Ph IIA trial are
           eligible to continue open label treatment with LGD-4665 for up to 3 months at an
           appropriate dose for the safe maintenance of platelet counts (≥ 50,000/uL to ≤
           200,000/uL). Assessments of effectiveness and safety will be made at 2 and 4 week
           intervals.

    <description>ITP Bleeding Severity Scale was used for the analysis of bleeding score. Bleeding scores were, 0=None, 1=minor, and 2=major. Body sites and bleeding grade analysis was as follows: cutaneous (1= 1-5 bruises; scattered petechiae and 2= &gt; 5 bruises, &gt;2 centimeter [cm]; petechiae), oral mucosa (1= 1 blood blister or &gt; 5 petechiae, gum bleeding &lt; 5 minute[min], 2= multiple blood blisters; gum bleeding &gt; 5 min), epistaxis (1= blood on blowing nose or epistaxis &lt; 5 min, 2= bleeding &gt; 5 min), gastrointestinal (1= occult blood, 2= gross blood), gynecological (1= spotting not at time of period, 2= bleeding not at time of period or very heavy period), urinary (1= microscopic (+ by dipstick), 2= macroscopic), pulmonary(1= possible symptoms but mild, 2= yes), subconjunctival (1= yes, 2= both eyes significantly involved), Intracranial (1= possible symptoms, 2= yes, clinically confirmed). Change from Baseline was calculated as Baseline value minus post-randomization value. Baseline was Day 1value.</description>
