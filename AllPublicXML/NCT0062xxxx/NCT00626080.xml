  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that subcutaneous administration of insulin
      detemir, as compared to insulin NPH, leads to a more pronounced effect on cerebral glucose
      metabolism and/or cerebral blood flow in brain regions associated with appetite regulation,
      to account for the reported difference in weight.
