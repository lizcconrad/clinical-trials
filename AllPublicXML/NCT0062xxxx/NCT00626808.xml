      database.

      -  To evaluate the rate of FluMist administration compared to other influenza vaccine use
           in the following pediatric populations:

             -  Children younger than 24 months of age

             -  Children 24-59 months of age with a claim associated with a diagnosis of asthma

             -  Children 24-59 months of age without a claim associated with a diagnosis of asthma,
                but with dispensed medication for wheezing

             -  Children 24-59 months of age with immunosuppression

        -  To describe, in children in the above populations who receive FluMist, the type and
           number of Emergency Room visits or hospitalizations associated with an insurance claim
           within 42 days of receiving FluMist

        -  To explore the rationale for FluMist immunization of pediatric populations that are
           excluded from recommended usage by characterizing the use in these populations
