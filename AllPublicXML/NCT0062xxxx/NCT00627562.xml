      1. Patients included will have benign or malignant lesions with treatment plan for
           endoscopic resection or resection by other minimally invasive techniques.

        2. They will be offered a robotic approach to their surgery using the DaVinci robotic
           surgical system (intuitive Surgical, Inc.).

        3. The objectives are to evaluate our ability to adequately visualize the surgical field
           and perform the intended surgery without a higher complication rate.

        4. Secondary objective include evaluation of blood loss, length of hospital stay,
           complications while using the DaVinci robot system, and quality of life in subjects and
           historical controls undergoing similar surgery without the robot or radiation therapy.

        5. To evaluate recurrence, survival and other outcome data in robotic surgery patients
           compared with similar historical control groups (matched with respect to stage, prior
           and subsequent treatment, age, tumor HPV positivity) of patients who have undergone
           standard surgery without the robot or radiation/chemoradiation treatment as an
           alternative to surgery.

      5. Endpoints will be compared to historical controls.

      The da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) being
      evaluated in this pilot study consists of 3 basic components: a surgeon's console,
      articulated mechanical arms and sterilizable instruments. The console includes a computer,
      video monitor and instrument controls, and is located in the operating room adjacent to the
      operating room table. The console is connected via computer to the mechanical arms holding
      the endoscope (surgical TV camera) and sterile surgical tools (e.g., forceps, scissors,
      electrocautery, etc.). These arms are located immediately adjacent to the patient on the
      operating room table. The surgeon sits at the console and controls the position and movement
      of the arms and surgical tools. The design of these tools is based upon well-established,
      commonly used surgical instruments. The da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive
      Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) is a &quot;manual image-guided surgery&quot; system that is computer
      enhanced rather than &quot;computer guided robotic surgery&quot; in which the surgeon programs the
      computer to do the surgery and the robot does the surgery (also known as a &quot;milling&quot;
      device).22 Use of the da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale,
      CA) in the aforementioned configuration in fact facilitates an exact translation of the
      surgeon's hand and finger movements at the console to precise and tremor-free movements of
      the arms and instruments.
