  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and asthma has increased in recent decades. We investigated the
      relationship between body mass index (BMI) and lung function, and also tried to determine if
      asthma prevalence differs between obese and non-obese children. We propose this
      cross-sectional, retrospective analysis to figure out whether the BMI is associated with
      elevated prevalence of asthma, and how their lung function changes in different BMI groups.
