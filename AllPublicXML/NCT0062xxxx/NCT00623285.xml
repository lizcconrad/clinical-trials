  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the perioperative administration of pregabalin will significantly
      decrease pain scores and post-operative opioid requirements for patients undergoing coronary
      artery bypass grafting, and reduces the incidence of opioid-induced side effects such as
      respiratory depression. This may reduce ICU admission and possibly abbreviate length of
      hospital stay.

Patients will receive the first dose post-operatively 12 hours after the initial dose was taken (+ 6 hours) given that patient is able to swallow and then they will receive placebo twice a day through the first 2 post-operative days for a total of six doses. If the patient is unable to swallow and NG tube is in place, the medication can be dissolved in water and administered through the NG tube.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients whom are able and willing to provide written informed consent.

          -  Male and female 18-70 years of age.

          -  Patients whom are undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting through a
             midline sternotomy for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients undergoing cardiac surgery for valvular or pericardial surgery.

          -  Patients with a documented ejection fraction of less than 50%.

          -  Patients with known chronic renal insufficiency and a calculated creatinine clearance
             of &lt; 60mL/min.

          -  Patients with known sensitivity to the study drugs.

          -  Patients with documented pre-existing chronic pain.

          -  Patients with seizure disorders.

          -  Patients whom are taking pregabalin or gabapentin

          -  Patients on chronic neuroleptic medications for control of psychiatric disorders as to
             avoid possible drug interactions and to avoid modulation of any pain states by such
             medications.

          -  Patients whom are taking tricyclic antidepressants or serotonin and norepinephrine
             re-uptake inhibitors(SNRI) will be excluded because of the effect of these drugs on
             neuropathic pain.

          -  Patients greater than 70 years of age will also be excluded because of their increased
             risk of side-effects and perioperative confusion.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females
