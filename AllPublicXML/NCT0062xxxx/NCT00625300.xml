  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of deep rTMS using the novel H-coil on the
      motor, affective and cognitive deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to
      establish its safety in this population.

      Study rational:We anticipate that reaching deeper brain layers and larger volume of
      activation with the novel H-coil may induce significantly better therapeutic effects in
      patients with PD and will pave the way for establishing a novel and effective treatment for
      this disorder.

      Design:A prospective, double blind sham-controled study. No. of centers:1 One: Tel-Hashomer
      Medical Center, affiliated to Sackler school of Medicine, Tel -Aviv University, Israel.

      Study Population:Forty patients with idiopathic PD, Hoehn and Yahr stages II to IV, on stable
      antiparkinsonian therapy, with partial response.

      Study Duration:Two years
