      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving high-dose
      radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works in
      treating patients who have undergone surgery for newly diagnosed grade II or grade III
      meningioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the impact of high-dose radiotherapy (RT) on progression-free survival (PFS),
           treatment tolerance, and post-treatment global cognitive functioning in patients with
           atypical (WHO grade II) or malignant ( WHO grade III) meningioma.

      OUTLINE: Patients with grade II disease are stratified according to resection status
      (complete excision [Simpson's stages 1-3] vs incomplete excision [Simpson's stages 4-5]) and
      participate in a phase II study. These patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups
      according to Simpson staging. Only data from these patients is analyzed with respect to the
      progression-free survival endpoint. Patients with grade III disease are treated in group 1 or
      2 according to Simpson staging (as patients with grade II disease). After treatment, the
      clinical results from these patients are observed and described.

        -  Group 1 (Simpson stage 1-3): Beginning no later than 6 weeks following surgery, patients
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

        -  Group 2 (Simpson stage 4-5): Beginning no later than 6 weeks following surgery, patients
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 7 weeks.

      Patients complete a Mini-Mental Status Exam at baseline and at 6 weeks and 6 months after
      completion of study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks, at 6 and 12 months,
      and then annually for at least 3 years.
