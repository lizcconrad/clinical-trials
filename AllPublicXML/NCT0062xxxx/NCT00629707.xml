      The purpose of this trial is to compare two different rates of fluid administration during
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment in children to determine which fluid administration
      rate is more beneficial for brain metabolism and for preventing or decreasing brain swelling
      during DKA.

    <textblock>
      Cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) is the most frequent serious complication of diabetic
      ketoacidosis (DKA) in children. The cause of cerebral edema during DKA is not well
      understood. Recent studies suggest that it may result from lack of adequate blood flow to the
      brain during DKA, before treatment starts. Brain injury, resulting in edema, may occur before
      treatment because of lack of adequate blood flow to the brain and additional injury may occur
      when adequate blood flow is re-established during treatment (called reperfusion injury).
      Because additional injury may occur during treatment, it is important to understand whether
      the rate of administration of intravenous fluids, and, therefore, the speed of reperfusion of
      the brain, is related to the degree of brain swelling and injury. Most current treatment
      protocols indicate that intravenous fluids should be administered slowly, but it may be
      possible that brain injury and swelling might be lessened if adequate blood flow is
      established more quickly.

      In this study, researchers will use magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to compare two different
      rates of fluid administration during DKA treatment in children. The investigators will use MR
      imaging to measure brain swelling and metabolism at three time points—twice during treatment
      and once after recovery from DKA—and will compare these measurements to determine which fluid
      administration rate has more beneficial effects on brain metabolism and brain swelling.

      The study's researchers hypothesize that more rapid re-establishment of blood flow to the
      brain (via more rapid administration of intravenous fluids) will result in less brain
      swelling and injury than slower rehydration with delayed re-establishment of adequate brain
      blood flow will.

    <description>In both groups, brain Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measures at 3-6 hours and 9-12 hours after beginning DKA treatment were averaged to determine overall brain ADC during DKA treatment. The brain ADC indicates the distribution of water in the brain and is an indicator of brain swelling (edema). The overall brain ADC values during DKA treatment were compared with the brain ADC measured after recovery to assess the degree of brain edema formation during DKA treatment. The difference in brain ADC, calculated as the averaged treatment values minus the recovery value, was used as the main outcome measure to indicate the degree of brain edema formation</description>

          <title>Cerebral Edema Measured by MR Imaging (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient)</title>
          <description>In both groups, brain Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measures at 3-6 hours and 9-12 hours after beginning DKA treatment were averaged to determine overall brain ADC during DKA treatment. The brain ADC indicates the distribution of water in the brain and is an indicator of brain swelling (edema). The overall brain ADC values during DKA treatment were compared with the brain ADC measured after recovery to assess the degree of brain edema formation during DKA treatment. The difference in brain ADC, calculated as the averaged treatment values minus the recovery value, was used as the main outcome measure to indicate the degree of brain edema formation</description>
