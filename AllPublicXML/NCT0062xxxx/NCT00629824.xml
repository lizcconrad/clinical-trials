  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin has greatly improved the
      treatment efficacy and is the mainstream of treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection. The
      efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin combination therapy and its
      impact on the outcome in older patients with chronic hepatitis C deserve to be elucidated.

      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination
           therapy in older patients with chronic hepatitis C

        2. To investigate the safety of pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination
           therapy in older patients with chronic hepatitis C

    <textblock>
      A prospective, hospital-based, case-control study enrolling 70 chronic hepatitis C patients
      who are 65 to 80 years of age and other sex- and HCV genotype-matched 140 chronic hepatitis C
      patients who are 50 to 64 years of age will be conducted for comparison. The 210 patients
      chronic hepatitis C patients will receive pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin
      combination therapy. Genotype 1 infected patients will received 48 weeks of treatment and
      genotype non-1 patients will received 24 weeks of treatment. Another 40 HCV-1 infected
      patients who are 65-80 years of age and have a rapid virological response ( defined as
      seronegative of HCV RNA at week 4 of treatment) will receive 24 weeks of treatment and are
      enrolled for comparison since Jan 2008. The primary outcome measurement is sustained
      virological response and safety.

             the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study

          -  History of thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medications, elevated
             thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations with elevation of antibodies to
