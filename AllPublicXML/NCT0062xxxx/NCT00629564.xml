      This study looks at the effect on basal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid output of 40 mg
      Esomeprazole (Nexium) administered orally and intravenously as a 15-minute infusion to people
      with symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Heartburn on at least 2 days of the past 7 days prior to screening, with or without a
             history of EE or a documented diagnosis of GERD within 6 months prior to screening,
             with or without a history of EE.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of ≥18.5 and ≤35 kg/m2. [BMI will be calculated using the
             following formula: weight (kg)/height (m)2.]

          3. Able to communicate with the investigator and to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of esophageal, gastric, or duodenal surgery, except for simple closure of an
             ulcer.

          2. History of severe liver disease, including (but not limited to) cirrhosis and acute or
             chronic hepatitis.

          3. Any significant &quot;alarm symptoms&quot;, within the past 6 months, such as, unintentional
             weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice or any other sign indicating serious
             or malignant disease.

          4. Abnormal lab test results, as indicated in the protocol.

          5. Other diseases, as indicated in the protocol.
