    <textblock>
      We are performing a research study to learn more about the control of an individual's blood
      thinning (anticoagulation) on warfarin. Individuals from an anticoagulation clinic are being
      asked to participate in order to see if a lottery which provides the opportunity to win money
      in combination with the use of the Med-eMonitor might be useful in helping patients to
      achieve better control of their anticoagulation therapy. Half of the participants will be
      enrolled in the lottery arm and the other half will be a control group who will receive the
      Med-eMonitor only.
