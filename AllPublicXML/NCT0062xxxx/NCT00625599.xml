  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population's life expectancy increases, fractures among the elderly in El Salvador are
      also increasing. There is currently limited data specific to the incidence and cause of
      fractures in the elderly within developing countries, such as El Salvador. The problem of
      inadequate knowledge pertaining to bone health and osteoporosis among the elderly is
      contributing to this aging population's health issues. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors effecting elderly patients admitted
      for fractures at the Hospital Zacamil in San Salvador, El Salvador. The study will also
      assess the current knowledge in two distinct populations on bone health and osteoporosis. The
      first population will be the patients over the age of 45 that present to Hospital Zacamil
      with acute fractures and are consulted by the department of orthopedics. The second
      population will consist of students at the Evangelical University over the age of 18 in
      non-medial track studies. All individuals will have to accept the invitation to participate
      in the study. In addition, educational materials will be developed on the prevention of
      fractures for medical professionals and for the elderly in El Salvador. The study objectives
      will determine incidence and prevalence of elderly fractures of patients over the age of 45
      at Hospital Zacamil. Secondly, the study will look at demographic information, prevalent
      causes of fractures, treatment of the fractures, morbidity and mortality, and any
      complications that may arise in the fracture patients prior to their discharge from the
      hospital. Thirdly, the study will seek out the current level of knowledge on bone health,
      osteoporosis, and fracture prevention in the young, educated Salvadorians and patients over
      the age of 45 at Hospital Zacamil. Fourthly, the study will address the benefits of the
      information gained by use of educational materials with the patients and doctors of El
      Salvador.

      Hypothesis One:

      Fractures of the elderly at Hospital Zacamil are significantly associated with occurring at
      the hip, wrist, and vertebra in comparison to other fracture locations.

        There will be two populations for this study. Hospital patients, females and males, over
        the age of 45 that are admitted to the department of orthopedics at the Hospital Zacamil in
        San Salvador, El Salvador from January 2008 to April 2008 will represent one of the
        populations. All patients over the age of 45 presenting to the hospital due to an acute
        fracture will be invited to join the study. The individual's care will not be changed
        negatively or positively based on whether or not the individual decides to participate in
        this study.

        The second population group will be the university students, females and males, over the
        age of 18 participating in non-medical studies at the Evangelical University in February
        2009. No student will be negatively affected by not participating in this study. There will
        be no positive or negative influence on the student's grade or course assessment from
        participating or choosing not to participate in this study.
