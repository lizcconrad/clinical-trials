    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot, exploratory study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance,
      pharmacokinetics and potential activity of an investigational agent, HE3286, when
      administered orally, daily for 28 days to patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HE3286 has a potentially new mechanism of action that may improve the current therapeutic
      options available to patients with ulcerative colitis. In preclinical experiments, HE3286 has
      shown activity in animal models of ulcerative colitis. Additionally, HE3286 has shown to have
      anti-inflammatory activity associated with corticosteroids but without the side effects
      associated with corticosteroid use, such as immune suppression and bone loss.
