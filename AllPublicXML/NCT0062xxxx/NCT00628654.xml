      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as glycan analysis, may be effective in finding
      ovarian epithelial cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well glycan analysis works in diagnosing cancer
      in women with ovarian epithelial cancer and in healthy female participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the accuracy of glycan analysis to distinguish between normal healthy control
           female subjects and those with ovarian epithelial cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the new assay to the standard CA 125 for diagnostic accuracy.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Ovarian cancer patients: Blood samples are obtained periodically for up to 2 years.
           Patients undergoing surgery have blood samples drawn before and after surgery. Medical
           charts are reviewed periodically for up to 3 years.

        -  Healthy volunteers: One blood sample is obtained. Volunteers also complete a 1-page
           questionnaire.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 healthy female participants and 400 patients will be
      accrued for this study.

    <description>For healthy controls, a single sample will be obtained. For patients scheduled for surgery, two samples will be obtained: one preoperatively and one postoperatively. Ovarian cancer patients who agree to participate in the longitudinal study will have follow-up serum samples drawn periodically during chemotherapy treatments and then during surveillance visits, to correspond with routine blood testing for CA 125. They will be asked to participate for 2 years, with a maximum of 8 blood draws per year (to be coordinated with other venipunctures, if possible).</description>
