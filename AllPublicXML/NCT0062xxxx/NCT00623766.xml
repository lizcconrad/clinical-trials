    <measure>Disease Control Rate by Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Tumor Assessment Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1, first dose to end of Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) (global, in brain, or outside of brain) based on mWHO criteria divided by the number of patients who received treatment. By mWHO criteria: CR=complete disappearance of all index lesions. PR=decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions. SD=does not meet criteria for CR or PR, in the absence of progressive disease (PD). Patients with PR or CR not confirmed after at least 4 weeks are scored as SD unless they have new primary lesions. PD=at least 25% increase in the sum of the diameters of all index lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum recorded at or following baseline) and/or the appearance of any new lesions. CNS=central nervous system.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate by Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1, first dose to end of Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of immune-related (ir) complete response (irCR), partial response (irPR), or stable disease (irSD) divided by the total number of patients who received treatment. By irRC definition: irCR=complete disappearance of all index lesions. irPR=decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions. irSD=does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of ir progressive disease (irPD). irPD=at least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum recorded at or following baseline). CNS=central nervous system; non-CNS compartment=extracranial, or outside of the brain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) by Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Criteria and by Immune-relate Response Criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1, first dose until the last tumor assessment, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>BORR is defined as the number of patients whose global best overall response (BOR) was complete (CR) or partial response (PR), divided by the total number of participants who received treatment. CR=complete disappearance of all index lesions. PR=decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions. The global BOR is the best overall response (OR) designation over the study as a whole for an individual in the study based on overall tumor burden. Both central nervous system (CNS) (brain lesions) and non-CNS compartments (lesions outside the brain) are considered for the global BOR. For the analysis of global BOR of CR or PR (by both modified WHO criteria and immune-related response criteria [irRC]), the OR assessment must be confirmed by a second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response and must be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) by Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Criteria and by Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1, first dose to last tumor assessment up to 18.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined in patients whose global best overall response is complete (CR) or partial response (PR) as the time between the date of response of confirmed CR or PR, whichever occurs first, and the date of progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first. For patients who remain alive and have not progressed following response, duration of response will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Criteria and by Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1, first dose to the date of progression or death, whichever occurred first up to 22 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between the date of the first dose of study therapy and the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first. A patient who dies without reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those who remain alive and have not progressed, PFS will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who have not died and have no recorded postbaseline tumor assessment will be censored on the date of first dose of study therapy. Those who die without any recorded postbaseline tumor assessment will be considered to have progressed on the date of death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Surviving at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 Months (Overall Survival [OS] Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to Months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug until the date of death. Overall survival rate is the percentage of participants known to be alive at a timepoint. For those patients who did not die, OS was censored at the recorded last date of patient contact, and those with a missing recorded last date of contact will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive. The survival rate at a specified time-point is the probability that a patient is alive at that time following randomization. The rate is calculated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. A corresponding 2-sided 95% bootstrap confidence interval will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Died or Had a Treatment-related Adverse Event (AE), Immune-related AE, Immune-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Nervous System Disorder, Treatment-related Nervous System Disorder, SAE, and AE Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuously from Day 1, first dose, to 70 days following last dose of ipilimumab</time_frame>
    <description>AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Treatment-related=having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Onset of Response by Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Criteria and Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1, first dose to a maximum of 4.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Onset of response is defined as the time between the first dose of study therapy and the date when measurement criteria are first met for global best overall response of partial (PR) or complete (CR), whichever occurs first. CR=complete disappearance of all index lesions. PR=decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug until the date of death. For those patients who did not die, OS was censored at the recorded last date of patient contact, and those missing a recorded last date of contact will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive.</description>

        <title>Disease Control Rate by Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Tumor Assessment Criteria</title>
        <description>Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) (global, in brain, or outside of brain) based on mWHO criteria divided by the number of patients who received treatment. By mWHO criteria: CR=complete disappearance of all index lesions. PR=decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions. SD=does not meet criteria for CR or PR, in the absence of progressive disease (PD). Patients with PR or CR not confirmed after at least 4 weeks are scored as SD unless they have new primary lesions. PD=at least 25% increase in the sum of the diameters of all index lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum recorded at or following baseline) and/or the appearance of any new lesions.

        <title>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) by Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Criteria and by Immune-relate Response Criteria (irRC)</title>
        <description>BORR is defined as the number of patients whose global best overall response (BOR) was complete (CR) or partial response (PR), divided by the total number of participants who received treatment. CR=complete disappearance of all index lesions. PR=decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions. The global BOR is the best overall response (OR) designation over the study as a whole for an individual in the study based on overall tumor burden. Both central nervous system (CNS) (brain lesions) and non-CNS compartments (lesions outside the brain) are considered for the global BOR. For the analysis of global BOR of CR or PR (by both modified WHO criteria and immune-related response criteria [irRC]), the OR assessment must be confirmed by a second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response and must be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Surviving at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 Months (Overall Survival [OS] Rate)</title>
        <description>OS is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug until the date of death. Overall survival rate is the percentage of participants known to be alive at a timepoint. For those patients who did not die, OS was censored at the recorded last date of patient contact, and those with a missing recorded last date of contact will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive. The survival rate at a specified time-point is the probability that a patient is alive at that time following randomization. The rate is calculated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. A corresponding 2-sided 95% bootstrap confidence interval will be calculated.</description>
