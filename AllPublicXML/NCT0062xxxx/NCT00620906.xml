      motion using a Polhemus motion capture system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sacroiliac (SI) joint is a diarthrodial joint with the contradictory biomechanical
      function of transmitting compressive loads from the lumbar spine to the lower extremity while
      maintaining a nutating motion in the pelvis.

      Recent studies identify the Sacroiliac (SI) joints as a significant source of pain in
      patients with chronic low back pain, contributing up to 27%. Recent studies have demonstrated
      that historical and physical examination findings and radiological imaging alone are
      insufficient to diagnose SI joint pain.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of manipulation on sacroiliac joint
      motion using a Polhemus motion capture system. The Absolute angular deviation of sacroiliac
      joint motion will be assessed during the normal gait cycle with the Polhemus Liberty motion
      capture system. Six sensors will be attached to specific anatomical landmarks of the pelvis
      which recorded motion characteristics while walking on a treadmill at 5 mph. The subjects
      then receive a HVLA manipulation to the SI joint and were retested at the same treadmill
      speed.

      The Motion capture system tracks objects at a speed of 240 updates per second on all sensors
      simultaneously. The latency of data sampling is less than 4ms; 240 x 60 sec x 8 Sensors
      totaling 115,200 data points per minute. The system generates and tracks electromagnetic
      fields (EMF), computes position and orientation of sensors in an X, Y, and Z coordinate
      system while interfacing with a computer. The EMF source contains electromagnetic coils that
      emit a magnetic field. The source is the system's reference frame for sensor measurements.
      The sensor contains electromagnetic coils (accelerometers) that detect the position and
      orientation of the magnetic fields emitted by the EMF source.
