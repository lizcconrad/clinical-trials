      The aim of the study is to establish tDCS as a prognostic tool to predict VNS therapy outcome
      among patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years it has been shown that many different brain stimulation techniques are
      effective in seizure reduction in epilepsy patients as well as in animal models of epilepsy.
      VNS is the method most often used with at least 45.000 patients implanted with this device
      worldwide. However, prediction of seizure outcome after VNS implantation is not possible in
      an individual patient so far. Recently, tDCS is increasingly used as a method to reduce
      seizure frequency in epileptic patients. Therefore it is hypothesized, that a positive effect
      after a single tDCS, in terms of short time seizure reduction and reduction of epileptic
      discharges in the EEG, could be predictive for epilepsy outcome after VNS implantation.

      In the proposed multicenter prognostic study we test the predictive value of tDCS for each
      patient with refractory epilepsy 1 week up to 2 months before VNS implantation. The effects
      of tDCS will be verified via a 15 minutes long routine EEG examination, performed immediately
      before and after tDCS, together with seizure diary and seizure severity scale, assessed 1
      month before and 1 week after tDCS. A 6 months long observation period will follow the VNS
      implantation. At the end of the 6 months period seizure diary and seizure severity scale of
      the last month will be performed to measure VNS therapy outcome. On the basis of the
      described variables, immediate up to 1 week long tDCS effects will be correlated to 6 months
      long VNS therapy outcome.
