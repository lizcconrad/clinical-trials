      HAART in pregnant HIV-infected serves two goals, preventing mother to child transmission and
      providing adequate treatment for the mother. Levels of HIV RNA at delivery and the use of
      antiretrovirals (ARV) are independently associated with decreased transmission[1]. With a
      HAART regimen the transmission rate can be reduced till under the 2 %[1, 2]. Possibly
      suitable drugs which can be used during pregnancy is lopinavir/ritonavir based regimens. In
      Thailand, aluvir is not available therefore a generic lopinavir/ritonavir tablet formulation
      will be used in our study.

      In order to prove adequate levels of lopinavir/ritonavir, we will record 12-hour PK at third
      trimester. Second trimester and post-partum 12-hour PK are optional. Furthermore, we will
      collect safety and efficacy throughout the study.

    <description>Patients will start with lopinavir/ritonavir new formulation 400/100 mg bid with a low fat diet plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The choice of the 2 NRTIs is at the discretion of the investigator, though in general the use of zidovudine+lamivudine (300/150mg Combivir®) is recommended. If patients can be included at or before gestational week 20, a 12h pharmacokinetic curve will be recorded at week 20 (± 2 weeks)(Group 1). There should be a minimum of 2 weeks between start of lopinavir and pharmacokinetic recording. If they are included after week 20, the first 12h pharmacokinetic curve will be recorded at gestational week 33 (± 2 weeks)(Group 2). For the patients in both groups a 12 hr curve will be recorded.
Subjects in Group 1 will be offered to conduct a second 12h pharmacokinetic curve at week 20 (± 2 weeks), but this is only optional. Both groups will be asked to participate in the post partum curve, again this is optional.</description>
