    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of a reduced intensity
      conditioning regimen and allogeneic bone marrow transplant for people with systemic
      sclerosis. In an allogeneic bone marrow transplant procedure, bone marrow is taken from a
      healthy donor and transplanted into the patient. Bone marrow can be donated by a family
      member or an unrelated donor who is a complete tissue type match.

      Participants will receive the chemotherapy and low dose radiation conditioning regimen
      consisting of the following: Fludarabine will be given intravenously for 5 days.
      Cyclophosphamide will be given intravenously on the first and second day. After completing
      the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, patients will receive a single low dose of total body
      irradiation. The next day, patients will receive the allogeneic bone marrow transplant. On
      the third and fourth day after the transplant, patients will receive high dose intravenous
      cyclophosphamide. This is given to help prevent two complications: (1) graft rejection, which
      occurs when the body's immune system rejects the donor bone marrow, and (2) graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD), which is when the donor immune cells attack the patient's normal tissues. On
      the fifth day after the transplant, patients will start receiving two additional medications:
      tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid (MPA, Myfortic), to help prevent GVHD. Patients will receive
      mycophenolic acid for about 5 weeks and tacrolimus for about 6 months. Also beginning on the
      fifth day after the transplant, patients will receive daily injections of a growth factor
      called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is a protein that increases the
      white blood cell count; G-CSF will be continued until the patient's white blood cell count
      has returned to normal levels.

      Patients will remain closely monitored either in the outpatient clinic setting or in the
      hospital for approximately 2-3 months after the transplant, but possibly longer if there are
      complications. Follow-up study visits will occur at 6 months and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
      years after the transplant. Study researchers will keep track of the patient's medical
      condition after leaving the transplant center by phone calls or mailings to patients and
      their doctors once a year for the rest of the study participants' lives.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and potential efficacy of reduced intensity conditioning with
      fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) and allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for the stabilization or regression of disease
      manifestations of severe systemic sclerosis (SSc).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable allogeneic donor engraftment can be safely established with
      reduced intensity conditioning followed by matched sibling or unrelated donor bone marrow
      transplantation in patients with severe SSc.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2 and
      Cyclophosphamide IV on days -6, -5, and undergo 2 Gray TBI on day -1. Patients receive human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Patients then
      receive cyclophosphamide IV on days +3 and +4, and beginning day +5 they start tacrolimus
      orally (PO) and enteric coated mycophenolic acid.

      After completion of initial study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then
      annually for 5 years.
