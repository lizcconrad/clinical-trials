      The purpose of this study is to determine if dexamethasone given at night is a more effective
      treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in young children than standard three times per
      day hydrocortisone. Our hypothesis is that nocturnal dexamethasone will lead to more
      efficient suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We performed a cross-over
      trial comparing hormonal control during two 24-hour hospitalizations, one on hydrocortisone
      and one on nocturnal dexamethasone.

      This is a Phase II clinical trial, intended to estimate the effect of instituting
      Dexamethasone therapy in comparison to prior standard therapy. Each subject provides his own
      baseline data. There is no control group. Patients with CAH who meet inclusion criteria will
      be admitted to the clinical research center for two 24 hour hospitalizations. Adrenal hormone
      profiles will be measured during each hospitalization. The patient will take his or her
      baseline hydrocortisone regimen during one hospitalization and a new regimen consisting of a
      single daily nocturnal dose of Dexamethasone during the second hospitalization.

    <description>Each subject was admitted for 2 24 hour hospitalizations, one on hydrocortisone and one on dexamethasone. Due to the timing of blood draws, the serum hormonal profile was only measured for 23 hours. The primary outcome was the Percent Difference in the Mean log transformed Area under the curve of 17-hydroxyprogesterone between the two regimens.</description>

    <description>Subjects were given their baseline hydrocortisone regimen which was three times daily for 4 of the subjects and twice daily for one subject. Doses were given at 8 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM. The 2 PM time point was skipped for the subject who received hydrocortisone twice daily. Doses ranged from 6.9 to 18.5 milligrams per meter squared per day and were based on each individual's baseline regimen.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with additional medical conditions necessitating glucocorticoid therapy.

          -  Patients on phenytoin, barbiturates, and rifampin as these medications accelerate the
             metabolism of glucocorticoids.

          -  Patients on ketoconazole as this medication increases the bioavailability of
