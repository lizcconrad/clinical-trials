      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Bulkamid®
      in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency
      (ISD) in adult women who have SUI or stress predominant mixed incontinence

      The study is a single-masked, randomized, comparative multi-center, 2-arm parallel study
      intended to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Bulkamid® vs. Contigen® for the
      treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI)due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) in
      adult women who have SUI or stress predominant mixed incontinence.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either a polyacrylamide hydrogel (Bulkamid®)
      treatment, or a collagen treatment (Contigen®) using a 2:1 ratio and will be masked to the
      treatment. Screening baseline evaluations and collagen skin testing will be completed to
      determine eligible subjects. Following a negative skin test, a subject will be randomized and
      treated with Bulkamid® or the comparator device at the Treatment Visit.

      Subjects that are not continent will be considered for re-injection. A maximum of 3
      injections (initial + 2 re-injections) are allowed. After the last injection, subjects will
      attend the 3-Month, 6-Month and 12-Month Follow-up Visits plus a telephone contact at 9
      months.

      The study will record objective incontinence measurements, subject's perception of
      effectiveness and quality of life assessments. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the
      study.

      Each subject will be followed for 12 months from the last injection.
