    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to obtain preliminary data of the safety and
      effectiveness of Sepraspray in a limited number of patients who are under going a
      laparoscopic myomectomy. Sepraspray will be applied to the organs in the pelvic cavity
      following laparoscopic myomectomy. We will compare treatment with Sepraspray as a adhesion
      prevention barrier after laparoscopic myomectomy versus no adhesion barrier.
