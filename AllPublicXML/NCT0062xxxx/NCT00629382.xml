      This clinical study designed as a prospective, open labelled, multi-centre, RCT will be
      carried out to evaluate if direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin B immobilized fiber column
      (PMX) is superior to conventional medical therapy for sepsis, for patients with sepsis
      arising from abdominal cavity infection, accompanied by the failure of one or more organs.
      120 patients (60 treatment/60 control) will be considered in this study. Those patients
      fulfilling inclusion criteria and not having exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to
      one of two study groups. One group will be treated with PMX (PMX group) and the other will
      receive a &quot;standard therapy&quot; for sepsis (control group). All patients will receive full
      intensive care management, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, antimicrobial
      chemotherapy, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy, if required. Each patient
      will be followed up for 28 days after study entry.

    <description>Hemoperfusion with PMX will be performed in ICU. The 1st PMX treatment (day 0) will be carried out for 2 hours and ideally within 24 hours but not later than 48 hours after diagnosis of severe sepsis. The second PMX treatment has to be performed 24 to 48 hours after the end of the first PMX treatment, ideally after 24 hours. Hemoperfusion therapy will be performed in addition to conventional medical therapy in the ICU.</description>
