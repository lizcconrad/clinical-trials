  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a Chinese herbal cream is effective in treating
      HSIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, also known as HGAIN, or high-grade anal
      intraepithelial neoplasia).

      The purpose of this study is to test a new noninvasive topical cream, AIJP (Arnebia Indigo
      Jade Pearl), for treatment of precancerous anal lesions in order to prevent their progression
      to anal cancer. AIJP is a topical Chinese herbal cream that has been specifically designed to
      treat people with the cancer precursor lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). In
      general, HPV infection is a key factor in development of cervical, anal and vulvar cancers.
      People with HIV are especially vulnerable to develop anal cancer associated with HPV. It is
      known that prior to development of anal cancer a person develops a precancerous condition
      known as a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Treatment of the HSIL can
      prevent progression to anal cancer. Current therapies for HSIL and anal cancer are highly
      invasive. A new effective noninvasive topical therapy for precancerous HSIL could have a high
      impact on prevention of anal cancer.

    <description>Response assessed 12 weeks after treatment.
Late Clinical Response (LCR): HSIL present at week 48 but none at week 60, with two independent reviews in agreement that HSIL absent at week 60.
Complete response (CR): No HSIL on histology or cytology at weeks 48 or 60 (caveat: if HSIL at week 60, blinded chart notes and photographs were reviewed by two clinicians, and decision was reached by agreement or consensus whether HSIL had been missed at week 48. Cases that reviewers independently agreed had not been missed at week 48 were considered true recurrences)
Partial Clinical Response (PCR): HSIL on cytology with no HSIL histology, or improvement &gt;50% in the number of lesions with HSIL, or an improvement &gt;50% in lesion size, area, or clinical characteristics (e.g. acetowhite staining, Lugol's staining, or vascular changes were improved)
No Response (NR): HSIL present at weeks 48 &amp; 60 on histology, or improvement ≤ 50% in number, size, area or characteristics.</description>

        <description>Response assessed 12 weeks after treatment.
Late Clinical Response (LCR): HSIL present at week 48 but none at week 60, with two independent reviews in agreement that HSIL absent at week 60.
Complete response (CR): No HSIL on histology or cytology at weeks 48 or 60 (caveat: if HSIL at week 60, blinded chart notes and photographs were reviewed by two clinicians, and decision was reached by agreement or consensus whether HSIL had been missed at week 48. Cases that reviewers independently agreed had not been missed at week 48 were considered true recurrences)
Partial Clinical Response (PCR): HSIL on cytology with no HSIL histology, or improvement &gt;50% in the number of lesions with HSIL, or an improvement &gt;50% in lesion size, area, or clinical characteristics (e.g. acetowhite staining, Lugol's staining, or vascular changes were improved)
No Response (NR): HSIL present at weeks 48 &amp; 60 on histology, or improvement ≤ 50% in number, size, area or characteristics.</description>

        <description>Response assessed 12 weeks after treatment (week 60), by treatment adherence assessed at 48 weeks.
Late Clinical Response (LCR): HSIL present at week 48 but none at week 60; two independent reviews agree HSIL absent at week 60.
Complete response (CR): No HSIL on histology or cytology at weeks 48 or 60 (caveat: if HSIL at week 60, blinded chart notes and photographs reviewed by two clinicians, with decision by agreement or consensus whether HSIL had been missed at week 48. Cases that reviewers independently agreed had not been missed at week 48 were considered true recurrences)
Partial Clinical Response (PCR): HSIL on cytology with no HSIL histology, or improvement &gt;50% in number of lesions with HSIL, or improvement &gt;50% in lesion size, area, or clinical characteristics (e.g. acetowhite staining, Lugol's staining, or vascular changes improved)
No Response (NR): HSIL present on histology, or improvement ≤ 50% in number, size, area or characteristics.</description>
