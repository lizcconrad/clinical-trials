      Velocity Vector Imaging may provide reliable and detailed information on left ventricular
      segmental function in asymptomatic patients with moderate-to severe AR. This may help to
      identify subclinical myocardial dysfunction in order to operate early enough to prevent
      postoperative heart failure and restrict unnecessary early operation which could be
      associated with operative risks and mortality related to prosthetic valves.

    <textblock>
      Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is a progressive process which causes both left ventricular
      volume and pressure overload. While the volume overload is associated with the degree of the
      aortic regurgitant volume, the pressure overload occurs as a result of systemic hypertension
      developed due to increased stroke volume. In early stages, excentric hypertrophy occurs
      aiming to compensate the volume overload in the left ventricle. Therefore , ejection fraction
      remains in normal range despite the increasing volume overload. Left ventricular dilatation
      and impairment in ejection fraction only occur in the end stages of the disease. Asymptomatic
      patients with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) have a good prognosis in the presence of
      preserved systolic function. Therefore it is a challenge to identify patients with
      subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Velocity vector imaging (VVI) is a new
      echocardiographic method based on two dimensional gray scale imaging, which is angle
      independent and can provide more accurate data about cardiac function.
