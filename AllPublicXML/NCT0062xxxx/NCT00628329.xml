  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to understand the association of Vitamin A serum levels and Vitamin A receptor number
      and responsiveness in asthmatics. We believe that Vitamin A receptors may be less prevalent
      in asthmatics and their responsiveness decreased.

    <textblock>
      We wish to define the association of asthma, vitamin A serum levels and vitamin A receptor
      number and responsiveness on circulating mononuclear cells. Asthma is a complex, heterogenous
      and often debilitating and potentially deadly disease. The causes for asthma are many, with
      susceptibility and resistance to treatment is poorly understood. Ultimately, looking at this
      disease from another angle such as the role of Vitamin A and/or receptors can help us learn
      more about the pathophysiology and treatment of asthma.
