  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ReWalk enables people with lower limb disabilities to carry out routine ambulatory
      functions (stand, walk, climb stairs etc.). It can be used by people with disabilities such
      as spinal cord injury, brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and other
      severe walking impairments. The device promises to restore the dignity of disabled persons,
      enabling them to work and improve their general health and quality of life, as well as
      significantly reduce medical and other related expenses.

    <textblock>
      The ReWalk comprises light wearable brace support suit, which integrates DC motors at the
      joints, rechargeable batteries, an array of sensors and a computer-based control system. It
      is snugly fitted on the body and worn underneath the clothing, if desired. ReWalk is a new
      realization of the Powered Exoskeleton concept, first tried about fifty years ago with no
      success. Employing an innovative, non-robotic design approach, it uniquely matches the user's
      capabilities with the control mechanisms. Upper-body movements of the user are detected and
      used to initiate and maintain walking processes. User stability and safety during ambulation
      is secured by concurrent use of safety aids such as crutches for walking and railing for
      stairs.
