    <measure>Number of Subjects With Pain Relief at 2 Hours From Time of First Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours from time of first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief at 2 hours was defined as change in rating from severe or moderate (score 3 or 2) to a rating of none or mild (score 0 or 1) at the 2-hour time point and no usage of rescue medications from the time of first dose to 2 hours.
The 4-point scale from the International Headache Society was used:
0 = none; 1 = mild symptom, not interfering with normal daily activities; 2 = moderate symptom, causing some restriction to normal activities; 3 = severe, leading to inability to perform daily activities</description>

    <time_frame>From 2 to 24 hours from time of first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained Pain Relief was defined as a rating of none or mild (score 0 or 1) at the 2-hour time point that was maintained during the 2-24 hour post-dose period and no use of rescue medication from the time of first dose to 24 hours.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Whose Time to Pain Relief Occurred Within 2 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours from the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects who reported pain relief (score of 0 or 1) at any time within the 2 hours following the time of first dose and who did not use rescue medication on or prior to this point. Subjects who did not reach pain relief by the end of the time period were not included.
The 4-point scale from the International Headache Society was used: 0 = none; 1 = mild symptom, not interfering with normal daily activities; 2 = moderate symptom, causing some restriction to normal activities; 3 = severe, leading to inability to perform daily activities</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Pain Relief at 10 Minutes</title>
        <description>Pain Relief at 10 minutes was defined as a change in rating from severe or moderate (score 3 or 2) to none or mild (score 0 or 1) at the 10 minute time point and no use of rescue medication from the time of first dose to 2 hours.
The 4-point scale from the International Headache Society was used:
0 = none; 1 = mild symptom, not interfering with normal daily activities; 2 = moderate symptom, causing some restriction to normal activities; 3 = severe, leading to inability to perform daily activities</description>
        <time_frame>2 hours from time of first dose</time_frame>
        <population>mITT population was defined as all randomized subjects who reported a qualifying migraine and received at least one dose of study treatment, and had at least one post-treatment efficacy evaluation.</population>
