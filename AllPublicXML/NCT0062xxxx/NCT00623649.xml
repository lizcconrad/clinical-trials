  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 3-day course of therapy with orally
      administered VCH-916 given at different dosages can effectively reduce the amount of
      circulating virus (i.e., viral load) in patients with early-stage chronic hepatitis
      C-infection. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with
      VCH-916. Blood samples will also be taken to measure the levels of VCH-916 present in plasma
      at various time points during the treatment period.
