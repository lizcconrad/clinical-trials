      This study will look how using taken from your tumors and mixed with special immune
      stimulating cells from another person's blood in given back to you in a series &quot;fusion cell&quot;
      injections, will effect your body. The primary goal of the study is to see if giving the
      experimental fusion cell injections is safe. We will also be looking to see what effect the
      experimental treatment as on your immune system and whether it has an effect on your cancer.

      Patients undergo tumor aquisition and short-term tumor cell cultures are established.
      Leukopheresis is performed monocyte-derived DC are generated ex-vivo by standard culture
      techniques, utilizing GM-CSF and Il-4. PEG fusions are generated, and following irradiation,
      the vaccine is frozen. The thawed vaccine is administered SC into a single site every three
      weeks. Each study is examining a dose-escalating strategy based apon the number PEG-fused
      generated from the PEG process that expressed both tumor cell and DC markers as determined by
      immune staining.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must be _&gt; 18 years of age

          -  The patient must be diagnosed with AJCC stage IV (primary or relasped) RCC

          -  The patient must have a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Clinical
             performance of 0-1

          -  The patient must have accessible tumor (minimum of 2.5cm in diameter in aggregate and
             accessible) for vaccine production

          -  The patient must have measurable tumor lesions (using Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) following resection of tumor lesions(s) used for vaccine
             production. If the patient has received previous radiation or intra-tumoral
             investigational treatments, the measurable disease must be outside the previous
             radiation port or treatment area unless there is documented tumor progression
             following the completion of therapy.

          -  The patient must have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function parameters
             within 21 days prior to the first vaccination (day 0 of treatment):

               -  White blood cell(WBC) count &gt;_ 3,000 cell/mm3

                  2.0 x Upper limits of normal

             HIV-2, and human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy tests, refrain
             from nursing and must agree ton use appropriate contraception for the duration of the
             trial

          -  The patient must have signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study
             procedures. The consent process must be documented in the patient's medical record

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has received prior chemotherapy

          -  The patient's tumor-derived cells do not meet predetermined manufacturing
             specifications, for example: human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class 1 molecule
             expression, sufficient tumor derived cells for vaccine manufacture, or pathologic
             confirmation of RCC

          -  The patient has received more than 2 prior regimes for treatment of RCC and the most
             recent is within 2 weeks of the first screening procedure

          -  The patient has any active or clinically significant central nervous system (CNS)
             metastases

          -  The patient is receiving chronic immunosuppressive, and/or oral steriod treatment

          -  The patient has any other reason in the Investigator's opinion that would make

             informed consent

          -  The patient has been treated with a non-oncologic investigational drug, biologic or
