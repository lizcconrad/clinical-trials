  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the change in the health status of severe COPD
      patients after the initiation of Tiotropium therapy. This will be assessed by the physician`s
      global evaluation of the patient`s health status on a 8-point scale. This measure has been
      shown to correlate with a established standard measure of the patients health related quality
      of life. The primary analysis in this trial will only include patients not pre-treated with a
      long-acting beta-agonist to establish a clear efficacy signal in this patient population. As
      the reality of COPD treatment nowadays is poly-pharmacy, a secondary analysis will analyse
      patients who are pretreated with long-acting bronchodilators to put the changes in the health
      status in a likely real world context. In parallel to these evaluations of the health status,
      the lung function response of the patients will be assessed to gain an established objective
      measure of treatment response.

    <measure>Change of Physician's Global COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Assessment After 8-week of Treatment Severe COPD Patients Without Concomitant LABA (Long-acting Beta Agonists) Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of satisfaction with tiotropium bromide treatment was evaluated based on the changes of the Global COPD Assessment performed by the physician. This evaluation was done with the help of an 8-point scale rated from 1 (Poor) to 8 (Excellent) following the question &quot;Overall, how is the COPD of your patient?&quot;</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second) After 8 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1: Average values for FEV1 in healthy people depend mainly on sex and age. Values of between 80% and 120% of the average value is considered normal. FEV1 &lt; 80% of the predicted value in combination with an FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% confirms the presence of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of FEV1/FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) After 8 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1/FVC (FEV1%) is the ratio of FEV1 to FVC. In healthy adults this should be approximately 75-80%. In obstructive diseases, the value often decreased (&lt;80%, often ~45%).</description>
