      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone, etoposide, and vinorelbine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known which drug is more effective in killing
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well mitoxantrone works compared to
      etoposide or vinorelbine works as second-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the palliative response rate in patients with hormone-resistant prostate
           cancer treated with mitoxantrone hydrochloride vs etoposide vs vinorelbine ditartrate as
           second-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of palliative response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the biological response (PSA &gt; 50%) in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression (biological and clinical) in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life and the impact on autonomy of patients over 70 years of
           age.

        -  Determine the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 5 minutes once a week for 3
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral etoposide twice daily on days 1-14.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral vinorelbine ditartrate once daily on days 1 and 8 and
           oral prednisone once daily on days 1-21.

      Treatment in all three arms repeats every 3 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
