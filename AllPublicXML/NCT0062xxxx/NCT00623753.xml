    <textblock>
      Vaccines have been very successful in preventing viral infections such as hepatitis B and the
      measles. Viral vaccines work by causing a person's immune system to make cells that will work
      against the virus. Due to the success in treating other viral infections, scientists are
      trying to develop a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV infection is the
      cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is one of the most serious viral
      infections we know.

      This is a research study to evaluate the safety of a possible vaccine against HIV.
      Researchers want to determine that a person's immune system can respond to the HIV before he
      or she is exposed to it. Therefore that person may be able to be protected from infection
      with HIV.

      This is a research study to find out about the safety of a new potential vaccine regimen
      against HIV. This potential vaccine regimen consists of a sequence of six vaccine shots that
      are being studied to see if they can help to protect people from the human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV). HIV infection is the cause of AIDS. AIDS is one of the most serious viral
      infections we know. Twenty million people around the world have already died of AIDS and over
      40 million people are currently infected with the virus. This study is being done to help us
      find an HIV vaccine that works.

      Vaccines have been very successful in preventing other viral infections, such as hepatitis B,
      polio, and measles. Viral vaccines work by causing a person's immune system to make
      antibodies and immune cells against the virus or to &quot;respond&quot; to the virus. Because of the
      success with other viral infections, scientists are trying to develop a successful vaccine
      for HIV. If a person's immune system can respond to HIV before he or she is exposed to it,
      that person may be able to be protected from infection with HIV.

      The vaccine regimen that will be tested in this study is based on the information that the
      virus uses to make a small part of the HIV. This small part is called the &quot;envelope&quot; or
      coating around the virus. Because only the information for this one part of the virus is used
      in the vaccine, the vaccine cannot cause HIV infection. We make all parts of the vaccine
      regimen in test tubes.

    <description>Description: The vaccine regimen is a series of 6 injections given 28 days apart. EnvDNA is administered intramuscularly as 100 mcg of recombinant DNA in 1.5 mL of PBS as injections #1, 2 and 5. PolyEnv1 is recombinant vaccinia virus administered subcutaneously as 107 pfu in 0.8 mL of PBS as injection #3. EnvPro is administered intramuscularly as 100 mcg of recombinant protein and 500 mcg of aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant in 1.0 mL of PBS as injections #4 and 6.</description>
