      Primary objective:

        -  to characterize the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic profile after intravenous
           bolus injection of unfractionated heparin (UFH) after repeated sc 100 IU anti-Xa/kg
           (corresponding to 1 mg/kg) twice a day during 2.5 days (every 12±2hrs) administrations
           of enoxaparin in Caucasian healthy subjects.

      Secondary objective(s):

        -  to compare the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic profile between 3 different
           timing of administration of the UFH

        -  to assess the tolerability of the different anticoagulation protocols
