  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The previous two studies of generic GPO saquinavir failed to prove bioequivalence. In this
      study the bio-equivalence will be investigated in healthy Thai volunteers, to see whether the
      generic GPO saquinavir shows bioequivalence when boosted with Norvir®. If the generic
      formulation is bioequivalent subsequent studies may follow in HIV-1 positive patients.

      The primary objective is to establish bioequivalence of &quot;ritonavir boosted generic GPO
      saquinavir&quot;, with Invirase® and Norvir® as the reference drug.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the short-term tolerability and safety profiles of
      generic saquinavir in healthy male volunteers.

    <description>Norvir® 100mg capsules, Invirase® 1,000 mg capsules Generic GPO Saquinavir 1,000 mg capsules For phase 1 and 2 - At day 1 subjects of group A will receive a single dose of Invirase®/Norvir® 1,000 mg / 100mg, while group B will receive generic GPO saquinavir / Norvir® 1,000 mg / 100mg as single dose. The same day the first 24 hr PK curve will be done. After this, a 7-day washout period will follow. At day 8 group A will take generic GPO saquinavir / Norvir® and Group B will take Invirase®/Norvir®. At this day, the second 24 hr PK curve will be done</description>
