      Purpose: Phase I focus groups with clinicians and patients will gather qualitative data to
      focus and inform the content of Phase II. In Phase II, 12 weeks of psychotherapy will be
      offered to evaluate feasibility and potential efficacy of a couples-based, integrated
      treatment for men with PTSD and alcohol dependence.

      Hypotheses: We predict that this experimental psychotherapy, Partners Encouraging Abstinence
      and Coping with Emotions (PEACE), will reduce patient drinking, reduce PTSD symptoms, and
      improve relationship functioning.

             with patient's clinician regarding treatment goals

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Spouse or partner also has an alcohol or drug problem as determined by P.I. based on
             report by patient or partner or as revealed on Alcohol Use Disorders Identification

             to domestic violence treatment. Couples who have experienced mild to moderate domestic
             violence may participate in Phase II of the study.
