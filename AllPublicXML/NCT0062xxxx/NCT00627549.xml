      Summary:

      Vaginal prolapse is a well-known disease and is observed in approximately 11% of all
      postmenopausal women and tending to increase with age. Consequently, many surgical procedures
      have been developed in order to ensure sufficient support for the bladder, rectum or vaginal
      vault depending on the site of the defect. However, many procedures are associated with a
      high recurrence rate up to 40 % even within one to two years after the surgical procedure.

      Due to the high recurrence rate new methods include the use of mesh, either biologically or
      synthetic. The latter is a permanent implant and therefore theoretically may result in a
      long-lasting anatomically correct position of the prolapse.

      Although the recurrence rate may be lower using a mesh such surgical procedures may be
      associated with adverse events such as erosions of the vaginal mucosa. Others have observed
      shrinkage of the vaginal mucosa. However, in these studies large prolene mesh have been used.
      In contrast the recurrence rate is lowered up to 25%.

      The above-mentioned advantage of synthetic mesh is however, mostly based on few
      non-randomised studies. We therefore find it of importance to evaluate whether a surgical
      procedure using a mesh implant is superior to conventional surgical techniques. The present
      study is a clinical controlled study where patients with anterior vaginal prolapse are
      randomised to either a mesh technique or a standard anterior procedure.

      The present study includes only two more visits at the outpatient clinic after the surgical
      procedure. Furthermore the patients have to fulfil questionnaires regarding urinary and
      faecal leakage and sexual habits.

      Any participation in the study is totally voluntary and the patient may at any time withdraw
      herself. In any case the patient will receive our standard treatment.

      The study is performed in all the Scandinavian countries.
