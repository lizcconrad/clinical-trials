  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that 18FDG Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) imaging, carried out after
      the first cycle of chemotherapy, will identify responders, thus permitting early termination
      of potential toxic therapy in non- responders leading to a significant decrease in morbidity
      and cost. The value of PET imaging as an early predictor of response to chemotherapy has been
      shown in other cancers.

    <description>The study will evaluate the potential of PET imaging to identify early responders to chemotherapy. Patients entered into this study will undergo FDG PET within 2 weeks prior to chemotherapy and prior to initiation of the second course of chemotherapy. All images will be carried out in the same manner with respect to equipment, acquisition parameters, and time post injection, to ensure that changes in standard uptake value(SUV) correlate with metabolic changes. This will be correlated with response determined by changes in serum CA 125 levels.</description>
