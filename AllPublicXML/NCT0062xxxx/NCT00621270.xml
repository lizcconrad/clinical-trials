      The purpose of this study is to determine whether BCI-540 80 mg given once daily (q.d.) or
      three times daily (t.i.d.) is effective in the treatment of major depression with concomitant
      anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BCI-540 has been shown to be neurogenic in the Sponsor's in vitro neural stem cell analyses
      and in vivo animal models of depression and anxiety. These observations and the recent
      findings linking hippocampal function and neurogenesis to mood disorders support the
      evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BCI-540 in patients with major
      depressive disorder with concomitant anxiety.
