  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a frequent inflammatory skin condition involving the pilosebaceous unit and
      affecting more than 80% of teenagers. Mild to moderate acne vulgaris is usually treated with
      topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, retinoids and antibiotics. These treatments can be
      associated with local tolerance problems and/or antibiotic resistance. Salicylic acid has
      been shown to be an effective treatment for acne. LHA is a lipophilic hydroxy acid derivative
      of salicylic acid that has comedolytic and antibacterial properties.

      The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerance of a cream formulation
      containing 0.3% LHA (LHA formulation) to a 5% benzoyl peroxide gel.

      This was a randomized clinical trial performed at two centers (Montreal and Laval, Quebec,
      Canada) under the direction of the same principal investigator. Eighty (80) subjects were
      enrolled in the study. Subjects were asked to report to the clinic for four visits (D0, D28,
      D56, D87). The LHA formulation was applied twice a day (morning and evening) and benzoyl
      peroxide was applied daily (evening) on a clean face for a total of 12 weeks.

      Efficacy was evaluated at day 28, 56 and 87. The number of papules, pustules, opened and
      closed comedones were counted at each visit by a blinded assessor. The overall efficacy was
      evaluated with a 4-point scale (no improvement, moderate, good and excellent) by the subject
      and the blinded assessor. Clinical examination included evaluation of sensitivity of the skin
      (presence of erythema and desquamation) by the investigator and of pruritus, tingling and
      burning sensation by subjects on a 4-point scale. Finally, the subject and the skin assessor
      both evaluated overall tolerance on a 4-point scale.
