  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study assessed the efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with Avastin
      (bevacizumab) + Xeloda (capecitabine), after initial treatment with Xeloda + oxaliplatin +
      Avastin, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomized into one of
      2 groups to receive 1) Xeloda + oxaliplatin + Avastin until disease progression or 2) Xeloda
      + oxaliplatin + Avastin for 6 3-week cycles, followed by Xeloda + Avastin until disease
      progression. Xeloda was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m^2 orally twice a day on days 1-14
      of each cycle, oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m^2 intravenously (iv) on day 1 of each cycle,
      and Avastin at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg iv on day 1 of each cycle.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years, 2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the first administration of study drug to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at Baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the Baseline sum longest diameter.</description>

    <description>A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. A partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the Baseline sum longest diameter. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at Baseline. All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the Baseline sum longest diameter.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the first administration of study drug to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at Baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the Baseline sum longest diameter.</description>
