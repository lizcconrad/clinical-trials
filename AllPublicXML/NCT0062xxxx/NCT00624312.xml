        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Undergoing a major surgical oncology procedure as defined below:

               -  Pancreatectomy

               -  Hepatectomy

               -  Esophagectomy

               -  Gastrectomy

               -  Retroperitoneal Sarcoma Resection

          -  18 years of age and older

          -  Hemoglobin level of ≥ 10g/dL to &lt; 13g/dL, within 10 days of enrollment

          -  If female of child-bearing potential, negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to
             surgery

          -  If subject is a sexually active male or a sexually active female of child- bearing
             potential, subject agrees to use a medically accepted form of contraception from the
             time of enrollment to completion of all follow-up study visits

          -  IRB-approved informed consent, signed by the subject or the subject's legally
             authorized representative ≥ 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-operative hemoglobin level ≥ 13g/dL or &lt; 10g/dL

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as a systolic pressure ≥ 160 and/or a diastolic
             pressure ≥ 110)

          -  History of allergy to Procrit®

          -  Known hypersensitivity to mammalian cell-derived products or human albumin

          -  History of spontaneous venous thrombotic vascular events

          -  Anemia due to factors other than cancer,(e.g. iron deficiency, B12 deficiency)

          -  History of (within 12 months) deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE), or
             other venous thrombotic events. Prior superficial thrombophlebitis is not an exclusion
             criterion

          -  History of (within 6 months) uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, cerebrovascular

             (QwMI), and non-Q wave myocardial infarction (NQMI)

          -  Currently receiving therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulants for conditions other
             than planned surgery. The only exceptions are low dose aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) or low
             dose anticoagulant to maintain patency of intravenous (IV) lines

          -  Patient is a candidate for autologous blood transfusion
