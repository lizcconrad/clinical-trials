      Objective is to characterize epidemiology, clinical and genetic features of Kallmann syndrome
      in Finland.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kallmann syndrome is comprised of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia
      (inability to smell). Associated phenotypes may include cryptorchidism, microphallus, bone
      deformations, mirror movements, hearing loss and infertility. Objective is to characterize
      epidemiology, clinical and genetic features of Kallmann syndrome in Finland.
