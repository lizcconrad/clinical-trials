  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational study of 102 women with Turner syndrome followed for 6 years with a
      two-yearly examination including ECHO, MRI of the heart and 24 ambulatory blood pressure. It
      has been found that besides an significantly increased risk of congenital cardiac
      malformations, TS have an increased risk of developing cardiac disease including the life
      threatening condition of aortic dilatation and rupture. The aim of the study is to describe
      the cardiac conditions of TS, evaluate different methods of examination and identify possible
      risc factors.
