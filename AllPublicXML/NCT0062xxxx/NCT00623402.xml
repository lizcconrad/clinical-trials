      This is a a prospective non-randomized, multicenter Phase II Study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of a combined treatment with Sorafenib (Nexavar®) and pegylated interferon-α-2b
      (PegIntron®) in patients with malignant melanoma in stage IV.

      The investigators will determine disease control rate (CR,PR,SD) after 8 weeks of treatment
      with pegylated interferon- α-2b (3 µg/kg body weight s.c. once a week) combined with
      Sorafenib 2x 400 mg (2 tablets orally, twice daily)
