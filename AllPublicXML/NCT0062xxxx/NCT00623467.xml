  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents called
      Gadavist. The purpose of this study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and
      efficacy (how well does it work) of Gadavist when used for taking images of the brain and
      spine. The results of the MRI will be compared to the results of images taken without
      Gadavist.

        <description>BR1 (reader 1 of 3) evaluated the images from the unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one session and the images from the combined unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced MRIs in another. Contrast enhancement was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no enhancement and 4 = excellent enhancement. Border delineation was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no or unclear delineation and 4 = excellent delineation. Internal morphology was scored on a 3-point scale where 1 = poorly visible and 3 = sufficiently visible.</description>

        <title>Scores for Three Visualization Parameters (Contrast Enhancement, Border Delineation and Internal Morphology) for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced MRI Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Clinical Investigator</title>
        <description>The clinical investigators evaluated the images from the unenhanced MRI in one session and the images from the combined unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced MRIs in another. Contrast enhancement was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no enhancement and 4 = excellent enhancement. Border delineation was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no or unclear delineation and 4 = excellent delineation. Internal morphology was scored on a 3-point scale where 1 = poorly visible and 3 = sufficiently visible. The data for &quot;contrast enhancement - unenhanced&quot; were not collected for the clinical investigators.</description>

        <title>Scores for Three Visualization Parameters (Contrast Enhancement, Border Delineation and Internal Morphology) for Lesions for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced MRI Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Blinded Reader 2 (BR2)</title>
        <description>BR2 (reader 2 of 3) evaluated the images from the unenhanced MRI in one session and the images from the combined unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced MRIs in another. Contrast enhancement was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no enhancement and 4 = excellent enhancement. Border delineation was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no or unclear delineation and 4 = excellent delineation. Internal morphology was scored on a 3-point scale where 1 = poorly visible and 3 = sufficiently visible.</description>

        <title>Scores for Three Visualization Parameters (Contrast Enhancement, Border Delineation and Internal Morphology) for Normal Structures for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced MRI Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Blinded Reader 1 (BR1)</title>
        <description>BR1 (reader 1 of 3) evaluated the images from the unenhanced MRI in one session and the images from the combined unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced MRIs in another.

Border delineation was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no or unclear delineation and 4 = excellent delineation. Internal morphology was scored on a 3-point scale where 1 = poorly visible and 3 = sufficiently visible.</description>

        <title>Scores for Three Visualization Parameters (Contrast Enhancement, Border Delineation and Internal Morphology) for Normal Structures for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced MRI Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Average Reader (AR)</title>
        <description>The AR analysis used the mean of the values for the 3 blinded readers. The 3 BRs evaluated the images from the unenhanced MRI in one session and the images from the combined unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced MRIs in another. Contrast enhancement was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no enhancement and 4 = excellent enhancement. Border delineation was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no or unclear delineation and 4 = excellent delineation. Internal morphology was scored on a 3-point scale where 1 = poorly visible and 3 = sufficiently visible.</description>

        <title>Scores for Three Visualization Parameters (Contrast Enhancement, Border Delineation and Internal Morphology) for Normal Structures for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced MRI Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Clinical Investigator</title>
        <description>The clinical investigators evaluated the images from the unenhanced MRI in one session and the images from the combined unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced MRIs in another. Contrast enhancement was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no enhancement and 4 = excellent enhancement. Border delineation was scored on a 4-point scale where 1 = no or unclear delineation and 4 = excellent delineation. Internal morphology was scored on a 3-point scale where 1 = poorly visible and 3 = sufficiently visible.</description>

          <title>Accuracy of Detection of Malignant Lesions (ML) for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced MRI Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Clinical Investigator</title>
          <description>The presence of malignant lesions was derived from the diagnoses given by the investigator on the evaluation of the unenhanced image set and the combined unenhanced/enhanced image sets. The final clinical diagnosis was provided by an independent truth committee following evaluation of findings from referral through a 3-month follow-up period, not including the study-specific MR image sets. Accuracy = percentage of participants for which the imaging modality (unenhanced or Gadobutrol-enhanced) matches the standard of truth for the presence or absence of malignant lesions.</description>
