      The purpose of the study is to develop a culturally appropriate DASH intervention and test
      the effectiveness of the intervention lower blood pressure in a group of African American
      participants at risk for developing hypertension (pre-hypertension) and those with mild
      hypertension (stage I).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has shown to
      have limited impact on blood pressure control among African Americans, which might be
      explained by inappropriate adaptation to African American culture and tradition. Therefore,
      the adequate adaptation of the DASH diet would result in blood pressure control among
      African-Americans. Using the nominal group technique as a part of the formative assessment,
      this project proposes to identify key cultural variables that impact dietary patterns for
      African Americans. Based on those results, a modified behavioral intervention will be
      developed and tested in African Americans with pre-hypertension or stage I hypertension.
      Primary outcomes will include change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at six months.
      It is expected that this project will contribute an additional tool for physicians, patients
      and health care systems to improve hypertension control amongst African Americans. The
      specific aims for this dietary intervention are: (1) to develop a modified DASH dietary
      pattern that is culturally appropriate for African-Americans by using principals of formative
      analysis and (2) to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of
      the modified DASH dietary pattern in reducing blood pressure for a cohort of
      African-Americans with pre-hypertension or stage I hypertension to a usual care control
      group.
