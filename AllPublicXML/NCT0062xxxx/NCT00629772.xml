  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palmoplantar psoriasis is a variant of psoriasis affecting palms and soles. It is one of the
      most debilitating variants of psoriasis which very often interferes with daily activities and
      with the ability to work. This type of psoriasis is very difficult to treat as topicals have
      difficulty penetrating the thick epidermis of palms and soles and are therefore not very
      effective. The response to standard agents (methotrexate, cyclosporine and acitretin) is also
      usually limited. A number of these patients have very severe hand and feet disease with mild
      to no involvement elsewhere on the body.

      Given the efficacy of infliximab in psoriasis, the purpose of this study is to evaluate if
      infliximab is safe and if it will improve severity and quality of life in patients with
      palmoplantar psoriasis, a debilitating variant of psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 patients with non-pustular palmoplantar psoriasis affecting at least 10% of the
      combined palms and soles area and with a modified palmoplantar pustulosis area severity index
      (m-PPPASI) of at least 8 will be recruited. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive
      either infliximab 5 mg/kg or placebo (normal saline) on weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients assigned
      to placebo during the first 3 infusions will receive infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 14, 16 and
      20 and placebo again at week 22 while patients who were assigned to receive infliximab during
      the first 3 infusions will receive infliximab at week 14 and placebo at week 16 and week 20
      as well as infliximab for the last infusion at week 22. The primary endpoint will be at week
      14. Patients will come back to the clinic at week 26 for a final efficacy and safety
      assessment.

      Efficacy will be evaluated by assessing psoriasis plaque severity on palms and soles
      (physician's global assessment PGA), percentage of palms and soles area affected by psoriasis
      (palmoplantar surface area - PPSA) as well as m-PPPASI (modified palmoplantar pustulosis area
      and severity index). Quality of life will be evaluated at every visit by performing the
      dermatology life quality index DLQI. Safety will be evaluated by repeating chemistry and
      haematology laboratories at regular visits as well as by physical examinations and assessment
      of adverse events.

    <description>Efficacy by comparing the number of patients reaching a 75% improvement in m-PPPASI (m-PPPASI 75) m-PPPASI = (E + I + D)Area X 0.2 (R palm) + (E + I + D) Area X 0.2 (L palm) + (E + I + D) Area X 0.3 (R sole) + (E + I + D) Area X 0.3 (L sole).
Erythema, induration and desquamation are evaluated on a scale of 0 to 4 while area is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 6. The m-PPPASI score can vary from 0 (absence of disease) to 72 (most severe palmoplantar psoriasis possible).</description>

    <description>Efficacy by comparing the mean percent PPSA. The surface affected by psoriasis on palms and soles is estimated on the day of the visit as a percentage of the total surface of palms and soles affected by psoriasis. Each palm represents 20% and each sole 30%. As a rule of thumb half a palm equals 10% of the total surface area of palm and soles. A sole completely covered with psoriasis would have a PPSA of 30% (if the other sole and the palms are unaffected) while a palm completely covered with psoriasis would have a PPSA of 20% (if the other palm and the soles are unaffected).</description>

          <description>Efficacy by comparing the mean percent PPSA. The surface affected by psoriasis on palms and soles is estimated on the day of the visit as a percentage of the total surface of palms and soles affected by psoriasis. Each palm represents 20% and each sole 30%. As a rule of thumb half a palm equals 10% of the total surface area of palm and soles. A sole completely covered with psoriasis would have a PPSA of 30% (if the other sole and the palms are unaffected) while a palm completely covered with psoriasis would have a PPSA of 20% (if the other palm and the soles are unaffected).</description>

The surface affected by psoriasis on palms and soles is estimated on the day of the visit as a percentage of the total surface of palms and soles affected by psoriasis. Each palm represents 20% and each sole 30%. As a rule of thumb half a palm equals 10% of the total surface area of palm and soles. A sole completely covered with psoriasis would have a PPSA of 30% (if the other sole and the palms are unaffected) while a palm completely covered with psoriasis would have a PPSA of 20% (if the other palm and the soles are unaffected).</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Improvement in Palmoplantar Psoriasis Surface Area (PPSA) at Week 26</title>
        <description>Efficacy of infliximab administered for 22 weeks in patients who received infliximab at Day 0 by evaluating the improvement over time in percent PPSA from Day 0 to Week 26. The surface affected by psoriasis on palms and soles is estimated on the day of the visit as a percentage of the total surface of palms and soles affected by psoriasis. Each palm represents 20% and each sole 30%. As a rule of thumb half a palm equals 10% of the total surface area of palm and soles.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the intent to treat (ITT) population and the imputation technique was last observation carried forward (LOCF).</population>
