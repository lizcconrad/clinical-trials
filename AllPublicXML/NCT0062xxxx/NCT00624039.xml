  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in the pilocarpine-induced ciliary
      body movement before and after cataract extraction in order to determine the effect of lens
      sclerosis on the ciliary muscle contractility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The functional changes in the ciliary body in presbyopia are not only important in a study of
      the mechanism for presbyopia but are also a key to various procedures or devices used to
      restore accommodation. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to quantify the in
      vivo accommodative changes in the aging ciliary muscle with and without a lens. We are going
      to evaluate the changes in the pilocarpine-induced contractility of the ciliary muscle in
      eyes with presbyopia before and after cataract extraction using ultrasound biomicroscopy
      (UBM).UBM will be performed with and without instilling 2 % pilocarpine, as well as before
      and 2 months after cataract extraction. Images of the ciliary body will be compared visually
      using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.
