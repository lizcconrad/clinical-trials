      Comparison on the effect on patient pain and discomfort by using CO2 instead of air for
      insufflation during gastroscopy.

      To achieve a satisfactory examination of the GI tract it needs to be distended during
      endoscopic procedures. After the examinations many patients complain of abdominal pain and
      discomfort. This pain has been substantially reduced by substituting room air with CO2 in
      both colonoscopies and ERCPs. The use of CO2 during colonoscopy has become routine practice
      at many endoscopy centers.

      In our study we will test the hypothesis that abdominal pain after gastroscopies also can be
      reduced by substituting room air with CO2.
