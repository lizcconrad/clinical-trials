      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the sorafenib-induced hypophosphatemia and
           possible early effect of hypophosphatemia on bone mineral density

        2. A secondary objective to assess the effect sorafenib treatment on evaluate left
           ventricular function (LVEF) and Beta-type natriuretic peptide in plasma.
