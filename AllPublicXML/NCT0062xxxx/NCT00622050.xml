  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific objectives of this project are to:

        1. Investigate the effects of reducing TV viewing time on energy intake, eating behavior,
           and energy expenditure in overweight or obese adult subjects, thus providing a basis for
           evaluating if reducing TV viewing time might be a useful adjunct therapy in obesity
           prevention and treatment

        2. Analyze the types of foods eaten in conjunction with TV viewing

        3. Determine if there is an association between location of TV and BMI.
