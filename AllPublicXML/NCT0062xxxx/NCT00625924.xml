      The goal of the study is measure breast sensations after breast surgery. The results of this
      study will help surgeons better understand breast sensations and may improve the way surgery
      is done.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The Samples used will be derived from three cohorts below and will only include
             patients who have completed mastectomy or reconstruction within 1-5 years of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients who have undergone immediate, two-stage expander/implant postmastectomy
             reconstruction

          -  Patients who have undergone immediate, autogenous tissue flap reconstruction following
             mastectomy

          -  Patients who have undergone mastectomy alone

          -  Patients at least 21 years of age

          -  Patients who completed mastectomy ± immediate post-mastectomy reconstruction at least
             one year but no longer than five years prior to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had any of the following:

          -  delayed reconstruction (no reconstruction at time of surgery) combined autogenous
             tissue/implant breast reconstruction, and/or

          -  Patients who have a pre-surgical history of complex regional pain syndrome

          -  Patients who have had radiation therapy

          -  Patients who have had a local recurrence

          -  Patients who do not speak the English language (validated translations of key
