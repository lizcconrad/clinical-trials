      Rationale: Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a life threatening
      disease with a high mortality rate. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) with
      veno-arterial (V-A) or veno-venous (V-V) cannulation can provide a last treatment option.
      Differences in circulatory changes between V-A and V-V ECMO concerning the course of PPHN and
      organ perfusion are not known. Independent of the underlying disease, courses of ECMO runs
      (with both systems) may differ a lot. Impairment of pulmonary and renal function and oedema
      is frequently seen. Mechanisms that may play a role are not well understood yet. A better
      understanding of hemodynamic changes in systemic and pulmonary circulation during treatment
      of PPHN with ECMO as well as consecutive changes in organ perfusion and function will help to
      develop more rationalistic treatment strategies to accelerate the recovery to a normal
      neonatal circulation and shorten ECMO treatment. This will reveal positive effects for
      patients as well as favourable effects on economic aspects for this very intensive treatment.

      Primary objective: I.Evaluation of changes in pulmonary and systemic circulation during VV-
      ECMO treatment and difference between V-V- and V-A ECMO Secondary objectives:II.Evaluation of
      changes in cerebral, renal and mesenterial organ perfusion during ECMO treatment and
      difference between V-V- and V-A ECMO III.Evaluation of hemodynamic changes during ECMO
      treatment in relation to renal function and difference between V-V- and V-A ECMO
      IV.Evaluation of BNP as diagnostic parameter regarding fluid homeostasis during ECMO
      treatment and difference between V-V- and V-A ECMO Study design: observational; including two
      cohorts. The first cohort consists of a group of patients that have been evaluated in a
      former study, exclusively treated with V-A ECMO. The second cohort of patients will
      prospectively include patients receiving V-V as well as V-A ECMO. A study period:2 and a half
      years. All consecutively admitted patients for ECMO treatment at the department of
      neonatology of the RUNMC will be evaluated for inclusion into the study. Study population:
      Inclusion: Newborn infants with gestational age older than 34 weeks and reversible causes of
      PPHN eligible for ECMO treatment. Exclusion:Newborn infants with congenital diaphragmatic
      hernia, other congenital malformations and post-cardiosurgery.

      Intervention: Standard treatment following the ECMO protocol of the department; evaluation at
      standard intervals starting directly before cannulation for ECMO until 24 hours after
      decannulation:registration of hemodynamic variables,parameters for organ perfusion using
      echocardiography and Doppler sonography, blood and urine sampling and registration of
      physiological and patient data.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Assessment of:Hemodynamic changes in pulmonary and systemic
      circulation Secondary and other parameters/endpoints:

      Assessment of:Changes in cerebral, renal and mesenterial blood flow, renal function in
      relation hemodynamic changes,BNP in relation to fluid homeostasis
