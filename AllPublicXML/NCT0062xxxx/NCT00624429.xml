    <textblock>
      The Early Head Start program serves lower socioeconomic inner-city children from birth to 3
      years. This population has a higher incidence of asthma due to increased exposures. The
      primary objective of this study is:

      To evaluate the effect of early identification of these high risk, inner-city asthmatic
      infants, age 1-3 years, and early treatment with pulmicort respules on asthma morbidity
      (asthma symptoms and use of rescue medications), infant pulmonary functions, and use of
      health care resources (unscheduled clinic visits, emergency room visits and
      hospitalizations).

      To obtain pilot behavior information using Carey Temperament Scale, Bitsea and expand to
      Itsea if indicated.
