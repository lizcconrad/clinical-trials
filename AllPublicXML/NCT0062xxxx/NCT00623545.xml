    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how exenatide causes weight loss. Specifically, the
      study is assessing how exenatide may change how people take in energy (energy intake), as
      well as how it may effect how people use energy (energy expenditure).

    <textblock>
      The bioenergetics study is looking at how and why the diabetes drug exenatide causes people
      to lose weight.Bioenergetics is the study of how your body burns calories.

      Adults 18-65 who do not have diabetes and have a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 may
      be eligible. Women who could get pregnant must be on birth control during the study and women
      who are pregnant cannot participate in the study.

      Subjects will take exenatide for 12 weeks. There are 6 study visits in the Univ. Wisconsin
      Hospital General Clinical Research Center. Visits range from 1 to 6 hours and include blood
      and urine tests, resting metabolic rate testing over a four hour period, physical exam, ECG,
      and a be bone mineral density testing at another clinic during 2 clinic visits of the study.

      All study procedures and testing are free of charge.

            <groups_desc>Previously published literature showed an average weight loss of 1.8 kg at 12 weeks of exenatide treatment. This was converted to differ- ence in TEE, estimating an average imbalance of 2 kg × 7800 kcal·kg–1 divided by 84 days or 185 kcal·day–1.We demonstrated an average reproducibility of the DLW method of 6% or 240 kcal·day–1. For a 5% probability of finding this difference with a power of 80%, we determined a need for 14 subjects to complete the study.</groups_desc>
