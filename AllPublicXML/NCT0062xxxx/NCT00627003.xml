      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cabergoline compared with
      placebo on periodic leg movements (PLMS) arousl index and sleep efficiency in patients with
      RLS. Also, additional objective and subjective sleep parameters and quality of life will be
      assessed.
