    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to define preferential sites of tumour recurrence by observing tracer
      uptake in the tumour in sequential PET images with 18F-fluoromethylcholine (and perfusion MR,
      see also below). Changes in the intensity of the tracer uptake in the tumour during and after
      the course of radiotherapy will be correlated with the site of tumour recurrence as will be
      assessed by conventional MRI. In due time, these results must enable clinicians to change
      their therapeutic approach of high-grade glioma.
