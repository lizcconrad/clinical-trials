    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in
      treating patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by stopping blood
      flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety and efficacy of GW786034 (pazopanib hydrochloride) as a
      therapeutic in patients afflicted with differentiated, medullary and anaplastic thyroid
      cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of the impact of therapy with GW786034 on serum/plasma vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) levels.

      II. To explore the potential relationship between changes in thyroglobulin levels and tumor
      response in patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer known to be thyroglobulin
      antibody negative.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years after registration.

             potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes cytochrome P450, family 2,
             subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A,
             polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4); certain other agents should be used with caution

             swallow and retain GSK786034 (pazopanib)

          -  Known active and/or untreated brain metastases and/or brain metastases requiring
             ongoing therapy (e.g. corticosteroids); NOTE: (because of the poor prognosis often
             associated with brain metastases and because of the potential risk of bleeding in
             active brain metastases associated with multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
             therapy, patients with active and/or untreated brain metastases and/or those with
             brain metastases requiring ongoing therapy - e.g. corticosteroids - are excluded from
             trial enrollment; enrollment will, however, be permitted in cases of patients with
             longstanding treated and inactive brain metastases not requiring ongoing therapy,
             providing that stability of brain metastases has been demonstrated for a period of 3
             months or greater as assessed by intracranial imaging - and providing that there is no
             indication of increased vascularity of the treated metastases by magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) imaging conducted =&lt; 14 days prior to registration; when questions arise
             related to these criteria, the PI of the trial, Dr. Keith Bible, should be contacted

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would or might reasonably be
             expected to limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women; NOTE: (breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with GW786034/pazopanib)

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy; NOTE: (appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated)

          -  Receiving any medications or substances known to affect or with the potential to
             affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of GW786034 (pazopanib); NOTE: the eligibility
             of patients will be determined following review of their case by the principal
             investigator; efforts should be made to switch patients who are taking enzyme-inducing
             anticonvulsant agents to other medications

          -  Receiving any concomitant medications that are associated with a risk of QTc
             prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes; NOTE: these medications should be
