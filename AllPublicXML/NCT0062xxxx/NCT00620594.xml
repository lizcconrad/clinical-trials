  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, phase I/Ib clinical research study with BEZ235, an inhibitor of
      phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K). The study consists of a dose escalation part followed
      by a safety dose expansion part:

      Dose escalation part (advanced solid tumors, including patients with breast cancer being
      treated with trastuzumab):

      Patients receive oral BEZ235 once daily on days 1-28 of the first course. Courses will repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of BEZ235, as single agent or in
      combination with trastuzumab, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose expected to produce during the first course of treatment dose-limiting
      toxicity in 33% of patients.

      Once the MTD has been defined, the safety expansion parts of the trial will be opened for
      enrollment.

      Safety dose expansion part (advanced solid tumors, including patients with breast cancer
      being treated with trastuzumab):

      Patients will be treated with BEZ235, as single agent or in combination with trastuzumab,
      given at the MTD, once daily. Treatment of patients will continue until disease progression
      or occurrence of unacceptable side effects.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        [Single agent dose escalation arm]: Patients with histologically-confirmed, advanced
        unresectable solid tumors including CS patients who have progressed on (or not been able to
        tolerate) standard therapy within three months before screening visit or for whom no
        standard anticancer therapy exists.

        [Combination part]: Patients with metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer, after failure of
        trastuzumab treatment. Eligible patients will have to have tumors carrying molecular
        alterations of PIK3CA and/or PTEN.

        standard anticancer therapy exists. Patients will be prescreened for molecular alterations
        affecting PIK3CA and/or PTEN. Patients with NSCLC will also be pre-screened for EGFR
        mutation.
