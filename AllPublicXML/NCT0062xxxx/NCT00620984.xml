  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactation (breastfeeding) mastitis is an acute infection of the milk ducts of the
      breastfeeding woman. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the infectious germ most commonly
      associated with lactation mastitis. Twenty percent of the general population are carriers of
      Staphylococcus aureus, which means that they carry the infectious germ but do not become ill
      from it. It has been suggested that mothers who are carriers of S. aureus in their nostril
      may be at an increased risk of developing lactational mastitis, however; this has not been
      clinical proven.

      We are studying the relationship between S. aureus carrier status of breastfeeding mothers
      and infants and the risk of developing lactational mastitis. Additionally, we are collecting
      questionnaire data in an attempt to better define factors predisposing women to lactation
      mastitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lactation mastitis is an acute inflammation of the interlobular connective tissue within the
      mammary gland of a breastfeeding woman. It is a relatively common condition that causes pain
      and worry, and can lead to restriction in activity and increased risk of early weaning from
      breastfeeding. Staphylococcus aureus is the infectious agent most commonly implicated in
      lactation mastitis.

      It is well established that the anterior nares are the primary reservoir of S. aureus in
      humans and that approximately 20% of healthy individuals are &quot;persistent carriers&quot; of the
      organism. Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus has been identified as a significant risk factor
      for the development of infection including surgical wound infections. It has been suggested
      that maternal and infant nasal carriage of S. aureus may be associated with an increased risk
      of breast infection during lactation.

      We propose to prospectively study the relationship between the S. aureus carrier status of
      500 healthy breastfeeding dyads and the rate of the subsequent development of lactational
      mastitis. Carrier status of mothers and infants will be determined through two nasal
      swabbings performed in the early post-partum period. The swabs will be analyzed with both
      traditional culture and through Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification analysis.
      Mastitis rate will be determined via serial follow-up telephone interviews during the first
      two months post-partum.
