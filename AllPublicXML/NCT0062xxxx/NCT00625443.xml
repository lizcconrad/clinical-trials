  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of AKR-501 (avatrombopag)
      administered in participants with chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) who were
      enrolled into and completed 28 days of study treatment in Protocol 501-CL-003 (NCT00441090).

      Participants eligible to enroll into this rollover protocol will begin study treatment within
      2-5 days of their Day 28 study termination visit in Protocol 501-CL-003 (NCT00441090).
      Participants who met the primary efficacy response criterion in Protocol 501-CL-003 will
      continue receiving the same study treatment to which they were assigned in the previous
      protocol in a double-blinded manner, these being one of the following 5 treatments:

        -  avatrombopag 2.5 mg daily

        -  avatrombopag 5 mg daily

        -  avatrombopag 10 mg daily

        -  avatrombopag 20 mg daily

        -  placebo

      Participants who did not meet the primary efficacy response criterion in Protocol 501-CL-003
      who otherwise meet the eligibility criteria for this rollover protocol will be offered open
      label avatrombopag 10 mg daily.

      This is a parallel group, rollover study.

    <description>A TEAE was defined as 1) the AE started on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or 2) the AE started before the first dose of study drug but worsened in severity on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 3 days after the last dose of study drug. For participants having a tapering period of study drug, the last dose day is the last day of study drug during the tapering period. Related AEs included those whose relationship was categorized as possible or probably by the investigator. Dose interruption includes dose decreased, dose previously stopped, permanently stopped, or temporarily stopped. The safety population was divided into three subgroups based on the mean daily dose of active study drug taken; lower 1/3 (less than 8.85 mg avatrombopag), middle 1/3 (greater than or equal to 8.85 mg but less than 13.5 mg avatrombopag), and upper 1/3 (greater than or equal to 13.5 mg avatrombopag).</description>

    <description>Platelet count (PC) was measured from blood draws. Based on avatrombopag response in study 501-CL-003, participants were divided into two subgroups; 1) &quot;Responders&quot;, participants who met the primary efficacy response; pretreatment PC was less than 30,000/mm^3 and increased to greater than or equal to 50,000/mm^3 after treatment with avatrombopag, and for participants on steroids, pretreatment PC was greater than or equal to 30,000/mm3 but less than 50,000/mm^3 and increased to a PC greater than or equal to 20,000/mm^3 above their pretreatment values and 2) &quot;Nonresponders&quot;, participants who did not meet the primary efficacy response and those who were in the placebo arm. Open-label dose escalation of avatrombopag, as well as reductions in ITP-directed concomitant therapy (e.g. steroids) was allowed for all participants. During the periods of avatrombopag dose escalation and/or ITP-directed concomitant medication reduction, platelet sampling was done weekly.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>After Protocol Amendment 4, this study implemented a flexible dose regimen and was considered to have an open-label, uncontrolled, single-arm design. Due to these limitations in study design, a single grouping method with 3 subgroups was implemented for reporting participant disposition.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as 1) the AE started on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or 2) the AE started before the first dose of study drug but worsened in severity on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 3 days after the last dose of study drug. For participants having a tapering period of study drug, the last dose day is the last day of study drug during the tapering period. Related AEs included those whose relationship was categorized as possible or probably by the investigator. Dose interruption includes dose decreased, dose previously stopped, permanently stopped, or temporarily stopped. The safety population was divided into three subgroups based on the mean daily dose of active study drug taken; lower 1/3 (less than 8.85 mg avatrombopag), middle 1/3 (greater than or equal to 8.85 mg but less than 13.5 mg avatrombopag), and upper 1/3 (greater than or equal to 13.5 mg avatrombopag).</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 through Month 6 while receiving treatment and at Month 7 after discontinuation of treatment.</time_frame>
        <population>Safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-treatment safety assessment. The term &quot;post-treatment&quot; refers to any assessment timepoint after the participant received at least one dose of study drug.</population>

        <title>Incidence of Severe (Grade 3 or 4) TEAEs</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as 1) the AE started on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 30 days after the last dose of drug, or 2) the AE started before the first dose of study drug but worsened in severity on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 3 days after the last dose of study drug. For participants having a tapering period of study drug, the last dose day is the last day of study drug during the tapering period. The safety population was divided into three subgroups based on the mean daily dose of active study drug taken; lower 1/3 (less than 8.85 mg avatrombopag), middle 1/3 (greater than or equal to 8.85 mg but less than 13.5 mg avatrombopag), and upper 1/3 (greater than or equal to 13.5 mg avatrombopag).</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 through Month 6 while receiving treatment and at Month 7 after discontinuation of treatment.</time_frame>
        <population>Safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-treatment safety assessment. The term &quot;post-treatment&quot; refers to any assessment timepoint after the participant received at least one dose of study drug.</population>

Grouping of avatrombopag dose into lower 1/3, middle 1/3, and upper 1/3 was based on the average daily dose received during the combined active treatment periods of studies 501-CL-003 and 501-CL-004.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Drug-Related TEAEs</title>
        <description>Drug-related TEAEs included those whose relationship was categorized as possible or probably by the investigator. A TEAE was defined as 1) the AE started on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 30 days after the last dose of drug, or 2) the AE started before the first dose of study drug but worsened in severity on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to and including 3 days after the last dose of study drug. For participants having a tapering period of study drug, the last dose day is the last day of study drug during the tapering period. The safety population was divided into three subgroups based on the mean daily dose of active study drug taken; lower 1/3 (less than 8.85 mg avatrombopag), middle 1/3 (greater than or equal to 8.85 mg but less than 13.5 mg avatrombopag), and upper 1/3 (greater than or equal to 13.5 mg avatrombopag).</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 through Month 6 while receiving treatment and at Month 7 after discontinuation of treatment.</time_frame>
        <population>Safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-treatment safety assessment. The term &quot;post-treatment&quot; refers to any assessment timepoint after the participant received at least one dose of study drug.</population>

        <title>Median Platelet Counts at Selected Analysis Timepoints</title>
        <description>Platelet count (PC) was measured from blood draws. Based on avatrombopag response in study 501-CL-003, participants were divided into two subgroups; 1) &quot;Responders&quot;, participants who met the primary efficacy response; pretreatment PC was less than 30,000/mm^3 and increased to greater than or equal to 50,000/mm^3 after treatment with avatrombopag, and for participants on steroids, pretreatment PC was greater than or equal to 30,000/mm3 but less than 50,000/mm^3 and increased to a PC greater than or equal to 20,000/mm^3 above their pretreatment values and 2) “Nonresponders&quot;, participants who did not meet the primary efficacy response and those who were in the placebo arm. Open-label dose escalation of avatrombopag, as well as reductions in ITP-directed concomitant therapy (e.g. steroids) was allowed for all participants. During the periods of avatrombopag dose escalation and/or ITP-directed concomitant medication reduction, platelet sampling was done weekly.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, and Follow-up Weeks (after last dose of study drug in this study) 1, 2, 3, 4</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set (FAS) included all participants who completed 501-CL-003 and received study drug in the current study, except baseline values and ITP-directed medications taken during the 2-week period before the first dose of avatrombopag in the current study. Data was summarized using the observed case (OC) method.</population>

            <title>Responders</title>
            <description>Participants continued on their previous blinded dose in study 501-CL-003 at entry into this study. These blinded doses were: avatrombopag 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. The maximum possible escalated dose was a total dose of assigned double-blind avatrombopag plus an additional 20 mg/day open-label avatrombopag. Grouping Method B of dividing participants into Responders and Non-Responders was based on both treatment received and Day 28 platelet response to study drug in study 501-CL-004.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Platelet Count of 100,000/mm^3 or Higher by Response Status and Selected Study Visit</title>
        <description>Platelet count (PC) was measured from blood draws. Based on avatrombopag response in study 501-CL-003, participants were divided into two subgroups; 1) &quot;Responders&quot;, participants who met the primary efficacy response; pretreatment PC was less than 30,000/mm^3 and increased to greater than or equal to 50,000/mm^3 after treatment with avatrombopag, and for participants on steroids, pretreatment PC was greater than or equal to 30,000/mm^3 but less than 50,000/mm^3 and increased to a PC greater than or equal to 20,000/mm^3 above their pretreatment values and 2) “Nonresponders&quot;, participants who did not meet the primary efficacy response and those who were in the placebo arm. Open-label dose escalation of avatrombopag, as well as reductions in ITP-directed concomitant therapy (e.g. steroids) was allowed for all participants. During the periods of avatrombopag dose escalation and/or ITP-directed concomitant medication reduction, platelet sampling was done weekly.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Response-Level Platelet Count</title>
        <description>Platelet count (PC) was measured from blood draws. Based on avatrombopag response in study 501-CL-003, participants were divided into two subgroups; 1) &quot;Responders&quot;, participants who met the primary efficacy response; pretreatment PC was less than 30,000/mm^3 and increased to greater than or equal to 50,000/mm^3 after treatment with avatrombopag, and for participants on steroids, pretreatment PC was greater than or equal to 30,000/mm^3 but less than 50,000/mm^3 and increased to a PC greater than or equal to 20,000/mm^3 above their pretreatment values and 2) “Nonresponders&quot;, participants who did not meet the primary efficacy response and those who were in the placebo arm. Open-label dose escalation of avatrombopag, as well as reductions in ITP-directed concomitant therapy (e.g. steroids) was allowed for all participants. During the periods of avatrombopag dose escalation and/or ITP-directed concomitant medication reduction, platelet sampling was done weekly.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (last PC before first dose of study drug in previous study), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and Follow-up Weeks (after last dose of study drug in this study) 1, 2, 3, 4</time_frame>

            <description>Participants continued on their previous blinded dose in study 501-CL-003 at entry into this study. These blinded doses were: avatrombopag 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. The maximum possible escalated dose was a total dose of assigned double-blind avatrombopag plus an additional 20 mg/day open-label avatrombopag. Grouping Method B of dividing participants into Responders and Non-Responders was based on both treatment received and Day 28 platelet response to study drug in study 501-CL-004.</description>
