  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a debilitating pathology resulting from pressure and shear in the
      soft tissues of immobilized patients. In studies to date, BION neuromuscular stimulation has
      been demonstrated to activate strong muscle contractions and to produce skeletal motion, with
      associated increases in muscle bulk (hypertrophy), strength, and metabolic capacity, hence
      counteracting the 3 major etiological factors in PU development (immobility, soft-tissue
      atrophy and hypoxia).

      This study intends to use neuromuscular stimulation to both shift paralyzed subjects' weight
      and build up gluteal muscle volume, in order to prevent recurrence of pressure ulcers. We
      will implant BIONs alongside the already exposed inferior gluteal and sciatic nerves in
      patients who are undergoing gluteal rotation flap surgery for PU reconstruction. The gluteal
      rotation flap is a common reconstructive technique for treating PUs by bringing healthy
      muscle and skin in to repair the deficient area, and to provide healthy tissue covering over
      bony prominences. The implanted BIONs will enable us subsequently to stimulate the gluteus
      maximus and hip extensor muscles. Outcome measures will include tissue health variables
      (measured by clinical assessment, X-Rays, MRI and Sesta-MIBI SPECT perfusion scans), pressure
      redistribution (measured by an array of pressure sensors), and recurrence rates over 12
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has had a spinal cord injury and has bilateral lower limb paralysis.

          2. Subject cannot contract his/her gluteus muscle voluntarily.

          3. Subject is between 18 and 70 years old.

          4. Subject sits in a wheelchair for at least 5 hours per day.

          5. Attending physician considers the subject in general good health (other than SCI and
             PU wound).

          6. Subject has one or more PUs of Stage III or IV (according to National Pressure Ulcer
             Advisory Panel Staging1).

          7. Subject is having a musculocutaneous (not cutaneous or fasciocutaneous) gluteal
             rotation flap surgery for PU treatment in which the inferior gluteal pedicle and
             sciatic nerve will be exposed but not damaged or sacrificed in any way (for any PU
             wound(s)).

          8. Subject is mentally capable of understanding the goals and the application of therapy.

          9. Subject is able to apply the therapy (with or without help) once discharged from
             Rancho Los Amigos.

         10. Subject is willing and capable of giving informed consent.

         11. Subject is willing and capable of traveling to testing center at the schedules.

          1. Subject has a positive pregnancy test, is nursing / lactating, or is planning on
             becoming pregnant or is unwilling to not become pregnant in the next 12 months.
