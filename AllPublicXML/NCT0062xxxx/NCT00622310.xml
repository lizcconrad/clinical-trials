  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed at determining whether an exercise-based weight loss intervention
      causes a compensation in some component of energy expenditure such that the increase in
      measured energy expenditure is less than the added exercise. The study will compare two
      separate exercise interventions to determine if this is influenced by exercise intensity.

      The primary aim of this proposed study is to determine how total daily activity thermogenesis
      (TDAT) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) are regulated in obese humans attempting to
      lose weight and maintain weight loss through exercise. Two exercise interventions will be
      compared; a structured aerobic exercise program and a walking program. exercise activity
      thermogenesis (EAT) will be verified, and non-exercise physical activity (NEAT), total daily
      activity thermogenesis (TDAT), and TDEE will be measured using state-of-the-art technologies.
      Subjects will be studied during a 6 month intervention period and then during a 6 month
      follow-up period. It is hypothesized that the walking program will have more favorable
      effects on TDAT and TDEE during both the intervention and follow-up periods. If the
      investigators hypotheses are correct, then data from the proposed study could be used to
      improve the effectiveness of exercise-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance programs.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in the EX group will perform supervised exercise 5 d/wk. Exercise will consist primarily of walking on an inclined motor-driven treadmill, but alternate activities will be permitted for 20% of the total exercise sessions (1 of 5 days). Exercise sessions will be preceded by a 5 min warm-up performed at a HR corresponding to 40% of VO2max. The initial exercise duration and intensity at baseline will be 20 minutes at an intensity that elicits a heart rate (HR) corresponding to 60% of VO2max. The target EE will be achieved by a gradual progression of exercise duration and intensity over the first 8 weeks of the exercise program. The target exercise intensity will be the workload corresponding to 75% of VO2max.</description>

    <arm_group_label>2 Walk</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in the WALK group will also perform exercise 5 d/wk. Exercise will consist exclusively of walking on level grades, and will be prescribed in two equal duration bouts each day. Subjects in the WALK group will be individually prescribed a walking program based on the EE during moderate intensity walking. The target exercise intensity will be walking speeds corresponding 45% of VO2max.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to either a structured, vigorous-intensity endurance exercise training program or an intermittent, low-intensity exercise program. Individualized exercise prescriptions will be designed to target an increase of 2500 kcal/wk, and the theoretical weight loss will be approximately 15 pounds (~6.8 kg) during the 6 month intervention.</description>
