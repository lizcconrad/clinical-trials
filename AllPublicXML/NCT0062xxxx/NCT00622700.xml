    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to demonstrate the effect of teriflunomide (HMR1726) (14 milligram
      per day [mg/day] and 7 mg/day), in comparison to placebo, for reducing conversion of
      participants presenting with their first clinical episode consistent with multiple sclerosis
      (MS) to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS).

      The secondary objectives were:

        -  To demonstrate the effect of teriflunomide, in comparison to placebo, on:

             -  Reducing conversion to definite multiple sclerosis (DMS)

             -  Reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR)

             -  Reducing disease activity/progression as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging
                (MRI)

             -  Reducing accumulation of disability for at least 12 weeks as measured by the
                Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)

             -  Proportion of disability-free participants as assessed by the EDSS

             -  Reducing participant-reported fatigue

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of teriflunomide

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of teriflunomide

        -  Optional pharmacogenomic testing aimed at assessing the association between the main
           enzyme systems of teriflunomide metabolism and hepatic safety, and other potential
           associations between gene variations and clinical outcomes

      The study consisted of 4 periods:

        -  Screening period: up to 4 weeks,

        -  Placebo-controlled treatment period: up to 108 weeks (at least 24 weeks for participants
           who experienced conversion to CDMS),

        -  Extension treatment period (without placebo-control): the extension period continued
           until teriflunomide was commercially available in participant's country of residence.

        -  Post-treatment washout period: 4 weeks after last treatment intake.

      The maximal duration of the study period per participant was expected to be 116 weeks if
      he/she did not continue in the extension treatment period.

    <measure>Core Treatment Period: Time to Conversion to Clinically Deﬁnite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to a maximum of 108 weeks depending on time of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Conversion to CDMS was defined by the occurrence of a relapse, which was defined as a new neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event, presented for at least 24 hours and occurred in the absence of fever or known infection. Percent probability of conversion at 24, 48, and 108 weeks was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Core Treatment Period: Time to Conversion to Definite Multiple Sclerosis (DMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to a maximum of 108 weeks depending on time of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Conversion to DMS was demonstrated by dissemination of MRI lesions in time (as per McDonald criteria) or a relapse, whichever occurs first. MRI Imaging criteria were detection of Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement at least 3 months after onset of initial clinical event, if not at site corresponding to initial event; detection of new T2 lesion if it appears at any time compared with reference scan (done at time of screening) done at least 30 days after onset of the initial clinical event. Occurrence of relapse was defined as new neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from onset of preceding clinical event, present for at least 24 hours and occurring in absence of fever or known infection. New clinical abnormality (neurological sign) that is consistent with participant's symptoms with increase in at least one Functional System (FS) or EDSS score compared to last EDSS assessment. Percent probability of conversion at 24, 48, and 108 weeks was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Core Treatment Period: Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to a maximum of 108 weeks depending on time of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>ARR is the total number of confirmed relapses that occurred during the treatment period divided by the total number of patient-years treated. Each episode of relapse (appearance, or worsening of a clinical symptom that was stable for at least 30 days, that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours in the absence of fever) was to be confirmed by an increase in EDSS score or Functional System scores. ARR was assessed using Poisson regression model with robust error variance. To account for the different treatment durations among participants, a Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used (total number of confirmed relapses onset between randomization date and last dose date as the response variable, treatment, region and baseline monofocal/multifocal status as covariates, and log-transformed treatment duration as an offset variable).</description>

          <description>EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that qualifies disability in participants with MS. It consists of 8 ordinal rating scales assessing seven functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder and cerebral) as well as ambulation. EDSS total score ranges from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS).</description>

        <description>Conversion to DMS was demonstrated by dissemination of MRI lesions in time (as per McDonald criteria) or a relapse, whichever occurs first. MRI Imaging criteria were detection of Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement at least 3 months after onset of initial clinical event, if not at site corresponding to initial event; detection of new T2 lesion if it appears at any time compared with reference scan (done at time of screening) done at least 30 days after onset of the initial clinical event. Occurrence of relapse was defined as new neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from onset of preceding clinical event, present for at least 24 hours and occurring in absence of fever or known infection. New clinical abnormality (neurological sign) that is consistent with participant's symptoms with increase in at least one Functional System (FS) or EDSS score compared to last EDSS assessment. Percent probability of conversion at 24, 48, and 108 weeks was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Core Treatment Period: Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)</title>
        <description>ARR is the total number of confirmed relapses that occurred during the treatment period divided by the total number of patient-years treated. Each episode of relapse (appearance, or worsening of a clinical symptom that was stable for at least 30 days, that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours in the absence of fever) was to be confirmed by an increase in EDSS score or Functional System scores. ARR was assessed using Poisson regression model with robust error variance. To account for the different treatment durations among participants, a Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used (total number of confirmed relapses onset between randomization date and last dose date as the response variable, treatment, region and baseline monofocal/multifocal status as covariates, and log-transformed treatment duration as an offset variable).</description>

        <description>EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that qualifies disability in participants with MS. It consists of 8 ordinal rating scales assessing seven functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder and cerebral) as well as ambulation. EDSS total score ranges from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS). Least-square means were estimated using a Mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) on cubic root transformed volume data adjusted for baseline monofocal/multifocal status, region, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline value and baseline-by-visit interaction</description>
