  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this booster study is to evaluate, in subjects primed in the primary study
      106786, the persistence, at the time of the booster vaccination, of antibodies elicited by
      the different formulation of DTPa-HBV-IPV/ Hib vaccine (Infanrix Hexa TM). The study will
      also evaluate the immune response of these subjects to a DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib booster. This
      protocol posting deals with the objectives and outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives and outcomes measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT = 00376779).
