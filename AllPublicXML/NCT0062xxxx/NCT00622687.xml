  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the efficacy of different dosages of long-term iloprost treatment on
      Raynaud's phenomenon, ulcer healing, skin thickening, and progression of internal organ
      sclerosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc).

      Methods. 50 SSc patients were 1:1 randomised either for maximally tolerated dose up to 2
      ng/kg body weight [bw] per minute or low dose (0.5 ng/kg bw per minute) intravenous iloprost
      administration, for six hours daily over 21 days. The effect on RP, ulcer healing, skin
      thickness, oesophagus function, lung involvement as assessed by lung function parameters FVC
      and DLCO, and side effects were measured.

      Conclusions. The efficacy of prolonged administration of iloprost is also achieved with low
      dose iloprost by long term treatment. The effects suggest a disease-modifying capability of
      iloprost, but further studies are needed to proof this hypothesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 SSc patients (23 patients with limited SSc; 15 patients with diffuse SSc, and 12 patients
      with overlap syndromes fulfilling the ACR criteria for systemic sclerosis) and suffering from
      severe Raynaud`s phenomenon were included into the study after written informed consent to
      participate in this study. Severe Raynaud`s phenomenon was defined by a high burden of
      disease, by trophic skin changes, or the presence of digital ulcers.

      Patients suffering from SSc related RP and/or digital ulceration were randomized 1 : 1 to one
      of the following groups that received either high or low dose infusions of iloprost for 21
      consecutive days given once or twice a year. High dose patients (n=25) started on 0.5ng per
      kg bw and min over 6 hours a day. Depending on the tolerability the dosages were increased in
      increments gradually every two days for 0.5 ng/kg x min. The maximum dose administered was
      2.0ng/kg bw and min. Low dose patients (n=25) were permanently treated with 0.5ng/kg bw over
      6 hours per day for 21 consecutive days.
