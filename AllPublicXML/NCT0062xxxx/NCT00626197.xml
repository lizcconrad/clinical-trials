  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre,
      parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab added to SOC
      (corticosteroid plus one of two immunosuppressant regimens) compared with placebo added to
      SOC in patients with WHO or ISN Class III or IV lupus nephritis.
