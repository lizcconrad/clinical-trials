        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy Japanese adult males between 20 and 64 yeas of age, inclusive.

          -  Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant
             disease as determined by their medical history, physical examination, clinical
             laboratory examinations, vital sign, 12-lead ECG, immunology tests and urinary drug
             screen test.

          -  Bodyweight &gt;50 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25.0 at screening.

          -  Subjects must be capable of providing written informed consent, which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Baseline QTc interval &lt;450 msec.

          -  Non-smoker or ex-smoker having ceased smoking for at least 6 months.

          -  Clinical laboratory examination (AST, ALT, ALP and GGT) at screening are within the
             normal range.

          -  The subject is able to attend all visits and complete the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening physical examination,
             vital sign measurement, 12-lead ECG recording and/or clinical laboratory examination
             that is deemed by the principal investigator and/or medical monitor to make the
             subject ineligible for inclusion because of a safety concern.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding, on average, 14 drinks/week for men
             (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 350 mL of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80
             proof distilled spirits) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Positive for urine drug at screening.

          -  Positive for syphilis, HIV antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody
             or HTLV-1 antibody at screening.

          -  Use of prescription or no-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is

          -  Consumption of grapefruit juice or food within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  A history of cholecystectomy or biliary tract disease including a history of liver
             disease with elevated liver function tests of known or unknown etiology.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 400mL within 4 months or 200mL within 1 months prior to
             at screening.

          -  History of drug abuse, or current conditions of drug abuse or alcoholism.

          -  Participation in a clinical study or post-marketing study with an investigational or a
             non-investigational product or device within 4 months of preceding the first dose of
             study medication.

          -  Participation in another clinical study or post-marketing study in which the subject
             is or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product or
             device.

          -  History of asthma, anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions, severe allergic responses.

          -  The subject has an allergy for any drug or idiosyncrasy. This excludes a pollen
