  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of injecting myoblasts
      (grown from your own skeletal muscle), using a catheter device, directly into the damaged
      heart muscle for treatment of severe heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the limited treatment options available to patients with congestive heart failure,
      there is a need for alternative therapies. Autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation has
      been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies to be a safe and effective treatment of heart
      failure. Initial clinical studies have shown that autologous myoblasts can be delivered into
      infracted myocardium by both direct epicardial and endomyocardial injection. However,
      autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation via percutaneous endomyocardial injection has
      the potential to play a significant role in such congestive heart failure patients without
      the need for surgical risk and general anesthesia. Thus, a Phase 2 clinical trial is proposed
      in order to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous myoblast delivered by endomyocardial
      injection for the treatment congestive heart failure.

          4. Subjects could be considered for enrollment if CRT placement has occurred greater than
             three months previously with no clinical improvement, CRT settings are judged to be
             optimized and the subject continues to meet all other inclusion criteria
             (inadequate-responders).

          5. Documentation of ineligibility for coronary revascularization and/or valve repair/
             replacement by review of recent left heart catheterization (within six months of
             baseline).

          6. Receiving optimally tolerated doses of standard, stable pharmacotherapy, including
             angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, unless intolerant or contra-indicated,
             diuretics, ÃŸ-receptor blockers for at least one month prior to enrollment

          7. Severe myocardial perfusion abnormality documented by SPECT imaging, involving at
             least 1/3 of a vascular territory, as confirmed by core lab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt; 21 years or &gt; 75 years.

          2. Significant coronary stenosis, as determined by the Investigator, which may
             potentially require percutaneous or surgical revascularization within 12 weeks of
             enrollment.

          3. Recent (within 4 weeks), documented acute coronary syndrome, i.e. (Q wave or non-Q
             wave infarction) or hospitalization for unstable angina.
