  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of peginterferon alfa-2a 40KD + ribavirin
      combination therapy given for 24 weeks versus 48 weeks in patients with chronic hepatitis C,
      genotype 2/3.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a pre-study run-in phase patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 2/3, who had
      started therapy with PEG-IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin according to local standard of care and
      did not achieve a rapid viral response (RVR) (defined as Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA &lt;15
      IU/mL at Week 4 of treatment measured with the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan® HCV
      Test) were eligible for the study and entered the screening phase between treatment Week 4
      and 8 as soon as the result of the Week 4 HCV RNA test was available.

      Eligible patients entered the study and continued with the dose regimens of PEG-IFN alfa-2a
      and ribavirin they were taking prior to enrolment into the trial up to Week 24 of treatment.
      Patients who achieved at least a 2-log10 drop of HCV RNA at Week 12 (as compared to HCV RNA
      levels prior to treatment initiation) or had HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL, and who were still taking
      study medication at treatment Week 24, were randomized at treatment Week 24 to one of the two
      study groups. Upon randomization, participants either stopped treatment (equaling 24 weeks of
      treatment) or continued treatment for another 24 weeks (equaling 48 weeks of treatment). A
      treatment free follow-up period of 24 weeks (for participants in the 48-week treatment group)
      or 48 weeks (participants in the 24-week treatment group) completed the study.

    <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) is defined as a single last HCV RNA measurement &lt;15 IU/ml (measured using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan HCV Test) 24 weeks after scheduled treatment completion, defined as Week 44 or later for participants randomized to the 24-week treatment period or Week 68 or later for participants randomized to the 48-week treatment period.

    <description>Virological relapse defined as the percentage of participants with a virological response at end of treatment but who did not have a sustained virological response 24 weeks after the end of treatment.
Virological response at end of treatment is defined as a single last HCV RNA measurement &lt;15 IU/ml measured using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan HCV Test at the day of last dose of study medication.
Sustained virological response 24 weeks after the actual treatment end (SVR24) is defined as a single last HCV RNA measurement &lt;15 IU/ml at least 20 weeks after treatment end.</description>

    <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) is defined as a single last HCV RNA measurement &lt;15 IU/ml (measured using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan HCV Test) at 12 weeks after actual end of study treatment. For participants in the 48-week treatment group who stopped study treatment prior to Week 48 for any reason, the HCV RNA measurements 12 weeks after actual end of treatment were used in the analysis.

    <description>An AE was defined as a sign or symptom, including intercurrent illness, that occurred during the course of the clinical study after treatment had started. A related AE is an event assessed by the Investigator to be remotely, possibly, or probably related to study treatment according to criteria provided in the protocol. A severe AE was an event graded by the Investigator as &quot;incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity&quot;. A serious AE (SAE) was defined as any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution. This includes any experience which was fatal; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/ birth defect; was medically significant or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above.</description>

          <description>Virological relapse defined as the percentage of participants with a virological response at end of treatment but who did not have a sustained virological response 24 weeks after the end of treatment.
Virological response at end of treatment is defined as a single last HCV RNA measurement &lt;15 IU/ml measured using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan HCV Test at the day of last dose of study medication.
Sustained virological response 24 weeks after the actual treatment end (SVR24) is defined as a single last HCV RNA measurement &lt;15 IU/ml at least 20 weeks after treatment end.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as a sign or symptom, including intercurrent illness, that occurred during the course of the clinical study after treatment had started. A related AE is an event assessed by the Investigator to be remotely, possibly, or probably related to study treatment according to criteria provided in the protocol. A severe AE was an event graded by the Investigator as &quot;incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity&quot;. A serious AE (SAE) was defined as any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution. This includes any experience which was fatal; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/ birth defect; was medically significant or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above.</description>
