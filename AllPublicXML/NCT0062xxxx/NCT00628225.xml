      Background: Smoking cessation is the key element in the treatment of patients with Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The role of the general practice in assisting these
      patients with successful quitting smoking was suboptimal. Therefore we evaluated the
      effectiveness of two smoking cessation programs (counseling and nicotine replacement) for
      smokers with COPD in routine general practice, one with (CNB) and one without (CN) the
      combination with bupropion-SR, compared to usual care (UC) and explored the role of COPD
      symptoms in successful smoking cessation.

      Method: RCT with 667 patients with COPD, 68 general practices were randomly allocated. The
      usual care group (UC) consisted of 148 patients (22 practices), the first intervention group
      (counseling plus nicotine replacement (CN) of 243 patients (21 practices) and the second
      intervention group of 276 patients (25 practices. Main outcome measure was (biochemically
      verified) point prevalence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A software program using Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical (ATC) prescription codes and
        International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) diagnosis codes selected potential
        patients with COPD. Criteria: age &gt;35 years and a diagnosis recorded as COPD or as ICPC
        code R95/96, or a prescription of at least three times of bronchodilators (ATC code
        R03a/bc) and/or prescription of at least two times of inhaled anti-inflammatory medication
        in the past year (ATC code R03). General practitioners (GPs) had to confirm the diagnosis
        of the selection. Patients were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria:

          -  Current smoking

          -  Suffering from COPD according to the GP's diagnosis

          -  In command of the Dutch language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Too ill

          -  Under control of a chest physician

          -  Serious physical or psychological comorbidity
