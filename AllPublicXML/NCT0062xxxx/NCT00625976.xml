      Background:

      Research on the treatment of CRPS-I, as described in the Dutch evidence based treatment
      guidelines (Richtlijn Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type I, 2006), mainly showed improvement
      at the level of pain and coping with pain. Only little improvement in functional restoration
      was found. Research in other pain populations such al neck- and back-pain patients has shown
      that pain related fear contributes to the development of functional disability. GEXP in vivo
      which aims on systematically reducing fear of movement, shows promising results in CRPS-I
      patients (de Jong et al., 2005).

      Objective:

      The objective of the proposed project is to compare the effectivity of GEXP in vivo with that
      of standardized physiotherapy in CRPS-I patients with pain related fear.

      Design:

      The study concerns a single blinded, single center, randomized clinical trial. The treatment
      will be preceded by two pre-measures. After treatment there will be one post-measurement and
      3, 6 and 12 month follow-up measurements.

      Population:

      The study population will consist of chronic CRPS-I patients between 18 and 65, with pain
      related fear (PHODA-LE-score ≥ 35 and PHODA-UE-score ≥ 32).

      Intervention:

      The two interventions that will be compared are GEXP in vivo (de Jong et al., 2005) and
      standardized physiotherapy according to the protocol of Oerlemans, Oostendorp, de Boo en
      Goris (1999). The GEXP in vivo comprises 17 sessions of one hour, the physiotherapy treatment
      of 34 sessions of 30 minutes. Both treatments will be given over a period of 17 weeks.
