    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial. The aim of the study was to compare
      xylometazoline HCL nasal drops to inhalation of epinephrine as a treatment for bronchiolitis.

      The study hypothesis is:xylometazoline HCL nasal drops treatment is good as epinephrine
      inhalation for treatment of bronchiolitis.

      Signed informed consent was obtained from a parent of each child. And the human ethics
      committee of our hospital approved the study according to the principles of the Declaration
      of Helsinki.(Approved - 2002)

      Patients:

      65 infants who were admitted to Pediatric A- a general pediatric ward, in Schneider
      Children's Medical Center because of bronchiolitis during winter in two consecutive years
      2004-2005.

      The inclusion criteria were: Full term previously healthy Infants, ages 1-12 months, after
      informed consent was signed with clinical presentation of mild to moderate bronchiolitis
      according to a clinical score .Exclusion criteria were as follows: prematurity, congenital
      lung or cardiac disease, infants who had past hospitalization due to respiratory illness and
      severe bronchiolitis (score&gt;7 with a range scale 0-10).

      All eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 (control) received
      inhalation of epinephrine 1mg, in 2cc of 0.9% saline solution four times a day, and nasal
      drops of 0.9% saline for each nostril every twelve hours. Group 2 - the study group received
      four inhalation of 0.9% saline four times a day and one nasal drop of xylometazoline HCL to
      each nostril twice a day. This treatment continued until the patient was ready for discharge.

      Patients were examined and evaluated at the study entry and were re-evaluated every 10-12
      hours. Length of hospital stay,time to improve Oxygen saturation, time to the need of IV
      fluid and clinical score between the two groups of treatment were compared.
