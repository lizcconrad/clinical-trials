  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of everolimus in
      Japanese patients. Everolimus is administered orally everyday to adult patients with relapsed
      or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have progressed despite standard therapy or for whom
      standard systemic therapy dose not exist.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients must have histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

          -  Patients must have disease that is either relapsed or refractory after at least one
             prior treatment regimen and must not be eligible for any standard treatments

          -  Patients must not have received autologous stem cell transplant at least within 12
             weeks prior to study treatment. If patients received autologous stem cell transplant
             more than 12 weeks ago, they must be fully recovered from the side effects of such
             treatment

          -  Patients who have not received autologous stem cell transplant must be either
             ineligible for the treatment or, if eligible, patients must have chosen not to receive
             stem cell transplant

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable lesion

          -  Age above 20 years old

          -  Performance Status 0, 1, or 2 on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Patients must be willing to provide portion of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy during
             study

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically
             significant or currently requires active intervention

          -  Patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplant

          -  Patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as
             requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require major surgery during the
             course of the study

          -  Patients who have received radiation therapy for ≤ 28 days prior to first study
             treatment or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy.

          -  Patients who have received any other investigational agents ≤28 days prior to the
             first study treatment

          -  Patients who have received anti-neoplastic therapy within 28 days (60 days for
             monoclonal antibody or radioimmunotherapy) prior to the first study treatment or who
             have not recovered from side effects of such therapy

          -  Patients who have received treatment with oral or intravenous steroids or any
             immunosuppressive agents ≤ 28 days prior to the first study treatment

          -  Patients who have received prior therapy with RAD001 or other mTOR inhibitors

          -  Patient with prior therapy of &gt; 450 U blomycin

          -  Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis.

          -  Treatment with any hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) ≤ 14
             days prior to the first study treatment

          -  Patients who have an impairment of gastrointestinal function or who have
             gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of study
             treatment (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
             malabsorption syndrome)

          -  Patients with active respiratory (excluding interstitial lung disease), skin, mucosal,
             renal, neurological, or ocular disorder of grade &gt; 1

          -  Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease of grade ≥ 1

          -  Patients with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity,
             hepatitis B or C seropositivity
