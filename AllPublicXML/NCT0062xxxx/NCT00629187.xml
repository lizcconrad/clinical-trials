  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find the maximum dose of a drug, temozolomide, that can safely
      be given to subjects with brain tumors. Past studies showed that the maximum dose of
      temozolomide was limited by low blood counts. The investigators will use blood stem cells
      collected from bone marrow to help subjects recover their blood counts, a procedure called
      autologous stem cell transplant or stem cell rescue. This way, the investigators expect to be
      able to safely deliver very high doses of temozolomide. This study is only available at Tufts
      Medical Center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant is an accepted treatment
      alternative for patients with brain tumors. Temozolomide has been approved for use by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certain tumors of the brain. The doses
      of temozolomide given in this study will be higher than approved by the FDA and higher than
      those given in any prior studies.

      Over 25 subjects will be enrolled on this study over a period of 5 years. This study will
      only be available at Tufts Medical Center.

    <description>Before taking part in this study, subjects will have stem cells collected in a procedure called apheresis. Once on this study, subjects will be admitted to the hospital and receive daily doses of temozolomide by mouth for 5 days. Stem cells will be given back to subjects who will remain in the hospital until blood counts have recovered. Doses of temozolomide will range from 350 mg to 1500 mg/m(squared) daily for 5 days (total dose 1750 to 7500 mg/m(squared).</description>
