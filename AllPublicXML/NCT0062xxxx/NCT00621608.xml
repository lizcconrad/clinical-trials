  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if HBOT plus standard wound care is more effective
      than standard wound care alone at preventing the need for major amputation (metatarsal and
      up) in patients with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) with moderate to sever chronic wounds of
      lower limbs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with diabetes mellitus and non-healing ulcers of the lower limb are at higher risk of
      amputation. Current standard care for foot ulcers includes maintaining optimal blood glucose
      levels, use of debridement, antibacterials, dressings, antibiotics for infection; adequate
      nutrition; pressure relief and amputation. There has been an increased interest in the use of
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as an adjunctive treatment for diabetic ulcers. HBOT is an
      established technology which currently is an accepted treatment of chronic diabetic ulcers in
      Ontario and physicians who provide this service are reimbursed under the current Ontario
      Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). However there are only a few facilities that can provide this
      service. In addition, results of published HBOT studies are inconsistent. The current study
      will provide quality efficacy data on the use of HBOT as an adjunctive therapy. As this study
      has been recommended by the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC), the results
      of the study will be used to make policy decisions regarding the funding and further
      utilization of HBOT therapy for people with diabetes mellitus with ulcers of the lower limb
      in the province. If the results are favorable towards HBOT in the treatment of diabetic
      ulcers, potential expansion and availability of this and other programs maybe be possible. A
      randomized placebo control trial evaluating HBOT, to the best of our knowledge has not been
      completed in this area and will provide much needed information to the scientific community.

    <description>Patients will receive HBOT placebo 5 days per week for 6 weeks for a total of 30 treatments. Each patient will be placed into the hyperbaric chamber and will receive 90 minutes of room air while inside the chamber and the initial flow of air into the chamber will produce a small increase in pressure (0.3 ATA partial pressure of oxygen = 210 mmHg) which will then be released over a period of 10 minutes. Subjects will receive dressings changes as required per standard of care.</description>
