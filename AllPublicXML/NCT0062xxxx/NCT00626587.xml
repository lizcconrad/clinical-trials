  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions(PPLs) remained a clinical challenge for
      physicians. Bronchoscope with sampling procedures was recognized as a useful method to obtain
      the correct diagnosis of PPLs. Conventional diagnostic procedures included transbronchial
      biopsy(TBB), bronchial washing(BW), or bronchial brushing, but the diagnostic yields were
      sometimes suboptimal. The diagnostic role of TBNA for PPLs remained to be determined, since
      many of the published studies were retrospective and had small sample size. This may explain
      the fact that TBNA was always underutilized for PPLs by bronchologists. With the popular
      application of EBUS-guided procedures in clinical setting, we performed EBUS-guided TBNA for
      PPLs. We want to determine whether EBUS-guided TBNA can improve the diagnostic rate of PPLs.

      The diagnostic yield of endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle
      aspiration (TBNA) for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) had not been evaluated. The
      diagnostic impact of TBNA when the EBUS probe was adjacent to lesions remained to be
      determined.

      Here we designed a randomized, prospective study to evaluate : (1) The diagnostic yield of
      EBUS-guided TBNA in PPLs; (2) The role of TBNA when EBUS probe was adjacent to the lesions.
      Lesions not visible by bronchoscopy were defined as PPLs (no findings of endobronchial
      lesions, extrinsic compression, submucosal infiltration, or orifice narrowing). The TBNA
      apparatus (Olympus NA-2C-1) was inserted through the working channel, and was advanced until
      it reached the target lesion which was localized by EBUS. Negative manual suction was applied
      with the 20 ml syringe. The specimens were then smeared on glass slides and immersed in 95%
      alcohol. At least 3 aspirates per lesion were obtained. Using simple randomization with
      random digit table, we randomly assigned patients to undergo EBUS-guided TBB and BW or
      EBUS-guided TBNA, TBB and BW.
