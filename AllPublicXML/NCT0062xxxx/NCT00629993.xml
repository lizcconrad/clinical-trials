  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary care physicians have an important role to play in the delivery of cancer prevention
      and detection services to patients. Face-to-face counseling of physicians, called academic
      detailing, involves a brief and focused intervention, modeled on the practices of
      pharmaceutical companies. This type of intervention may increase physicians' attention to
      preventive opportunities and increase their screening behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this proposal are:

        1. To test the hypothesis that an intervention, multi-component academic detailing, will
           increase the rate of physician cervical cancer screening at 3- and 6-months
           post-randomization, compared to the rate observed in a service-as-usual control.

        2. To develop models predicting which physician offices are most and least likely to adopt
           the intervention, and to generate hypotheses about tailoring the dissemination of
           cervical cancer screening guidelines to different physician subgroups.

        3. To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the incremental societal costs and
           effects (in lives saved, life-years saved, and quality-of-life-years saved) of the
           cervical cancer intervention implemented in physicians' offices.

      The long-term goal of this project therefore is to reduce cervical cancer risks among ethnic
      and racial minorities, by influencing the screening behaviors of their primary care
      physicians.

    <description>Multi-component, academic detailing regarding ACS guidelines on cervical cancer screening approaches.
Includes an interactive, digitized CD-ROM, focused on the discussion of risks and benefits, screening options or alternatives, values clarification, and mutual decision-making, alongside patient education materials designed for low literacy patients.</description>

    <description>It will involve multiple intervention components, some of which are standardized across physicians (i.e., self learning packets, post-tests for CME credit, CD-ROMS, videos, newsletters, culturally sensitive patient education materials, office staff informational sessions, chart and patient reminders, and a general office routine for cervical cancer counseling, including performance feedback, as well as media-ready materials). Academic detailing and the specific office routines will be customized to each physician, although the frequency of the detailing visits will be routinized across all participants, to reduce cost and to maximize its potential for dissemination.</description>
