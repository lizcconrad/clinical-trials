  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to compare the tolerability and effectiveness of
      Combigan(brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate) and Cosopt (dorzolamide hydrochloride)in the
      treatment of open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      Patients between the ages of 40 to 90 years of age, that have been diagnosed with open angle
      glaucoma or ocular hypertension,including pseudo-exfoliation and pigmentary glaucoma with
      definitive glaucomatous optic disk cupping and/or glaucomatous visual field loss, who have
      been receiving a stable treatment regime for at least 4 weeks prior to the study initiation,
      with a Cosopt mono or a Prostaglandin + Cosopt combination are to be included in the
      study.Patients must have an IOP between 16 and 32 mmHg, with no readings above 35 mmHg at
      baseline.

      Patients with any other form of glaucoma other than primary open angle glaucoma, with a
      gonioscopy measured angle grade of less than 2, with a visual field defect not of
      glaucomatous origen and previous cyclodestructive procedures will be excluded.The use of
      ocular non steroidal and anti-inflammatory topical agents which inhibit cyclooxygenase and
      prostaglandin analog synthesis,the use of glucocorticoid therapy, and hypersensitivity to any
      of the study components also precludes involvement in the study. Any ocular laser therapy
      within the past three months, ocular inflammation or infection in the past three months or
      any history of trauma in the last six months will also exclude enrollment in the study.
