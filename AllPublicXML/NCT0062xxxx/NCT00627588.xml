    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the trial are to assess the safety and efficacy of ProSavin.

      Patients in the trial will have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and will be failing
      on current treatment with L-DOPA but they will not have progressed to drug-induced
      dyskinesias. The first stage is an open-label dose escalation to evaluate up to three dose
      levels of ProSavin in cohorts of three patients each. Following a recommendation by the DMC
      the study may proceed to the second stage of the trial, a further 12 patients will be
      recruited to confirm efficacy of the optimal dose in the randomized phase of the study.

      The efficacy of ProSavin will be assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score
      (UPDRS). Patients will be monitored at regular intervals, with the primary endpoint being an
      efficacy assessment at six months after treatment. The secondary objective of the trial is to
      asses the extent to which patients' current therapy (L-DOPA) can be reduced following
      administration of ProSavin.

             capacity

          7. Response to L-DOPA where an increase in dose is unacceptable to the patient due to

          8. Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 and 4

          9. UPDRS (Part III) of between 20 and 60 in the &quot;OFF&quot; state
