  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study assessing the impact of conventional dose iodinated contrast
      on the renal function of advanced chronic kidney disease patients undergoing arteriovenous
      fistula evaluation using a standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol. In addition,
      this model allows for pre and post procedure measurements of kidney function, providing a
      unique opportunity to assess the utility of novel biomarkers for contrast-induced kidney
      injury.

      Our primary hypothesis is that there will be no change in serum creatinine post-procedure
      when using a standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol. Our secondary hypothesis is
      that there will be no change in urinary kidney-injury marker-1 (KIM-1) post-procedure using a
      standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol. In addition, we will assess the impact of
      different patient characteristics on the development of contrast-induced kidney injury, such
      as diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor therapy.

      The National Kidney Foundation publishes kidney disease outcome guidelines for improving care
      of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient. Regarding hemodialysis vascular access, the
      recommendation is for early placement of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to improve morbidity
      and mortality outcomes, specifically when the glomerular filtration rate is less than
      25ml/min, corresponding to stage 4 and 5 CKD. Despite its advantages, the need for
      surveillance of the AVF to determine maturation for use and maintain optimal longevity
      requires the use of interventional procedures. While radiocontrast use can lead to acute,
      often reversible kidney injury, its use in AVF evaluation has renewed interest with the
      recent implication of gadolinium-enhanced MRI being associated with a rare disorder of skin
      swelling and induration called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. CKD patients are particularly
      susceptible to long term adverse outcomes from contrast-induced kidney injury, with 1 year
      mortality in stage 4 and 5 CKD patients being 44% and 62%, respectively. While optimal fluid
      therapy to prevent contrast-induced kidney injury remains uncertain, several prospective
      randomized trials using sodium bicarbonate pretreatment have shown a lower incidence of
      contrast-related kidney injury compared to isotonic saline. Traditional markers of acute
      kidney injury, including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine clearance have
      been insensitive in differentiating contrast-induced kidney injury from other forms of renal
      injury. Kidney injury marker-1 (KIM-1) is a transmembrane receptor induced to very high
      levels in the proximal tubule of the nephron following ischemic and nephrotoxic injury. KIM-1
      has been shown in a small cohort of patients to differentiate ischemic kidney injury from
      other forms of acute and chronic kidney disease.
