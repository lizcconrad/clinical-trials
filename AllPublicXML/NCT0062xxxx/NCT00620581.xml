  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of SSRI use to relieve the symptoms associated with premenstrual dysphoric
      disorder has been established. We proposed to test the hypothesis that intermittent treatment
      with paroxetine administered during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle only is more
      effective than placebo in improving symptoms of PMDD. This was a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, three-arm parallel group study of patients with PMDD. Menstruating women
      18 years of age or older who met criteria for inclusion in the study were randomized to one
      of three arms: paroxetine 10mg/day during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; paroxetine
      20mg/day during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; placebo daily during the luteal
      phase of the menstrual cycle. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      intermittent treatment of paroxetine in women with PMDD.
