      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as lymph node mapping during surgery and sentinel
      lymph node biopsy, may help doctors find micrometastases and predict cancer recurrence.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lymph node mapping during surgery together
      with sentinel lymph node analysis and blood testing work in detecting and predicting early
      micrometastases in patients with colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the accuracy and sensitivity of intraoperative lymph node mapping with
           isosulfan blue and sentinal node biopsy (SLN) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

        -  To compare molecular and immunohistochemical methods for detection of micrometastases in
           the SLN and primary tumor and evaluate the clinical outcome.

        -  To evaluate the clinicopathological utility of hematogenous micrometastases in
           predicting disease recurrence in CRC.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive isosulfan blue subserosally around the primary tumor for sentinel
      lymph node (SLN) identification and SLN(s) are marked. Patients undergo a standard colon
      resection as planned to include the SLN(s) and regional lymph nodes.

      Lymph nodes removed during surgery are analyzed within 30 days after surgery. Routine
      pathologic analysis (H&amp;E) are performed on all lymph nodes (SLN and non-SLN) removed.
      Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for cytokeratin antibodies AE-1/AE-3 or MAK-6 are
      performed on all lymph nodes negative by H&amp;E. Multimarker PCR (MM PCR) are performed on all
      SLNs. Blood samples are collected at baseline and then periodically for 4 years for MM PCR to
      detect circulating tumor cells and standard tumor markers (e.g., CEA).

      After surgery, patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years.
