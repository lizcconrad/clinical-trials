      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with
      gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and
      gemcitabine in treating older patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly bortezomib and gemcitabine in treating
           elderly patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of bortezomib and
           gemcitabine in these patients.

        -  To obtain preliminary information about the anti-tumor activity of bortezomib and
           gemcitabine.

        -  To characterize gemcitabine and metabolite pharmacokinetics in patients receiving
           concurrent bortezomib therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of bortezomib and gemcitabine.

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes followed 1 hour later by
      bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and bortezomib until the
      maximum tolerated dose of the combination is determined.

      Blood is collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.
