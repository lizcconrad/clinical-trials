      The present study is a pragmatic trial that investigates the efficacy and usefulness of two
      treatment modules in a sample of Rwandan genocide orphans: Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET)
      versus group-Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). We used a half year baseline to measure the
      treatment-induced changes. We hypothesized that there would be a greater reduction in
      posttraumatic stress symptoms in the NET- than in the IPT-group and that IPT would be
      superior to NET in the reduction of depression symptoms.

      The 1994 genocide of Rwanda has left countless children orphaned. 26 Rwandan orphans who
      fulfilled DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD were offered participation in a controlled treatment
      trial. A group adaptation of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT, n = 14) was compared to
      Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET, n = 12). Main outcome measures were symptoms of PTSD and
      depression assessed pre-treatment, 3 months after therapy (post-test) and 6 months after
      therapy (follow-up) using the CAPS, MINI and Hamilton Rating Scale. At post-test,
      participants in both treatment conditions showed reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms
      and depression symptoms. At 6-month follow-up, NET proved to be more effective in the
      treatment of PTSD. Only 25% (n = 3) of NET-participants but 71% (n = 10) of the
      IPT-participants still fulfilled PTSD criteria at follow-up. Although there was a significant
      reduction in depression symptoms in both treatment groups from pre-test to follow-up, NET
      again proved to be more effective. This treatment-trial demonstrates that NET and group-IPT
      are suitable treatment modules even when most severe traumatic stress and difficult living
      conditions have led to chronic mental suffering.
