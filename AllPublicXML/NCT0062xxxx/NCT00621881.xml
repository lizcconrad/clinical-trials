  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group study that will be conducted at two
      study sites. Patients with hepatic impairment and matched healthy subjects will receive
      naproxcinod 750 mg bid for 6 days and qd for the last day.
