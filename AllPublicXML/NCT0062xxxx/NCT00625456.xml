  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced/metastatic
      solid tumors refractory to standard therapy; tumors may include malignant melanoma, non-small
      cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
      These tumor types were selected because evidence of biological activity was observed in these
      tumor types in a Phase I study of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) administered by intratumoral injection in
      patients with metastatic disease to the liver. Patients will receive treatment at one of five
      dose levels in a sequential dose-escalating design.

             squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck

          -  At least one measurable tumor mass by CT/MRI (i.e. lesion that can accurately be
             measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter &gt; 1 cm)

          -  At least one tumor mass amenable to biopsy and/or FNA

          -  Expected survival for approximately 16 weeks or longer
