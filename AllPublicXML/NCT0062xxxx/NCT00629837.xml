    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic profile after single
      administration of two doses of BAY 79-4980 (high and low: 35 IU FVIII/Kg reconstituted in 22
      mg and 13 mg of liposomes/Kg, respectively) compared to rFVIII-FS (35 IU/Kg reconstituted in
      2.5 mL WFI/1000 IU) in PTPs aged 12 to 60 years with severe hemophilia A.

             than or equal to 100 mm/Hg)

          -  Any patient who cannot forego FVIII treatment for at least 4 days prior to study entry
             or between study infusions due to a need for more frequent prophylactic treatment
             because of a pre-existing medical condition

          -  Any patient with known allergy or severe reactions to liposomes or PEG
