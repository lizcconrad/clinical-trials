  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not unusual for several children operated for severe adenoid hyperthrophy causing
      breathing problems to have otitis media with effusion simultaneously. It is unknown whether
      adenoidectomy, myringotomy and tubes insertion is superior to adenoidectomy and myringotomy
      alone in terms of otitis media related quality of life and recurrence of otitis media several
      months after the operation. For this purpose a randomized trial is conducted including
      children operated for adenoid hyperthrophy and whose otitis media with effusion had caused
      minimal or no symptoms so far

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children operated for their adenoid hyperthrophy with an adenoid size of 3 (measured
             in a scale of 1-3 intraoperatively or from lateral neck x-ray) and otitis media with
             effusion causing an average air-bone gap of greater than 20db. Children should be
             otherwise healthy with an ASA score of I and between 3-12 years old of age

        Exclusion Criteria:
