  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes male subjects age 45 to 70, who have sustained a traumatic Spinal Cord
      Injury (SCI) at least 10 years prior. Subjects will be interviewed for demographic data,
      including heart disease risk factors. A blood test for cholesterol levels will be drawn. A CT
      scan of arteries of the heart will be performed to determine the presence of coronary
      calcium, a marker of subclinical Coronary Heart Disease. Scoring of Coronary Calcium or
      Coronary Calcium Score (CCS) is automated by the CT scanner. Each subject's Framingham Risk
      Score will be calculated; This is an individuals 10 year risk of having a Coronary Heart
      Disease event (significant symptoms). In addition, it will be determined if subjects are
      being treated for diagnosed dyslipidemia (high cholesterol) according to the National
      Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP) guidelines.

      The proposed pilot study aims to better understand the problem of Coronary Heart Disease in
      individuals with Spinal Cord Injury, specifically CCS in SCI, when compared to the general
      population.

    <description>Participants were classified as high risk, intermediate high risk, intermediate low risk, and low risk based upon both their CCS and their LDL using NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines. Those with CCS &gt;/-400 were considered high risk, CCS=100-399 were intermediate high risk, CCS=1-99 intermediate low risk, and CCS=0 were low risk. The percent agreement between CCS and NCEP Guidelines was calculated by totaling the number of subjects who were classified in the same risk category and dividing by the total number of subjects</description>
