    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, open label trial of lamotrigine for older adults (age 60 and older) with
      type I or type II Bipolar depression. Non-demented older adults with Bipolar I or II
      depression, confirmed via the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) - Patient edition (SCID-I/P) and meeting
      inclusion criteria for depressive symptom severity (score of 18 or greater on the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale/HAM-D-24) will receive add-on lamotrigine dosed to a target of 200
      mg/day.
