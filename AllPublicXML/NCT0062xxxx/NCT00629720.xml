  <brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study With Alfuzosin in Children and Adolescents With Elevated Detrusor Leak Point Pressure of Neuropathic Etiology</brief_title>
  <acronym>ALFACHIP</acronym>
  <official_title>Four-week, Open-label, Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel-group Study to Investigate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, Tolerability and the Effects on Leak Point Pressure of Two Oral Doses of Alfuzosin (0.1 mg/kg/Day; 0.2 mg/kg/Day) in Children and Adolescents 2 to 16 Years-of-age With Elevated Detrusor Leak-point Pressure of Neuropathic Etiology</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 2 doses of alfuzosin
      (given as a solution or tablets depending on age) in children and adolescents 2 to 16 years
      of age with elevated detrusor Leak Point Pressure (LPP) (â‰¥40 cm H2O) of neuropathic etiology
      stratified into 2 age groups (2 to 7 years and 8 to 16 years).

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety and tolerability of the 2 dose
      regimens and to determine the effect of the 2 dose regimens on detrusor LPP.
