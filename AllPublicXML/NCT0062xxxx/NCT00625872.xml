      The planned study focuses on the effect of a one year Somatropin treatment (0.035 mg/kg/d or
      0.067 mg/kg/d) in short children born SGA on neuromuscular function and cognitive
      performance.

    <description>Triceps, supra-iliac and subscapular skinfolds were measured on the right side of the body to the nearest 0.1 mm with a Holtain skinfold caliper. The measurement was performed at the left side of the participant. Triceps skinfold thickness was measured halfway down the left upper arm, while the arm was hanging relaxed at the participant's side. Suprascapular skinfold was measured laterally just below the angle of the left scapula. Suprailiac skinfold was measured just above the iliac crest in the middle-axillary line. SDS indicates how similar the participant was to the reference population.</description>

        <description>Peak jump power (PJP) was defined as the peak of the calculated power (force multiplied by velocity). It was measured by Leonardo Jumping Platform during two-leg jump. The participant performs 3 jumps and the highest peak (PJP) of the 3 recordings was selected for further calculations. The SDS indicates how similar the participant was to the reference population.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Peak Jump Power Standard Deviation Score (PJP-SDS; Two-leg-jump) in Per Protocol (PP) Population at Month 6</title>
        <description>PJP was defined as the peak of the calculated power (force multiplied by velocity). It was measured by Leonardo Jumping Platform during two-leg jump. The participant performs 3 jumps and the highest peak (PJP) of the 3 recordings was selected for further calculations. The SDS indicates how similar the participant was to the reference population.</description>

        <population>PP population included participants who received the study medication for at least 22 weeks. Number of participants analyzed (N) signifies participants evaluable for the measure.</population>

        <description>K-ABC was assessed in children between 2.5-12.5 years. Comprised of 16 subtests; 10 mental processing (intelligence) and 6 achievement subtests. Achievement subtests: expressive vocabulary, faces&amp;places, arithmetic, riddles, reading/decoding, reading/comprehension. Sixteen subtests were weighted accordingly to form 5 global scales: sequential processing, simultaneous processing, achievement, non-verbal and mental processing composite. Scores were rated as upper extreme [greater than (&gt;) 131], above average (116-130), average (85-115), below average (70-84), lower extreme [less than (&lt;) 69].</description>

        <description>K-ABC was assessed in children between 2.5-12.5 years. Comprised of 16 subtests; 10 mental processing (intelligence) and 6 achievement subtests. Achievement subtests: expressive vocabulary, faces&amp;places, arithmetic, riddles, reading/decoding, reading/comprehension. Sixteen subtests were weighted accordingly to form 5 global scales: sequential processing, simultaneous processing, achievement, non-verbal and mental processing composite. Scores were rated as upper extreme [greater than (&gt;) 131], above average (116-130), average (85-115), below average (70-84), lower extreme [less than (&lt;) 69].</description>

        <description>The KITAP is a computer aided standardized neuro-cognitive development test which allows examination of a wide range of attention and executive functions such as shift of attention (Distractibility); simple reaction time (Alertness); &quot;Sustained Attention&quot;, change of reaction (Flexibility); &quot;Divided Attention&quot;, controlled reaction disposition (Go/No go) and &quot;Vigilance&quot;. It has been designed appropriately for children between the age of 6 to 10 years to allow optimal motivation during testing and to increase validity of results.</description>

        <description>The Chair rising test is a performance test (total power output) to measure neuromuscular function of complex movement in standing up. Test allows diagnostics of movement deficits using Leonardo jump plate. Five stand up test: five repetitions of rising from a chair on jump plate as quickly as possible with arms crossed over the chest (time to perform the tasks, maximal PJP, maximal velocity and maximal PJF). PJP is defined as the peak of the calculated power (force multiplied by velocity).</description>

        <description>The Chair rising test is a performance test (total power output) to measure neuromuscular function of complex movement in standing up. Test allows diagnostics of movement deficits using Leonardo jump plate. Five stand up test: five repetitions of rising from a chair on jump plate as quickly as possible with arms crossed over the chest (time to perform the tasks, maximal PJP, maximal velocity and maximal PJF). PJP is defined as the peak of the calculated power (force multiplied by velocity).</description>

        <description>Chair rising test is performance test (total power output) to measure neuromuscular function of complex movement in standing up. Test allows diagnostics of movement deficits using Leonardo jump plate. Five stand up test: 5 repetitions of rising from a chair on jump plate as quickly as possible with arms crossed over chest (time to perform tasks, maximal PJP, maximal velocity and maximal PJF). Time to perform task includes: Average (avg) rise time which is avg time to perform 1 rise, avg time per test is the avg time to perform 1 test (rise and sitting down) and total time to perform 5 tests.</description>

        <description>Bone Mineral Density (BMD) was measured by pqCT. The Z-score measures the distance of the measured BMD value from the appropriate normal age matched population mean value in units of standard deviation of this population. More negative scores indicate less BMD compared to age matched population and more positive scores indicate higher BMD compared to age matched population.</description>
