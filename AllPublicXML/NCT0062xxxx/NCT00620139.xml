    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to evaluate the feasibility of measuring the proximal effects of
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on the expression of potential therapeutic target
      molecules in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). Specifically, this study proposes
      to evaluate the extent to which CRT induces the differential expression of components along
      two critical, and potentially interdependent, molecular pathways: the arachidonic acid and
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways.

    <description>Some patients presenting with suspicious lesions of the oropharynx or oral cavity will need to undergo transoral biopsy in the clinic to confirm the diagnosis of carcinoma. Of those patients who choose to participate in the study, an extra piece of tumor will be harvested for investigational purposes related to this trial.</description>

    <description>patient will undergo transoral pretreatment biopsy of the tumor. A comparable second tumor biopsy will be performed in the office after exactly 5 days of concurrent CRT (5 daily fractions of 180-200 cGy radiotherapy and a single cycle of Cisplatin or Carboplatin/5-FU based chemotherapy).Blood plasma and single-void urine specimens will be collected contemporaneously,before and after 5 days of concurrent CRT.</description>

             less than two years post menopausal) and unable to confirm adequate contraception
             (abstinence, IUD, birth control pills, or spermicidal gel with diaphragm or condom)
             since last menses.

          -  History of chronic inflammatory disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease,
             rheumatoid arthritis or pancreatitis).

          -  Corticosteroid use within 6 weeks of enrollment, excluding topical nasal sprays.
