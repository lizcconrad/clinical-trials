  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the food supplement called Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) may help boost the effectiveness of the nasal flu vaccine. Preliminary
      data from several studies of healthy volunteers suggest that LGG boosts the immune response
      to vaccines. Fifty-two subjects will be recruited into the study, all will receive the nasal
      flu vaccine. Twenty-six will receive capsules that contain LGG, 26 will receive placebo
      capsules. Blood and nasal specimens will be collected weekly for four weeks and at eight
      weeks to evaluate the initial mucosal and systemic immune response to the immunization. This
      study will provide preliminary data on whether the immune response of healthy adults to the
      nasal influenza vaccine can be boosted by LGG.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-49 years

          -  Available for clinic visits at Tufts-New England Medical Center

          -  Written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
             (HIPAA) obtained

          -  Ability of participant to understand and comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any medical conditions for which the CDC states should not be vaccinated
             with LAIV (asthma, reactive airways disease, other chronic disorders of the pulmonary
             or cardiovascular systems; metabolic diseases such as diabetes, renal dysfunction, and
             hemoglobinopathies; or persons with known or suspected immunodeficiency diseases)

          -  Self-reported vaccination with the influenza vaccine for the current influenza season
             (2007-8); vaccination with any vaccine within the one month period prior to study
             enrollment or intent to receive any other vaccine during the study period;
             hypersensitivity to any influenza vaccine components including thimersol or egg or
             Guillain-Barre syndrome

          -  Self-reported treatment with immunomodulator/immunosuppressor drugs (interleukins,
             corticosteriods (oral or inhaled)), G(M)-CSF in 4 weeks before enrollment or
             self-reported history of IL-2 administration within 5 years; use of theophylline
             preparations or warfarin because of the theoretical possibilities of enhanced drug
             effects and toxicities following influenza vaccination; medication use that might
             affect the immune response to a vaccine or effects of LGG (no antibiotics during the
             previous 4 weeks)

          -  Current alcohol, substance abuse, or systemic/psychiatric illness that potentially
             could interfere with compliance and ability to make study visits

          -  Health care or day care workers or close contacts with immunosuppressed persons
             because of the theoretical risk that LAIV could be transmitted to the immunosuppressed
             person and cause disease, per CDC recommendations

          -  Use of LGG or other probiotics in 4 weeks before enrollment. Yogurt consumption is not
             an exclusion criteria, but subjects will be asked to avoid consumption of other
             lactobacilli and probiotic organisms during the study period

          -  Abnormalities upon physical examination

          -  Acute febrile illness on day of intended immunization - immunization deferred until
             illness resolved

          -  Routine laboratory tests outside the limits outlined for this study:

               1. hemoglobin &gt;=11.5g/dL for women; &gt;=13.5 g/dL for men

               2. WBC 3,300-12,000 cells/mm^3

               3. Differential within normal range

               4. Platelets 125,000-550,000 /mm^3

               5. ALT &lt;= upper limit of normal

               6. Serum creatinine &lt;= upper limit of normal

               7. Normal urinalysis (negative glucose, negative or trace protein, and negative or
                  trace hemoglobin)

               8. Negative beta-HCG pregnancy test (urine or serum) for women presumed to be of
                  reproductive potential because LAIV is contraindicated in pregnant women

               9. negative HIV test

              10. negative hepatitis B surface antigen

              11. negative anti-HCV
