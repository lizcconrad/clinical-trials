  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational study utilising anonymised individual patient clinical
      and prescribing information routinely collected by UK General Practitioners (GPs). This
      information will be observed for two years, one year pre and one year post- &quot;Index
      Prescription Date&quot; (IPD). The IPD is the date when a patient was first switched to any option
      of the step-3 asthma treatment regimen. The one year before the IPD is the baseline period
      and will be reviewed for risk factors and confounding factors. The one year after the IPD is
      the outcome period and will be observed to see the outcomes of the new treatment.
