      Researchers want to find out if urine heavy metal levels are changed in persons who use
      Mineralox Basic Câ„¢ (Mineralox). Mineralox is a zeolite (clinoptilolite) in combination with
      Vitamin C. Zeolites are natural supplements (nutraceuticals) that work at the cellular level
      to remove heavy metals and toxins that are accumulated in every day life safely from the body
      through the urine. The study doctor will give Mineralox to 20 people in this study to see if
      it helps with the heavy metal removal from the body.
