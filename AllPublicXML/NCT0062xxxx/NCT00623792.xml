      The purpose of the trial is to determine whether a preoperative lifestyle intervention
      (targeting diet, exercise, and preparation for surgery) will favorably impact obesity-related
      parameters prior to bariatric surgery and improve short-term postoperative outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a preoperative lifestyle
      intervention that targets diet, exercise, and preparation for surgery as an adjunct to the
      surgical treatment of obesity. Patients will be randomized to a 6-month lifestyle
      intervention (n = 100) or to usual care (n = 100) prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. We
      aim to evaluate the effect of the intervention on select pre- and postoperative outcomes. We
      hypothesize that patients who participate in the preoperative intervention will exhibit
      greater improvements in weight and related outcomes and better preparation for surgery than
      those who receive usual care. After operation, we hypothesize that patients who participate
      in the intervention will exhibit better compliance and fewer behavior-related eating
      problems, as well as a lower rate of complications and fewer outpatient visits with
      surgery-related conditions than those who received usual preoperative care. Our secondary aim
      is to determine whether the intervention affects weight/BMI trajectory through 24 months
      after operation.
