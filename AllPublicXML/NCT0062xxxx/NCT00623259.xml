      Monocentric study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA-HIV
      multiantigen vaccine MVA-mBN120B in HIV-infected subjects. 15 subjects will receive
      immunizations at day 0, after 4 and 12 weeks at a dose of 2E8 TCID50 MVA-mBN120B. The vaccine
      will be administered subcutaneously.

          -  Adequate hepatic function defined as:

               1. Total bilirubin &lt; = 2 x ULN unless elevation is explained by antiviral therapy
