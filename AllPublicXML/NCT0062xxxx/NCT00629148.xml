  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      sequential use of vinorelbine and capecitabine as first line therapy in patients with MBC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of vinorelbine and capecitabine had been implied to be quite useful in
      metastatic breast cancer. This study was designed to explore whether sequential and
      simultaneous use of vinorelbine and capecitabine have similar efficacy and whether the
      sequential way has better tolerability.
