  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although serum alpha-fetoprotein level and abdominal sonography are the main methods to
      screening hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients, the adequate time and methods
      used are not completely well-defined. This study aims to assess the better timing and methods
      for prospectively screening HCC in patients with cirrhosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Well-diagnosed consecutive patients with cirrhosis were enrolled through a designed
      questionnaire to obtain basic information about gender, age, etiology of cirrhosis,
      conventional liver function tests, serum AFP level, education level, substance use including
      smoking, alcohol drinking, betel quid chewing, history of familial HCC, etc. Then the
      patients was followed by periodic abdominal sonography examination and determination of AFP
      and liver function. If AFP elevated or liver nodule appears, effort to diagnose HCC will be
      performed.If HCC was performed, the survival will be followed-up. As anti-viral therapy was
      found to decrease risk for HCC, patients with those therapy will be excluded.
