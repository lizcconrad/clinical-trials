  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transudative pleural effusions are a common manifestation of patients with congestive heart
      failure. Severe dyspnea and respiratory failure may develop in those with large effusions,
      which in general show poor response to medical treatment. Therapeutic thoracenteses (TT) may
      be indicated in these patients and can produce marked relief of symptoms. However, the
      underlying effect of TT on gas exchange and respiratory mechanics in theses patients remains
      unclear. The researchers' hypothesis is that,TT may improve arterial oxygenation and
      respiratory mechanics in patients with congestive heart failure complicated by large pleural
      effusions.
