    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at concentrations of GSK189075, WELLBUTRIN SR
      and active metabolic products in blood samples when doses of both drugs are taken by mouth.
      Doses are either taken alone or together. The results will help to determine if doses of
      GSK189075 and WELLBUTRIN SR can be safely taken together.
