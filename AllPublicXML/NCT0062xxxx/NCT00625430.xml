    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a
      gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy for prostate cancer. FP253 contains an ovine
      atadenovirus that expresses the E. coli enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) under
      the control of a prostate-directed promoter. PNP converts systemically administered
      fludarabine (the prodrug) into 2-fluoroadenine (the active agent) at the site where FP253 has
      been administered (the prostate). This localized conversion is expected to provide
      organ-targeted chemotherapy that should reduce the systemic side effects associated with
      classical chemotherapy and also reduce the risk of debilitating damage to tissues surrounding
      the prostate.

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability
      of FP253 for prostate cancer. FP253 contains an ovine atadenovirus that expresses the E. coli
      enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) under the control of a prostate-directed
      promoter.

      SUBJECT POPULATION: Up to eighteen male subjects (6 groups of 3 subjects) who have a
      histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, still have their prostate in situ,
      have evidence of progressive disease despite continuous androgen deprivation therapy and who
      meet all eligibility criteria, will be enrolled into this study.

      STUDY DESIGN: This study is designed as an open-label, dose escalation trial in which each
      patient in a cohort will receive a single defined dose. Subjects will be enrolled
      consecutively into 6 escalating dose groups each of 3 subjects. Each subject will receive the
      treatment as outlined in the protocol and will be followed up for a further 2 years at
      regular intervals for life, as defined by current standard of care.

      TREATMENT: Subjects will be administered a single injection of FP253 followed by five doses
      of Fludarabine phosphate as outlined in the Intervention section.

      SAFETY PARAMETERS: Adverse events will be recorded and physical examinations, 12-lead ECG,
      vital sign monitoring, urinalysis and collection of blood samples for pathology laboratory
      tests will be performed at regular intervals during the study to monitor safety. The shedding
      of viral vector will be monitored as per regulatory requirement until negative.

      ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS: In order to assess any haematological or immunological effects of this
      novel agent or any effects on tumour response and survival, the following will be assessed:

        -  Biochemical and Haematological Markers: including Prostate-Specific Antigen,

        -  Immunopathological Markers: including haematological markers and indicators of
           cytotoxicity,

        -  ECOG assessment,

        -  Assessment of disease progression and survival.

      DATA ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize key data including
      demographics, vital sign measurements, ECG parameters, clinical laboratory parameters, immune
      response, tumour response, adverse events and concomitant medication. The general strategy of
      the safety analysis will be to examine the data summaries for any trends in safety parameters
      across the dose levels. No formal hypothesis will be tested.

      A formal data analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed the study period
      (28 days) and an interim analysis will be performed after the first 3 dose cohorts have been
      completed. For the first year, three monthly follow up reports will be produced followed by 6
      monthly reports for the second year and a final follow up report when all subjects have
      completed 2 years of follow up. Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarise key
      data including demographics, vital sign measurements, ECG parameters, clinical laboratory
      parameters, immune response, tumour response, adverse events and concomitant medication. The
      general strategy of the safety analysis will be to examine the data summaries for any trends
      in safety parameters across the dose levels. No formal hypothesis will be tested.

Group A: 1 x 10Exp9 virus particles (VP); Group B: 3.2 x 10Exp9 VP; Group C: 1 x 10Exp10 VP; Group D: 3.2 x 10Exp10 VP; Group E: 1 x 10Exp11 VP; Group F: 3.2 x 10Exp 11 VP.
If there are no dose-limiting toxicities, three additional patients may be treated at the highest dose.

        Inclusion Criteria (Prostate Cancer Categorization):

        Subjects will have adenocarcinoma of the prostate which is progressive despite androgen
        deprivation therapy.

        Subjects MUST fulfil each of the following criteria for inclusion in this study:

          1. Biopsy of the tumour must have been performed and histological status of
             adenocarcinoma of the prostate documented. The diagnostic prostatic biopsy will have
             taken place at least 4 weeks prior to the planned day 1.

          2. Subjects will have their prostate in situ.

          3. Biochemical evidence of prostate cancer recurrence; defined as a rise over 3
             successive PSA measurements spanning a minimum of 3 months (no lower limit of PSA
             exclusion).

          4. Subjects will have been treated with androgen deprivation therapy and will remain on

          3. Have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          4. Have agreed to remain confined to the clinical testing facility for the first 3 days
             (2 nights) of the study.

          5. Have adequate baseline organ function.

          6. Have an ECG which is normal, or, if there is any abnormality, it must be considered to
             be clinically insignificant in the context of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria (Prostate Cancer Categorization):

        study:

          1. Subjects who have had prior radical prostatectomy.

          2. Subjects who are expected to die of prostate cancer within 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria (General):

        Subjects with any of the following criteria will NOT be eligible for participation in this
        study:

          1. Hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, fludarabine, pegfilgrastim or similar compounds.

          2. Contraindications to fludarabine: subjects with decompensated haemolytic anaemia.

          3. Contraindications to pegfilgrastim: known hypersensitivity to E. coli derived
             products.

          4. Other associated or concomitant medical conditions that would interfere with the
             conduct of the study in the opinion of the treating physician.

          5. Have used an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             preceding the first dose of study medication.

          6. Are immunocompromised or have used immunomodulatory agents/therapy within the 6 months
             preceding the initial treatment.

          7. Subjects who, at the sole discretion of the Investigator, are judged to be unsuitable
             for participation in the study.
