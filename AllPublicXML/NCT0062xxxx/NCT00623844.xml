      Objectives: The PAKT project shall evaluate the effects of an exercise intervention in
      kindergarten combined with an educational training of parents and kindergarten teachers on
      behavior and health status of children.

      Study design: Baseline measurements were performed on more than 700 kindergarten children
      aged 43-67 months in May to July 2007. The kindergartens are located in and around Wuerzburg
      in Germany. Kindergartens were then randomized in an intervention (21 kindergartens) and a
      control (20 kindergartens) group. The intervention group offers a daily exercise class
      lasting at least 30 min. Parents and teachers of the children in the intervention program
      receive educational training. In addition, the children have activity homework involving the
      entire family. The control kindergartens keep their routine. Follow-up measurements of
      physical activity (actigraph), motor skills, body mass index, skinfold thickness, and blood
      pressure take place in January/February 2008, June/July 2008, and September/October 2008. The
      number of accidents in and outside of the kindergartens and the number of children missing
      the kindergarten due to infections are monitored continuously.

      Use of results: If the PAKT program should proof effective, the results will be published in
      scientific journals and made public using the press. With the help of the GEK, the program
      will then be implemented nationwide in kindergartens.
