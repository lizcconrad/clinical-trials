      Inhaled medications are often used to treat lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis. We are
      performing this study to determine whether inhaled medications dissolved in surfactant-based
      solutions will distribute more evenly throughout the lungs when compared to standard
      saline-based solutions. We think that inhaling medication that is in a surfactant-based
      liquid will result in more medication reaching partially blocked parts of the lung. This
      study will use a special nuclear medicine test called an aerosol deposition scan to compare
      how a drug spreads in the lung using a surfactant-based aerosol compared to a saline-based
      aerosol.

    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive
      system of about 30,000 children and adults in the United States (70,000 worldwide). The lungs
      of a person with cystic fibrosis often contain thick sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and
      lead to life-threatening lung infections. A major milestone in the treatment of CF was the
      development of an inhaled form of an antibiotic drug called tobramycin. For an inhaled
      antibiotic to work it must be delivered to all infected parts of the lung. Many studies have
      shown that blockages in the lungs, like those found in CF patients, can prevent inhaled
      medicines from reaching all parts of the lungs.

      Usually aerosolized medications are dissolved in saline or water. Most of these medications
      could be dissolved in surfactant solutions and aerosolized. Soaps are common examples of
      surfactants. Surfactants may have the ability to spread medication over the inside surface of
      the lungs similar to the way dish soap spreads over water. We think that inhaling medication
      that is in a surfactant-based liquid will result in more medication reaching partially
      blocked parts of the lung. We further believe that the normal movements of the lung
      associated with breathing will further spread surfactant-based aerosol medications, and
      contribute to even more even drug distribution over longer periods of time.

      A surfactant-based inhaled antibiotic would have the potential to reach more sites of
      infection in the lung, possibly getting rid of infection all together. This study will use a
      special test called an aerosol deposition scan to compare how a drug spreads in the lung
      using a surfactant-based aerosol compared to a saline-based aerosol. The study includes one
      screening and two testing visits.

    <description>Measured change in central/peripheral (c/p) dose ratio over a 30 minute period after aersol delivery (c/p at t=30 - c/p at t=0). Central and peripheral lung doses are measured as radioactive counts depicted on nuclear medicine gamma camera images after radioisotope aerosol delivery. The central lung zone is a rectangle with 1/2 the height and 1/2 the width of a box outlining the whole right lung. The peripheral lung zone is defined as the portion of the lung outside of the central lung zone. A change in c/p ratio over time would indicate transport of material from one lung zone to the other. The variable represents the realtive proportion of airways dosing to alveolar dosing - an indication of deposition uniformity in the lungs.</description>

    <time_frame>30 minutes after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Change over 30 minutes in the percentage of the total deposited aerosol dose found in the peripheral lung zone. We are reporting the %peripheral dose at t=30 minus the %peripheral dose at t=0. This dose is determined based on measured radioactive counts after aerosol delivery, using nuclear medicine gamma camera images. The central lung zone is defined as a rectangle with 1/2 the height and 1/2 the width of a rectangle that surrounds the right whole lung. The peripheral zone is the portion of the lung image not included in the central lung zone.</description>

        <title>Peripheral Lung Dose</title>
        <description>Change over 30 minutes in the percentage of the total deposited aerosol dose found in the peripheral lung zone. We are reporting the %peripheral dose at t=30 minus the %peripheral dose at t=0. This dose is determined based on measured radioactive counts after aerosol delivery, using nuclear medicine gamma camera images. The central lung zone is defined as a rectangle with 1/2 the height and 1/2 the width of a rectangle that surrounds the right whole lung. The peripheral zone is the portion of the lung image not included in the central lung zone.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Our aerosol delivery method resulted in more peripheral distribution than was anticipated. The more peripheral deposition pattern likely affected the location and quantity of deposited calfactant available to cause transport.</limitations_and_caveats>
