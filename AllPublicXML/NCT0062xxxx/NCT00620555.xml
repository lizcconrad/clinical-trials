    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities and Treatment-Related)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 53 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug was considered an adverse event (AE), without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse events: those which occurred or worsened after baseline. Severe AEs: those which interferes significantly with participant's usual function. An AE resulting in any of the following outcomes, was considered to be a serious adverse event: death; life-threatening; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Response Ratio calculated by the following equation : Response Ratio = (T minus B) divided by (T plus B), where T is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 52-week treatment period, and B is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 6-week baseline period of the previous study A9451162 (NCT00603473).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Responder Rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with a 50 percent or greater reduction in the seizure frequency per 28 days for the 52-week treatment period in comparison with the frequency per 28 days for the 6-week baseline period of the previous study A9451162 (NCT00603473).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in Seizure Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in seizure frequency (PCH) was calculated as follows: PCH = 100*(T minus B) divided by B, where T is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 52-week treatment period, and B is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 6-week baseline period of the previous study A9451162 (NCT00603473).</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Seizure Frequency</title>
        <description>Percent change in seizure frequency (PCH) was calculated as follows: PCH = 100*(T minus B) divided by B, where T is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 52-week treatment period, and B is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 6-week baseline period of the previous study A9451162 (NCT00603473).</description>

        <population>Intent to treat (ITT): Subjects who have received at least one dose of the study drug and in whom the number of epileptic seizures used for efficacy assessment has been counted in both the baseline and treatment periods.

            <description>Pediatric participants received gabapentin three times daily for 52 weeks. Participants aged 3 to 12 years received oral solution (250 mg/5 mL) at the dose calculated based on their body weight; 40 mg/kg/day for 3 to 4 years old and 25 to 35 mg/kg/day for 5 to 12 years old but not exceeding 1800 mg per day. Participants aged 13 to 15 years received gabapentin tablet at the dose of 1200 or 1800 mg/day. The dose was adjusted within the range of maintenance doses. Gabapentin could be increased if necessary with the maximum dose of 50 mg/kg/day for participants aged 3 to 12 years; All participants could receive gabapentin tablet not exceeding 2400 mg per day.</description>
