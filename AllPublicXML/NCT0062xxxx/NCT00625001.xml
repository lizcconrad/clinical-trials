    <textblock>
      Turner Syndrome (TS) is associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis. Reduced bone mineral
      density (BMD) and increased risk of fractures are present in many younger and middle-aged
      women with TS. The objective is therefore to describe longitudinal changes in BMD in TS.

      The study is an observational follow-up study. Examinations at baseline, after 5 and 10
      years.

      Bone mineral density is measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and bone turnover
      by bone markers.

      Main Outcome Measures: Bone mineral density (BMD; grams/ square centimetre) were measured at
      lumbar spine, hip and the non-dominant forearm.
