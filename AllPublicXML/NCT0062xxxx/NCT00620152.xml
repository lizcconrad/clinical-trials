    <textblock>
      In this study, we evaluate whether dietary advice based on two healthy nutritional programs
      can be effectively delivered to families over one month by telephone. We hypothesize that
      among overweight school age children, a one-month telephone intervention will result in
      specific dietary changes consistent with the randomly assigned dietary intervention.

    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity have increasingly become problems faced by children. However, the best
      dietary approach for managing weight in children remains unclear and how to make dietary
      advice practical remains a challenge. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the
      feasibility of a one-month telephone-based dietary intervention for pediatric obesity in
      achieving changes in the target variable (dietary glycemic load or dietary fat) of the
      assigned intervention. We hypothesis that among overweight school age children, a one-month
      telephone intervention will elicit specific dietary changes consistent with the randomly
      assigned prescriptions. Specifically, children counseled to reduce glycemic load will achieve
      a significantly greater mean reduction in glycemic load than those counseled to reduced
      dietary fat and, conversely, those counseled to reduce dietary fat will achieve a
      significantly greater mean reduction in dietary fat than those counseled to reduce glycemic
      load. The first ten participants enrolled will comprise a pilot study group intend to inform
      study design/methods and will not be included in the primary analysis.
