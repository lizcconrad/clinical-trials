      The aim of this study is to evaluate if acupuncture prevents or reduces nausea or vomiting
      during radiotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with acupuncture is, despite sometimes unclear evidence, increasing in cancer care.
      Acupuncture is used for indications such as pain and nausea, but for radiotherapy (RT)
      induced nausea it is still an unexplored treatment. For evaluation of the method, the use of
      sham acupuncture as a control treatment provides a tool resembling placebo for drugs. The aim
      of the studt is therefore to investigate whether acupuncture reduces nausea caused by
      radiotherapy in a patient group with a &gt;50% risk of experiencing the symptoms (abdominal or
      pelvic region). Patients are randomised to invasive acupuncture (IA) or placebo acupuncture
      (PA) 30 min, 2-3 times/week during the whole RT period. IA is administered bilaterally to the
      point PC6 using an invasive needle and PA with a needle, which looks identical but is not
      pointed and is not fixed in its handle. When this comes into contact with the surface of the
      skin and gives a feeling of penetration it glides upwards in its handle and is therefore
      shortened, which gives an illusion that the needle has entered the tissue. Nausea and
      vomiting is documented in diaries and questionnaires under the entire treatment period as
      well as two and four weeks after radiotherapy.

    <description>Acupuncture was administered bilaterally to the standard antiemetic point2-4 pericardium six (PC6) located between the tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpii radialis at two body-inches proximal of the wrist crease. Sharp needles, diameter 0.25 x length 40 millimetres, were inserted into a depth of a half body-inch. One body-inch (or a &quot;cun&quot; in traditional Chinese medicine context) is equivalent to the greatest width of the individual patients´ thumb at the distal phalanx, approximately one and a half centimetres or one American thumb. The needles were manipulated three times (at the start, middle and end of the treatment session) by twirling, thrusting and lifting until deqi occurred.</description>

    <description>Sham acupuncture was administered bilaterally to a non-acupuncture point two body-inches proximal of PC6 with the telescopic Park sham device16, 0.30 x 40 millimetres (fully extended length). That needle looks identical with a real needle but is blunted and glides upwards into its handle instead of penetrating, which gives an illusion of penetration. The marking tubes hold the needles in place. The therapist gave an illusion of manipulation by turning the needle three times, each time for a couple of seconds until the needle touched the skin, but no deqi occurred. Except when placing and manipulating the sham needle, it was not pressed against the skin at all.</description>
