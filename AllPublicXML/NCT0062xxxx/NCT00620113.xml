  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the dose-response on the percent change from baseline
      in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar vertebrae 1 to 4 (L1- L4) when
      odanacatib (MK-0822) 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or placebo is orally administered once weekly for 52
      weeks to Japanese involutional osteoporosis participants. The study will also assess safety
      and tolerability of odanacatib (10, 25, and 50 mg) in these participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 280 participants and randomly assign them to 3 different
      doses of odanacatib or placebo for 52 weeks, along with supplemental vitamin D3 and calcium
      carbonate. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that a dose-response relationship on the
      percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD (L1- L4) is seen when odanacatib 10, 25, 50
      mg or placebo is orally administered once weekly for 52 weeks to involutional osteoporosis
      participants. The primary safety hypothesis is that odanacatib will be safe and well
      tolerated over 52 weeks to involutional osteoporosis participants.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Observation visit to Wk 0 treatment visit), Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>BMD (g/cm2) data was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at lumbar spine vertebrae 1 through 4 (L1-L4) from anterior view at the Observation visit (up to 5 weeks before Treatment Period), Week 0 (start of Treatment Period) and Week 52 (end of Treatment Period) or at discontinuation. Baseline was defined as the average of the 2 values collected at the Observation visit and Week 0 visit. Percent change from baseline in BMD = ([BMD at Week 52 visit] - [baseline BMD] ÷ baseline BMD) × 100. Measurements were performed using the Hologic Quantitative Digital Radiography (QDR) Series densitometer, and by same machine and under same scan mode throughout the study period. BMD data was centrally judged.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants That Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose up to Post-Study (up to 54 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure (sign), function (symptoms), or chemistry of the body (laboratory data) temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's products (including placebo), whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product was also an AE. The number of participants that experienced at least one AE was reported for each treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 52 in Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Lumbar Vertebrae 1 to 4 (L1-L4)</title>
        <description>BMD (g/cm2) data was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at lumbar spine vertebrae 1 through 4 (L1-L4) from anterior view at the Observation visit (up to 5 weeks before Treatment Period), Week 0 (start of Treatment Period) and Week 52 (end of Treatment Period) or at discontinuation. Baseline was defined as the average of the 2 values collected at the Observation visit and Week 0 visit. Percent change from baseline in BMD = ([BMD at Week 52 visit] – [baseline BMD] ÷ baseline BMD) × 100. Measurements were performed using the Hologic Quantitative Digital Radiography (QDR) Series densitometer, and by same machine and under same scan mode throughout the study period. BMD data was centrally judged.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 52 in Trochanter BMD</title>
        <description>BMD (g/cm2) data was measured by DXA at the trochanter subregion of the hip (near bony protrusions along outside edge of femur) at the Observation visit (up to 5 weeks before Treatment Period), Week 0 (start of Treatment Period) and Week 52 (end of Treatment Period) or at discontinuation. Baseline was defined as the average of the 2 values collected at the Observation visit and Week 0 visit. Percent change from baseline in BMD = ([BMD at Week 52 visit] – [baseline BMD] ÷ baseline BMD) × 100. Measurements were performed using the Hologic QDR Series densitometer, and by same machine and under same scan mode throughout the study period. BMD data was centrally judged.</description>
