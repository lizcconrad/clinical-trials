  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are precursors of colon cancer; their
      prevention would correlate with cancer risk and their elimination would reduce that risk. In
      this study we wished to (1) establish the feasibility of stain-enhanced magnification
      colonoscopy, (2) determine whether colorectal cancer is asociated with increased numbers of
      ACF, and (3) investigate the natural history of ACF and the durability of their elimination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are randomly assigned at the time of stain-enhanced magnification colonoscopy to
      have any ACF removed or merely observed. Subjects are evenly divided into those with and
      those without a personal history of colon cancer. ACF are tabulated by an observer blinded to
      the subject's personal history. All subjects are then re-evaluated after one year by an
      observer blinded to the original procedure.
