    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of using
      Rapamycin to prevent chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) during and after the tacrolimus
      taper in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      Our hypothesis is that the T cells that can cause chronic GVHD are suppressed but not
      eliminated by calcineurin inhibitors. Therefore, when the calcineurin inhibitors are
      discontinued, the T cells may get activated and result in GVHD. Rapamycin on the other hand
      will allow anergy formation and thus when discontinued, T cells should not get activated. The
      schedule is designed to have therapeutic rapamycin levels as the tacrolimus is discontinued.
      Rapamycin will be continued as a single agent for additional 4 weeks and be tapered off in
      two weeks.

    <description>Rapamycin will be initiated 24 weeks post SCT, while the patient is on Tacrolimus. The initial dose of rapamycin is 12 mg of loading dose, followed by 4 mg daily. The dose will be adjusted to keep trough level at 3-12 ng/dl. Rapamycin will be continued at the therapeutic dose for 4 additional weeks after Tacrolimus is stopped. Rapamycin will then be tapered off over 2 weeks. The patients will be on 50% of steady state dose for one week and 25% of the steady state dose for the last week.</description>

The rate of taper will be 25% every to weeks for patients on 4 mg or more tacrolimus daily. For the patients on 3 mg or less of tacrolimus, the dose will be reduced 1 mg every two weeks, and the last dose will be 1 mg every other day for two weeks.</description>

      <desc>AE reporting from study entry to one month following completion of study therapy. This period includes study therapy during taper of tacrolimus, continuing for one month after discontinuation of tacrolimus and then a 2 week taper period of study drug. For most subjects this will amount to 3-4 months of monitoring for adverse events.</desc>

          <description>Rapamycin: Rapamycin will be initiated 24 weeks post SCT, while the patient is on Tacrolimus. The initial dose of rapamycin is 12 mg of loading dose, followed by 4 mg daily. The dose will be adjusted to keep trough level at 3-12 ng/dl. Rapamycin will be continued at the therapeutic dose for 4 additional weeks after Tacrolimus is stopped. Rapamycin will then be tapered off over 2 weeks. The patients will be on 50% of steady state dose for one week and 25% of the steady state dose for the last week.
Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus target level is 5-10 ng/dl. Tacrolimus taper will start at 26 weeks post SCT. Tacrolimus will be tapered off over 4-8 weeks. The rate of taper will be 25% every to weeks for patients on 4 mg or more tacrolimus daily. For the patients on 3 mg or less of tacrolimus, the dose will be reduced 1 mg every two weeks, and the last dose will be 1 mg every other day for two weeks.</description>
