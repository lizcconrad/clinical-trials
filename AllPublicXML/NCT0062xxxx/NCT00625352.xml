  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cares for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) become one of the
      common clinical practices oncologist are now facing. So, we need to seek adequate regimens
      for them. Gemcitabine is well known to be one of active third generation agents in terms of
      both efficacy and tolerability. Gemcitabine alone have been recommended as first line
      treatment for elderly NSCLC patients, especially in the aspect of tolerability. However,
      gemcitabine alone is suggested to be suboptimal to control their disease. Therefore, we plan
      to make an optimal regimen containing gemcitabine for the elderly patients.
