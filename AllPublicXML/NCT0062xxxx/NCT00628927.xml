  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether performance on neurocognitive measures
      predicts treatment outcomes in individuals with substance abuse disorders. A second purpose
      is to compare the risk of damage, as well as actual damage, to DNA and other cell parts in
      people with substance abuse disorders to that of people who do not have substance abuse
      disorders.

      The primary objective of this study is to replicate the finding that performance on the
      Stroop color-word interference task is predictive of treatment completion in participants
      with cocaine use disorders and to extend this finding to participants with Methamphetamine
      use disorders. Secondary objectives include evaluating whether:

        1. performance on various neurocognitive measures, including the Stroop, Rey
           Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Iowa Gambling Task (GT), Wisconsin Card Sorting
           Task (WCST), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale version -11 (BIS-11), and the Frontal
           Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) is predictive of treatment attrition and stimulant use
           outcomes in METH/cocaine abusers;

        2. neurocognitive test performance is associated with oxidative damage, a severe
           consequence of oxidative stress, in METH/cocaine abusers;

        3. oxidative damage is predictive of treatment attrition and substance use outcomes in
           METH/cocaine abusers,

        4. oxidative damage in METH/cocaine abusers is significantly greater than that of a normal
           comparison group and

        5. exploratory analyses reveal a significant relationship among oxidative stress,
           neurocognitive function, and treatment outcomes in METH/cocaine abusers.

    <description>The primary objective of this study was to replicate the finding that performance on the Stroop color-word interference task is predictive of treatment completion in participants with cocaine use disorders (Streeter et al., 2007) and to extend this finding to participants with methamphetamine use disorders. In the Stroop, the participant is required to name the color of the ink in which a word is printed while inhibiting the overlearned response of reading the word (e.g., the word ''red'' might be printed in blue ink). The number of errors were subtracted from the time required (RT; Reaction Time) for each of the 3 trials, yielding three summary scores. The derived interference score is obtained by subtracting the RT for the first trial from the RT for the third trial.</description>

    <measure>Barrett Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single study visit</time_frame>
    <description>The BIS-11 consists of 30 self-report items, with responses in a four-point Likert-type scale (0 - 3)ranging from &quot;Rarely/Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always/Always&quot; and comprises three domains: Attentional impulsiveness (AI), Motor impulsiveness (MI), and Non-planning impulsiveness (NP); these three domains are summed to yield a total score; higher scores reflect greater impulsivity. The total score was utilized as the BIS-11 predictor measure (possible score range 0 - 90).</description>

      <recruitment_details>As an ancillary study to CTN-0031, six of the nine sites participating in CTN-0031 were chosen to participate in the present study. At the participating sites, participants who were randomized into CTN-0031 were eligible to be screened for the present study. Normal controls were recruited via advertising from one study site.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>6 stimulant abusers met at least one exclusion criterion, 3 for a history of stroke and 3 for a history of seizures. 2 of those 6 were incorrectly enrolled into the study. The most common exclusion criteria met by the normal control screeners was having a DSM-IV substance use diagnosis and positive urine toxicology screen.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Stroop Color-word Task</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study was to replicate the finding that performance on the Stroop color-word interference task is predictive of treatment completion in participants with cocaine use disorders (Streeter et al., 2007) and to extend this finding to participants with methamphetamine use disorders. In the Stroop, the participant is required to name the color of the ink in which a word is printed while inhibiting the overlearned response of reading the word (e.g., the word ‘‘red’’ might be printed in blue ink). The number of errors were subtracted from the time required (RT; Reaction Time) for each of the 3 trials, yielding three summary scores. The derived interference score is obtained by subtracting the RT for the first trial from the RT for the third trial.</description>

        <title>Barrett Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11)</title>
        <description>The BIS-11 consists of 30 self-report items, with responses in a four-point Likert-type scale (0 - 3)ranging from &quot;Rarely/Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always/Always&quot; and comprises three domains: Attentional impulsiveness (AI), Motor impulsiveness (MI), and Non-planning impulsiveness (NP); these three domains are summed to yield a total score; higher scores reflect greater impulsivity. The total score was utilized as the BIS-11 predictor measure (possible score range 0 - 90).</description>
