    <description>The experimental group will have a nutrition program based solely on measured resting metabolic rate. The nutrition plan will be a specific calorie level that will promote a 1-2.5 lb per week weight reduction. No experimental participants' nutrition plan will be below 1200 Kcal/day for women or 1600 Kcal/day for men. Second, the experimental group will receive a downloadable copy of a computerized nutrition software program (BalanceLog: Microlife USA, Inc. Golden, CO) that functions s on a Windows 2000-XP or Palm operating system.</description>

The diet will be follow current government based recommendations for carbohydrates (i.e. 55%), fat (30%), and protein (15%). Study participants will receive a standard paper-based food and exercise journal</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant between the ages of 18-65 years.

          2. Participant with a BMI (Body Mass Index &gt; 30.0 kg/m2)

          3. Have access and use email a minimum of 2-days per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is not pregnant or lactating: Weight loss is not recommended for pregnant
             women and extra energy requirements are essential for fetal development (Butte, Wong,
             Treuth, Ellis, &amp; O'Brian Smith, 2004; Durnin, 1991).

          2. Participant is not currently participating in any structured/self-help weight loss
             program. The elimination of individuals actively participating in a current weight
             loss program will reduce the potential of a carry-over effect from these weight loss
             modalities (Fife-Shaw, 2006).

          3. Participant has not attempted weight loss in the past 3 months. Same as number two.
