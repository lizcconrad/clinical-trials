  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to provide detailed information on the efficacy of indacaterol in
      terms of its effect on spirometry assessed forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over a
      24 hour time period.

          <description>In treatment period 1, patients received indacaterol 300 μg once daily for 14 days via single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI); in treatment period 2, patients received placebo to indacaterol once daily for 14 days via SDDPI; and in treatment period 3, patients received salmeterol 50 μg twice daily for 14 days via multi-dose dry-powder inhaler (MDDPI). There was a washout period of 14 days between each treatment period. Indacaterol and placebo to indacaterol were administered double-blind; salmeterol was administered open-label. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting β2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>

          <description>The entire study population included all 6 treatment groups who received indacaterol 300 µg once daily, placebo to indacaterol once daily, and salmeterol 50 µg twice daily via a single-dose (indacaterol and placebo to indacaterol) or multi-dose (salmeterol) dry-powder inhaler in 6 different sequences. Patients received each treatment for 14 days with a 14 day washout between each treatment period. Indacaterol and placebo to indacaterol were administered double-blind; salmeterol was administered open-label. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting β2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>

        <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose at the end of each treatment period. The analysis included baseline FEV1, defined as the average of the FEV1 values measured at 50 and 15 minutes prior to the first study drug administration in that period, as a covariate.</description>
