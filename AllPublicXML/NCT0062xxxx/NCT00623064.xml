      RATIONALE: Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, and gemcitabine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving lapatinib together with combination chemotherapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lapatinib when
      given together with cisplatin and gemcitabine as first-line therapy in treating patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended doses of lapatinib ditosylate when
           administered with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, and determine on the basis of
           acute dose-limiting toxicity in course 1 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract.

      Secondary

        -  To determine any relationship between drug exposure and adverse events in these
           patients.

        -  To assess the antitumor activity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lapatinib ditosylate.

        -  Lapatinib ditosylate, cisplatin, and gemcitabine hydrochloride: Patients receive oral
           lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-28, cisplatin IV on day 2, and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity until the recommended dose
           of lapatinib ditosylate is determined.

        -  Lapatinib ditosylate, cisplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride: Subsequently enrolled
           patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate (beginning at one dose level below the
           recommended dose determined in the previous combination) once daily on days 1-21,
           cisplatin IV on day 1, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes. Courses repeat
           every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly.
