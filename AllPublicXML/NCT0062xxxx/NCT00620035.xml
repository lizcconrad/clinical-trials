      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the next generation applicator
      and its instructions for proper insertion of the Radiopaque Implant. Secondary objectives
      include: evaluation of implant removal, evaluation of the overall contraceptive efficacy and
      safety of the Radiopaque Implant, assessment of x -ray visibility of the Radiopaque Implant,
      and to assess participant expectations and satisfaction with the Radiopaque Implant.

    <description>In order to evaluate efficacy and ease of use of the Next Generation Applicator (NGA), the investigator/applicator user (AU) completed a User Satisfaction Questionnaire on Day 1 after the 12th implant insertion. The domain, 'Design/technical aspects' consisted of five questions: fit of the applicator in the hand, size, weight, handling, and color of the applicator were assessed. The percentage of AUs who were very satisfied and satisfied was presented.</description>

    <description>Radiopaque Etonogestrel Implant (drug) inserted with the Next Generation Applicator (NGA)
The Radiopaque Implant is a single rod contraceptive implant of 4 cm length and
2 mm in diameter which is placed at the inner side of the non-dominant upper-arm
about 8-10 cm above the medial epicondyle. The Radiopaque Implant contains
approximately 68 mg etonogestrel (ENG) dispersed in a matrix of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer and barium sulfate, surrounded by an EVA membrane. The barium-sulfate provides radio-opacity and allows detection by X-ray.
The ENG dose released from the implant amounts to about 60-70 mcg/day shortly after insertion and decreases to about 40 mcg/day at the start of the second year, and to about 25-30 mcg/day at the end of the third year.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Applicator Users Who Were Very Satisfied and Satisfied- User Satisfaction Questionnaire for Domain: Design &amp; Technical Aspects</title>
          <description>In order to evaluate efficacy and ease of use of the Next Generation Applicator (NGA), the investigator/applicator user (AU) completed a User Satisfaction Questionnaire on Day 1 after the 12th implant insertion. The domain, 'Design/technical aspects' consisted of five questions: fit of the applicator in the hand, size, weight, handling, and color of the applicator were assessed. The percentage of AUs who were very satisfied and satisfied was presented.</description>

            <description>The Radiopaque Implant is a single rod contraceptive implant of 4 cm length and 2 mm in diameter which is placed at the inner side of the non-dominant upper-arm about 8-10 cm above the medial epicondyle. The Radiopaque Implant contains approximately 68 mg etonogestrel (ENG) dispersed in a matrix of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer and barium sulfate, surrounded by an EVA membrane. The barium-sulfate provides radio-opacity and allows detection by X-ray.
The ENG dose released from the implant amounts to about 60-70 mcg/day shortly after insertion and decreases to about 40 mcg/day at the start of the second year, and to about 25-30 mcg/day at the end of the third year.</description>
