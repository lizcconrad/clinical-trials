      The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of warfarin versus placebo,
      administered for 6 months, in the prevention of thromboembolic complications after
      transvenous cardiac devices implantation in high-risk patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous lesions following cardiac devices implantation are a common complication of
      transvenous access that may cause disease manifestations and difficulties during
      reoperations. These lesions tend to develop early, and their incidence decreases gradually
      within 6 months after device implantation. Ventricular dysfunction and previous transvenous
      temporary leads ipsilateral to the permanent implant are risk factors identified in a
      previous study performed at our institution and other risk factors have been reported
      recently.The usefulness of prophylactic therapeutic strategies to prevent these
      complications, however,remains unknown. This randomized trial examined the effects of
      warfarin in the prevention of these complications in high-risk patients. After device
      implantation, patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or warfarin.
      Periodical clinical and laboratorial evaluations were performed to anticoagulant management.
      Following the six-month period, every patient was submitted to a digital subtraction
      venography.
