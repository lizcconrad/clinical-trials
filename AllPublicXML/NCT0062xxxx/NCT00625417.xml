      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as optical spectroscopy, may help learn the extent of
      disease and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying optical spectroscopy to see how well it works in
      evaluating tumor margins in patients who have undergone surgery for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To develop a non-invasive detection tool that evaluates breast tumor margins in
           real-time to guide tumor resection during partial mastectomy procedures.

        -  To conduct an ex vivo optical spectroscopic study in operating rooms on breast tissue
           samples obtained immediately following resection to assess the efficacy of using this
           tool in differentiating breast tumor or tumor margins from normal breast tissue.

      OUTLINE: Breast tissue samples obtained immediately following resection are examined in the
      operating room using optical spectroscopy to evaluate the margin tissue. During spectroscopy,
      all lights, except for the surgical lights, are turned off and the lateral, superior, medial,
      inferior, deep, and anterior margins of the breast tissue sample are examined using a
      fiber-optic probe, a nitrogen laser, and a broad band white light source. Reflectance and
      fluorescence spectra are measured at each of these margins by a system operator. The measured
      margins are then immediately marked by sutures placed by the surgeon. Additional margins may
      be measured at the surgeon's and system operator's discretion. The breast tissue sample is
      then delivered to surgical pathology, where shave biopsies are performed at the suture-marked
      sites to provide a direct correlation between spectroscopy measurements and tissue pathology.

      Data collected in this study, including spectral data, gross diagnosis of the patient's
      tumor, and histological identities of all specimens collected, will be kept in the research
      record for at least 6 years after the study is finished.
