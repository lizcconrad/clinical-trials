      To compare in terms of HbA1c insulin naive patients with Type 2 Diabetes starting with
      insulin glargine on an algorithm with insulin naive patients starting with insulin glargine
      on the physician's standard practice.

      To compare in terms of FBG insulin naïve patients starting with insulin glargine on an
      algorithm with insulin naïve patients starting with insulin glargine on the physician's
      standard practice.

      To compare the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c&lt; 7% in each treatment group.

      To compare hypoglycaemic events (minor, severe and nocturnal) between groups.

      To compare average insulin dose between groups.

      To compare PRO (patients' reported outcomes) between groups.

      To compare mean changes in body weight between treatment groups.

    <description>For the control group (following the physician's standard practice) a minimum of 4 visits to the clinic is required.

    <description>In the group following the algorithm, fasting SMBG will be asked 3 times a week until FBG&lt;100 mg/dl is achieved. Afterwards, 1 fasting SMBG will be asked weekly. Pre-prandial SMBG will be performed at the discretion of the physician.
For the group following the algorithm, during the titration period, weekly telephone contacts will be required and a minimum of 4 visits to the clinic.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes.

          -  Patients in treatment with OADs (one or more) for at least 1 year who failed metabolic
             control (HbA1c &gt; 8% and &lt; 11%).

          -  FBG &gt; 130 mg/dl and &lt; 240 mg/dl.

          -  BMI &lt; 40 kg/m2 and &gt;25 kg/m2.

          -  Ability and willingness to follow a tight anti-diabetic therapy and to perform SMBG
             controls.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  C peptide &lt; 0.30 nmol/l.

          -  Unexplained weight loss of more than 10% of body weight in the last 6 months.

          -  Pregnant women or women with the intention of becoming pregnant.

          -  Women with childbearing potential who will not use contraceptive protection.

          -  Breastfeeding women.

          -  Patients using or that have used rapid or ultra-rapid acting insulins; except for
             those patients that have used rapid or ultra-rapid insulins during intercurrences such
             as AMI, severe infection or surgery.

          -  Renal impairment defined as serum creatinine &gt;1.4 mg/dl in women and &gt;1.5 mg/dl in
             men.

             the study protocol (non selective beta blockers and systemic corticosteroids).

          -  History of drug or alcoholic abuse.

          -  Diabetic retinopathy with surgical treatment in the 3 months prior to study entry or
             which may require surgical treatment within 6 months of study entry.

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, neurological,
             endocrine, hematological, oncologic or other major systemic disease making
