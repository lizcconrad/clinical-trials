    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of peginesatide used to
      treat anemia in subjects diagnosed with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer
      or prostate cancer and who also receiving a taxane chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Currently approved erythropoiesis stimulating agents have been used successfully to increase
      hemoglobin levels, reduce fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms, improve daily function,
      and alleviate the need for transfusions of red blood cells in subjects with chronic kidney
      disease-related anemia or in cancer subjects with chemotherapy-induced anemia.

      Peginesatide (hematide) Injection is a parenteral formulation for administration by
      intravenous or subcutaneous injection that is being developed for the correction of anemia in
      patients with chronic kidney disease, including patients on dialysis and patients not on
      dialysis, and for the treatment of patients with anemia due to concomitantly administered
      chemotherapy.

      This is a multicenter, open-label dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and efficacy of multiple doses of peginesatide Injection in subjects with refractory
      non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. These subjects must have
      anemia diagnosed as a result of taxane chemotherapy.
