    <textblock>
      An international, multi-centre, prospective three arm parallel-group, phase II proof of
      concept study comparing the efficacy and safety of two dosage regimens (BID 7 days and TID 7
      days) of TD1414 2% cream and one dosage regimen (BID 7 days) of Bactroban® (mupirocin) 2%
      cream in adults and children down to 2 years of age with impetigo or SITL. Furthermore an
      evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of TD1414 2% cream TID for 7 days will be performed. A
      total of 664 patients will be enrolled in a stepwise manner according to age groups starting
      with the oldest age group.

Clinical cure will be either of the following:
Total absence of signs and symptoms of impetigo/SITL or
Improvement - total SIRS score reduced to &lt;8 and all individual clinical signs/symptoms included in the SIRS score should be ≤ 4
Bacteriological cure will be:
Documented eradication
Presumed eradication
Documented infection with a pathogen different from the baseline pathogen, and the pateient is NOT symptomatic.</description>
