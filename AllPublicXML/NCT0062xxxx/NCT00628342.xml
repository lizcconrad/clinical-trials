  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes patients with sleep disturbances associated with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) and has 3 treatment arms. Patients will receive only one of the following
      treatment arms: esomeprazole 20 mg once daily, esomeprazole 40 mg once daily, matching
      placebo once daily. The relief to the sleep disturbances will be assessed.
