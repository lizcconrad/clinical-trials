    <textblock>
      Trials evaluating new therapies for stopping or slowing the progression of ALS depend
      critically upon the use of outcome measures to assess whether a potential treatment is
      effective. The more effective an outcome measure, the fewer patients need to be enrolled and
      the shorter the trial. Many outcome measures have been used over the years, including
      strength assessments, breathing tests, functional status surveys, and nerve testing, but all
      are far from ideal. A new method, called electrical impedance myography (EIM) appears to be
      especially promising in that it provides very consistent data from one testing session to the
      next, is sensitive to the muscle deterioration that occurs in ALS, and is entirely painless
      and non-invasive. In this study, investigators from multiple institutions plan to compare
      several different outcome measures, including EIM, in approximately 120 ALS patients, with
      each patient being followed for a period of one year. All of these measures will be compared
      to one another and an assessment of their ability to detect disease progression made. Our
      goal will be to determine whether EIM can serve as a valuable new outcome measure, ultimately
      leading to substantially faster, more effective ALS trials requiring fewer patients.

    <description>The main outcome measure was the coefficient of variation (CoV) in the rate of the decline for each measure over time. The CoV was calculated by dividing the standard deviation in the rate of decline across the group of subjects and dividing that by the mean rate of decline for the cohort. This approach was taken for each of the measures being evaluated (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, Handheld dynamometry, Electrical impedance myography). The lower the CoV in the rate of decline, the more sensitive it is to identifying a potential treatment effect, since it suggests gives a measure of homogeneity of the rate of decline across the population as well as the overall rate of decline. The smaller the standard deviation across the group and the larger the mean rate of decline across the group, the lower the CoV and the fewer number of subjects needed for a potential clinical trial using that outcome measure.</description>

          <description>The main outcome measure was the coefficient of variation (CoV) in the rate of the decline for each measure over time. The CoV was calculated by dividing the standard deviation in the rate of decline across the group of subjects and dividing that by the mean rate of decline for the cohort. This approach was taken for each of the measures being evaluated (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, Handheld dynamometry, Electrical impedance myography). The lower the CoV in the rate of decline, the more sensitive it is to identifying a potential treatment effect, since it suggests gives a measure of homogeneity of the rate of decline across the population as well as the overall rate of decline. The smaller the standard deviation across the group and the larger the mean rate of decline across the group, the lower the CoV and the fewer number of subjects needed for a potential clinical trial using that outcome measure.</description>
