    <textblock>
      This human physiologic study will evaluate the effects of a new drug called CD-NP in
      individuals with stable chronic heart failure, with a focus on evaluating responses of the
      kidneys and the hormonal system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD-NP is a novel chimeric natriuretic peptide which was created by combining the 22 amino
      acids of human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and the 15-amino-acid C-terminus of
      Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP). The rationale for selecting CNP, a natriuretic peptide
      of endothelial cell origin, is that it exhibits predominantly venodilating effects, which may
      minimize systemic hypotension. Moreover, its anti-proliferative action is also a highly
      desirable property for novel cardiovascular drugs. However, a limitation of CNP is that it
      does not exert significant renal actions, whereas, DNP is potently natriuretic and diuretic.
      Thus, CD-NP was synthesized with the goal of combining the above complementary profiles of
      CNP and DNP into a single chimeric peptide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and non-pregnant female subjects, aged 21 or above, with stable chronic HF of
             primary cardiac etiology, resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤ 40 %
             documented within the last 2 years, and New York Heart Association functional class I
             - III symptoms

          2. Be willing to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known allergy or other adverse reactions to exogenous natriuretic peptides (CD-NP or
             its components, nesiritide, other natriuretic peptides, or related compounds).

          2. Women who are pregnant, or breast-feeding.

          3. Having received nesiritide for within 7 days prior to prior to entry into the study.

          4. Having received any investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to entry into
             the study.

          5. Clinically unstable patients (e.g. systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg, ongoing
             requirement for vasopressors or mechanical circulatory support, or mechanical
             ventilation).

          6. Recent hospitalization for decompensated HF or recent defibrillation for cardiac
             resuscitation within 30 days prior to randomization.

          7. Prior organ transplantation, being on a waiting list for organ transplantation, or
             ongoing requirement for longterm vasoactive support.
