    <textblock>
      Description: Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune, chronic and recurrent blistering disease
      with unknown etiology that affects mucosa and skin of patients with significant morbidity and
      mortality.

      The treatment back-bone is based on prednisolone administration. There are controversies on
      the opportunity of adding immunosuppressive drugs. For some, they are just corticosteroid
      sparing drugs. For others, they are disease modifying drugs.

      The purpose of this trial is to compare efficacy and safety of azathioprine vs. placebo in
      new cases of pemphigus vulgaris treated with prednisolone.
