  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study in which your cells will be used for somatic cell nuclear transfer
      (SCNT), and/or genetic reprogramming research which may result in the production of stem cell
      lines. This study does not provide treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that studies of genetic reprogramming and SCNT using human cells have the
      potential to give us new basic knowledge about human development. Current work will focus on
      developing this basic knowledge. In the future, human embryonic stem cell lines (hESC)
      derived from genetic reprogramming and SCNT may also have the potential to develop into cell
      types that are useful for cell-based therapies to treat human disease and disability.
