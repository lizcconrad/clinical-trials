    <measure>Exercise Duration Time Assessed by Constant-load Cycle Ergometry at the End of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>End of each 3 week treatment period (last day of Weeks 3 and 9)</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of each 3 week treatment period, patients completed constant-load cycle ergometry testing at a work-rate of 75% of the Wmax determined at Screening. This work-rate was maintained until symptom limitation caused the patient to stop exercising. The time from the start of loaded pedaling until the patient stopped exercising was recorded.</description>

    <description>At the end of each 3 week treatment period 60 minutes before inhalation of study drug, IC was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. The mean of 3 acceptable measurements was calculated and reported in liters.</description>
