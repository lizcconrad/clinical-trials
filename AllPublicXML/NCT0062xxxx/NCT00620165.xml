  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor poses one of the greatest therapeutic challenges to neurologists. This study
      will examine the effectiveness of the drug, levetiracetam or keppra, for the treatment of
      essential tremor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently available pharmacological treatments for essential tremor are hampered by
      relatively low efficacy and intolerable side effects. Recent evidence indicates that
      levetiracetam (LEV) may modulate the dopaminergic system. In this regard LEV has been shown
      to reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesias, tardive dyskinesia and myoclonus, and is relatively
      well-tolerated in the elderly. Previous studies examined the efficacy of LEV for the
      treatment of essential tremor. However, these were either open label or relatively short
      duration studies. A longer term study of LEV for the treatment of essential tremor is
      therefore warranted. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study,
      ten subjects with essential tremor will be randomly assigned to receive either LEV up to a
      maximum dose of 3000 milligrams (mg) per day or placebo. Study drug will be titrated up over
      6 weeks and continued at 1500 mg twice daily for an additional 6 weeks. Following a 4 week
      washout period subjects will cross over to the other arm and continued for an additional 12
      weeks. Subjects will be evaluated monthly by a blinded examining neurologist and research
      coordinator. At each study visit subjects will receive a neurological examination and will be
      evaluated using a 16-item scale for tremor and medication side effects. The data derived from
      study drug vs. placebo groups will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon W tests.
