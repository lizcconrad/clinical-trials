  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present research study is to investigate for the first time, the safety
      and tolerability of infusion doses of AP214 in subjects having heart surgery such as coronary
      bypass graft and/or valve repair or replacement surgery. AP214, the investigational drug, is
      being developed to potentially prevent post-surgical kidney injury after thoracic aortic
      aneurysm repair.
