      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with
      paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving sorafenib together with
      paclitaxel and to how well it works in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib tosylate and paclitaxel by measuring tumor
           response, as defined by RECIST criteria, in patients with metastatic, HER2-negative
           breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate six-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate clinical benefit rate (tumor response and stable disease) at 24 weeks in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To examine the relationship of gene expression and tissue/serum protein markers, where
           available, related to response to therapy focusing on growth factor receptor pathways.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28 and paclitaxel IV over 1
      hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
