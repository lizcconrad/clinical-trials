  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia is the leading cause of death in end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) patients treated with hemodialysis (HD). As it is anticipated that the number
      of individuals with ESRD will exceed 1.2 million in the next 20 years, sudden death in this
      population has enormous public health impact. Research has shown that arrhythmic events are
      temporally associated with longer periods between HD with a three-fold risk of events in the
      12 hours preceding the longest inter-dialysis interval. The exact cause of these findings is
      unknown.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of cardiac electrical instability at
      various times in the dialysis cycle. The hypothesis is that longer time intervals between
      hemodialysis results in sympathetic and electrolyte-induced alterations in ventricular
      repolarization that can be measured non-invasively using microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA).
      This increase in cardiac electrical instability may serve as a link between the clinically
      observed periods of increased risk and the occurrence of sudden cardiac death.
