  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of patient education (PE) in patients with
      arthritis. PE has become a task that is dictated by law in Norway, and is increasingly used
      as an element in the treatment of patients with chronic complaints. Our hypothesis is that

      - PE delivered as group education, followed by an individual nurse consultation increases the
      patients wellbeing an ability to cope with the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a rather long tradition of PE for patients with arthritis. A recent systematic
      review found that PE had small short-term effects on disability, joint counts, patient global
      assessment, psychological status and depression, but this effect disappeared on the latest
      time of follow up (3-14 months). A recent large British study also failed to show an effect
      on pain, physical functioning, or contact with primary care after 12 months, but found a
      significant effect on anxiety and improved the participants' perceived self efficacy. This
      indicates that the present forms of interventions fails to show a long term effect. One
      possible reason for the lack of long term effect might be that these interventions are given
      to groups only. Patients seem to prefer one-to-one interaction regarding information about
      the disease and its treatment together with emotional aspects, while education in groups are
      preferred for physical training and relational topics.
