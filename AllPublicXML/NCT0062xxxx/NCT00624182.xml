    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response of
      different doses of URLC10 peptide emulsified with Montanide ISA51 in combination with
      gemcitabine. Recommended phase II dose will be also determined.

    <textblock>
      Our previous studies have demonstrated that up-regulated lung cancer 10 (URLC10) has been
      identified as a new target of tumor associated antigen using cDNA microarray technique
      combined with the expression profiles of normal and cancer tissues. We have also found that
      100% of tissue samples from bile duct cancer express URLC10. We have determined the
      HLA-A*2402 and HLA-A*0201 restricted epitope peptides derived from URLC10.These epitope
      peptides have shown to induce specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL). Furthermore, 60% and
      20% of Japanese population have HLA-A*2402 and HLA-A*0201, respectively. Therefore, these
      peptides are suitable for clinical trial. On the other hand, gemcitabine is a drug approved
      against bile duct cancer. Recent studies has reported that gemcitabine has an additional
      ability to improve immune response. From these results, synergistic effect between vaccine
      therapy and chemotherapy using gemcitabine will be expected.

      In this clinical trial, we evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune responses of
      different doses of URLC10 peptide emulsified with Montanide ISA51 as immunochemotherapy in
      the patients with unresectable or recurrent bile duct cancer. Toxicity profiles will be
      monitored, and antigen specific T cell responses will be described.
