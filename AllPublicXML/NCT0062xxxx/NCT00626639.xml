      Oral Mucositis associated with adjuvant radiation and concurrent chemotherapy in
      postoperative Head and Neck setting

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of 2 phases. The acute oral mucositis (OM) evaluation phase includes the
      time from randomization to the time of severe OM (WHO Grade 3 or 4) resolution (up to Week 12
      or up to Week 15 for participants whose severe OM is not resolved at Week 12). In the acute
      OM evaluation phase, participants were randomized to receive either a single IV bolus dose of
      palifermin or placebo at 120 μg/kg, 3 days before the start of radiotherapy, plus 7
      once-weekly palifermin or placebo doses at the same dose level during a 7-week
      radio/chemotherapy course. In the long-term follow up phase, participants are followed until
      death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up. The long-term follow up phase is still
      ongoing.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12 (or Week 15 for participants with severe OM was not resolved by Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is an undesirable medical occurrence (sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition occurring after start of study drug up to the end of acute oral mucositis (OM) evaluation phase, whether or not considered to be study drug related. If severe OM was not resolved by Week 12, AEs were documented until resolution of severe OM or Week 15, whichever occurred first. A serious AE is any event that is fatal, life threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The intensity of AEs was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3 based on the following: Grade 1 = Mild AE, Grade 2 = Moderate AE, Grade 3 = Severe AE, Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 = Death related to AE. A Protocol-specific Limiting Toxicity (PSLT) is any non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 AE considered related to study drug.</description>

    <description>The effect of palifermin on cell proliferation was to be assayed by staining for the cell cycle proliferation marker Ki67 in buccal mucosal biopsy samples taken prior to the first dose and either 24 or 48 hours after the first dose. Due to the small sample size, this analysis was not performed.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event is an undesirable medical occurrence (sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition occurring after start of study drug up to the end of acute oral mucositis (OM) evaluation phase, whether or not considered to be study drug related. If severe OM was not resolved by Week 12, AEs were documented until resolution of severe OM or Week 15, whichever occurred first. A serious AE is any event that is fatal, life threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The intensity of AEs was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3 based on the following: Grade 1 = Mild AE, Grade 2 = Moderate AE, Grade 3 = Severe AE, Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 = Death related to AE. A Protocol-specific Limiting Toxicity (PSLT) is any non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 AE considered related to study drug.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits sponsor a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Sponsor may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multi-center studies, investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety and efficacy endpoints were not evaluable due to the limited number of subjects enrolled.</limitations_and_caveats>
