    <textblock>
      Postoperative arrhythmias (heart irregularities) are one of the most common complications
      after cardiac surgery and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Preoperative
      depression may be an important co-factor in the generation of postoperative arrhythmias due
      to sympathetic hyperactivity evident in patients with depression.

      Objectives: To determine the effect of preoperative depression on postoperative arrhythmia in
      patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

      Prospective observational study, 120 patients undergoing elective CABG surgery ECG will be
      preformed preoperatively on all patients. All patients will be assessed for signs of
      depression using the Prime MD Patient Health Questionnaire (Prime MD PHQ) one week before
      surgery and 6 weeks postoperatively.Based on the Prime MD PHQ results, patients will be
      divided into two groups: those with or without signs of depression. Heart rate and rhythm
      monitoring with Holter will be performed for 3 days postoperatively in order to compare the
      incidence of postoperative arrhythmias between groups.

      The primary outcome is the number of patients with and without depression suffering from
      ventricular and/or supraventricular arrhythmias. Secondary outcomes include all cause
      mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and congestive heart failure.

      CABG surgery is the most common operative procedure in North America and arrhythmias are one
      of the most common postoperative complication. It is estimated that about a third of these
      cardiac patients suffer from preoperative depression and therefore may be exposed to a higher
      risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. If an association between preoperative
      depression and postoperative arrhythmia is found, treatment modalities may be indicated to
      reduce the prevalence of perioperative arrhythmia in patients with preoperative depression
      undergoing cardiac surgery.
