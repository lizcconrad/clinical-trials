  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the long term safety and tolerability of an
      additional infusion of 10 billion VRX496 gene-modified CD4 T cells with a focus on evaluating
      additional therapeutic benefits with respect to viral load and CD4 counts.

      The study has concluded it's 9-month active phase. Subjects are currently in a 15-year Long
      Term Follow-up Phase of the study.

      In keeping with the recently released Guidance on Monitoring For Delayed Adverse Events, that
      states that for the first 5 years all subjects should undergo monitoring of vector sequences
      every 6 months, subjects will visit the clinic at a maximum of 6 months intervals for a blood
      test evaluating persistence of vector sequences.

      Therefore for the first 5 years, subjects will have 6 months visits for safety assessment.
      For years 6 to 15, subjects will be contacted by phone or mail. At these contacts, subjects
      will be asked about their health status.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability and willingness to give written informed consent in accordance with
             institutional and federal guidelines and to comply with the investigational nature of
             the study and the related requirements.

          -  Subjects who have successfully completed participation in the VRX496-USA-05-002 trial.

          -  Subjects who initiated or changed to a new ARV regimen more than 3 months prior to
             Entry Assessment are eligible.

          -  Subjects that who (1) if on ARVs and are willing to continue on the current therapy
             unchanged, or (2) if not on ARV willing to remain off ARVs for the duration of the
             trial i.e. 9 months. However, if there is clinical need to start or change ARV
             therapy, then it is permitted to do so.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CD4 counts decreased by ≥25% from baseline in main study.

          -  Viral load increased by ≥ 1.0 log from baseline in main study or ≥ 200,000.

          -  Female subjects who are of reproductive potential who have a positive serum B HCG at
             the Entry Assessment visit or are not willing to use a reliable method of barrier
             contraception.

          -  Are breast-feeding.

          -  Subjects who are actively using injection drugs or other substance abuse (such as
             extensive alcohol or narcotic use).

          -  Any medical condition(s) which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere
             with the subject's ability to participate in or adhere to the requirements of this
             protocol

          -  Active HIV-related or non HIV-related illness

          -  Subjects who do not have additional cell product available
