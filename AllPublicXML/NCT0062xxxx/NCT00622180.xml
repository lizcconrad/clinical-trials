  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess over a 25-week period the efficacy of hand-foot narrow-band ultraviolet B light
      versus focal 308-nm light treatment in inducing the return of pigment in vitiligo after skin
      minigraft transplants to the backs of the hands in patients with light brown to black skin.
      Subject will undergo treatment for 13 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Prospective investigator-blinded study involving 25 adult male and female subjects with
      vitiligo on the backs of both hands. Punch minigrafting will be performed on both hands
      taking skin from the thighs and/or buttocks. Light treatments will be administered starting
      at week one after grafting. One hand will receive narrow-band ultraviolet B light and the
      other will receive focal 308-nm light treatments. Light treatments will be administered 3
      times per week for 12 weeks. A long term follow-up visit will be completed at week 25. The
      investigator will evaluate the subjects at week 4, 7, 13 and 25 in addition to screening and
      baseline evaluations/procedures.
