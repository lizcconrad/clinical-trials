  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is safe and
      effective in reducing the amount of narcotic pain medication needed to control pain during
      the first 24 hours after herniorrhaphy.

    <textblock>
      Inguinal herniorrhaphy is a common surgery; and common surgical methods used include
      laparoscopic and open placement of synthetic mesh. The use of synthetic mesh can greatly
      reduce the risk of hernia recurrence regardless of the method used for its placement.
      Managing postoperative pain and preventing morbidity after open mesh herniorrhaphy remain
      considerable medical challenges.

      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at the
      surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.

      This study will compare the amount of narcotic pain medication required after surgery in
      patients who receive either the CollaRx Bupivacaine implant or a plain collagen sponge.
