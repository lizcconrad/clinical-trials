      The primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate in patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness that enoxaparin
           with Graduated Elastic Stockings is superior to enoxaparin-placebo with Graduated
           Elastic Stockings on overall mortality at day 30 after randomization.

      The secondary objective:

        -  To compare, in patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness, enoxaparin with
           Graduated Elastic Stockings versus enoxaparin placebo with Graduated Elastic Stockings
           on overall mortality at day 90 after randomization.

        -  To evaluate the safety of enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis in patients hospitalized for acute
           medical illness with respect to major hemorrhage, total bleedings, heparin induced
           thrombocytopenia, adverse events and serious adverse events .
