  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For chronic hepatitis C patients unresponsive to previous (PEG-)IFN/RBV combination therapy
      we propose continuous subcutaneous administration of high-dose IFN-a2b (Intron A®) for 48
      weeks in combination with 15 mg/kg/day RBV (Rebetol®) and optimal management of side effects
      in order to maintain the highest possible dosages of both IFN-a2b and RBV for 48 weeks. We
      expect improved tolerability with continuous subcutaneous pump delivery of IFN-a2b compared
      to thrice weekly or daily subcutaneous injection of IFN-a2b, and increased antiviral activity
      and biologic potency due to sustained and higher levels of a fully potent interferon protein.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatitis C genotype 1 unresponsive to (peg)interferon /ribavirin therapy

          -  In the past, peginterferon or conventional interferon plus ribavirin combination
             therapy for at least 12 weeks and less than 2-log HCV RNA decrease at week 12, HCV RNA
             positivity at week 24, breakthrough during therapy or relapse after therapy

          -  At least 12 weeks between end of (peg)interferon/ribavirin therapy and start of
             high-dose IFN/ribavirin therapy

          -  Persistent indication for antiviral therapy such as persistently elevated serum ALT or
             histological evidence of continuing or progressive fibrosis

          -  Age 18-60 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Signs of progressive liver disease since end of previous therapy, beyond generally
             accepted criteria for HCV antiviral therapy:

               -  serum bilirubin &gt;35 μmol/l, albumin &lt;36 g/l, prothrombin time &gt;4 sec prolonged or

                  Severe depression would include the following: (a) subjects who have been
                  hospitalized for depression, (b) subjects who have received electroconvulsive
                  therapy for depression, or (c) subjects whose depression has resulted in a
                  prolonged absence of work and/or significant disruption of daily functions.
                  Subjects with a history of mild depression may be considered for entry into the
                  protocol provided that a pretreatment assessment of the subject's mental status

             subject must have abstained from using the abused substance for at least 2 years

          -  Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
