      Purpose: To study the immune response of the newly licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      (PCV) in comparison to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) to determine if a
      significantly better immunologic response to boosting can be elicited in patients previously
      vaccinated with PPV.

    <description>Prevnar is manufactured as a liquid preparation. Each 0.5 mL dose is formulated to contain:
2 μg of each saccharide for serotypes 4, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F, and 4 μg of serotype 6B per dose (16 μg total saccharide); approximately 20 μg of CRM197 carrier protein; and 0.125 mg of aluminum per 0.5 mL dose as aluminum phosphate adjuvant. After shaking, the vaccine is a homogeneous, white suspension.</description>
