  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of recurrence in stage III and IV of colorectal cancers (CRC) is high during the
      three years following the tumoral resection with curative aim. Therefore, a prolonged
      follow-up and an intense monitoring are recommended to detect these recurrences precociously.
      Nevertheless, current consensual morphological and biological examinations are not very
      contributory, of difficult interpretation and expensive. The metabolic imagery in
      tomoscintigraphy by emission of positron coupled with the scanner, called PET-TDM, allows to
      identify more specifically recurrences, analyzes the whole body, detects hepatic metastasis
      more precociously and give some benefice for early diagnosis of lymph nodes recurrence. The
      principle purpose of this study is to evaluate if the systematic follow-up per PET-TDM allows
      detecting more often recurrences accessible to a curative surgery. We make the hypothesis
      that the systematic practice of PET- tomodensitometry (TDM) during the follow-up of CRC
      allows to decrease non curative recurrences appearance during the 3 years follow-up after a
      curative surgery.

      Patients will be randomized in two groups: one (PET-TDM group) including a semi-annual
      systematic PET-TDM during usual follow-up (M6, M12, M18, M24, M30 and M36 after initial
      surgery) and the second (control group) in which one PET-TDM will be realized only for
      current indication (high isolated markers or before a metastasis curative resection) during
      usual follow-up. Will be included patients with a high risk of recurrence of a colorectal
      tumor N+ or M+ completely removed (R0 or R1) or tumor stage 4, no regional lymph node
      metastasis, no distant metastasis (T4N0M0) operated in emergency (tumoral perforation).

      Patients will be followed-up during 3 years since the date of initial surgery. Conventional
      follow-up will be performed by consensual recommendations for all the patients. In the case
      of detecting a recurrence, the adapted treatment (surgery or chemotherapy or both) with
      curative aim will be implemented and the follow-up will be carried out in its term or death.
      In the case of non curable recurrence, the follow-up will be carried out in its term or
      death, and the PET-TDM will not be realised any more.
