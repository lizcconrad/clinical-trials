    <textblock>
      Most transient inhibitor formation, if any, will develop within the first 4 weeks. The study
      is to further monitor whether participants with severe Hemophilia A will develop inhibitors
      or antibodies at the later stage when switched from their current recombinant therapy
      produced from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line to Kogenate-FS raised in a Baby Hamster
      Kidney cell line.
