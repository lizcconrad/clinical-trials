  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are often associated with gastric ulcers. This
      study looks at the prevention of these gastric ulcers, in patients deemed to be at risk, with
      either esomeprazole 40 mg once daily; esomeprazole 20 mg once daily.
