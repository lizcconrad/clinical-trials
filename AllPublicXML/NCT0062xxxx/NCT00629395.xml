      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based, computerized
      attention training program with survivors of central nervous system (CNS) impacting pediatric
      cancer (e.g. acute lymphocyte leukemia [ALL], brain tumors).

      Specific Aim 2: To estimate the effect size of this attention training program with survivors
      of childhood cancer to determine whether a larger-scale clinical trial is warranted.

      Pediatric patients meeting initial eligibility criteria will be identified through the
      databases for each clinic (n = approximately 50 survivors in each clinic). A letter
      explaining the purpose of the study will then be sent to the parents of these patients.
      Interested parents will be invited to contact study personnel by phone or email for a
      thorough review of the study and to schedule a screening appointment.

      After obtaining written informed consent and assent (from parents and child, respectively),
      screening procedures will include administration of an abbreviated intellectual test battery,
      two working memory tasks, and a computerized attention measure to the survivor. Parents will
      complete questionnaire measures regarding their child's adaptive, behavioral, emotional, and
      attentional functioning; follow-up interviewing will be conducted to clarify any potential
      problems identified on the questionnaires. The entire screening procedure is estimated to
      take approximately 60 minutes for the survivor and 30-45 minutes for parents. To maximize
      efficiency, a research assistant will complete testing with the child and a psychologist will
      explain the questionnaire measures to the parent and conduct any follow-up interviewing.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A T-score greater than the 75th percentile on either the Cognitive
             Problems/Inattention or the DSM-IV Inattention subscales of the Conners' Parent Rating
             Scale

          2. One or more standard deviations below the mean on the Working Memory Index of the
             WISC-IV or a Working Memory Index that is one or more standard deviations below the
             participant's estimated IQ.

        These criteria are based on the eligibility criteria used in the largest trial to date of
        psychostimulant methylphenidate (MPH; commonly known as Ritalin) with survivors of
        childhood cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Estimated IQ â‰¤ 70

          2. Motor, visual, or auditory handicap that prevents computer use

          3. A diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant
             disorder (ODD), depression, autism, or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD)

          4. Insufficient fluency in English.

        Participants who are currently taking stimulant medications (stable dose for at least 30
        days) for attentional difficulties, but who meet inclusion criteria will be allowed to
        participate.
