  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this study to see if writing about life experiences helps women adjust to breast
      cancer that has spread. We will compare two groups. One group will write about their breast
      cancer experience. The other will write about their daily activities. What we learn from this
      study may help us to find new ways to help women cope with breast cancer that has spread.
