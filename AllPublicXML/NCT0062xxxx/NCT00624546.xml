  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the symptomatic and epithelial (histologic and endoscopic) response to antireflux
      therapy are well known and extensively studied, little is known of the genetic events
      occurring in response to proton pump inhibitor therapy. Preliminary data from our laboratory
      has shown, for example, that COX-2 expression is not only elevated in patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease but also can be correlated with pathologic esophageal acid
      exposure on 24 hour pH monitoring. Similar studies have suggested that antireflux surgery may
      normalize COX-2 gene expression. In contrast studies following ablation of dysplastic
      Barrett's epithelium have shown persistence of genetic changes associated with altered
      cellular function, despite the return of the histologic appearance to normal. Several key
      mediators of inflammation, metaplasia (Barrett's) and neoplasia have now been well
      characterized and shown to be important factors in the pathogenesis of esophageal injury. It
      is likely that successful antireflux therapy returns altered expression of these mediators
      toward normal although this hypothesis remains largely unexplored. The aim of this study is
      to investigate gene expression of key mediators of the spectrum of esophageal mucosal injury
      and the response to antireflux therapy.

      Hypothesis: Antireflux therapy (proton pump inhibitor and surgical fundoplication) normalizes
      the expression of genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation
      (esophagitis), metaplasia (Barrett esophagus) and neoplasia (adenocarcinoma).

      Aims: To determine the effects of antireflux therapy (pump inhibitor and surgical
      fundoplication) on gene expression of:

        1. inflammation: IL-8, IFN-g, TNF-a.

        2. intestinal metaplasia: CDX-1/2, MUC2 and Sonic hedgehog.

        3. Neoplasia: Cox-2, VEGF, and EGFR.
