  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the efficacy of a catheter with antibacterial surface coating in
      preventing central venous catheter related infection and the effect of an intensive hygiene
      and catheter care education of the nursing staff on preventing central venous
      catheter-related infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection depends on catheter type, method and site
      of insertion, aseptic technique and number of manipulations. To address this problem, efforts
      have focused on engineering biomaterials and surfaces with antibacterial properties to
      prevent bacteria adhesion and biofilm formation.

      In view of the necessity to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections and of the
      inadequacy of currently available antimicrobially coated devices, a new antimicrobial
      catheter surface was developed.

      Among other factors, the mode and quality of catheter handling and care of exit site is an
      important aspect with respect to catheter-related infections.

      The clinical study aims at providing data on antimicrobial efficiency of the 2 types of CE
      certified double lumen catheters and a supposed additional preventive effect of intense
      hygiene training on catheter-related infections.
