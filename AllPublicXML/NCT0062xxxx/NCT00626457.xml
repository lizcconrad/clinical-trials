  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Losing weight has many health benefits for women such as reducing the risk of heart attacks,
      high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer. However, women often struggle with maintaining the
      weight they have lost. This may be because they need to learn skills for maintaining weight,
      not just losing weight.

      When is the optimal time is to learn these maintenance skills? It may be better to lose
      weight first and then learn maintenance skills since people may feel good about the weight
      they have lost and be motivated to maintain. Alternatively, it may be better to learn
      maintenance skills first and then lose weight since they may experience how easy it is to use
      these maintenance skills and become confident they can maintain a weight loss in the future.

      Therefore, this study will examine whether learning these maintenance skills--before or after
      losing weight--helps women succeed at maintaining weight loss.

      This randomized trial will test whether learning a novel set of 'stability skills' before
      losing weight improves long-term weight management (i.e., during a subsequent follow-up
      period once classes and staff contact have ended). Overweight/obese participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions (Maintenance First or Weight Loss First). In the
      Maintenance First condition, participants will learn stability skills during a novel 8-week
      maintenance program before participating in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss
      program. In the Weight Loss First condition (usual care/active comparator condition),
      participants will participate in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program followed
      by a standard 8-week problem-solving skills maintenance program. Participants in both
      conditions will participate in identical standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss programs and
      be offered the same number of 90-minute weekly classes over the 6-month intervention period,
      (thus matching for time and attention from study-led health educators). Participants will be
      assessed at baseline and 6 months during the 6-month intervention period and at 12 and 18
      months during the subsequent 12-month follow-up period (i.e., after classes and staff contact
      have ended). There will be no intervention staff contact during the 12-month follow-up, only
      6, 12 and 18-month assessments. The primary aim will test whether participants in the
      Maintenance First condition gain less weight during the 12-month follow-up period (i.e., 6-18
      months) than those in the Weight Loss First (active comparator) condition. Secondary
      questions of interest include examining psychometrics of lifestyle behavior questions (e.g.,
      physical activity).

    <description>Physical activity will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months using the Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical item (L-Cat). The L-Cat is self-administered and comprised of six ordered activity categories that range from inactive to very active. Participants pick the category that best describes their activity during the past month.</description>
