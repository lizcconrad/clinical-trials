      language intervention group program for two-year-old children with language delay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Language delay in toddlers is a prevalent problem for pediatric practitioners. As there are
      no clear guidelines to deal with this problem, in German speaking countries the
      &quot;wait-and-see&quot;approach is widely chosen, although longitudinal studies have found that
      children with language delay are at risc for cognitive, behavioral and social-emotional
      problems.

      During the last few years various forms of early language intervention have been increasingly
      implemented in German speaking countries. However, they have not been evaluated.

      Early parent-based intervention could be an economical way in prevention speech and language
      disorders.

    <description>The HPLI is a group program for parents of young children with language delay. This 12-14week program includes seven two-our sessions and one three-our session six months later. It is designed for 5 to 10 people and based of an interactive model of language intervention, wich presumes that optimized parental input will provide better language-learning opportunities.</description>
