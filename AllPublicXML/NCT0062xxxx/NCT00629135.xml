  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is contemplating the antibiotic therapy of intraabdominal abscesses. These
      abscesses are a serious problem in surgical practice. Associated pathophysiologic effects as
      for example peritonitis may become life threatening or may lead to extended periods of
      morbidity with prolonged hospitalization.

      The objective of the sudy is to evaluate whether the combination of Moxifloxacin and
      Metronidazole is equivalent to Piperacillin / Tazobactam with regard to clinical outcome and
      eradication of aerobe and anaerobe pathogens in patients with intra-abdominal abscesses.

      The study is an interventional prospective, comparative, open-label, randomised single-centre
      study. Adult patients with intra-abdominal abscesses matching the criteria to be included
      will be enrolled in the study and randomised into one of the Groups: 1. Moxifloxacin 400 mg,
      administered intravenously once daily in combination with Metronidazole 500 mg, administered
      two times daily intravenously, followed by an oral medication with Moxifloxacin 400 mg once
      daily and Metronidazole 500 mg twice daily. 2. Piperacillin / Tazobactam 4,5 g administered
      intravenously three times daily.

      Primary study endpoints: Clinical success / failure rate at the Test-of-Cure visit.

      Secondary study endpoints: -Bacteriological response at TOC, -Clinical + Bacteriological
      response at End-of-Treatment-visit, - Course of disease on the basis of clinical and
      laboratory parameters, -Time to discharge from hospitals, -Duration of hospitalization
      post-operatively, - safety and tolerability of the study medication, -cost effectiveness of
      treatment regimes.
