      Originally test host's to understand the tracking healthily and immune change of the dengue
      fever in Taiwan. Blood drawing 20 c.c for liver examination, kidney and other biochemical
      function, analyze host immunity adjusts and controls the gene, and the reciprocation that may
      be produced with the virus hepatitis, besides collected 10 c.c urine at the same time. Urine
      check is in order to compare acute infect and infected over three month person, the change of
      chemical composition.

      This plan expect to collect 150 healthy, 150 dengue fever infected and 150 dengue fever bleed
      hot or dengue fever shock disease group's patient, goal to understand health state and
      immunity of follow-up adjust and control the difference of the gene and the reciprocation may
      produce to virus hepatitis of light disease and serious disease.

      The dengue fever is an important tropical infectious disease in the south of Taiwan, cause
      and threaten of public health at Kaohsiung and Ping-Dong all over the years, this will cause
      patient's death, the default of clinical change of dengue fever, acute infect, infect
      influence, host immunity adjust and control, and the reciprocation of virus hepatitis, will
      be a very urgent in basic research.

      Originally test host's to understand the tracking healthily and immune change of the dengue
      fever in Taiwan. Blood drawing 20 c.c for liver examination, kidney and other biochemical
      function, analyze host immunity adjusts and controls the gene, and the reciprocation that may
      be produced with the virus hepatitis, besides collected 10 c.c urine at the same time.

      This plan expect to collect 150 healthy, 150 dengue fever infected and 150 dengue fever bleed
      hot or dengue fever shock disease group's patient, goal to understand health state and
      immunity of follow-up adjust and control the difference of the gene and the reciprocation may
      produce to virus hepatitis of light disease and serious disease.

      Urine check is in order to compare acute infect and infected over three month person, the
      change of chemical composition. The result of study can help doctor to understand the factor
      of immune regulation and control of the host and health change after the dengue fever is
      infected with, possible reciprocation with virus hepatitis. Researchers have collect 100
      dengue fever bleed hot or dengue fever shock syndrome groups of patient, it is estimated that
      can collect and expect the case will be counted within two years.
