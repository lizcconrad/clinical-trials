             hyperbilirubinemia) in which case the total bilirubin should be ≤ 3.5 mg/dL], AST and
             ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN, hepatic alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5× ULN;

          -  LDH ≤ 1.5 × ULN;

             palliative in nature, not in the area where the tumor will be biopsied, at least one
             measurable lesion outside the radiation field, and all radiation-related toxicities
             have resolved to NCI CTCAE Grade ≤ 1 or patient's baseline;

             weeks prior to study entry or any other antitumor therapy, such as cytostatic and/or

             response modifiers within 4 weeks prior to study entry;

          -  Previous treatment with 17-AAG, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygel-danamycin

             conduction system disease; Patients with sinus bradycardia secondary to pharmacologic
             treatment may enroll if withdrawal of the treatment results in normalization of the
             resting heart rate to within normal limits;

          -  Screening QTc &gt; 450 msec in males; QTc &gt; 470 msec in females, or previous history of
