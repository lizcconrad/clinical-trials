    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effect of lower limb vibration therapy
      on bone density in the tibia in patients with spinal cord injury. The second purpose is to
      assess the neuromuscular junction variability at the motor units of the tibialis anterior
      muscle after a sequence of lower limb vibration therapy
