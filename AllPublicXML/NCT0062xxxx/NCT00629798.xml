  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see if the researchers can lower that risk by giving the patient Palifermin.
      This drug helps protect the lining of the mouth, throat, and stomach. These areas typically
      get sores or ulcers while the blood cell counts are very low. The patient can get infections
      in or from these sores. Palifermin might also help the immune system recover faster. It is
      currently approved for patients who receive their own stem cells. That is called an
      autologous transplant. This study will test the use of Palifermin for T-cell depleted
      allogeneic stem cell transplants.

    <description>This is a single arm phase II trial to assess the efficacy (decrease the transplant related mortality) and safety of peri-transplant Palifermin in combination with a preparative regimen with busulfan, melphalan, fludarabine, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and a T cell depleted stem cell transplant from a histocompatible related or unrelated donor in patients with advanced MDS and AML evolved from MDS. The addition of Palifermin is to decrease the toxicity and the infection rate associated with this regimen and transplant type and to foster earlier immune reconstitution.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive Palifermin 60 mcg/kg/day IV on three consecutive days with the last dose administered no less than 24 and no more than 48 hr prior to start of cytoreduction. The preparative regimen to be used for transplants will consist: of busulfan administered in 12 doses over three days of 0.8 mg/kg IV for patients &gt; or = to 4 years of age or 1.0 mg/kg IV for patients &lt; 4 years of age; melphalan 70 mg/m2 IV x 2 days; and, fludarabine 25 mg/m2 IV x 5 days</description>
