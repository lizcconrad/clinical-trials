  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of IV (intravenous) and PO (oral) formulations of
      linezolid among children with cystic fibrosis and establish a dose regimen that will be safe
      and effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis who have pulmonary exacerbations associated with the isolation
      of MRSA in their sputum will be identified by their primary physicians and by laboratory
      record review. If they meet the inclusion criteria, they will be invited to participate in
      the study. The primary outcome variables include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices.
      The study end points include completion of the sputum and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic
      studies of both intravenous and oral formulations of linezolid and collection of
      microbiologic specimen (sputum and anterior nares cultures) one month after discharge.
      Additionally, pharmacokinetic data will be analyzed for effects of age and CFTR mutation on
      clearance of linezolid and for relationship between levels of linezolid achieved in sputum
      and blood and clinical outcome

daily dose of linezolid at 15 mg/kg/dose Intravenously (IV) based on subject's weight at study entry, over half an hour period, every 8 hours for a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 28 days total. The primary doctor may change the route of administration of linezolid from IV to oral (by mouth)after 72 hours on IV formulation and demonstrated clinical improvement based on the clinical evaluation by the primary doctor and comparison of cystic fibrosis exacerbation criteria scores before and after initiating treatment with linezolid.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &lt; 18 years of age inclusive, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
             being admitted to the hospital for acute pulmonary exacerbation with MRSA isolated
             from sputum culture.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             the first dose of study drug, and if sexually active agrees to use an acceptable
             method of birth control per investigator judgment for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who are receiving medications with serotonergic (such as certain types of
             antidepressants) and adrenergic activity that can not be discontinued based on
             clinical judgment of the primary physician may be enrolled. These subjects will be
             monitored closely for serotonin- and sympathomimetic-associated toxicity.

          -  Subject (when able) and subject's parent /legal guardian agree to comply with the
             study requirements.

          -  Subject has sufficient venous access to permit administration of the study medication,
             collection of pharmacokinetic samples and monitoring of safety variables.

          -  Duration of linezolid therapy is expected to exceed 7 days.

          -  English and Spanish-speaking subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinical or laboratory evidence of severe hepatic (Child-Pugh class C)
             disease

          -  Subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min)

          -  Subjects with a history of allergy to linezolid.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding subjects.
