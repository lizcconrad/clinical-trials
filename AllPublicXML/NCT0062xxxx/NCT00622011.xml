  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an organic psychiatric syndrome characterized by fluctuating consciousness and
      impairment in perception, cognition and behavior. In hospitalized elderly, the prevalence of
      delirium ranges from 10% to 40%. If untreated, delirium is associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality. Treatment of delirium consists of identifying and managing
      underlying medical abnormalities and the associated psychiatric symptoms. Conventional
      antipsychotics have been the mainstay of treatment of agitation and psychosis associated with
      delirium; but their use is limited in terms of EPS side effects. Second-generation
      antipsychotic agents have been reported to have a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side
      effects and tardive dyskinesia which has resulted in their increased use in the treatment of
      delirious patients. However, there is still no consensus regarding standard pharmacologic
      treatment of this syndrome that takes use of second-generation antipsychotic agents into
      account.

      Risperidone and zotepine have a lower incidence of EPS and are effective in treating
      disturbing psychotic behaviors. We hope to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone and
      zotepine in the treatment of delirium and the correlation between the severity of delirium
      with autonomic dysfunction.

      Qualified inpatients will be enrolled and randomly given a flexible-dose regimen of
      Risperidone or Zotepine. Autonomic dysfunction is checked using analysis of heart rate
      variability before any active drug given. The initial starting dose of each drug is
      1mg(risperidone) or 50 mg(zotepine) once a day. The dosage was increased depending on the
      status of delirium during the first 7 days and will be adjusted until patients are maximally
      stabilized or until intolerable adverse events necessitated cessation. Risperidone or
      zotepine will be tapered off in 10 days when patients are considered stable. No concomitant
      psychotropic medications will be used during the study except for lorazepam, which are given
      for severe agitation or insomnia . Patients are assessed by another rater blinded to active
      drug at the time of enrollment, the subsequent 12, 24,and then assessed daily until
      discharge. The study period is estimated to be around 12 months upon the designed number of
      subjects are reached.
