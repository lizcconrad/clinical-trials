  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who suffered from a rupture of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with instability of
      the knee joint, will be treated with an operative ACL-reconstruction. One group of patients
      will stay one night in the hospital and go home the other day (Group I). The other group of
      patients will go home the same day of surgery (Group II). All patients will undergo the same
      arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL. Anesthesia will be performed on each patient in a
      classic manner. At the end of the surgery each group of patients will be randomly divided in
      two subgroups: one group will get an injection in the knee joint with 20 ml of physiological
      fluid (Group Ia en IIa), the other group will get an injection in the knee joint with 20 ml
      of chirocaine 0.125%, a widely used pain-medicine (Group Ib and IIb). This will happen in a
      double blind, randomized way. The whole procedure takes about one hour. After surgery
      patients are brought to the recovery room and are observed every 30 minutes for the duration
      of 4 hours. Before being brought to their rooms, patients will have to fill in a VAS: Visual
      Analogue Scale, to determine their pain. After being brought to their rooms, the patients
      will have the choice of going home the same day or staying in the hospital for one night,
      according to the amount of pain they are in. That moment it will be possible to switch
      groups. Patients who go home the same day of surgery will be contacted by phone the day after
      to fill in a question form. Patients who were admitted for one night will be seen before
      their leave to fill in the same question form.
