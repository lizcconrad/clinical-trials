      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the HMY Model YA-60BB
      Intraocular Lens (IOL) when implanted in the posterior chamber of the human eye for the
      optical correction of aphakia following cataract extraction.

      A prospective, single-phase, non-randomized, open-label study to include patients with
      operable cataract of the human crystalline lens who have a potential post-operative best
      corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better and no pre-existing progressive sight-threatening
      ocular disorders. Patients who are eligible per inclusion / exclusion criteria will undergo
      phacoemulsification cataract extraction and then implantation of the Hoya HMY Model YA-60BB
      posterior chamber intraocular lens. Each patient will be followed-up at specific time
      intervals to assess safety and effectiveness, for up to 36 months.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients with cataract who are eligible for phacoemulsification cataract
             extraction of the lens through an incision of approximately 4 mm, and primary
             implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens.

          2. Patients must have no pre-existing ocular conditions that preclude the ability of the
             treated eye to achieve BCVA of 20/40 or better after IOL implantation.

          3. Patients must be at least 21 years of age.

          4. Patients must sign a written informed consent form.

          5. Patients must be able and willing to return for scheduled follow-up examinations after
             surgery throughout the 36 month study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of/or clinical signs of any of the following sight-threatening
             conditions:

               1. Previous Retinal Detachment or retinal pathology in operative eye, only

               2. Macular Degeneration in either eye

               3. Macular Edema in either eye

               4. Persistent Iritis/Uveitis in operative eye, only

          2. Uncontrolled Glaucoma or under current treatment for glaucoma in either eye

          3. Significant Corneal Disease in operative eye, only

          4. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy in either eye

          5. Patients who have had previous ocular surgery, of any kind, within the last 6 months
             or patients who have had previous ocular surgery at any time and who do not have
             potential BCVA after cataract extraction/IOL implantation of 20/40 or better

          6. Patients who have best corrected vision worse than 20/200 in the fellow eye.

          7. Patients with serious (i.e., life threatening) non-ophthalmic disease which may
             preclude study completion.

          8. Patients who have undergone previous cataract extraction and intraocular lens
             implantation.

          9. Patients unwilling or unable to sign the IRB-approved informed consent document for
             the study or who cannot or will not complete the study's examination schedule.

         10. Patients who are currently enrolled in another clinical trial, or who exited a
             clinical trial within the last 30 days.
