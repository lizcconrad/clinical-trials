    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a 10 week program of Stress
      Management versus control Patient Education sessions on cardiac responses to mental stress in
      veterans with Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled small clinical trial designed to determine whether a
      10-week program of group cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) versus a control
      &quot;Patient Education&quot; program can improve hemodynamic responses to mental stress testing in
      patients with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators. Comparison will be made between groups
      of heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental arithmetic and anger-recall mental
      stress, psychometric profiles, arrhythmia frequency and implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator firings before, immediately and up to 6 months after intervention. If benefit
      of CBSM is proven, study findings could lead to wider use of stress management programs, with
      increased life expectancy for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients.

    <measure>Mental Stress Induced Elevation in &quot;Double Product&quot; by Math Stress Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate to 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Mental Stress induced elevation in &quot;Double Product&quot; , (equal to Heart Rate , beats/minute, x Systolic Arterial Blood Pressure, mmHg), following serial heart rate and blood pressure measurements during mental stress task of mental arithmetic (serial subtraction). Heart rate and blood pressure responses were recorded at 2.5 minute intervals before , during, and after each test using a Philips automated blood pressure recording device. The math task was applied for 10 minutes, with 10 minutes recovery time. An average of 3 measurements was taken as baseline prior to stress tasks. Stress induced double product elevations were measured as the difference between baseline and maximal values in units of mmHg.beats/minute. Higher values represent a greater mental stress induced effect, and lower values, a lower effect.</description>

Heart rate and blood pressure responses were recorded at 2.5 minute intervals before , during, and after each test using a Philips automated blood pressure recording device. The anger-recall test was applied for 25 minutes with 10 minutes monitoring post-test. An average of 3 measurements was taken as baseline prior to stress tasks.

    <time_frame>6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate Variability measure of cardiac autonomic activity, believed to reflect a combination of cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
Data are derived from ambulatory ECG recordings during serial mental stress testing (math and anger-recall tasks) using a General Electric MARS Holter analysis system. Time series are created from beat-to-beat intervals, from which frequency domain measures are calculated. Low frequency heart rate variability correlates with cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Increased sympathetic activity and/or decreased parasympathetic activity occur in this study population at high risk for cardiac arrhythmia. Normalized units are used, reflecting percentage of total frequency power.</description>

Time series are created from beat-to-beat intervals, from which frequency domain measures are calculated. Decreased Low/High Frequency ratio reflects Increased High Frequency heart rate variability which correlates with increased cardiac parasympathetic activity, which may be beneficial in this patient population.

        <description>Maximum Mental Stress induced elevation in &quot;Double Product&quot; , (equal to Heart Rate , beats/minute, x Systolic Arterial Blood Pressure, mmHg), following serial heart rate and blood pressure measurements during mental stress task of mental arithmetic (serial subtraction). Heart rate and blood pressure responses were recorded at 2.5 minute intervals before , during, and after each test using a Philips automated blood pressure recording device. The math task was applied for 10 minutes, with 10 minutes recovery time. An average of 3 measurements was taken as baseline prior to stress tasks. Stress induced double product elevations were measured as the difference between baseline and maximal values in units of mmHg.beats/minute. Higher values represent a greater mental stress induced effect, and lower values, a lower effect.</description>

        <title>Low Frequency Heart Rate Variability</title>
        <description>Heart Rate Variability measure of cardiac autonomic activity, believed to reflect a combination of cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
Data are derived from ambulatory ECG recordings during serial mental stress testing (math and anger-recall tasks) using a General Electric MARS Holter analysis system. Time series are created from beat-to-beat intervals, from which frequency domain measures are calculated. Low frequency heart rate variability correlates with cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Increased sympathetic activity and/or decreased parasympathetic activity occur in this study population at high risk for cardiac arrhythmia. Normalized units are used, reflecting percentage of total frequency power.</description>

          <description>Heart Rate Variability measure of cardiac autonomic activity Data are derived from ambulatory ECG recordings during serial mental stress testing (math and anger-recall tasks) using a General Electric MARS Holter analysis system. Time series are created from beat-to-beat intervals, from which frequency domain measures are calculated. Decreased Low/High Frequency ratio reflects Increased High Frequency heart rate variability which correlates with increased cardiac parasympathetic activity, which may be beneficial in this patient population. Normalized units are used, reflecting percentage of total frequency power.</description>
          <population>Reduced numbers of participants analyzed reflect drop-outs or non-diagnostic recordings for heart rate variability analyses during follow-up, with inclusion only of participants having accurate and appropriate data.
Data are shown for Ratios of Low and High Frequency power shown above.</population>

Heart rate and blood pressure responses were recorded at 2.5 minute intervals before , during, and after each test using a Philips automated blood pressure recording device. The math task was applied for 10 minutes, with 10 minutes recovery time. An average of 3 measurements was taken as baseline prior to stress tasks. Stress induced double product elevations were measured as the difference between baseline and maximal values in units of mmHg.beats/minute. Higher values represent a greater mental stress induced effect, and lower values, a lower effect.</description>
