    <textblock>
      The purpose this study is to measure cortical gama-aminobutyric acid levels (GABA) levels in
      menopausal women with major depressive disorder and healthy subjects using nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Measurements will be compared in 1) menopausal healthy subjects
      before and after estrogen replacement, and after fourteen days of medroxyprogesterone
      administration; and 2) in depressed menopausal subjects before and after treatment of their
      depression with antidepressant alone, estrogen alone or antidepressant plus estrogen.
      Cortical GABA levels will be correlated with plasma GABA and neurosteroid levels.
      Neurosteroids to be measured include progesterone, allopregnanolone, pregnenolone, and
      pregnenolone sulfate.

    <description>This study was conducted at Yale University almost two decades ago. Our group at the University of Pennsylvania only has very basic information about this study. This includes the number of participants, which was 18, and the fact that no adverse events occurred. Staff members at the University of Pennsylvania do not have access to any additional study data. The contact person who initially entered this study protocol information is no longer at the University of Pennsylvania and we are unable to contact for additional information.
We only know that 18 participants completed, but as far as we know data was never analyzed for these 18 participants.</description>
