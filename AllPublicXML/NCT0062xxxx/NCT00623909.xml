    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the AvicennaTM class IV laser for
      application over the skin of human subjects. In addition, we seek to measure the
      effectiveness and utility of this class 4 laser therapy in the treatment of post-thoracotomy
      pain syndrome.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women age 25-65 years old with chest wall pain after lung surgery lasting more
             than 2 months after surgery.

          -  Subjects shall have failed conservative treatment which may include rest, physical
             therapy, braces, and over the counter anti-inflammatory medications. All those
             enrolled will be native English speakers and have at least a high school degree

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they are pregnant (which will be confirmed by a urine
             pregnancy test if they are of childbearing age)

          -  Have previous history of other pain syndromes or psychiatric disorders.

          -  We will exclude the morbidly obese (BMI &gt;30) because the laser may not be able to
             penetrate deep enough through adipose tissue. In addition, subjects who have had
             previous back surgery, or are on antidepressants for the treatment of depression in
             the preceding 6 weeks will be excluded as these may represent potential confounding
             factors.
