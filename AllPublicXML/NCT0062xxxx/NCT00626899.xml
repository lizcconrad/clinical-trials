  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients resuscitated from a cardiac arrest undergo therapeutic hypothermia as a treatment
      option. Measuring the cardiac output in these patients is sometimes important, but difficult,
      as these patients require an invasive device for measurement. Recently, a non-invasive device
      based on pulse-contour analysis of the arterial pulse was developed (the Vigileo).
      Hypothermia changes the pulse contour, so the performance of the Vigileo in patients with
      induced therapeutic hypothermia is not known. Therefore we conduct this observational study
      in which the cardiac output of the patients is measured with the traditional method and the
      Vigileo simultaneously.
