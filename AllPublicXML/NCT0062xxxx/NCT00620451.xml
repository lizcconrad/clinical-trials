  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of larazotide acetate versus
      placebo in inducing remission in subjects with active celiac disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an outpatient, randomized, parallel- group, double-blind, multicenter, 8-week study
      with three treatment arms: larazotide acetate 4 mg TID, larazotide acetate 8 mg TID and
      placebo TID in subjects with celiac disease. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy
      of larazotide acetate versus placebo in inducing remission in subjects with active celiac
      disease, as defined by an improvement in the Villous Height to Crypt Depth (Vh:Cd) ratio,
      obtained by duodeno-jejunal biopsy. Secondary objectives included assessment of the safety
      and tolerability of larazotide acetate, to prospectively validate the components of a
      composite weighted index of celiac disease activity (celiac disease Activity Rating Score,
      CeDARS), individually and as a whole, to To compare the CeDARS against the Clinician Global
      Assessment of disease (CGA), Psychological Well Being Index and the Short Form 12 version 2
      (SF-12 v2) health survey and to assess the effects of larazotide acetate on inflammatory
      markers in subjects with active celiac disease.

    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety endpoints assessed in this study were adverse events, vital signs, physical examination results, clinical laboratory test results and ECG results. Plasma larazotide acetate and metabolites, as well as potential serum antibodies against larazotide acetate, were also determined.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Candidate components of the CeDARS Index measured in this study were GSRS, anti-tTG antibodies, LAMA ratio, Hb, ferritin, body weight, triceps skin fold thickness, BMI, urinary nitrates</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the CeDARS against the Clinician Global Assessment of disease (CGA), Psychological Well Being Index (PWBI) and the Short Form 12 version 2 (SF-12v2) health survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>CGA, PWBI and SF-12v2 were collected at Visits 2, 3 and 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The CGA was completed by the PI or designee; the PWBI and SF-12v2 were completed by the subject.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the effects of larazotide acetate on inflammatory markers in subjects with active celiac disease subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood draws occurred at Visits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood for serum was drawn for potential future determination of inflammatory mediators that might be involved in the response of Celiac Disease to larazotide acetate, such as cytokines (e.g. TNF-α,IFN-γ) or the putative permeability factor &quot;zonulin&quot;.</description>
