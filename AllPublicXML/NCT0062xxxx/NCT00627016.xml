  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Percentage of Nights Without Heartburn Over 4 Weeks as Assessed by Daily Diary.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage calculated by the number of heartburn-free nights out of the total number of nights during the treatment period with a diary entry indicating presence or absence of nighttime heartburn in subjects who had â‰¥1 diary entry indicating presence or absence of nighttime heartburn, as indicated by the subject's daily diary. Subjects indicate the presence (Yes/No) of nocturnal heartburn symptoms in a Daily Electronic Diary. Nights missing diary results were excluded from the numerator and denominator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Subjects With Relief of Night Time Heartburn Over the Last 7 Days of Treatment as Assessed by Daily Diary.</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 7 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Relief of nighttime heartburn was defined as 6 of 7 nights with no heartburn and at most 1 night with mild heartburn; lack of relief of nighttime heartburn was defined as 2 or more out of 7 nights with heartburn, or 1 night with at least moderate heartburn. Subjects indicate the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe, or very severe) of nocturnal heartburn in a Daily Electronic Diary. The percentage was calculated as the number of subjects with relief of nighttime heartburn divided by the number of subjects whose relief status could be determined.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Relief of Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Associated Sleep Disturbances Over the Last 7 Days of Treatment as Assessed by Daily Diary.</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 7 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Relief of GERD-associated sleep disturbance was defined as 6 of 7 nights with no GERD associated sleep disturbances; lack of relief of GERD-associated sleep disturbance was defined as 2 or more out of 7 nights with GERD-associated sleep disturbance. Subjects indicate the presence (Yes/No) of GERD associated sleep disturbance in a Daily Electronic Diary. The percentage was calculated as the number of subjects with relief of GERD-associated sleep disturbance divided by the number of subjects whose relief status could be determined.</description>

          -  Meets both of the following criteria: 1) nocturnal heartburn severity of moderate,
             severe, or very severe on at least 3 of 7 nights and; 2) GERD related sleep
             disturbances on at least 3 of 7 nights.

          -  Subjects must have history of symptomatic GERD prior to screening with GERD symptoms
             that were responsive to acid-suppressive therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to any proton pump inhibitor drug (lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole,

             anticholinergic effects such as tricyclic antidepressants or drugs with central

             reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). However,
             subjects who remain on a stable regimen and dose of these medications during the 90

        <title>Median Percentage of Nights Without Heartburn Over 4 Weeks as Assessed by Daily Diary.</title>
        <description>Percentage calculated by the number of heartburn-free nights out of the total number of nights during the treatment period with a diary entry indicating presence or absence of nighttime heartburn in subjects who had â‰¥1 diary entry indicating presence or absence of nighttime heartburn, as indicated by the subject's daily diary. Subjects indicate the presence (Yes/No) of nocturnal heartburn symptoms in a Daily Electronic Diary. Nights missing diary results were excluded from the numerator and denominator.</description>

        <title>Percent of Subjects With Relief of Night Time Heartburn Over the Last 7 Days of Treatment as Assessed by Daily Diary.</title>
        <description>Relief of nighttime heartburn was defined as 6 of 7 nights with no heartburn and at most 1 night with mild heartburn; lack of relief of nighttime heartburn was defined as 2 or more out of 7 nights with heartburn, or 1 night with at least moderate heartburn. Subjects indicate the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe, or very severe) of nocturnal heartburn in a Daily Electronic Diary. The percentage was calculated as the number of subjects with relief of nighttime heartburn divided by the number of subjects whose relief status could be determined.</description>
