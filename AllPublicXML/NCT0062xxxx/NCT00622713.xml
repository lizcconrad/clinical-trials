      This study is designed to confirm the efficacy, the tolerability, the patient compliance and
      the caregiver satisfaction with rivastigmine target patch size 10 cm^2 in patients with
      probable Alzheimer's Disease (Mini-Mental State Examination 10-26) in the community setting

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Achieved and Maintained the Maximum Dose of 10 cm^2 Rivastigmine Patch for at Least 8 Weeks During 24 Weeks Study</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who were able to tolerate (and stay on for at least 8 weeks) rivastigmine target patch size 10 cm^2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) by Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC is an assessment tool used by a clinician to make a judgment of the severity or a change of a patient's condition. The clinician relies solely on information obtained from the patient at the Baseline visit as well as clinical information obtained throughout the study period. The CGIC is rated on the following seven-point scale:&quot;very much improved&quot;, &quot;much improved&quot;, &quot;slightly improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot;, &quot;slightly worsened&quot;, &quot;much worsened&quot; and &quot;very much worsened&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the 4-item Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (4-IADL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-IADL assesses the ability of a patient to autonomously perform 4 activities of daily living: Use the telephone, take medications, use public transport, and manage their own budget. Each activity is assessed by a series of questions and rated on a scale of 1 to 4. Scores on the 4 activities are combined for a total score ranging from 1 to 16. A lower score indicates a more self-sufficient individual. A positive change from baseline score indicates worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language) and results in a total possible score from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Mini-Zarit Inventory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Zarit Inventory assesses the burden of a caregiver in caring for a patient. The inventory is composed of 5 questions which are rated according to the following answers: 0 = never, ½ = sometimes, 1 = often. The ratings on the 5 questions are added together resulting in a total score of 0 to 7 with a higher score indicating greater caregiver burden.</description>

    <intervention_name>Rivastigmine transdermal patch</intervention_name>
    <description>The study treatment was delivered as a patch sizes 5 and 10 cm^2 containing respectively 9 and 18 mg of rivastigmine. During the first 4 weeks of the study, patients applied a new rivastigmine 5 cm^2 patch once daily. At the end of the 4 weeks, if tolerability was satisfactory, the dosage was increased and patients applied rivastigmine 10 cm^2 patch once daily for an additional 4 weeks. Thereafter, and until the end of the study, patients remained at the maximum tolerated dose, either 5 or 10 cm^2.</description>

        <description>The CGIC is an assessment tool used by a clinician to make a judgment of the severity or a change of a patient's condition. The clinician relies solely on information obtained from the patient at the Baseline visit as well as clinical information obtained throughout the study period. The CGIC is rated on the following seven-point scale:&quot;very much improved&quot;, &quot;much improved&quot;, &quot;slightly improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot;, &quot;slightly worsened&quot;, &quot;much worsened&quot; and &quot;very much worsened&quot;.</description>

        <description>The 4-IADL assesses the ability of a patient to autonomously perform 4 activities of daily living: Use the telephone, take medications, use public transport, and manage their own budget. Each activity is assessed by a series of questions and rated on a scale of 1 to 4. Scores on the 4 activities are combined for a total score ranging from 1 to 16. A lower score indicates a more self-sufficient individual. A positive change from baseline score indicates worsening.</description>
