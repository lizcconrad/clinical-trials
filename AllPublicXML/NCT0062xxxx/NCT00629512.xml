  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are often associated with gastric ulcers. This
      study looks at the prevention of these gastric ulcers with one of the three following
      treatment groups for up to 8 weeks: esomeprazole 40 mg once daily; esomeprazole 20 mg once
      daily; versus placebo; in patients at risk.
