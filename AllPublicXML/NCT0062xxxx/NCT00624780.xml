          <description>Period 1 (treatment optimization): Pregabalin capsule 150 milligram per day (mg/day) orally twice daily in 2 equally divided doses in Week 1, pregabalin capsule 300 mg/day orally twice daily in 2 equally divided doses in Week 2 and pregabalin capsule 450 mg/day orally twice daily in 2 equally divided doses in Week 3 during 3-week upward titration. Flexible dosing of pregabalin capsule 450 mg/day or 600 mg/day orally twice daily in 2 equally divided doses depending on efficacy and tolerability up to Week 6. If participant had an adequate response at Week 6, fixed dosing of pregabalin capsule 450 mg/day or 600 mg/day orally twice daily in 2 equally divided doses up to Week 12. Period 2 (fixed dosing): Continued pregabalin capsule 450 mg/day or 600 mg/day orally twice daily in 2 equally divided doses up to Week 24. Period 3 (treatment discontinuation): A 1-week blinded dose tapering period (Week 25). Participants were followed-up after 1 week (Week 26).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Rebound Anxiety for Cohort 2 (3-Month Last Visit)</title>
        <description>Rebound anxiety was defined as a rapid return of the participant’s original symptoms following drug discontinuation, that were worse compared to baseline. This was characterized by a HAM-A score at the Discontinuation Week 1 or Week 2 greater than or equal to the baseline value.</description>
