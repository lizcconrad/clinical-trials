  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in the setting of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis(IPF)is
      a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the peri-lung transplant(LT) setting. Currently
      there is no significant data to support the use of pulmonary vasodilators for PAH in the
      setting of interstitial lung disease such as IPF. The majority of IPF patients have PAH
      either at rest or during exercise. The study hypothesis is that sildenafil may improve
      morbidity and mortality in the peri-LT setting in both IPF cohorts with either resting or
      exercise PAH.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of sildenafil in patients with pulmonary
      fibrosis and PH being considered for lung transplantation. We hypothesize that not only will
      sildenafil improve functionality and QOL in the pre-transplant setting but it may also
      improve primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation.
