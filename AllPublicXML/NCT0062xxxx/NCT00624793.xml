      The subjects in this research study will be 159 men and women with HIV infection who have a
      history of chronic nausea for three months or greater and show evidence of two or more
      episodes of nausea and/or report a duration of two hours or more (per day) in baseline
      symptom diaries. Subjects will be randomized (by chance) to one of three conditions:
      Condition 1, subjects receive Standard acupuncture (active treatment); Condition 2, subjects
      receive Individualized acupuncture based on Traditional Chinese Medical Diagnosis (active
      treatment); Condition 3, (Control Group), subjects receive Sham acupuncture. Subjects in
      Conditions 1, 2, &amp; 3 will attend scheduled sessions over 24 weeks.

      The subjects in the proposed experiment will be 159 men and women with HIV infection who have
      a history of chronic nausea for three months or greater and show evidence of two or more
      episodes of nausea and/or report a duration of 2 hours or greater (per day) in prospective
      baseline symptom diaries. Subjects will be randomized to one of three experimental
      intervention conditions: Condition 1, subjects receive Standard acupuncture; Condition 2,
      subjects receive Individualized acupuncture based on Traditional Chinese Medical Diagnosis;
      Condition 3, (Control Group), subjects receive Sham acupuncture. Subjects in Conditions 1, 2,
      &amp; 3 will attend 16 scheduled sessions over 24 weeks. All subjects will: be assessed by a
      diagnostic acupuncturist (blinded to treatment assignments); be administered the same
      instruments; and submit their symptom diaries for data entry and analysis. After a
      screening/intake session, randomization and treatment sessions will follow. There will be
      four weeks of twice weekly treatment sessions, four weekly treatment sessions and three
      follow-up sessions. All conditions will be identical in duration and be administered by
      licensed acupuncturists trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This study is a prospective,
      randomized, controlled, blinded (subject and evaluator), parallel groups clinical trial aimed
      at reducing chronic nausea and improving quality of life in persons with HIV/AIDS.
