      The purpose of the research is to: 1) to test whether psychotherapy including immediate
      feedback of empathy data is more efficacious than therapy without such an exchange of data,
      2) to measure the degree of accuracy of therapist's empathy and its relationship to the
      patient's estimate of the therapist's empathy.

      Objective: To develop and evaluate a feedback method for measuring and increasing therapists'
      empathic accuracy and reducing empathic errors in psychotherapy. Method: Sixteen (16)
      patient-therapist pairs were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. All
      patients rated their own functioning using the GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning) and
      predicted the accuracy with which their therapists would estimate their ratings. Therapists
      rated the patient's GAF, predicted the patients' ratings of their own GAFs, and rated their
      confidence in their own predictions. In the intervention condition, therapist and patients
      discussed the previous session's ratings for a few minutes of the therapy session. Results:
      Intervention therapists showed greater empathic accuracy relative to controls on our empathy
      measure (t(14) = 2.69, p &lt; .01) and increased empathy over time on the Barrett-Lenard Empathy
      subscale (t(32) = 3.21, p &lt; .01). We also found significant effects on errors related to
      perceived accuracy of therapist empathy. Patients in the control group were found to perceive
      their therapists to be either more or less accurate than was actually the case
      (over/under-idealization), but such biases were not as strong in the intervention group.
      Similarly, therapists in the control group were likely to over-estimate their own accuracy
      (over-confidence) to a greater extent than intervention therapists. Affective responses to
      the instrument were positive overall and did not differ by condition. Conclusion: Empathy
      feedback and feedback concerning degrees of patient idealization and therapist confidence may
      be effective in improving functioning as well as in increasing empathic accuracy in
      psychotherapy.
