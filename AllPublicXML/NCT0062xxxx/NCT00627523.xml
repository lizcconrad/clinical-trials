    <measure>Change From Baseline in Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at Month 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Height SDS was calculated at the relevant visit by means of the following formula: Height SDS = (participant height) - (normal height)/normal height standard deviation. Where participant height refers to the participant's height at the relevant visit, and normal height and the normal height standard deviation equals the population mean and standard deviation values for participants of a similar age and gender. The change from Baseline value for height SDS was calculated as the difference between the parameter values at a specific visit, and the Baseline parameter values. The scores were centred around zero. Negative score indicated a participant was smaller for their age/gender.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mental Development Using the Mental Development Index (MDI) of Bayley Scale at Month 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-II) measured the mental and psychomotor development and test behavior of participants from 1 to 42 months of age. The scale was used to describe the current developmental functioning of infants and to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning for infants with developmental delays or disabilities. The BSID-II provided the mental raw score which was used to calculate the MDI score. Possible MDI scores ranged from 50-150. A score of 69 and below indicates significantly delayed performance, 70 to 84 indicates mildly delayed performance, 85 to 114 indicates normal limits and 115 and above indicates accelerated performance.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This randomized controlled trial enrolled small for gestational age (SGA) children at 16 centers in 8 countries. In total, 52 participants were screened for the study, of these, 9 participants were considered screen failures. The remaining 43 participants were randomized to receive either study drug (Genotropin®) or were not treated (Control).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants aged between 19 to 29 months at Screening visit, born SGA (birth length and/or weight &lt;-2 standard deviations (SD) for gestational age, using country-specific standards), height below -2.5 SD at Screening (19-29 months of age), and had at least one measurement of length between 12 and 18 months of age were enrolled in this study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received Genotropin® at a dose of 0.035 mg/kg/d for 24 months. The dose was calculated based on the actual body weight, and the closest dosing step of the 5 mg pen used. The starting dose for the first 2 weeks was 1/3 of the calculated dose. After 2 weeks the dose was increased to 2/3 of the calculated dose. After 4 weeks the daily dose was the dose calculated on body weight at randomization.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at Month 24.</title>
        <description>Height SDS was calculated at the relevant visit by means of the following formula: Height SDS = (participant height) - (normal height)/normal height standard deviation. Where participant height refers to the participant’s height at the relevant visit, and normal height and the normal height standard deviation equals the population mean and standard deviation values for participants of a similar age and gender. The change from Baseline value for height SDS was calculated as the difference between the parameter values at a specific visit, and the Baseline parameter values. The scores were centred around zero. Negative score indicated a participant was smaller for their age/gender.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Growth Velocity SDS at Month 12.</title>
        <description>The growth velocity SDS was calculated at the relevant visit by means of the following formula: Growth velocity SDS = (participant growth velocity) – (normal growth velocity)/normal growth velocity standard deviation. Where, participant growth velocity refers to the participant’s growth velocity at the relevant visit, and normal growth velocity and the normal growth velocity standard deviation equals the population mean and standard deviation values for participants of a similar age and gender. The change from Baseline value for growth velocity SDS was calculated as the difference between the parameter values at a specific visit, and the Baseline parameter values. A negative score indicated that a participant had slower growth for their age/gender.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mental Development Using the Mental Development Index (MDI) of Bayley Scale at Month 12.</title>
        <description>The Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-II) measured the mental and psychomotor development and test behavior of participants from 1 to 42 months of age. The scale was used to describe the current developmental functioning of infants and to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning for infants with developmental delays or disabilities. The BSID-II provided the mental raw score which was used to calculate the MDI score. Possible MDI scores ranged from 50-150. A score of 69 and below indicates significantly delayed performance, 70 to 84 indicates mildly delayed performance, 85 to 114 indicates normal limits and 115 and above indicates accelerated performance.</description>

        <description>Head circumference SDS was calculated by means of the following formula = (Participant head circumference)–(Normal head circumference)/Normal head circumference standard deviation. Where participant head circumference refers to the participant's head circumference at the relevant visit, and normal head circumference and the normal head circumference standard deviation equals the population mean and standard deviation values for participants of a similar age and gender. A negative score indicated a participant had a smaller head circumference for their age/gender.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) included participants who were randomized to treatment and completed at least one post-baseline efficacy measure. One participant was randomized to Genotropin® but did not receive any treatment. This participant was excluded from FAS but included in Control group for safety analysis.</population>
