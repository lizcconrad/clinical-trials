    <textblock>
      Hypercholesterolemia is a frequent finding in organ transplant recipients receiving
      immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus. To prevent increased cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality in these patients, co-medication with lipid-lowering statins is recommended.
      However, treatment with statins is limited in many patients by insufficient
      cholesterol-lowering efficacy, drug interactions and serious adverse drug reactions (e.g.
      rhabdomyolysis). These patients may benefit from comedication with the cholesterol absorption
      inhibitor ezetimibe. Since tacrolimus and ezetimibe were shown to be substrates of the efflux
      transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), drug interactions between both compounds may occur.
      Therefore, this clinical study in healthy subjects was initiated to evaluate the clinical
      relevance of drug/drug interactions between tacrolimus and ezetimibe according to the
      accepted bioequivalence approach.
