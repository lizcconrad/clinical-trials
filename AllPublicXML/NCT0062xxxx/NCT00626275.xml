  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ADL5859 in relieving pain
      associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with placebo and naproxen (similar to
      Aleve®). A second objective is to see whether the effect of ADL5859 differs after a single
      dose compared with multiple doses.

      This Phase 2a study was conducted in 2 parts. Part A was a randomized, single-dose,
      double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 3-way crossover phase during which participants
      were administered study medication in the clinical facility. Part B was a 14-day, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple-dose phase in which participants
      self-administered study medication at home.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Average Difference Between Baseline and Post Dose Evoked (by Treadmill Walking) Lower-Extremity Pain Intensity Scores (AELEPID) Over the 6 Hours After Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 6 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Approximately 1 hour before baseline and again approximately 45 minutes before the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, participants rested for 45 minutes, then they started the treadmill walk at 15 minutes before baseline and at the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points. After the treadmill walk, participants were asked to rate their lower extremity pain on an 11 point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. The average difference between baseline and 6 hours post dose evoked lower-extremity pain intensity scores (AELEPID-6) is presented for each treatment group. Difference = predose (baseline) NPRS score - NPRS score 6 hours post dose.
Least square (LS) means and standard errors (SE) were calculated from an analysis-of-covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for sequence, treatment, period, predose evoked lower extremity pain intensity as a covariate, and a random effect for participant nested within sequence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B: The Mean of Daily Average &quot;Now&quot; Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (LEPI) Score During the 2-Week Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their &quot;Now&quot; LEPI 3 times each day (morning, midday, and evening at approximately 10 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM) and before taking any rescue medication. At each time point, participants were asked to rate their lower extremity pain on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. If a scheduled pain assessment was taken within 4 hours of rescue medication, the observed pain score was replaced by the pain score obtained right before the rescue medication was taken.
LS means and SE were calculated from an analysis-of-covariance model with effect for treatment and baseline &quot;Now&quot; LEPI (before dosing for Treatment Period 1 of Part A) as a covariate. Participants with no postbaseline assessments were excluded from the baseline summary.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Pain Intensity Score (NPRS Score) for Overall Pain, for Lower Extremity Pain, and for Evoked (by Treadmill Walking) Lower Extremity Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Pain Intensity (OPI), &quot;Now&quot; Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (LEPI), and Evoked Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (ELEPI) were assessed using the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. OPI was assessed at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at 6 and 12 hours (hr) after dosing. At 15 minutes before dosing, during Period 1 only, participants were also asked to assess their average LEPI over the last 24 hours as a baseline measurement. &quot;Now&quot; LEPI was assessed at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 12-hour time points. Approximately 1 hour before dosing and approximately 45 minutes before the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, the participant rested for 45 minutes, then (after the &quot;Now&quot; LEPI assessment) he or she started a treadmill walk at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, and then assessed ELEPI.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Mean Peak Difference in ELEPI According to the NPRS Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 6 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Evoked Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (ELEPI) was assessed using the 11-point NPRS. Participants were asked to rate their lower extremity pain on an 11 point NPRS, with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. If a scheduled pain assessment was taken within 4 hours of rescue medication, the observed pain score was replaced by the pain score obtained right before the rescue medication was taken. Approximately 1 hour before dosing and approximately 45 minutes before the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, the participant rested for 45 minutes, then he or she started a treadmill walk at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, and then assessed ELEPI. Peak ELEPID was defined as the maximum of ELEPIDs recorded at 2, 4, and 6 hours post dose. Difference = predose (baseline) NPRS score - peak NPRS score up to 6 hours post dose.</description>

        <title>Part A: Average Difference Between Baseline and Post Dose Evoked (by Treadmill Walking) Lower-Extremity Pain Intensity Scores (AELEPID) Over the 6 Hours After Dosing</title>
        <description>Approximately 1 hour before baseline and again approximately 45 minutes before the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, participants rested for 45 minutes, then they started the treadmill walk at 15 minutes before baseline and at the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points. After the treadmill walk, participants were asked to rate their lower extremity pain on an 11 point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. The average difference between baseline and 6 hours post dose evoked lower-extremity pain intensity scores (AELEPID-6) is presented for each treatment group. Difference = predose (baseline) NPRS score - NPRS score 6 hours post dose.
Least square (LS) means and standard errors (SE) were calculated from an analysis-of-covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for sequence, treatment, period, predose evoked lower extremity pain intensity as a covariate, and a random effect for participant nested within sequence.</description>

        <description>Overall Pain Intensity (OPI), “Now” Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (LEPI), and Evoked Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (ELEPI) were assessed using the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. OPI was assessed at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at 6 and 12 hours (hr) after dosing. At 15 minutes before dosing, during Period 1 only, participants were also asked to assess their average LEPI over the last 24 hours as a baseline measurement. “Now” LEPI was assessed at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 12-hour time points. Approximately 1 hour before dosing and approximately 45 minutes before the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, the participant rested for 45 minutes, then (after the “Now” LEPI assessment) he or she started a treadmill walk at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, and then assessed ELEPI.</description>

OPI was assessed at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at 6 and 12 hours (hr) after dosing. At 15 minutes before dosing, during Period 1 only, participants were also asked to assess their average LEPI over the last 24 hours as a baseline measurement. “Now” LEPI was assessed at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 12-hour time points. Approximately 1 hour before dosing and approximately 45 minutes before the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, the participant rested for 45 minutes, then (after the “Now” LEPI assessment) he or she started a treadmill walk at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, and then assessed ELEPI.</description>

        <title>Part A: Mean Peak Difference in ELEPI According to the NPRS Scale</title>
        <description>Evoked Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (ELEPI) was assessed using the 11-point NPRS. Participants were asked to rate their lower extremity pain on an 11 point NPRS, with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. If a scheduled pain assessment was taken within 4 hours of rescue medication, the observed pain score was replaced by the pain score obtained right before the rescue medication was taken. Approximately 1 hour before dosing and approximately 45 minutes before the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, the participant rested for 45 minutes, then he or she started a treadmill walk at 15 minutes before dosing for baseline and at the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour time points, and then assessed ELEPI. Peak ELEPID was defined as the maximum of ELEPIDs recorded at 2, 4, and 6 hours post dose. Difference = predose (baseline) NPRS score - peak NPRS score up to 6 hours post dose.</description>

        <title>Part B: The Mean of Daily Average &quot;Now&quot; Lower Extremity Pain Intensity (LEPI) Score During the 2-Week Period</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their “Now” LEPI 3 times each day (morning, midday, and evening at approximately 10 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM) and before taking any rescue medication. At each time point, participants were asked to rate their lower extremity pain on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), with 0 indicating No Pain and 10 indicating Worst Possible Pain. If a scheduled pain assessment was taken within 4 hours of rescue medication, the observed pain score was replaced by the pain score obtained right before the rescue medication was taken.
LS means and SE were calculated from an analysis-of-covariance model with effect for treatment and baseline “Now” LEPI (before dosing for Treatment Period 1 of Part A) as a covariate. Participants with no postbaseline assessments were excluded from the baseline summary.</description>
