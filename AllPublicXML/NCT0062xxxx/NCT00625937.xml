      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, S-1, and cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving
      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with radiation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel and S-1 together with
      radiation therapy and low-dose cisplatin works in treating patients with stage III or stage
      IV head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the response rate in patients with stage III or IV head and neck cancer
           treated with induction therapy comprising docetaxel and S-1 followed by radiotherapy and
           low-dose cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of this regimen on survival and locoregional and systemic control
           rates in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive oral S-1 twice daily on days 1-14 and docetaxel
           IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive low-dose cisplatin IV once daily and undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 18 months.
