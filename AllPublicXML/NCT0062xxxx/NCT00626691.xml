  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find out if the daily consumption of English walnuts (Juglans
      regia L.) for 6 wk, at a dose readily incorporated into the diet (0.75 or 1.50 oz), will have
      a positive effect on antioxidant capacity and nutrient status in a population of healthy
      adults, aged 50-70 y.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies conducted in large populations have consistently shown that increased
      consumption of plant-based, antioxidant-rich foods, i.e., fruits, vegetables, grains, and
      nuts, reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Among the various plants consumed
      worldwide, English walnuts (Juglans regia L.) have been reported to have the highest
      antioxidant activity, second only to rosehips (Rosa canina L.). There are a number of
      different compounds present in walnuts that are known to exhibit antioxidant activity,
      including vitamin E (as γ-tocopherol), melatonin, and several non-flavonoid polyphenols
      (e.g., ellagic acid monomers and polymeric ellagitannins). In vitro and ex vivo, studies have
      demonstrated the ability of walnuts and walnut extracts to increase the resistance of low
      density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation. Walnuts and/or their constituents have also been
      shown to decrease levels of oxidative stress in diabetic mice and increase serum antioxidant
      capacity in rats2. In humans, in vivo antioxidant capacity changes after consuming walnuts
      have only been measured in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. The antioxidant capacity of the
      lipophilic compartments, as well as the cooperative/synergistic interactions between the
      water- and fat-soluble antioxidants present in plasma after walnut consumption have not been
      measured. Indeed, there have been no studies conducted to date of the effect of walnut
      consumption on the total antioxidant capacity of healthy men and women. The goal of our
      proposed study is to determine if consuming walnuts in amounts readily incorporated into the
      diet can affect the antioxidant capacity of older adults.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to receive either 0.75 oz (22.5 g) or 1.5 oz (45 g) of walnuts daily for the first 6 wk period, followed by a 6 wk washout period, and an additional 6 wk period during which they will receive the reverse dose of walnuts daily. Each serving of walnuts will be pre-weighed and pre-packaged.</description>
