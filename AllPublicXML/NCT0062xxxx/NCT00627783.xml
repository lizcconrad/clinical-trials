      DYNAMIT is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open strategy trial run in 45 French
      hospitals. Diabetic patients with no evidence of coronary artery disease and at least 2
      additional cardiovascular risk factors are randomized to screening for silent ischemia using
      a bicycle exercise test or Dipyridamole Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (N=316),
      or follow-up without screening (N=315). All have access to cardiovascular prevention
      according current guidelines. The main end point is time to death from all causes, non-fatal
      myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalization or
      emergency service intervention.

    <description>Patients are referred to a cardiologist for a systematic detection of silent ischemia by a bicycle exercise test performed according to the French Society of Cardiology protocol after washout of cardiovascular medications likely to interfere with the test. Dipyridamole Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is used in patients unable to perform the exercise test, with a sub-maximal negative exercise test result or with electrocardiographic abnormalities impairing the interpretation of the exercise test. Subsequent investigations (such as coronary angiography) and treatments (such as revascularization procedures) are left at the cardiologist's decision.</description>
