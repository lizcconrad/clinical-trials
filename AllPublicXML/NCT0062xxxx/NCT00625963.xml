  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current standard of the diagnosis and monitoring of PHNT requiring combination of invasive
      and non-invasive tests. The goal of the study is to correlate data from CT scans,
      echocardiograms, right heart catheterization, PFTs, sleep studies, and perfusion scans. The
      ultimate goal is to determine patterns of the PAH disease processes.

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of our study is to correlate data from various non-invasive tests such as commuted
      tomography (CT) imaging, echocardiogram, Pulmonary Function Tests, and other laboratory tests
      along with hemodynamic measurements from Right Heart Catheterizations in these ILD patients
      with Pulmonary Hypertension, as well as all other pulmonary hypertension. The ultimate goal
      is to determine patterns of the PAH disease processes, as well as define optimal diagnostic
      modalities including in-hospital verses outpatient studies.
