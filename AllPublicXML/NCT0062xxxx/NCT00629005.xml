  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with stroke experience weakness and incoordination. Studies have shown that with
      functional task practice, people can increase motor control and strength to a certain extent.
      This study will investigate whether adding progressive resistance strength training to
      functional task practice modeled after Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy results in greater
      motor function gains than functional task practice alone

      To date most investigations of UE rehabilitation have examined single interventions. However,
      combining 2 efficacious interventions may enhance effectiveness. Both functional task
      training and strength training are beneficial for promoting improved upper extremity
      function, but they have seldom been studied as a coupled therapy. The research proposed in
      this project will examine the effect on UE function of adding UE resistive exercises to
      functional task training. Secondary aims are to examine the effect of stroke severity on the
      response to therapy, the interrelationship between therapy-induced neural changes and
      movement composition and functional changes with therapy, and test for retention of UE
      function gains over 6 months. Individuals with chronic hemiparesis from stroke will complete
      baseline testing and then be randomly assigned to either the functional task + strength
      training group or the functional task training alone group. Each group will train 4
      hours/day, 3 days/week for 4 weeks. Each will perform 3 hours of functional task training per
      session. The strengthening group will then complete 1 hour of UE progressive resistance
      exercises while the functional task training alone group will complete gravity eliminated
      range of motion exercises for 1 hour. All subjects will be post-tested and then complete
      follow-up testing 6 months later.
