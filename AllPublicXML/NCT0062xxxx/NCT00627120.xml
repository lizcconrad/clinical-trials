      This study will evaluate:

        -  The safety and tolerability of a single dose of VGX-1027 as determined by: adverse event
           reporting, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, physical examinations, and
           electrocardiograms (ECGs).

        -  The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VGX-1027 maximum concentration (Cmax)
