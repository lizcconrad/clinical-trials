      This study aims to determine if the vacccine can be used safely in patients with advanced
      melanoma (cancer of the pigment cells) and whether the cells in this vaccine are capabale of
      producing immune responses against your own cancer.

      To assess the toxicity associated with vaccination of melanoma patients with dendritic cell
      (DC)/tumor fusions. To determine if cellular and humoral immunity can be induced by serial
      vaccination with DC/tumor fusions cells. To determine if vaccination DC/tumor fusions results
      in a tumor response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with confirmed diagnoses of disseminated melanoma, with measurable and
             clearly progressive metastatic involevment

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old

          -  Patients must have ECOG performance status 0-1 with greater than 9 week life
             expectancy

          -  Those patients with the following accessible tumor will be eligible: soft tissue, bone
             marrow or visceral lesions; Skin or superficial soft tissue, or lymph nodes amenable
             to resection under local anesthesia; Patients who require surgical procedures that are
             not considered significantly invasive but may require general anesthesia, such as
             thorascopic biopsy, laparascopic biopsy or mediastinal node biopsy may potentially be
             eligible; Malignant ascites or pleural effusion; Patients requiring major surgical
             intervention will be considered ineligible. Patients scheduled to undergo tumor
             resection for independent diagnostic or therapeutic indications may have tumor
             collected for the purposes of this study.
