      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, may be an
      effective method of finding ovarian cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well contrast-enhanced ultrasonography works in
      diagnosing early-stage ovarian cancer in patients with an adnexal mass undergoing surgery to
      remove the ovary.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether use of a contrast agent improves the images of the ovaries during
           ultrasonography.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients may undergo baseline transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonography, if not already
      done. Patients then undergo contrast-enhanced transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonography
      using perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity®) IV.

      Pathology reports from tissue collected during subsequent oophorectomy is analyzed and
      compared with ultrasonography findings.
