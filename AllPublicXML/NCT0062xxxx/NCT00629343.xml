  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and toxicity for the combination of
      Temozolomide and Azacitidine in the treatment of Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma or Malignant
      Mesothelioma. This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm Phase I dose-escalation trial.
      Patients will be evaluated with complete history and physical as well as laboratory studies
      (complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function tests), biopsy, and imaging of all
      sites of measurable disease. This study will be conducted over the course of 3 years.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical and laboratory toxicities as
      well as acceptability/tolerance of this dose schedule of combined drug treatment with
      temozolomide and azacitidine.

      Secondary objectives include determination of biochemical response to azacitidine as defined
      as change in methylation status. We will specifically be looking at changes in genome wide
      methylation patterns as determined by two high-throughput platforms:

        1. A single nucleotide polymorphism chip-based method (MSNP) for genome wide epigenetic
           profiling

        2. CpG island promoter arrays will be performed to focus on promoter methylation status.

      We will also monitor clinical response, time to progression and overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma or mesothelioma.

          -  Ineligible for other high priority national or institutional study.

          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating.

          -  Recurrent or progressive disease defined as an increase in size of any existing tumor
             mass, or the development of new tumor mass or masses, which is not amenable to
             definitive surgical therapy.

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be measured in at least one dimension
             by physical examination or by means of medical imaging techniques. Ascites and pleural
             effusions will not be considered measurable disease.

          -  Prior chemotherapy is allowed with the exception of prior treatment with Temozolomide
             or Azacitidine. Patients must have received prior 1st line therapy. There is no upper
             limit to the number of prior therapies received. Prior treatment with an alkylating
             agent is acceptable.

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed.

          -  At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or at least 6 weeks since prior radiation
             therapy.

          -  Patients may have had another cancer but there must be convincing clinical evidence
             that the sarcoma is the disease requiring therapeutic intervention. (i.e. Several
             sarcoma patients have had had a prior cancer [Hodgkin's disease or breast cancer]
             treated years previously and then developed a clinically active sarcoma.)

          -  Clinical parameters: Life expectancy &gt; 3 months, Age &gt; 18 years, Performance Karnofsky
             performance status of greater than or equal to 60%.

          -  Required initial laboratory data:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 10.0 g/dl

               -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3

               -  Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory.

               -  Transaminases: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
                  levels must be &lt; 2 x ULN. If there is known hepatic metastasis, transaminases may
                  be &lt; 5 times upper limit of normal.

               -  Serum creatinine levels &lt; 1.5 x ULN.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior
                  to initiation of treatment.

          -  Men and women of child-bearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for a reasonable period thereafter (approximately
             3 months).

          -  Capable of providing written, informed consent. Each patient must be completely aware
             of the nature of his/her disease process and must willingly give consent after being
             informed of the procedure to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy,
             alternatives, potential benefits, side-effects, risks and discomforts.

          -  No serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or intensive
             treatment (e.g. serious infection).

          -  No uncontrolled central nervous system metastases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Histology other than soft-tissue sarcoma or mesothelioma

          -  Active or uncontrolled infection or other serious systemic disease

          -  Prior treatment with temozolomide or azacitidine

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Uncontrolled central nervous system metastases

          -  Liver metastases

          -  Patients will not be excluded if they do not wish to participate in the second biopsy
             for tissue evaluation

          -  Subjects who have not had prior chemotherapy.
