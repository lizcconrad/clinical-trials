    <textblock>
      24 diabetics with mild &amp; moderate renal disease and 12 diabetics without renal disease. One
      screening, one dosing &amp; one follow-up visit with TechnosphereÂ® Inhalation Powder given at
      Visit 2 via MedToneÂ® Inhaler and PK testing at 26 designated time points

      This Phase 1, single-dose trial is being conducted to determine if nephropathy affects the
      way the kidneys eliminate the byproducts of TechnosphereÂ® Inhalation Powder as compared to
      kidneys free of disease. This trial will test the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of the study medication. The trial consists of a screening, dosing and a follow-up visit.
      Single dose administration of TechnosphereÂ® Inhalation Powder occurs at the dosing visit.
      (V2) with serum and urine PK testing .
