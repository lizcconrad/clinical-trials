      Although it has not been evaluated prospectively, the usual treatment for obstructive airway
      disease (OAD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) , which is
      related to graft versus host disease (GVHD), consists of intensification of systemic
      immunosuppressive therapy. However, this treatment has a limited efficacy and is associated
      with a significant number of serious adverse effects, particularly infectious. Alternative
      treatments are therefore necessary.We have retrospectively reported clinical and functional
      improvement in patients with OAD following AHSCT treated with inhaled budesonide/formoterol
      combination.These encouraging results need to be confirmed by the present randomised,
      prospective double-blind trial. This study is therefore designed to evaluate the efficacy of
      budesonide/formoterol versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe OAD, not requiring
      initiation or intensification of systemic immunosuppressive therapy for extra thoracic GVHD.
