  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Microalbuminuria in Untreated Boys with Alport Syndrome study is to gather
      information about critical clinical time points such as when patients with small amounts of
      protein (microalbuminuria) in their urine progress to larger amounts (overt proteinuria).
      Large amounts of protein in the urine is often an early sign of kidney disease.

      Information needs to be collected in boys who are not taking medications known as angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in order to obtain
      accurate data about the length of time between the onset of microalbuminuria and the start of
      overt proteinuria. This new information will give physicians a better understanding of how to
      treat patients with Alport syndrome.

      The information we gather by conducting this study will aid in planning future clinical
      trials because the identification of time points in disease progression, such as
      microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria, could reduce the time necessary to show a clinical
      benefit of a new treatment option.

      The study has been approved by the University of Minnesota's Institutional Review Board.

      Study Aims

        1. To determine the average ages of onset of microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria in
           untreated boys with Alport syndrome

        2. To determine the average duration of microalbuminuria before transition to overt
           proteinuria in untreated boys with Alport syndrome

      This study does not involve treatment and is anticipated to last 3-5 years.

      Each urine sample will be assayed for albumin, total protein and creatinine. The following
      definitions will be used:

        -  Microalbuminuria: urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) &gt; 30 mcg/mg, on 3 consecutive
           measurements spaced one month apart

        -  Overt proteinuria: urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC) &gt; 0.2 mg/mg, on 3 consecutive
           measurements spaced one month apart
