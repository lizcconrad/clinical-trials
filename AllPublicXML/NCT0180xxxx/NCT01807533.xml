  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four hypotheses will be tested in this study:

        1. The intervention group performs better in child, parent and transactions outcomes than
           the control group throughout the follow-up period.

        2. The intervention group shows greater changes in early neurophysiological brain functions
           and transactions within the family that lead to better neurodevelopmental outcomes than
           the control group.

        3. Certain polymorphisms of the dopamine-related genes are associated with the
           neurodevelopmental outcomes in VLBW preterm infants.

        4. Very low birth weight preterm infants carrying more genetic plasticity in the
           dopamine-related genes may benefit more from the interventions than those carrying less
           genetic plasticity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 250 VLBW preterm infants will be prospectively recruited at three medical centers
      in northern and southern Taiwan and will be randomly assigned to the FCIP or UCP group.
      Outcome assessments will include primary (child medical, growth and development) and
      secondary measures (parent and transactions within the family). The neurophysiological and
      transactions data will be examined for whether they mediate intervention effects on child
      development. In addition, these infants and 153 VLBW preterm infants in our prior
      intervention study will be collected buccal cells for assessment of the polymorphisms of
      dopamine-related genes, which are involved in the neurotransmission of cognitive,
      sensori-motor and behavioral-emotional systems and postulated to be associated with several
      developmental and psychiatric illnesses. The polymorphisms of dopamine-related genes will be
      examined for potential moderating influence on the effects of the intervention for child
      development.

    <description>This program will include in-hospital intervention, after-discharge intervention and neonatal follow-up. Five sessions of in-hospital intervention will emphasize modulation of the NICU, teaching of child developmental skills, feeding support, massage, interactional activities and parent support and education. The 7-session after-discharge intervention will consist of 4 clinic visits and 3 home visits with specific care in modulation of home environment, teaching of child developmental skills, feeding support, teaching of interactional activities, and parent support and education</description>
