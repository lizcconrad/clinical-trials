      Leptin is a fat hormone which acts in maintaining energy balance. However, leptin levels are
      high in obese subjects indicating resistance to the actions of leptin. High leptin levels
      have been associated with increased cardiovascular and metabolic risks, but it is not clear
      if increased leptin or leptin resistance contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk.
      Further, even though leptin receptors are present in fat tissue, leptin's role in fat tissue
      functions are not completely investigated in humans. Based on preliminary data the
      investigators hypothesize that resistance to leptin action in obese adipose tissue is
      responsible for altering the expression of adipose tissue proteins which contribute to the
      development of cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction. To test this hypothesis the
      investigators propose a novel study directed at investigating the leptin dependent changes in
      adipose tissue protein expression using adipose tissue obtained from lean and obese human
      subjects

    <description>The effect of leptin on adipose tissue protein expression will be assessed by Western blot method. The adipose tissue biopsy samples will be treated with leptin for 24 hours in sterile culture conditions. After leptin treatment, the tissue will be lysed, proteins will be separated by denatured SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane and changes in specific proteins will be determined using protein-specific antibodies.</description>
