  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to test a new Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) device and
      study its reliability and ability to differentiate ALS patients from healthy controls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will study 10 ALS patients and at least 10 age-matched healthy controls between
      the ages of 21 and 85 years old. For all subjects, EIM measurements will be performed on four
      muscles: two in the upper and two in the lower extremities, using 8 different EIM sensors.
      Measurements will be repeated one time.

    <description>EIM measurements are taken by applying saline to the skin and placing a sensor on patients' muscles that will record electrical activity. Electrical current is generated by this machine, but patients will not be able to feel it. The electrical activity recorded is returned to the machine and analyzed by a computer.</description>
