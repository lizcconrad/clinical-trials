    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and distribution and
      elimination of a novel therapeutic drug when administered to Healthy Volunteers. In addition
      its effects on some inflammatory parameters will be measured in presence or absence of
      lipopolysaccharide stimulation.

    <description>Blood samples for plasma NI-0101 concentrations.
The following pharmacokinetic parameters of NI-0101 will be measured:
Area under the curve from the time of dosing extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf); Area under curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUClast); AUCinf - AUClast expressed in % of AUCinf (% AUCextr); Systemic drug clearance (CL); Mean residence time (MRT) extrapolated to infinity (MRTinf); Mean residence time (MRT) at last measurable concentration (MRTlast).</description>

    <description>Blood samples for inflammatory markers measured in blood with or without the presence of an exogenous stimulus (lipopolysaccharide).
Cytokine levels induced by ex vivo lipopolysaccharide challenge and circulating cytokine levels induced by in vivo lipopolysaccharide challenge will be measured.</description>
