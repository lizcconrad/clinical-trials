    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to document the prescription and the use of Low Molecular Weight Heparin
      in usual medical practice in patients with cancer and established Venous Thromboembolism.
      This study also aims at gathering epidemiological data on the Low Molecular Weight Heparin
      therapy of Venous Thromboembolism in patients with cancer.
