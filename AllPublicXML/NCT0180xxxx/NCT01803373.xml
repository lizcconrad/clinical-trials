  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the relative bioavailability (extent and rate to which a
      drug is taken up by the body) of TMC207 following the administration of two pediatric
      formulations of TMC207 taken with and without food in healthy adult participants.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all study staff and participants know the identity of treatments
      assigned), 3-way cross-over (method used to switch participants from one treatment to another
      treatment) study. Three panels of 12 healthy adult participants each will be enrolled. Within
      each panel, participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences
      to receive each of the 3 formulations of TMC207 in a randomized order. The 3 formulations of
      TMC207 will be referred to as Treatments A, B, and C. In Treatment A, participants will
      receive a single 100-mg dose of TMC207 formulated as a 100-mg tablet (reference formulation).
      In Treatment B, participants will receive a single 100-mg dose of TMC207 formulated as 20-mg
      water dispersible (dissolvable) tablets (i.e. 5 tablets) (pediatric formulation 1). In
      Treatment C, participants will receive a single 100-mg dose of TMC207 formulated as granules
      5 grams (20 mg/g) (pediatric formulation 2). Each treatment will be separated by 4 weeks.
      Participants in Panel 1 will receive each treatment with a standardized breakfast, Panel 2
      will receive each treatment with yogurt, and Panel 3 will receive each treatment after a
      10-hour overnight fast (without food). The duration of the treatment period in this study
      will be 8.5 weeks (includes 4 weeks between treatments).

             the study and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study drug

          -  Participants must be non-smokers for at least 3 months prior to screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus - type 1 (HIV-1) or type 2 (HIV-2) infection confirmed at
             screening
