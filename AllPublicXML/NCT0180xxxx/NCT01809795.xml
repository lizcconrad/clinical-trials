  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to determine if adding blueberries to obese children's diet will
      improve weight status and other medical testing. We would also like to determine if a larger
      research study involving blueberries is possible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten children aged 12 to 17 years of age who have a BMI &gt; 95th percentile for age and who are
      patients of the Center for Better Health and Nutrition will be recruited for this 12 week
      study.

      Group 1 (Standard Therapy): Participants will be asked not to consume berries during the
      study so as not to confound the effects of eating blueberries. They will, however, be
      encouraged to consume other fruits consistent with nutrition guidelines for the Healthy
      Eating Plan (HEP: reduced glycemic load diet).

      Participants will be instructed and receive educational handout materials on implementing
      HEP. In addition participants will be introduced to the use of behavioral tools (e.g. goal
      setting, daily tracking when goals are met, and incentives provided by the family) to help
      them stay on track with HEP. Participants will be seen by the dietitian at monthly intervals
      consistent with programmatic standard of care to review adherence to HEP, use of behavioral
      tools, and change in weight status.

      Participants will be encouraged to attend group exercise classes five days per week or a
      minimum of four days per week. At the end of each exercise session, participants will receive
      a &quot;sham smoothie&quot; which contains no blueberries. The children will be directly observed by a
      study worker when consuming the smoothies to ensure compliance and measure how much of the
      smoothie was consumed.

      Group 2 (Blueberry Enhanced): All the features of Group 1 with the exception that the
      participants will be given a smoothie that contain 1 1/2 cups of freeze-dried whole
      blueberries crushed into a powder per serving.
