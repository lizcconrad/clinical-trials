  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing laparotomy, the incidence of abdominal wall related complications such
      as incisional hernia is very high. In particular in patients with peritonitis undergoing
      laparotomy the incidence of incisional hernia is up to 54.3%. Furthermore, these patients are
      at great risk for development of postoperative fascial dehiscence.

      The gold standard of abdominal wall closure is a running slowly absorbable suture
      irrespective of the presence of peritonitis. Implantation of an intraperitoneal mesh
      potentially reduces the incidence of incisional hernia.

      In a series of high risk patients in which we implanted non-absorbable intraperitoneal mesh
      prophylactically we reduced the incidence of incisional hernia down to 3.2%.

      Background

      Incisional hernia is a common complication in visceral surgery and varies between 11 and 26%
      in the general surgical population [1,2]. An incisional hernia is defined as any abdominal
      wall gap with or without a bulge in the area of postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by
      clinical examination or imaging [3]. Overall incidence of incisional hernia at our
      institution with a follow-up of five years was 14%, whereas in patients undergoing liver
      transplantation we found an incidence of incisional hernia of 25% in a prospective study [2].
      However, patients with peritonitis are at very high risk for the development of incisional
      hernia. Moussavian et al demonstrated an incidence of incisional hernia of 54.3% after a
      median follow-up of 6 years in patients undergoing emergency surgery for secondary
      peritonitis [4]. In patients undergoing surgical therapy for secondary peritonitis, redo
      surgery because of complications associated with the abdominal wall, such as fascial
      dehiscence and surgical site infection are frequent. Impaired wound healing in response to
      the systemic inflammatory response and the high incidence of surgical site infection might
      render the abdominal wall even more susceptible for incisional hernia, compared with the
      general surgical population [5,6]. Furthermore, patients with peritonitis undergoing
      emergency laparotomy develop fascial dehiscence in up to 24.1% [7]. Fascial dehiscence
      requires reoperation and is associated with a mortality rate up to 44% [8].

      Objective

      To compare prophylactic mesh implantation to conventional abdominal wall closure in patients
      undergoing emergency laparotomy for peritonitis.

      Methods

      Implantation of a non-resorbable intraperitoneal mesh in patients with peritonitis undergoing
      emergency laparotomy.
