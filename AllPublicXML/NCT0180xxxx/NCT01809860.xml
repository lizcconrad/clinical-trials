  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of sirolimus after single dose administration.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive a single dose of sirolimus on Day 1 followed by a 21 day wash-out
      period (time from sirolimus dosing to isavuconazole dosing). On Days 22 and 23, isavuconazole
      will be dosed three times daily (TID). On Days 24 through 34, isavuconazole will be
      administered once daily (QD). All subjects will be administered a single dose of sirolimus on
      Day 26.
