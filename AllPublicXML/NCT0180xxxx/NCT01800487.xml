  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis is one of the most common adverse effect from anti-tuberculosis. Silymarin showed
      its efficacy to decreased serum alanine transaminase enzyme in animal models from recent
      study. No confirmed this efficacy was performed in human.

      A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out according to Good
      Clinical Practice Guideline. This study is to define the efficacy of silymarin to prevent
      hepatotoxicity from anti-tuberculosis drugs. Informed consent is obtained prior to the study.
      New patients diagnosed with tuberculosis are enrolled. Patients with liver diseases, current
      alcohol drinking more than 20 g/day, regular use of herbal or other potential hepatotoxic
      drugs are excluded. Patients are treated with a standard regimen of four anti-tuberculosis
      therapy. They will randomize to receive either placebo or silymarin (140 mg) thrice daily.
      Liver function test (LFT) and clinical changes are assessed at 2- and 4-week after initiation
      of the treatment. DILI from anti-tuberculosis drugs ('atb-DILI') is defined as: i) a rise of
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to 2 times above normal upper limit, or ii) an elevation of
      total bilirubin more than 2 mg/dl with or without ALT elevation. The study endpoints are the
      level of ALT by week 4 and the number of patients who developed atb-DILI.

      Statistical analysis is used to compare the differences in ALT and number of atb-DILI
