    <textblock>
      The general hypothesis is that delayed antibiotic treatment strategy present similar
      effectiveness, when compared with non-prescription of antibiotics or the prescription of
      antibiotics, in the non-complicated acute respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients.

      The current project (DAP Pediatrics) is a study that explores the optimization of antibiotic
      prescribing in our country by evaluating the delayed prescription of antibiotics. The
      proposed trial will take place in the context of a prior similar study we conducted in
      adults. The study currently underway is the DAP-Adults study (a randomised controlled trial
      that evaluates several antibiotic prescribing strategies, including de delayed prescription
      in uncomplicated acute respiratory infections in adults in primary care).

      The aim of this study DAP-Pediatrics (randomized, multicenter parallel) to determine the
      efficacy and safety of delayed prescription of antibiotics compared to direct prescription
      and non-prescription of antibiotic in uncomplicated acute respiratory infections in pediatric
      patients. This 3 arms clinical trial will include 450 children and will evaluate the duration
      and severity of symptoms, antibiotic consumption, parents' satisfaction, the perceived
      efficacy of antibiotics and the number of visits generated. The project also includes a
      qualitative study, by means of structured interviews, to assess the perception and attitudes
      of parents towards the different treatment strategies and carry out a full analysis of
      economic evaluation.

        General Inclusion Criteria:

        In this study can be enrolled children (2 to 14 ages) with non-complicated acute
        respiratory tract infections, including pharyngotonsillitis, rhinosinusitis, acute
        bronchitis and acute media otitis. The doctors include children with these infections if
        they have reasonable doubts if they should treat with antibiotics.

        General Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not aged between 2 and 14.

          -  Patients have participated in the DAP-pediatrics previously.

          -  Patients are severely affected or patients has been felt severely affected for one
             week (all time).

          -  Patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of serious illness or severely affected
             and/or complications (particularly pneumonia, mastoiditis, peritonsillar abscess,
             peritonsillar cellulitis, intraorbital or intracranial complications).

          -  Patients at high risk of serious complications due to prior comorbidity. This includes
             significant heart disease, lung, kidney, liver or neuromuscular, immunosuppression,
