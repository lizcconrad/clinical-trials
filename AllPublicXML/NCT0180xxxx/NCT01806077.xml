    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, intravenous, single-dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PZ-128 (pepducin inhibitor of PAR1) in
      subjects with vascular disease or who have 2 or more coronary artery disease (CAD) risk
      factors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 to 75 with documented vascular disease
             (peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease or coronary artery disease) or 2
             or more coronary artery risk factors.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             enrollment and immediately before drug administration and agree to use two methods of
             effective barrier contraception, or a hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy
             throughout the study.

          -  The subject is able to read and give written informed consent and has signed and dated
             an informed consent document and authorization permitting release of personal health
             information approved by the Investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has participated in an investigational drug study within the last 30 days.

          -  The subject has a medical or surgical condition that may impair drug absorption or
             metabolism.

          -  Anticoagulants, P2Y12 inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (no more than
             three times a week) or any other drug that the investigator deems to have potential
             interaction with platelets or PAR-1 receptor inhibition are prohibited from 2 weeks
             prior to study drug dosing through 2 weeks post dosing. Aspirin is allowed.

          -  The subject has previous history of anaphylaxis to drugs or any environmental stimuli
             including foods or hymenoptera (e.g., ants, bees, wasps) stings.

          -  Asthma requiring bronchodilator/inhaler therapy.

          -  Currently smoking ≥2 pack/day.

          -  Herbal supplements (i.e., Fish Oil/Omega-3, St. John's Wart, Ginseng, Garlic, Ginkgo,
             Saw Palmetto, Echinacea, Yohimbine, Licorice, and Black Cohosh) are prohibited from 1
             week prior to dosing through 24 hours post dosing.

          -  Prior history or clinical suspicion of cerebral vascular malformations, intracranial
             tumor, transient ischemic attack, stroke, gastric ulcers and any form of bleeding
             disorder.

          -  Prior history of myocardial infarction within the last 3 months or unstable angina.

          -  Thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count of &lt;130,000/mm3 or low hematocrit defined
             as &lt;30%.

          -  Renal function: serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN. However, subjects with an estimated
             creatinine clearance eGFR ≥60 mL/min, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula,
             are eligible.

          -  Liver enzymes ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Alcohol consumption within 48 hrs prior to dosing, and for the duration of the
             in-house study period.

          -  Evidence of history of substance or alcohol abuse at screening, including positive
             urine test results for drugs or positive breath test for alcohol.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension defined as a sustained supine systolic
             pressure &gt;160 mmHg or &lt;100 mmHg; or a diastolic pressure &gt;90 mmHg or &lt; 50 mmHg.

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5

          -  Poor venous access (i.e., insufficient for intravenous drug delivery).

          -  History of hepatitis or HIV.

          -  The subject has undergone an invasive surgical procedure within the last 3 months, is
             anticipating one during the course of their study participation or is planning to have
             one within 1 month post dosing with the study drug.

          -  The subject has any condition which could interfere with or for which the treatment
             might interfere with the conduct of the study, or which would, in the opinion of the
             Investigator increase the risk of the subject's participation in the study. This would
             include, but is not limited to alcoholism, drug dependency or abuse, psychiatric
             disease, epilepsy or any unexplained blackouts, previous hypersensitivity to drugs,
             and severe asthma.
