      -  Hypothesis 1. When compared to passive dissemination, active dissemination will result
           in greater participant enrollment.

        -  Hypothesis 2. The intervention will be offered with equal fidelity in churches, clinics
           and community sites.

        -  Hypothesis 3. Knowledge of CRC screening and perceived risk of CRC will be positively
           correlated.

      In this study, investigators aim to evaluate 20 community coalitions and 7,200 participants
      by: testing passive and active approaches to disseminating the Educational Program to
      Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening (EPICS) to increase screening rates for colorectal
      cancer; measuring the extent to which EPICS is accepted and the fidelity of implementation in
      various settings and estimating the potential translatability and public health impact of
      EPICS. This four-arm cluster randomized trial (five community coalitions plus 1,800 African
      Americans, 50-74 years of age, who are not current on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening per
      arm) compares the following implementation strategies: (1) web access to facilitator training
      materials and toolkits without technical assistance (TA); (2) web access, but with technical
      assistance (TA); (3) in-person access to facilitator training materials and toolkits without
      TA and (4) in-person access with TA. Primary outcome measures are the reach (the proportion
      of representative eligible community coalitions and individuals participating in the trial)
      and effectiveness (post-intervention changes in CRC screening rates). Secondary outcomes
      include adoption (percentage of community coalitions implementing the EPICS sessions) and
      implementation (quality and consistency of the intervention delivery). The extent to which
      community coalitions continue to implement EPICS post-implementation (maintenance) will also
      be measured. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to compare passive to active
      dissemination costs. Investigators believe that implementing this evidence-based colorectal
      cancer screening intervention in partnership with community coalitions will result in more
      rapid adoption than traditional top-down approaches, and that changes in community CRC
      screening practices are more likely to be sustainable over time. With its national reach,
      this study has the potential to enhance understanding of barriers and enablers to the uptake
      of educational programs aimed at eliminating cancer health disparities.
