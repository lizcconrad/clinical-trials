  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators assessed the effects of low-dose IV ketamine-midazolam versus morphine on
      pain control in trauma patients with closed limb fracture(s); and also compared the incidence
      of adverse events (mainly cardio pulmonary ) between two groups.

    <textblock>
      this prospective, single blind, noninferiority trial randomized consecutive ED patients aged
      18 to 60 years to two groups: receiving either 300-500 mcg ketamine plus 0.03 mg midazolam,
      or 0.05 to 0.1 mg morphine. Visual analogue score and adverse events were carefully verified
      during an interval of 30 minutes.

      Two hundreds, thirty six patients were selected, among whom were 207 males (87.3%), and 29
      females (12.2%). The average age was 29Â±2, with extremes of 60 years and 18 years.the
      patients were divided into two groups: G1: 116 patients receiving ketamine-midazolam and G2:
      120 patients receiving morphine alone.
