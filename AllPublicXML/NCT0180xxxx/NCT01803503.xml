  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out whether the effect of docetaxel chemotherapy may be improved by
      combining it with another anti-cancer drug called sunitinib, which stops blood vessels from
      growing (anti-angiogenic agent). Sunitinib is an oral anti-angiogenic drug that has been
      approved for the treatment of kidney cancer, a rare form of soft tissue tumor called
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and a rare form of cancer in the pancreas called pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumor. Sunitinib is usually given continuously at a dose of 37.5mg (3 pills)
      daily either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, there are studies which have
      shown that the continuous administration of sunitinib may reduce chemotherapy effectiveness.
      On the other hand, a short course of sunitinib before each chemotherapy cycle may sensitize
      the tumor to chemotherapy. This treatment strategy will be used in patients with different
      kinds of cancers with a commonly used chemotherapy drug, docetaxel. Ths study aims to
      evaluate if intermittent administration of low dose sunitinib before docetaxel chemotherapy
      can improve the treatment response in cancer patients.

      Study Hypothesis: Low dose, short course sunitinib at 12.5mg daily orally for 1 week prior to
      chemotherapy can normalize tumor vasculature and enhance delivery of chemotherapy into the
      tumor, and improve treatment response and progression-free survival.

      This is a single-centre, phase II randomized study. Eligible patients will be randomized to
      docetaxel with or without intermittent sunitinib. A total of eighty patients with measurable
      tumor will be enrolled over a period of 24-36 months. Eligible patients will be randomized
      1:1 to either arm A or arm B. Patients will be stratified according to site of primary tumor
      (breast vs non-small cell lung cancer vs others) for randomization purposes.

      Arm A (Control arm):

      Docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks

      Arm B (Experimental arm):

      Docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, preceded by 7 days of sunitinib 12.5mg orally daily
      during each cycle.

      Patients will be treated for a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy in the absence of tumor
      progression or unacceptable toxicities.

      Patient will be evaluated weekly for toxicity assessments and full blood count during cycle
      1, and on days 1 and 15 of each subsequent cycle.
