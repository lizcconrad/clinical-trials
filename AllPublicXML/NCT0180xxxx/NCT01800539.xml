  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the need to characterize and improve early intervention services for minority and
      under-resourced children with ASD, this study translates a manualized and proven training
      model to examine its impact on the use of evidence-based practices (EBP) by early
      intervention providers, and to examine its relationship to child and family outcomes. By
      highlighting the impact of EBP-focused training on participating providers, children, and
      families, findings of the proposed study have the potential to effect significant change in
      the organization and delivery of early intervention services for minority and under-resourced
      children with ASD.
