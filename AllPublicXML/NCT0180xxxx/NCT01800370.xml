  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging in men reduces the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (Te) secreted in
      each burst. Stress-associated mechanisms introduced by acute illness and chronic disease
      decrease LH and Te secretion further. A major unresolved issue is whether the aging process
      heightens the negative effects of a stressor (whether physical or metabolic) upon LH and Te
      secretion. This study will assess LH and Te secretion in response to a physical stressor
      (maximal exercise) and a common metabolic stressor (hyperglycemia) as a function of age in
      healthy men ages 18-80 yr.

    <description>Blood will be sampled every 10 min from 0700 to 1300 h. Each intervention will begin at 0800 h after 1 h of baseline sampling, and be completed by 0900 h. Intervention is followed by 4 additional h of sampling to capture recovery (total sampling 6 h). Ten-min samples are for Te, LH, ACTH, cortisol, and GH. Glucose will be checked every 30 min. At 07000 h an archival serum sample will be obtained for safety-monitoring purposes.</description>
