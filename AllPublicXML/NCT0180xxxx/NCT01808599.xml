      Single arm phase II study of Chlorambucil in combination with subcutaneous Rituximab followed
      by maintenance therapy with subcutaneous Rituximab in patients with histologically proven
      diagnosis of CD20-positive marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type arisen at any
      extranodal site, either de novo, or relapsed following local therapy (including surgery,
      radiotherapy and antibiotics for H. pylori-positive gastric lymphoma).

      The study consists in three parts. In Part A (induction phase I) patients will be treated
      with Chlorambucil 6 mg/m2 daily p.o for 42 consecutive days (weeks 1-6) in combination with
      intravenous Rituximab 375mg/m2 on day 1 week 1 followed by subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg on
      days 8, 15 and 22 (day 1 of weeks 2, 3 and 4). After restaging (CT scan to be performed
      during weeks 7-8, i.e. between d42 and d55), responding patients (CR, CRu, PR) and those with
      stable disease will be treated in part B (induction phase II). In part B, starting from d56,
      (month 3) patients will receive Chlorambucil 6 mg/m2 daily p.o for 14 consecutive days
      (d1-14) every 28 days for 4 cycles in combination with subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg on day 1
      of each 28-day cycle. After restaging (CT scan to be performed at the end of month 6)
      responding patients and those with stable disease will be treated in part C. In Part C
      (maintenance phase) patients will be treated with subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg every two
      months for 2 years (in total 12 injections). During maintenance phase, CT scans will be
      performed every 12 months and patients responding or with stable disease will stay on
      treatment for a total of two years as above reported.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven diagnosis of CD20-positive marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT
             type either de novo, or relapsed following local therapy (including surgery,

               -  H. pylori-negative cases, either de novo (non pre-treated) or at relapse
                  following local therapy (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy or antibiotics).

                    -  Patients with clinical (endoscopic) and histological evidence of disease
                       progression at any time post H. pylori eradication

                    -  Stable disease with persistent lymphoma at ≥ 1 year post H. pylori
                       eradication

          2. Measurable or evaluable disease. Measurable disease in at least two perpendicular
             dimensions on an imaging scan is defined as: lymph node or nodal mass bi-dimensional
             measurement with &gt; 1.5 cm in longest transverse diameter or the short diameter must
             measure &gt; 10 mm regardless of the longest transverse diameter.

          3. Any stage (Ann Arbor I-IV) (see Appendix A)

             involvement

          9. For women of childbearing potential only: negative serum pregnancy test done within 7

         10. Fertile male or female patients of childbearing potential and their partners must use
             two forms of contraception during the study and for at least 12 months after the last
             dose of subcutaneous rituximab.

             For appropriate methods of contraception considered acceptable, see Appendix C. Should
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner are
             participating in this study and for 12 months after study participation, the patient

               -  Women who have had tubal ligation

             Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the
             following reasons:

               -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
                  salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

         15. Fertile men or women of childbearing potential who do not agree to use a highly
             effective measure of contraception (such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine device

             sterile) throughout the study and for at least 12 months after the last dose of
             subcutaneous rituximab
