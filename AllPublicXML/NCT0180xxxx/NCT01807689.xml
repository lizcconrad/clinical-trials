  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center clinical study to compare the performance of a collective panel of
      salivary biomarkers to discriminate SS from non-SS in sicca cohorts recruited from three
      clinical sites with the diagnostic outcomes based on the new classification criteria for
      Sjögren's syndrome by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed in 2012. This is
      not a treatment study, but a pilot study to confirm diagnostic ability of a panel of salivary
      biomarkers. All enrolled subjects must be classified as having both oral and ocular sicca
      symptoms without another autoimmune/connective tissue disease (Appendix 2). At the University
      of California in Los Angeles, using molecular techniques, we will quantify discriminatory
      biomarkers in saliva collected from enrolled subjects, who are also being evaluated as part
      of their clinical care using the standard diagnostic tests of the 2002 AECG criteria. We also
      will test the performance of these biomarkers to predict the diagnosis of pSS according to
      the AECG criteria, as these are the most widely used tests to diagnose pSS and assess disease
      activity worldwide.

      Aim 1: Test the association using Odds Ratios between seven individual biomarkers (cathepsin
      D, α-enolase and β-2-microglobulin [B2M], anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-histone,
      anti-transglutaminase) with pSS and build an initial panel and evaluate its sensitivity and
      specificity for diagnosis of SS at the time of interim analysis using the first 210 recruited
      subjects.

      Hypothesis 1: Individual biomarkers are significantly associated with SS. Hypothesis 2: The
      panel has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of SS.

      Aim 2: Test the panel on the second 210 recruited subjects, refine and evaluate the panel
      sensitivity and specificity on entire 420 subjects.

      Hypothesis 1: The panel built from Aim 1 has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for
      diagnosis of SS.

      Hypothesis 2: The refined panel has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of
      SS.

        All enrolled subjects must be classified as having both oral and ocular sicca symptoms,
        without another autoimmune/connective tissue disease. All enrolled subjects, who are also
        being evaluated as part of their clinical care, using the standard diagnostic tests of the
        AECG criteria of 2002, will meet the ARC criteria.
