  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a common problem in the western world. There is a group of people suffering from
      neck pain with a reduced ability to maintain an upright posture showing a forward head
      position and an altered muscle function.

      The aim of the study was to evaluate a motor control intervention for patients with
      persistent neck pain and a forward head posture.

      This pilot study used a Single System Experimental Design (SSED) with an A-B-A-design and
      multiple baselines.

      The tailored motor control intervention addressed the faulty postural alignment and the deep
      muscles of the cervical spine.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Head posture</measure>
    <time_frame>Effect from baseline to 8 weeks and being maintained to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The craniovertebral (CV) -angle was used to estimate the cervical curvature and head posture in relation to the thorax being measured with the Head Posture Spinal Curvature Instrument</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle function of the deep cervical flexors</measure>
    <time_frame>Effect from baseline to 8 weeks and being maintained to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Cranio-Cervical Flexion Test (C-CFT) was used to assess the tonic holding abilities of the deep cervical muscles by using a Pressure biofeedback unit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Effect from baseline to 8 weeks and being maintained to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a self-reported questionnaire with 10 categories where each question estimates the current status, from no disability (0) to full disability within that category used to assess disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Effect from baseline to 8 weeks and being maintained to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity was evaluated using the 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with the anchors &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; that assessed the average pain intensity in the neck over the last seven days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Posture</measure>
    <time_frame>Effect from baseline to 8 weeks and being maintained to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The category Relation to Body Center (items Postural activity, Deviation in standing, Stability in stance and In sitting) and Relation to Ground (items Contact surface, Load, Stance on one leg) from the Body Awareness Scale (BAS) was used to measure the theoretical plumb line perpendicular to the body´s center to estimate the ability to maintain a neutral posture.</description>
