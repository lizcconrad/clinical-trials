  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofilm has been identified as the major bacterial phenotype contributing to atherosclerosis.
      It has become very important to evaluate atherosclerosis and the role of biofilm using
      advanced technologies. It is also important to understand wound biofilm at a genetic and a
      molecular level.

      High throughput pyrosequencing is opening new doors in nucleic acid analysis. 454 Roche has
      developed sequencing instrumentation which has the ability to sequence not only genomic DNA
      (gDNA) but also derivatives of messenger RNA (mRNA) and 16s ribosomal DNA (rDNA). This
      technology has the potential to survey the nucleic acids involved within a mixed population
      of species, such as atherosclerotic biofilm. In addition to transcriptome science; proteome,
      metabolome, and other -omic sciences are advancing rapidly. Examining atherosclerotic plaque
      using transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and other -omic approaches may provide valuable
      insight into the wound's microecology.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To study the role of biofilm in the hardening of the arteries. The study will evaluate the hardening of the arteries found in legs that have been amputated because of vascular disease and/or diabetes.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Amputated legs will be dissected and en bloc removal of atherosclerotic arteries will be performed within the pathology department of TTUHSC. Preferred artery specimen will be grossly involved arteries that are 5-10 cm in length. The specimens would be flash frozen and stored at -81 degrees within the department until analysis could be undertaken. Frozen tissue would be transferred to the site for further testing (R&amp;T) once the accrual goal was met. This technology has the potential to survey the nucleic acids involved within a mixed population of species, such as atherosclerotic biofilm. In addition to transcriptome science; proteome, metabolome, and other -omic sciences are advancing rapidly. Examining atherosclerotic plaque using transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and other -omic approaches may provide valuable insight into the wound's microecology.</description>
