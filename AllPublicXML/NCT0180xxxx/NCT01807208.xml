  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are two fold: 1) To learn whether a personalized patient health goal
      and reminder tool helps patients to learn more about their condition and to make changes in
      behavior and medication taking to reduce the risk of another heart attack. 2) To examine a
      blood sample to learn how patients are responding to their medications. The study team will
      enroll approximately 220 patients in the hospital recovering from a heart attack. Half of the
      patients will receive the educational tools and a copy will be sent to their outpatient
      provider.

      The goals of this study are two fold: 1) To evaluate the impact of a personalized patient
      health goal education and reminder tool on patient adherence to evidence based therapies and
      subsequent cardiovascular risk factor modification after acute myocardial infarction (AMI);
      2) To assess age-related heterogeneity in antiplatelet response among AMI patients. This is a
      prospective study of ~220 AMI patients, with at least half over age 65 years. Patients will
      be surveyed with questionnaires (at baseline and 6 months post discharge) and biomarkers
      (baseline only) to assess the status of their physical function, depression, nutrition,
      inflammation, and response to antiplatelet therapies. Patients will also be administered a
      walking test and a grip strength test at baseline. About 1 week after hospital discharge, and
      again about 3 months after hospital discharge, about half of the patients and their
      outpatient providers will receive the personalized post-AMI health goal education and
      reminder tool on patient adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention therapies. Data
      will be analyzed in aggregate using descriptive statistics. The primary endpoint of interest
      is a composite measure of adherence at six months to secondary prevention therapies described
      as the sum of measures received divided by the sum of available opportunities. The secondary
      endpoint will be analyzed to describe platelet response profiles as a function of age. The
      study team anticipates the risks for this study to be minimal, since the patient does not
      receive any investigational therapies.

    <description>The study team plans to evaluate the impact of a personalized patient health goal education and reminder tool on 6-month clinical and other health outcomes. The measure will be a composite of lab measures (such as blood pressure at goal; BMI at goal), behavior change (physical activity, smoking cessation) and medication use (beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins if not contraindicated)</description>

    <description>The study team will ask patients whether they used the education tools in their follow-up physician visits post-AMI; how helpful the tools were; whether they were easy to read and understand; and whether the amount of material presented was appropriate</description>
