  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if physician education coupled with audit and
      feedback of antibiotic prescribing can improve antibiotic prescribing by primary care
      clinicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a large, diverse pediatric primary care network sharing a comprehensive electronic
      health record (EHR), a cluster-randomized trial will be performed to determine the
      effectiveness of an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship bundle, including treatment
      guidelines coupled with audit and feedback of physician prescribing, to curb inappropriate
      antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections.

      Aim 1: To determine the impact of an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship bundle within a
      pediatric primary care network on antibiotic prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics
      are not indicated.

      Hypothesis: Antimicrobial stewardship will decrease rates of antibiotic prescribing for
      conditions for which antibiotics are not indicated.

      Aim 2: To determine the impact of an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship bundle within a
      pediatric primary care network on broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for conditions for
      which narrow-spectrum antibiotics are indicated.

      Hypothesis: Antimicrobial stewardship will decrease the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic
      prescribing for conditions for which narrow-spectrum antibiotics are indicated.

    <description>The secondary outcome measure seeks to determine the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for targeted conditions for which narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated. Thus, two classes of diagnoses will be collected: 1) respiratory tract infections for which no antibiotics are indicated, represented by a group codes indicating common infections with presumed viral etiology and 2) bacterial respiratory tract infections for which narrow spectrum antibiotics are indicated</description>
