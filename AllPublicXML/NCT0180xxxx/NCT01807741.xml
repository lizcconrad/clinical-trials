      The purpose of this study is to compare asenapine with placebo in the treatment of depression
      associated with bipolar disorder, type I over eight weeks.

      We hypothesize that patients will show significantly greater improvement with asenapine than
      placebo over eight weeks of treatment.

      86 patients with an episode of major depression associated with bipolar disorder, type I will
      be recruited by two sites for the study over fifteen months. Medication will be administered
      in a double-blind manner. Patients will receive asenapine (or placebo) beginning on day 0 at
      5 mg bid. Dose may be increased to 10 mg bid and adjusted based on clinical response.
      Patients will be evaluated by a blinded (to treatment status) rater. Patients will be seen
      and ratings obtained at baseline (day 0) and on days 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 (or termination
      from the study). Adverse events will be evaluated as well.

    <description>Asenapine will be given beginning on day 0 at 5 mg bid. Dose will be increased to 10 mg bid if there is less than 50% decrease in MADRS score by week 2. Dose increases may be held if clinically indicated. Doses may be decreased at any time, if clinically indicated, by increments of 5 mg/day to a minimum of 5 mg qHS. Daily treatment with asenapine will be for 8 weeks.</description>
