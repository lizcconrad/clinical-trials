  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have breathing problems during sleep. This is called
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS is very common in individuals with Down
      syndrome because of the shape of their face and tongue and because of their low muscle tone.
      OSAS can cause a lot of health problems including behavioral and learning problems as well as
      heart problems.

      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effects of treating OSAS in individuals
      with Down syndrome with a machine called Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). The
      investigators want to see if treatment of OSAS improves learning, behavior and heart
      problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All individuals participating in the study will be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome (OSAS) with a baseline sleep study. Based on the results of the sleep
      study,individuals with OSAS will be randomly assigned into two groups. One group will receive
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the other intervention group will receive sham
      CPAP(placebo) for four months. CPAP is a machine with a mask that fits over the nose, is worn
      during sleep and helps keep the airway open. Sham CPAP (placebo) is a machine that looks and
      sounds like a CPAP machine but does not give pressure so it does not treat OSAS. Individuals
      with normal breathing during the sleep study will not receive a machine, and will serve as
      controls.

      Individuals will also have baseline tests including blood tests, an echocardiogram (pictures
      of the heart), a walking test and learning tests. After 4 months, the baseline tests will be
      repeated in all participants. At the end of the study, all individuals with OSAS will get
      treatment.

    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale From Baseline to End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of the study is to assess the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and the neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes of individuals with Down syndrome. Sleepiness was assessed using the pediatric version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. It provides a measure of a person's general level of daytime sleepiness, or average sleep propensity in daily life. The ESS asks people to rate, on a 4-point scale (0, low to 3, high) their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily lives. The total ESS score provides an estimate of a general characteristic of each person's average level of sleepiness in daily life (0= no chance of dozing/no daytime sleepiness to 24=high chance of dozing/lots of daytime sleepiness).</description>

    <measure>Change in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Score From Baseline to 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in behavioral domain was measured by the Child Check Behavior List. The CBCL is a widely used method of identifying problem behavior in children. Problems are identified by a respondent who knows the child well, usually a parent or other care giver. There are 2 versions based on the child's age (CBCL/1½-5 for use children 18 months-5 years; the CBCL/6-18 for children aged 6-18 years). The checklists consists of a number of statements about the child's behavior and responses are recorded on a scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. The preschool checklist contains 100 questions and, school-age checklist contains 120 questions. 8 sub-scores (1 for each of 8 syndromes: anxious/depressed, withdrawn depressed, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior and aggressive behavior) are calculated, each ranging from 0 (normal) to 16 (clinical behavior).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Left Ventricular (LV) Mass Index Score From Baseline to 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in left ventricular mass index score, measured on echocardiography, was used to assess the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and cardiovascular function of individuals with Down syndrome. Left ventricular (LV) mass was calculated from M-mode measurements of the LV end-diastolic dimension, the thickness of the interventricular septum and the thickness of the LV posterior wall, and presented as a z-score.</description>

        <title>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale From Baseline to End of Study</title>
        <description>The primary aim of the study is to assess the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and the neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes of individuals with Down syndrome. Sleepiness was assessed using the pediatric version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. It provides a measure of a person’s general level of daytime sleepiness, or average sleep propensity in daily life. The ESS asks people to rate, on a 4-point scale (0, low to 3, high) their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily lives. The total ESS score provides an estimate of a general characteristic of each person's average level of sleepiness in daily life (0= no chance of dozing/no daytime sleepiness to 24=high chance of dozing/lots of daytime sleepiness).</description>

        <title>Change in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Score From Baseline to 4 Months</title>
        <description>The change in behavioral domain was measured by the Child Check Behavior List. The CBCL is a widely used method of identifying problem behavior in children. Problems are identified by a respondent who knows the child well, usually a parent or other care giver. There are 2 versions based on the child's age (CBCL/1½-5 for use children 18 months-5 years; the CBCL/6-18 for children aged 6-18 years). The checklists consists of a number of statements about the child's behavior and responses are recorded on a scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. The preschool checklist contains 100 questions and, school-age checklist contains 120 questions. 8 sub-scores (1 for each of 8 syndromes: anxious/depressed, withdrawn depressed, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior and aggressive behavior) are calculated, each ranging from 0 (normal) to 16 (clinical behavior).</description>
