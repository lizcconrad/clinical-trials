  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, partially-blinded, placebo and moxifloxacin-controlled, single dose,
      4-period, balanced crossover study. The primary objective of this study is to separately
      assess the effects of a therapeutic and supratherapeutic dose of GSK1322322 on the cardiac
      conduction (corrected QT interval [QTc]) compared with placebo in eligible healthy male and
      female subjects. Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) will be used as an open-label positive
      control in order to validate the sensitivity of the study in detecting QTc change.
      Approximately 56 healthy subjects will participate in the study for approximately 9 weeks
      i.e. 30 day Screening period, 4-week Treatment period, and a 7-10 day Follow-up period. There
      will be 4 treatment periods separated by at least 1 week. Subjects will be admitted to the
      clinical unit on Day -1 of each dosing period. Each subject will receive each of the four
      treatment sequences (GSK1322322 1200 milligram [mg] intravenous [IV] over 60 minutes x 1
      dose, GSK1322322 3000 mg IV over 60 minutes x 1 dose, GSK1322322 Placebo IV over 60 minutes x
      1 dose, moxifloxacin 400 mg administered orally x 1 dose) on Day 1 of each Treatment period
      in a randomized fashion. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous Holter monitoring,
      laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and serial pharmacokinetic samples will be
      collected for up to 24 hours following each treatment. If no clinically significant
      abnormalities are noted, subjects will be discharged from the clinical research unit after
      the completion of all assessments on Day 2 in each period and return approximately one week
      later for the next dosing period. Each individual subject will follow the same dosing
      schedule at every period. A Follow-up visit will be conducted 7-10 days after administration
      of the last dose of study medication in treatment period 4.
