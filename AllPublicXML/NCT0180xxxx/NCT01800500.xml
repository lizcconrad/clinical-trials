    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies interest in smokeless tobacco product as a
      substitution for cigarettes in current smokers. Use of smokeless tobacco products may help
      people stop smoking. Measuring use of other sources of nicotine for cigarettes under a
      variety of different conditions may help determine whether and how much smokers are willing
      to use substitutions

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Systematically vary price, availability, product type, and information about products to
      examine their individual and joint effects on degree of substitution of smokeless products
      for cigarettes.

      II. Examine the impact of smokeless tobacco (ST) substitution on biomarkers of exposure
      (carbon monoxide [CO], cotinine).

      III. Explore relationships between ST substitution and measures of mood and health related
      quality of life.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Participants purchase ST products using a fixed rate of product prices once weekly and
      record their consumption of ST products and cigarettes smoked daily for 3 weeks.

      ARM II: Participants purchase ST products using escalating product prices once weekly and
      record their consumption of ST products and cigarettes smoked daily for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
