    <textblock>
      This prospective pilot study is designed to provide preliminary data on the use of
      Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FDG-PET-MRI) in
      patients with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) associated optic glioma and plexiform neurofibroma
      (PN).

      Subjects will undergo FDG-PET-MRI scans in place of standard of care imaging at 0 and 12
      months, unless more frequent imaging is clinically indicated. Subjects and their family
      caregivers will also undergo serial interviews and complete questionnaires related to the
      psychosocial aspects of NF1.
