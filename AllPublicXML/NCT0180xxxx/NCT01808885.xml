    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter safety study comparing the tolerance profile of olesoxime (495 mg, od) when
      administered on top of Interferon beta in patients with stable Relapsing Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis. Patients will be randomly allocated to olesoxime (495 mg, od) or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio.

      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the general safety and tolerability of
      olesoxime (495 mg, od), compared to placebo when administered in combination with Interferon
      beta over a 24-week treatment period in patients with stable Relapsing Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of multicenter protocols
      for measurement of neurodegeneration and remyelination by MRI as well as the plasma exposure
      to olesoxime (495 mg, od).

      MRI will be performed to all patients to assess effects of olesoxime on brain inflammation as
      well as to assess measures of brain atrophy, neuronal damage and myelination status at
      Baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.
