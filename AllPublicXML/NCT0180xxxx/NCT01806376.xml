      The primary objective of this study is to explore the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting
      toxicity of oral Subutinib Maleate capsules and rational dosage regimen for phase Ⅱ study, to
      investigate the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple oral doses of Subutinib Maleate
      capsules.
