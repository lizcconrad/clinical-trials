  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      pomalidomide that can be given in combination with melphalan and dexamethasone that can be
      given to patients with AL amyloidosis. The safety of this drug combination will also be
      studied.

      Pomalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. This may decrease the
      growth of cancer cells.

      Melphalan is designed to damage the DNA (genetic material) of cells, which may cause cancer
      cells to die.

      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body.
      Dexamethasone is often given to Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients in combination with other
      chemotherapy to treat cancer.

      Planned Phase I/II Study terminated early during Phase I portion without continuation to
      Phase II.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of pomalidomide, based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of pomalidomide
      will be tested for the Phase I portion of this study. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled
      at each dose level in the Phase I portion, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in
      Phase II. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group
      will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were
      seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of pomalidomide is found.

      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive pomalidomide at the highest
      dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone and melphalan. If
      intolerable side effects are seen at the lowest dose level, then the melphalan dose will be
      lowered.

      After 2 cycles of therapy, you may be referred to a transplant specialist, if you are
      eligible for a stem cell transplant.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      Treatment Phase:

      You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-21 of each cycle. You should take each
      dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow the pomalidomide capsules
      whole with water at the same time each day. Pomalidomide should be taken without food (at
      least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal). Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If
      you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss
      taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (DO NOT
      take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You should tell the study
      doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide. If you take more than
      the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care, if needed, and
      contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused pomalidomide and empty
      bottles to the clinic at each study visit.

      You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan or
      dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets
      you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to
      review.

      On Days 1-4 of each cycle, you will take melphalan pills by mouth one time each day. You
      should take melphalan in the morning at least 2 hours before or after a meal.

      You will take dexamethasone pills on Days 1-4 of each cycle.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You will receive a
      blood thinner to prevent blood clots. The study doctor will decide what type of blood thinner
      you will receive.

      Maintenance Phase:

      You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-28 of each cycle during the maintenance
      phase. You should take each dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow
      the pomalidomide capsules whole with water, at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or
      open the capsules. If you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the
      same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next
      scheduled day (DO NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You
      should tell the study doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide.
      If you take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical
      care, if needed, and contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused
      pomalidomide and empty bottles to the clinic at each study visit.

      You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan, or
      dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets
      you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to
      review.

             weeks prior to starting therapy with PMD, with the following exceptions:Vertebroplasty
             and/or kyphoplasty, which must have been performed at least 1 week prior to starting
             PMD; Planned elective surgery unrelated to the patient's diagnosis of multiple
             myeloma, such as hernia repair, may be allowed, at the discretion of the principle
             investigator, as long as it was performed at least 2 weeks prior to starting PMD, and
             patients have recovered fully from this procedure

         16. Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the duration
             of the study since the effects of PMD on the developing human fetus are unknown. If a
             female partner of a male subject taking Pomalidomide becomes pregnant, the male
             subject taking Pomalidomide should notify the Investigator immediately. The pregnant
             female partner should notify their healthcare provider. Female patients must be either
             post menopausal, free from menses for &gt;/= 2 years, surgically sterilized, or willing
             to use two adequate barrier methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy, or must
             agree to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study. Female patients of
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (Beta-HCG) before
             receiving the first dose of PMD. The female participant must also follow pregnancy
             testing requirements as outlined in the POMALYST REMS program.

         17. Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients
             intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin).

         18. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMSTM program,
             and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the POMALYST REMSTM
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are receiving any concurrent investigational agent with known or
             suspected activity against amyloidosis

          2. Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 or higher, as defined by National Cancer Institute
             Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) version 4.

          3. Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction within 6
             months of enrollment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure
             uncontrolled angina, or clinically significant pericardial disease.

          4. Stage III cardiac amyloidosis with NT-proBNP&gt; 8000 ng/L.

          5. Amyloid-specific syndrome, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or skin purpura as the only
             evidence of disease. The finding of vascular amyloid only in a bone marrow biopsy
             specimen or in a plasmacytoma is not indicative of systemic amyloidosis.

          6. Presence of non-AL amyloidosis

          7. Clinically overt multiple myeloma with definite lytic bone lesions.

          8. Other malignancy within the past 5 years. Exceptions include basal cell or
             non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ or FIGO
             Stage 1 carcinoma of the cervix, or breast or prostate cancer that have been stable on
             hormonal therapy for at least three years.

          9. Concurrent medical condition or disease, such as active systemic infection,
             uncontrolled diabetes, or pulmonary disease, that is likely to interfere with study
             procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the investigator would constitute a
             hazard for participating in this study.

         10. Use of any investigational drugs within 30 days before initiation of study treatment

         11. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             pomalidomide. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

         12. Patients with active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infection

         13. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or lenalidomide.

         14. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while
             taking thalidomide, pomalidomide or similar drugs.

         15. Any prior use of thalidomide, lenalidomide or pomalidomide.

         16. Known positive for HIV.
