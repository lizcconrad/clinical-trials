    <textblock>
      Obturator externus (OE) muscle has the possibility as a pain generator, considering its
      anatomical and functional aspects, but this muscle as a possible target for therapeutic
      intervention is currently understudied in pain practice.

    <measure>Post-injection pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 weeks after injection</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after the OE muscle injection, patients were asked to rate their pain score using a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain). We also assessed the degree of patient satisfaction as excellent, good, fair, and bad during 2 weeks after injection. In this period, any analgesic medications did not change in all patients. Complications associated with OE muscle injection were investigated.</description>

        The study population was defined as chronic pelvic pain patients with a localized
        tenderness on inferolateral side of the pubic tubercle corresponding to obturator foramen
        who received OE muscle injection with local anesthetic for their pain treatment.
