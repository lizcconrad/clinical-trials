    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single arm, open label clinical trial. 60 RVO patients (including 30 BRVO
      and 30 CRVO, respectively) are enrolled in the study. The study included a fixed treatment
      period (3 months) and a PRN period (6 months). In the fixed treatment period patients will
      receive 3 consecutive monthly intravitreal of 0.5 mg Conbercept. In the PRN period, patients
      are monthly visited and retreatment will be needed according to the retreatment criteria
      pre-specified.
