  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed research is a single center, prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled
      trial, designed to evaluate IVF pregnancy outcomes following endometrial injury in 254
      patients with implantation failure. Patients will be identified during their work-up and
      treatment at Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center. Only Shady Grove patients are
      eligible for the study. The investigators hypothesize in patients with one or more previous
      failed day 5 blastocyst transfers, injury to the endometrium via endometrial biopsy will
      improve clinical pregnancy outcomes compared to controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in assisted reproductive technologies; implantation failure in patients
      undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) is frequent. Unfortunately, few treatments exist
      except for the use of a gestational carrier. There have been a number of recent clinical
      studies demonstrating that local injury to the endometrium results in improved clinical
      pregnancy outcomes for patients with a history of implantation failure. However, not all
      studies have shown a beneficial effect, and those demonstrating benefit have been limited by
      small sample sizes, and considerable heterogeneity in the procedures and populations
      evaluated. A recent meta-analysis synthesized the available data concluded that a large,
      prospective, well-designed randomized trial is desperately needed to definitively assess this
      new possible treatment. If these preliminary findings from previous trials are confirmed,
      this practice could be applied in the clinical setting to help patients suffering from
      repeated implantation failures.

    <description>Subjects will have a vaginal speculum placed and visualization of the cervix will be obtained. The cervix will be cleaned with betadine (or hibiclens for those with an iodine allergy). Those randomized to the treatment arm (endometrial biopsy) will have an endometrial pipelle (Endocell, Wallach, Orange, Connecticut) inserted gently through the cervix into the uterus. Two passes will be performed with the pipelle catheter. For each pass the catheter will be rotated and scraped 4 times, once in each quadrant.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to the control group will have a small cotton swab placed gently into the cervix. No tissue will be obtained with this method. The randomization to a placebo control is necessary to prove that any positive effects seen are due to the biopsy and not just random chance.</description>
