  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of prednisone versus
      sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline (50 mg/d) in the treatment of active moderate-severe
      Graves' Orbitopathy (GO).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy is an autoimmune disease characterized by an inflammatory phase followed
      by fibrosis. Surgery to correct eyelid swelling, proptosis, and diplopia is effective, but
      can not be done until the inflammatory phase has passed. To arrest the inflammatory phase,
      several types of immunosuppressive treatments have been investigated. Corticosteroids are the
      first-choice immunosuppressive treatment, having a successful outcome of 50-70% in patients.
      However, long time usage of corticosteroids often cause severe side-effects.

      Sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline posses known anti-inflammatory effects that are separate
      from their antibacterial mode of action. This mode of action has lead to the routine use of
      sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline for treating inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, such as
      rosacea, periodontitis and multiple sclerosis. The mechanism is by inhibiting lymphocyte
      proliferation and production of colony-stimulating factor, inflammatory cytokines, and
      immunoglobulins, factors thought to play a role in the orbital autoimmune process. These
      mechanisms make them, in theory, an attractive option of doxycycline for treating Graves'
      Orbitopathy. In addition, only few adverse events were reported when doxycycline were
      administered for 3 months in patients with periodontitis or rosacea.

      We propose to compare the effect and safety of sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline versus
      prednisone for treating non-sight threatening, moderate-severe, inflammatory GO.

    <description>Overall treatment response was graded as: improvement, deterioration, and no success.
Improvement, when at least one major criteria or two minor criteria were achieved, in absence of deterioration of any criterion in that observed eye.Three major criteria were: improvement in diplopia grade (disappearance or change in grade); improvement of ≥8 degrees in any direction of eye movements; reduction of three points or more in CAS. Four minor criteria were: reduction of 2 mm or more in eyelid aperture; reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis; improvement in grade of soft tissue swelling; decrease in CAS by at least two points.
Deterioration, defined as occurrence of DON, and/or worsening of soft tissue swelling, and/or worsening of diplopia, and/or an increase of ≥2 mm in lid aperture, and/or an increase of ≥2 mm in proptosis, and/or a decrease of ≥8 degrees in duction.
No success was defined if there was no change or the changes did not reach the improvement criteria.</description>
