  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a device to compare the blood flow in the patient's
      injured arm to the patient's uninjured arm. This will help us determine 'normal' readings for
      this device for a child's forearm and may in the future help us detect children that have
      injured the blood vessels that go to the forearm when they have an elbow fracture. The
      patient will be one of approximately 100 people involved in this research project at
      Carolinas Medical Center, and the patient's participation will last until the patient is
      discharged from the hospital. It is hypothesized that if the blood vessel is uninjured, the
      readings on the NIRS device on the injured arm will be equal to the uninjured arm. It is also
      hypothesized that if the blood vessel of the injured arm is injured, the readings on the NIRS
      device will be different than on the uninjured arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supracondylar humerus fractures (fracture just above the elbow) are common in children.
      Supracondylar humerus fractures account for 60% of the elbow fractures in children. Some
      supracondylar fractures injure the brachial artery and a small percentage of children present
      with an absent radial pulse after supracondylar humerus fracture, and these injuries may
      result in insufficient blood flow to the ipsilateral forearm. This can lead to compartment
      syndrome and/or ischemic contracture of the forearm muscles, and may result in permanent
      disability. Currently, physicians do not have objective data to determine whether or not the
      forearm muscles below a supracondylar humerus fracture are receiving adequate blood flow and
      must rely on the clinical exam of the wrist and hand distally. The purpose of this study is
      to use near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to compare the blood flow in the forearm muscle
      compartments of an injured arm compared to an uninjured arm. This will provide data to
      establish normal readings for this device for a child's forearm, and may then help clinicians
      detect children with insufficient perfusion of the forearm muscles after supracondylar
      humerus fracture.
