      The aim of this intervention study is to compare the efficacy of Emla cream as a pain relief
      or no pain relief in connection to the first pneumococcal vaccination at the age of three
      months in Child health care.

      Primary objective

      1.Leads Emla cream as pain relief to children in connection with pneumococcal vaccination at
      the age of three months to lower pain scores in the use of FLACC as a pain measurement
      instrument?

      The aim of this intervention study is to compare the efficacy of Emla cream as a pain relief
      or no pain relief in connection to the first pneumococcal vaccination at the age of three
      months in Child health care.

      Primary objective

        1. Leads Emla cream as pain relief to children in connection with pneumococcal vaccination
           at the age of three months to lower pain scores in the use of FLACC as a pain
           measurement instrument?

           Secondary objectives

        2. Leads Emla cream as pain relief in connection with pneumococcal vaccination to any
           difference in the child's heart rate response and saturation?

        3. Leads Emla cream as pain relief that it takes longer before the baby starts crying and
           does the child cry for a shorter time in connection with vaccination?

      Method: The study is randomised and singleblind. The study involves 72 children who are 3
      months old. 36 children will receive Emla-cream and 36 children will receive placebo-cream.

      This study will lead to new knowledge about Emla cream and pneumococcal vaccination. The
      study will give new knowledge how painful pneumococcal vaccination is for the children. If
      the study shows that Emla cream don´t give enough pain relief during pneumococcal vaccination
      more studies should be done with other pain relief.
