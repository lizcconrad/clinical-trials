  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts to this study: (1) an information gathering phase leading to the
      development of new educational materials; and (2) a study to test the newly developed
      material. The information gathering phase has been completed. The purpose of this part of the
      research study is to test the usefulness and acceptability of new educational materials
      investigators have developed. Investigators will compare the new educational material to
      another widely available educational brochure. The goal is to see if the new educational
      material will change knowledge and behaviors about colorectal cancer and colorectal
      screening.

      Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and other community health clinics (CHCs) provide
      comprehensive primary health care for underserved patients. Recently, high-sensitivity and
      high-specificity fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) have
      emerged as a preferred initial screening modality within clinics due to convenience, ease of
      use, and low cost compared with colonoscopy. FOBT/FIT may help to reduce colorectal cancer
      screening (CRC) screening disparities and overcome several previously mentioned factors that
      often account for suboptimal CRC screening rates.

    <description>Investigators will measure uptake of I-FOBT/FIT as any completed kit within 180 days of delivery of the intervention. That is, the proportion of participants who return a sampled kit by the 6 month assessment (investigators expect most kits to be returned much sooner) for calculation of the primary screening endpoint. I-FOBT/FIT use will be compared (CARES vs. SI).</description>

    <description>Overall CRCS with any test will be compared (CARES vs. SI). It is expected that pairing I-FOBT/FIT kits with the CARES toolkit will result in greater CRCS uptake compared to SI plus I-FOBT/FIT.</description>

    <description>In both conditions, patients will participate in a Baseline Survey. Three brief items will be used to assess patient-provider discussion and recommendation: (1) Was colorectal cancer or colorectal cancer screening one of the things you discussed with the doctor or health care provider? (Yes/No). (2) If Yes, who brought the topic of colorectal cancer first? (patient/health care provider). (3) Did your doctor or health care provider recommend colorectal cancer screening? (Yes/No). These questions are necessary to evaluate the impact of interventions on patient-provider discussion of CRCS and provider recommendation of CRCS.</description>

    <description>12 months after participants began to participate in the study, they will be contacted via telephone to complete a final set of questionnaires. Participants will be asked questions similar to those answered in baseline. This time they will ask about the participant's thoughts on the educational materials as well.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Racially-ethnically diverse adult men and women

          -  Average risk individuals who have no personal diagnosis, or presumptive symptoms of
             colorectal cancer (CRC), or are not at high risk

          -  Self-report as not current on screening

          -  Provide at least two forms of contact information and contact information of a
             relative (not living with respondent) to facilitate follow-up contacts

          -  Are able to speak, read and write English because the instruments and CARES
             intervention are available only in English at this time. We recognize that
             interventions are needed for non-English speaking populations, therefore, once we find
             promise in the English language CARES intervention materials, we will move forward
             with conducting other studies that involve translation of measures and cultural
             adaptation of the CARES intervention materials into Spanish or Haitian Creole.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have participated in a CRCS research study in the past 1 year will not
             be eligible for this study.

          -  Recent screening criteria relates to not having had I-FOBT within the previous year,
             flex sig within the previous 5 years, a double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) x-ray with
             the previous 5 years, or a colonoscopy within the previous 10 years.

          -  Within the recruitment and intervention frame, high risk individuals (due to strong
             family history, ulcerative colitis, polyposis syndromes) are excluded because they may
             be eligible for CRC screening before age 50, and the preferred screening option is
             certainly colonoscopy which is beyond the primary focus of the current study.
