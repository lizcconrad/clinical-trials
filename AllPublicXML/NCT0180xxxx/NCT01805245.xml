  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of stress reduction on physiological and
      psychological variables in adults with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who have moderate to severe
      levels of diabetes-related emotional distress. Subjects will be randomized to one of two
      interventions. We will evaluate the impact of the interventions on glucose metabolism, blood
      pressure, diabetes-related distress and quality of life. Additionally, we will investigate
      the role of neuroendocrine dysfunction, systemic inflammation and diabetes self-care
      practices as mediators in the relationship between increased stress, adverse glucose
      metabolism and elevated blood pressure in those subjects with T2DM.
