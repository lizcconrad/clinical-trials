  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proposed for severe and resistant obsessive-compulsive
      disorder. This electrical stimulation has been tested on, and shown to be effective at,
      different targets (subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus &amp; nucleus accumbens). However, the
      efficacies of each target have never been compared directly.

      This protocol aims to do so, with the hypothesis that subthalamic (STN) stimulation will be
      more efficacious.

      Deep brain stimulation has been proposed for severe and resistant obsessive-compulsive
      disorder (OCD). This electrical stimulation has been tested on, and shown to be effective at,
      different targets (subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus &amp; nucleus accumbens). However, the
      efficacies of each target have never been compared directly.

      Therefore, bilateral subthalamic and caudate electrodes will be implanted in severe OCD
      patients. Efficacy of stimulation at the different targets will be assessed using a
      double-blind randomised crossover design.
