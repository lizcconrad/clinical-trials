      The laser areas treated with biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing
      anti-hyperpigmentation agent (&quot;biocellulose mask&quot;, &quot;Farhorm®&quot;) heal faster than vaseline
      ointment which is a standard treatment.

      Volar surface at upper arm (2X2 cm) on both sides were treated with semi ablative, 1,550 nm
      Erbium: glass fractional laser. Biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing
      anti-hyperpigmentation agent (&quot;biocellulose mask&quot;,&quot;Farhorm®&quot;)was applied for 20 min on one
      side and the other side was treated with vaseline ointment. The redness, skin hydration and
      skin pigmentation were evaluated at that area before laser, immediately after laser and after
      applying the treatment. These parameters were compared between treatment (area treated with
      Biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing anti-hyperpigmentation agent, &quot;biocellulose
      mask&quot;, &quot;Farhorm®&quot;) and control (vaseline ointment).
