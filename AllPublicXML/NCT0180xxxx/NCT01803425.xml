  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This PMS study aims to collect safety and reactogenicity data of Synflorix™ in healthy
      infants and children of the local population as per the licensing requirement of the Sri
      Lankan regulatory authority.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participating physicians (investigators) will be asked to enrol only those subjects to
      whom they administer Synflorix™ in the course of their normal clinical practice according to
      the locally approved Prescribing Information.

      Since there is lack of clarity regarding the PMS study requirement (both from Regulatory
      agency and Ethics Committee), it was decided that GSK will submit Local PSURs on a regular
      basis as desired by Local regulatory agency. The same is communicated to Regulatory agency
      and if they want something more they are requested to revert back with specific requirements.

  <why_stopped>
    Lack of clarity regarding the PMS study requirement from the RA and Ethics committee hence it
    was concluded GSK will submit local PSURs.
