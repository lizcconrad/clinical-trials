  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, an estimated 230,000 HIV-infected women in need of services for prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) give birth in Nigeria, more than in any other
      nation in the world. Vanderbilt University (VU), through its affiliate, Friends in Global
      Health (FGH), is currently supporting HIV/AIDS services in North-Central Nigeria. These sites
      are predominantly rural primary health centers (PHCs) where shortages of high-cadre health
      care providers and insufficient laboratory capacity to perform CD4+ cell count testing have
      been major barriers to effective PMTCT scale-up. A systematic reassignment of patient care
      responsibilities coupled with the adoption of point-of-care (POC) CD4+ cell count testing
      will facilitate the ability of lower-cadre health providers to manage PMTCT care, including
      the provision and scale-up of antiretroviral treatment (ART) to pregnant women in these
      rural, decentralized sites. A system wherein men are facilitated to accompany their wives to
      ANC appointments will create an important opportunity to address entrenched gender norms. The
      investigators therefore propose using community and facility-based measures to encourage male
      partners to accompany their spouses for ANC. As influential community members, male partners
      can assist their spouses to utilize culturally-sensitive, sustainable and integrated PMTCT
      care provided by lower-cadre providers in these resource-constrained settings.

      The investigators propose a parallel, cluster randomized trial to evaluate the impact of a
      family-focused PMTCT package that includes: 1) task-shifting to lower-cadre providers at
      PMTCT sites; 2) POC CD4+ cell count testing; (3) integrated mother-infant care; and (4)) a
      prominent role for influential family members (male partners), working in close partnership
      with community-based health workers/volunteers. The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To evaluate whether implementation of the integrated PMTCT package in primary level
           antenatal clinics (ANC) increases the proportion of eligible pregnant women who initiate
           antiretroviral medications for the purposes of PMTCT. The investigators hypothesize that
           the provision of the PMTCT package in intervention clinics will improve PMTCT
           antiretroviral uptake rates among eligible women during pregnancy from 40% to 65%.

        2. To determine whether implementation of the PMTCT package improves postpartum retention
           of mother-infant pairs at 6 and 12 weeks. The investigators hypothesize that postpartum
           retention rates among mother-infant pairs attending intervention sites will be &gt;20%
           higher at 6 weeks when compared to mother-infant pairs receiving care in
           non-intervention sites.

        3. Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the impact of this novel PMTCT
           intervention compared to the existing standard-of-care referral model. The investigators
           hypothesize that the proposed intervention will be more cost-effective than the existing
           model of care.

      In addition, two qualitative evaluations will be conducted in order to:

        1. Assess client satisfaction with health services, comparing PMTCT services provided by
           lower level vs. higher level cadre health workers; and

        2. Evaluate health care worker satisfaction with the new PMTCT service delivery model.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a parallel cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effects of the
      intervention. Twelve primary and secondary level health care facilities in Niger State will
      be randomized to the control (standard-of-care) or intervention arms. The investigators will
      match clinics on patient volume and level of facility and randomize to intervention and
      standard-of-care/control arms - 6 clinics per arm.

      The investigators will make the proposed intervention available to all eligible women
      attending clinics that are randomized to the intervention arm. The drug regimens and general
      HIV care services provided as part of the package are standard of care, based on Nigerian
      national guidelines.

      Inclusion Criteria: (1) HIV-infected women (and their infants) who present to ANC or delivery
      with unknown HIV status; (2) HIV-infected women (and their infants) with previous history of
      ARV prophylaxis or treatment, but who are not on prophylaxis or treatment at the time of
      presentation for antenatal care or delivery.

      Exclusion Criteria: HIV-infected women with known status who are on ARV prophylaxis or
      treatment at the time of presentation to ANC.

      Home-based care (HBC) workers will track clients who miss appointments at control and
      intervention sites. The HBC workers will document clients as terminated care if they: (1)
      discontinued services due to death or personal decision; (2) transferred their care to
      another clinic; or (3) are lost to follow-up (defined as being 90 days late for a clinic
      appointment plus 5 failed attempts at tracking the client). Clients will not receive any
      remuneration for participating in the study. Clients will be allowed to discontinue
      participation and decide that their medical data cannot be used in the analysis.

    <description>The primary outcome is the proportion of eligible women who initiate ARV medications for PMTCT. This will be determined through data in our electronic medical records system. The investigators will report the total proportion of women who initiate ARV drugs, presenting the results stratified by regimen (cART, ZDV, NVP) and type of facility. The investigators will also collect information on duration of cART.</description>

    <description>Mother-infant pairs who have presented for their 6-week postpartum appointment will be considered active in the program (retained in care). The investigators will assess retention at both 6 week and 12-week time points in order to examine the impact of our intervention package on early (6 week) and later (12-week) postpartum retention.</description>

    <description>For the CEA, the basic outcome is the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER). The CER will be computed for both intervention and the standard-of-care arms.
The investigators will also measure the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A separate ICER will be calculated for the two primary study outcomes (the cost/HIV-infected women who initiated treatment for PMTCT and the cost/mother-infant pair retained in care at 6 weeks postpartum) and for the secondary outcome (cost per infant infection averted at 6 weeks of age).</description>
