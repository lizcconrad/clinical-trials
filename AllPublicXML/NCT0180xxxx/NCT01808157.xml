  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in male
      and female subjects, aged ≥ 12 years with mild/moderate atopic dermatitis and at least
      moderate pruritus. All subjects will receive BID topical applications of CT327 ointment or
      vehicle for up to 4 weeks.

      At baseline, the subjects must have atopic dermatitis, as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka
      criteria, which involves a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 20% body surface area, an
      Investigator Global Assessment Score of 2 or 3 (mild or moderate) and pruritus visual
      analogue scale scores of ≥ 40mm (at least moderate).

      All subjects will attend a screening visit not more than 21 days prior to Day 1. Subjects
      will be required to return to the clinic on Days 1 (baseline visit), 4, 11, 18 and 29 (end of
      treatment visit). All subjects will be asked to attend for a follow-up visit 14 (±3) days
      after the last dose of study medication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects aged ≥ 12 years.

        Clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (as defined by Hanifin and Rajka criteria (Appendix
        F) at screening with:

          -  IGA score of 2 or 3 (mild or moderate)

          -  Score of ≥ 40mm on all screening pruritus VAS assessments (average and worst over the
             last 24 hours and current itch)

          -  A minimum of 5% and not more than 20% of the subjects' BSA affected by atopic
             dermatitis (affected is defined as active atopic dermatitis lesions or pruritus)

          -  Amenable to treatment with topical treatment

          -  Stable disease for ≥1 months prior to screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Atopic dermatitis only affecting the head or scalp. Unstable or actively infected atopic
        dermatitis. Concomitant dermatologic or medical condition(s) which may interfere with the
        investigator's ability to evaluate the subject's response to the study drug.

        Subjects who have received monoclonal antibody therapy for their atopic dermatitis in the 4
        months prior to screening.

        Subjects who have used systemic immunosuppressive drugs, corticosteroids or received PUVA
        therapy in the 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment, or are scheduled to start these
        treatments during the study period.

        Subjects who have used topical immunomodulators (pimecrolimus, tacrolimus) within 2 weeks
        of starting study treatment or are scheduled to start these treatments during the study
        period.

        Subjects who have used topical corticosteroids from WHO group II, III or IV, or other
        treatments for atopic dermatitis, including wet wraps, within 2 weeks prior to starting
        study treatment or are likely to require treatment with these medications during the study
        period.

        Subjects who are unable to abstain from using emollients from baseline (Visit 2) until the
        end of study treatment (Visit 6).

        Subjects who are using any concomitant medication(s) that, in the investigators' opinion,
        could affect the subject's atopic dermatitis or pruritus (for example TADs, SSRI,
        pregabalin). Subjects using such medications may be included, at the investigators
        discretion, if they have been stable on treatment for at least 1 month prior to the start
        of study treatment and no changes to these medications are planned during the study period.

        Subjects undergoing, or due to have, UVA, or UVB therapy in the 2 weeks prior to starting
        study treatment or during the study period.

        Planned exposure of affected areas to excessive sunlight. Subjects with a clinically
        significant abnormal laboratory safety test and/or 12-lead ECG results at screening.

        Subjects who are receiving any investigational drug or who have taken part in a clinical
        study with an investigational drug within three months prior to the start of study
        treatment.

        Subjects with a known reaction or allergy to test drug or excipients.
