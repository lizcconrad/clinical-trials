      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether a Chinese medicine formula (Qing'E) is
      effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms and safety.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether a
      Chinese medicine formula (Qing'E, composed of eucommia, psoralen, walnuts and garlic) is
      effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms. 240 Chinese women with menopausal symptoms will
      be recruited and randomized into two groups. One is treatment group with 12 weeks of Qing'E
      pills (well-controlled), the other is controlled group with 12 weeks of placebo. The
      treatment outcome measures include: 1) the severity of menopausal symptoms: self-recording of
      daily frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes), the Kupperman index. 2) NEI network
      indices. 3) Urine metabolomics. All measures are conducted at baseline and endpoint except
      the self-recoding of vasomotor symptoms, Kupperman index and urine metabolomics. Tyhe
      investigators expect this research will provide an effective and safe therapy for menopausal
      symptoms.

    <description>To calculate the Kupperman index, the symptoms were weighted as follows: hot flashes (4), insomnia (2), nervousness (2), and all other symptoms (night sweats, depressed mood (melancholy), dizziness, tiredness, joint and muscular pain, headache, and palpitations (1). The highest potential score is thus 51. The score of hot flashes was based on number of complaints per day: slight (more than 5), moderate (5-10), and severe (more than 10)</description>
