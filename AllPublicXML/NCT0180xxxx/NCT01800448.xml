  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For critically ill patients, it is important to know when to liberate them from mechanical
      ventilation (the removal of breathing or endotracheal tube or extubation) and weaning (the
      progressive decrease of the amount of support that a patient receives from the mechanical
      ventilation). It is well recognized that prolonged ventilation and weaning harms patients and
      introduces significant increased costs to the health care system. The investigators objective
      is to improve the safety of removal of life support in critically ill patients by harnessing
      information from two new technologies; NM3 and Nexus device. In particular, the investigators
      are interested in the patterns of variation of respiratory and cardiac signals from the NM3
      device, as well as monitor skin conductance with the Nexus device. The combination of these
      measures has not yet been investigated to date, and could represent a novel set of measures
      that can be used to help physicians better manage critically ill patients. The current
      standard of care dictates that once a patient is considered as a candidate for withdrawal
      from ventilation, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBTs) is performed, where the degree of
      ventilator support is decreased, and their response is observed to help predict if they will
      tolerate extubation.

      Health is associated with a high degree of variation of physiologic parameters such as heart
      rate and respiratory rate, and illness &amp; stress are associated with a loss of variability.
      The analysis of variability of biological signals measures the degree of fluctuations present
      over time. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in variability (generally
      decreases) are observed in illness states, and the degree of this change correlates with
      illness severity. Several studies have reported that reduced heart or respiratory rate
      variability (HRV or RRV) during SBTs is associated with extubation failure. Until recently,
      variability analysis has traditionally been done only on heart rate (HRV), derived from
      analyzing beat-to-beat intervals from the ubiquitous electrocardiogram (ECG). The
      investigators aim to apply variability analysis to the respiratory and cardiac signals which
      represent a rich novel set of muti-organ variability measures whose utility in managing
      extubation and ventilator weaning has not been investigated to date.
