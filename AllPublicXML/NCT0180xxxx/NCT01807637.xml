    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS)applied over the lower extremity motor cortex in conjunction with functional electrical
      stimulation assisted gait training (FESAGT) is effective for improving gait in patients with
      chronic stroke.

    <measure>change from baseline in slope of cortical recruitment curve</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, and 1 week, 1 month, and 6 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The cortical recruitment curve slope will be derived from plots of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the contralesional tibialis anterior muscle. MEPs are elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered at increasing intensity over the lower extremity motor cortex.</description>

    <measure>change from baseline in Stroke impact scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, and 1 week, 1 month, and 6 moths post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a standardized assessment of strength, hand function, ADL/IADL, mobility, communication, emotion, cognition, and social and occupational engagement. It consists of 64 - 5 point likert scale questions with a total score range of 64(lowest) to 320 (highest).</description>

    <description>tDCS will be applied using a Life-Tech®, Iontophor PM Deluxe constant current stimulator with carbon rubber electrodes encased in saline (0.9% NaCl) soaked sponges that measure 5 x 5 cm (25cm2) for the anode and 5x7 for the cathode (35cm2). The anodal electrode will be placed over the lower extremity representation of primary motor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stroke survivors &gt; 3 months from most recent unilateral, stroke based on clinically or
             experimentally obtained MRI brain scans and behavioral evidence of stroke (e.g., risk
             factors, hemiplegia, unilateral sensory impairment, or localized higher cortical
             dysfunction) by report or in the medical record.

          -  Age: &gt;30 years of age.

          -  Complete NIH Stroke Scale.

          -  Sufficient endurance, motor ability and balance to ambulate at least 10 meters
             continuously with moderate or less assistance.

          -  Have ankle dorsiflexion passive range of motion to 0° or greater.

          -  Demonstrate foot-drop during ambulation such that gait instability or inefficient gait
             patterns [gait pattern manifesting &quot;dragging&quot; or &quot;catching&quot; of the affected toes
             during swing phase of gait, or use of compensatory strategies such as circumducting
             the affected limb, vaulting with the unaffected limb or hiking the affected hip to
             clear the toes] are exhibited.

          -  Ankle dorsiflexion to at least neutral while standing in response to neuromuscular
             electrical stimulation (NMES) of the common peroneal nerve without painful
             hypersensitivity to the NMES.

          -  Pass the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Adult Safety Screen (TASS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Edema, skin breakdown, absent sensation of the affected lower limb which interferes
             with the peroneal nerve stimulator.

          -  History of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia,
             supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid ventricular response atrial fibrillation with
             hemodynamic instability.

          -  Demand pacemakers or any other implanted electronic systems.

          -  Pregnant women, uncontrolled seizure disorder, Parkinson's Disease, Spinal cord
             injury, Traumatic brain injury with evidence of motor weakness, Multiple sclerosis.

          -  Fixed ankle plantar flexor contracture, peroneal nerve injury at the fibular head as
             the cause of foot-drop.

          -  History of dementia, severely impaired cognition, communication or comprehension
             deficits.

          -  Presence of severe or frequent headaches

          -  History of painful hypersensitivity to NMES of the common peroneal nerve.

          -  History of Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection to either of the lower extremities within
             the 3 month period preceding study entry.

          -  Receiving other forms of electrical stimulation.

          -  Have other medical conditions or are taking medications that compromise ambulation or
             balance.

          -  Failure to meet established screening criteria for TMS or tDCS (i.e., TASS)
