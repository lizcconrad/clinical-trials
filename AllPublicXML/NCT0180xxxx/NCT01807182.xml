    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) after combination
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to other places in the
      body. Biological therapies, such as TIL, may stimulate the immune system in different ways
      and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      TIL after combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the anti-tumor efficacy of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma
      patients using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with a lymphodepleting conditioning
      regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), and followed by adjuvant
      high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 (aldesleukin).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo persistence of transferred tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

      II. Examine the safety of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients using
      autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, preceded by a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen
      of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and followed by adjuvant high-dose IL-2.

      III. Evaluate for molecular tumor markers and immunohistochemical features that correlate
      with in vivo persistence and anti-tumor efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -7 to -6 and fludarabine
      phosphate IV on days -5 to -1. Patients undergo TIL infusion over 30-60 minutes on day 0 and
      receive aldesleukin IV every 8 hours on days 1-5 for up to a maximum of 14 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.
