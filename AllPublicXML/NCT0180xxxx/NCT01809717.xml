      This study will establich the feasibility of weight lifting exercise among patients with
      multiple myeloma, determine if weight lifting exercise increases lean body mass among
      patients with multiple myeloma and obtain further preliminary data on toxicity and
      pharmacokinetics of high-dose melphalan.

      This is a prospective, single-institution, pilot study of a 3 month weight lifting program
      designed to increase musle hypertrophy prior to starting stem cell collection and receiving
      high-dose melphalan, in patients with multiple myeloma. We will use this exercise
      intervention while patients are receiving initial induction chemotherapy in the 3-6 month
      period before they receiv high-dose melphalan. The primary study endpoint is to determine the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining multiple myeloma patients to an exercise intervention
      trial. The secondary study endpoint is to determine whether the weight lifting program
      increases lean body mass as intended.
