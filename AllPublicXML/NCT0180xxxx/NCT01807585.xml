      This is a randomized control trial comparing VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System with
      Radiofrequency Ablation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the VenaSeal SCS as being both non-inferior to RF
      ablation therapy in achieving anatomical closure of lower extremity superficial truncal veins
      in patients with venous reflux through endovascular transcatheter embolization with
      coaptation of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and in the reduction of intraprocedural and post
      procedural pain and symptoms. The study will demonstrate safety of the VenaSeal SCS by
      follow-up visits that will evaluate via duplex ultrasound and physical exam the presence of
      deep vein thrombosis and or pulmonary embolus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥21 years and ≤ 70 years of age at the time of screening

          2. Reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV) greater than 0.5 sec reflux

          3. One or more of the following symptoms related to the target vein: aching, throbbing,
             heaviness, fatigue, pruritis, night cramps, restlessness, generalized pain or
             discomfort, swelling

          4. GSV diameter while standing of 3-12 mm throughout the target vein as measured by
             Duplex ultrasound.

          5. CEAP classification of C2 (if symptomatic) - C4b

          6. Ability to walk unassisted

          7. Ability to attend follow-up visits

          8. Ability to understand the requirements of the study and to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year

          2. Active treatment for malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer

          3. Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease with ABI &lt;0.89

          4. Daily use of narcotic or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications to control
             pain associated with GSV reflux.

          5. Current, regular use of systemic anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin, heparin)

          6. Previous or suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus (PE).

          7. Previous superficial thrombophlebitis in GSV.

         19. Patients who require additional ipsilateral treatments on the same leg within 3 months
             following treatment.
