  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although evidence-based treatments for PTSD exist, a significant minority of individuals do
      not benefit from these treatments and many individuals to not seek treatment, citing barriers
      such as time commitment and expense of treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to
      establish an alternative PTSD treatment that is efficacious and efficient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has demonstrated that written exposure therapy (WET), is an efficient,
      well-tolerated, and efficacious treatment for PTSD. The proposed project takes the next step
      in establishing WET as an intervention for PTSD by examining whether WET is equally
      efficacious to an evidence-based treatment for PTSD. Using a randomized noninferiority
      controlled trial, 126 adults diagnosed with PTSD will be assigned to either WET or Cognitive
      Processing Therapy (CPT). Outcome data will be collected at baseline and 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-
      and 60-weeks post-first treatment session. The primary aim is to examine whether PTSD
      participants assigned to WET demonstrate PTSD symptom severity outcome that is noninferior to
      PTSD participants assigned to CPT. Secondary aims include examining whether expected
      treatment gains are sustained for both treatments and whether WET has a lower treatment
      dropout rate relative to CPT. Exploratory aims include examining moderators and mediators of
      WET and CPT. If the hypothesis that WET is noninferior to CPT is confirmed then a brief
      treatment option for PTSD will be established.
