  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand primary care provider's knowledge, attitudes, and
      barriers to promoting evidence-based cancer screening and prevention practices for physicians
      with large Latino patient populations. The investigators will ask providers information on
      cancer screening and prevention practices by conducting one-on-one interviews. In addition,
      they would like to develop a committee of community providers to help design and implement
      cancer screening and prevention programs specifically for Latino patients based on the
      interview findings.

    <intervention_name>in-depth, semi-structured interviews</intervention_name>
    <description>In-depth interviews will be conducted by the Principle Investigator and will use a combination of open-ended and closed, fixed response questions. Interviews will be audio recorded if the participant agrees, and answers to fixed response questions will be marked for complete analysis. The data collection portion of the study is estimated to take approximately 8 months. Areas to be addressed in the open-ended portion of the interview include: 1) Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward evidence-based cancer screening and prevention approaches 2) Barriers to implementing evidence-based cancer screening practices in the individual provider's clinical setting 3) Preferences for mechanisms of information dissemination and implementation and 4) Ideas and methods to facilitate evidence-based practices to improve cancer screening in the Latino population. A community-based participatory committee (CBPC) will be formed with 5-7 key informants identified during the interview process.</description>
