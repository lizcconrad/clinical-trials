      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the feasibility
      and safety of an investigational technique or drug. This study will try to define an
      appropriate dose of the investigational drug indocyanine green (ICG) in combination with near
      infrared (NIR) imaging to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that this drug,
      ICG, is approved by the FDA for other imaging uses, but not for lymphatic mapping using NIR
      light. Its use for following lymphatic pathways from tumors in the human body is still being
      studied and research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA
      has not approved ICG mapping for your type of cancer.

      ICG is a dye and is approved for testing liver function and measuring blood flow from the
      heart. This drug has been used in studies to map lymphatic pathways in lung cancer and breast
      cancer and information from those other research studies suggests that this dye may help to
      identify lymph nodes associated with your esophageal tumor in this research study. ICG can be
      detected within the body using special near-infrared light cameras. In this research study,
      the investigators are looking at how easily ICG can get to the first lymph node (called the
      sentinel lymph node or SLN) associated with your esophageal tumor and whether the
      investigators can see the path of the ICG and the respective SLN using a near infrared
      camera.

      If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo a review of your
      medical history to confirm that you are eligible. If this review shows that you are eligible
      you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not
      be able to participate in the research study.

      Your primary surgeon will coordinate the date and time of surgery with you, and the hospital
      will confirm this schedule.

      At the time of surgery, a dose of ICG mixed with normal saline, a solution of salt and water,
      will be administered in four small injections immediately around your tumor. You will receive
      approximately half a teaspoon of the normal saline/ICG solution. You will be under general
      anesthesia. Pictures of the ICG solution will be taken with the NIR camera and the
      progression of the dye, as it makes its way along the lymphatic channel from the location of
      your tumor to the SLN, will be monitored. After five to fifteen minutes, the surgeon will
      continue with your procedure, removing the lymph nodes according to standard or care. The
      surgeon will discuss this with you ahead of time.

      As each lymph node is removed, we will take a picture of it to see if the ICG dye has entered
      and colored that node.

      Following the removal of your lymph nodes, your surgeon will complete the operation and you
      will continue to be monitored for 30 minutes for any rare but possible side effects (allergic
      reactions) to the ICG. You will then be removed from the study. With the exception of the
      administration of the ICG and photography with the NIR camera, there will be no changes from
      the standard of care.

      Following your surgery, we will collect the final pathology results from your procedure.
      Because we are only looking at determining the feasibility of this technique using NIR
      imaging, we do not wish to follow you for any period of time following the procedure. If you
      experience a rare but possible side effect from the ICG, normal saline, or NIR light, we will
      continue to monitor you until the condition is resolved.
