  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the usefulness of providing patients with web-based
      electronically accessed patient information when compared to the provision of written
      information leaflets.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitals and health care institutions attempt to provide information to patients through a
      variety of media including; written information, web-site based information and more recently
      through the use of smart phone based applications. Such educational campaigns have financial
      implications for hospitals and institutions.

      The level of knowledge among patients with vascular disease of their pathology and its
      associated risk factors has been shown to be poor (Lovell et al 2009, Hirsch et al 2007). The
      optimum tool with which to provide information to patients with vascular disease has not been
      determined to date.

    <measure>Overall improvement in knowledge in a group of patients with vascular disease following the provision of information through verbal, written or electronically based sources.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be randomised to receive either verbal and written information or verbal and electronically based information on their disease specific condition. Knowledge will be assessed through the use of a multi choice questionnaire at baseline prior to the provision of information on their condition and again at follow up 6 weeks later.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At follow patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their use of the information provided.
The following measures will be recorded:
Did you access the website address provided Y/N
If Yes, How many times did you access the website (Specify) ____________________
Did you find the website useful or informative Yes/No/Somewhat
Did you read the information leaflet provided Y/N
