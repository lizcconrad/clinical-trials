  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide a communication training program to inpatient nurses
      and social workers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in order to help them assist
      caregiving families. The importance of this training program is that it aims to teach nurses
      and social workers how and when to respond more effectively and compassionately to challenges
      faced by caregiving families. One of the goals of this program is to address family support
      needs during a patient's hospitalization.

    <description>This is a new training curriculum for inpatient oncology providers called Working with the Caregiving Family (WCF) training, a program designed to teach MSKCC inpatient staff to address family-level concerns during acute hospitalization. The WCF training will teach staff to recognize and inquire about areas of family distress that are likely to impact the caregiving process; to provide brief, supportive interventions, and/or to transition families to specialized support services when needed. We will provide staff with skills to address especially challenging family situations (e.g., noncompliance with medical care, conflict, poor communication) in collaborative and compassionate ways. We will teach clinicians to intervene and respond more effectively when problematic relationships develop within families or between families and larger systems (e.g., medical team, institutional programs).</description>

    <description>Training curriculum will be comprised of 2 phases to be attended sequentially: (l) The Didactic Phase will consist of 6 twice a month seminars, administered over a 3 month period. Each seminar includes a 1 hour lecture &amp; discussion followed by 1 hour of role-play exercises; Lecture segments may include short training videos which Dr. Zaider uses in the nurses' training module she teaches through the Communication Skills Laboratory. The teaching portion of the didactic sessions of the training may also be videotaped as a reference point for curriculum review. Will explain to the providers that videotapes will only be available to study staff &amp; that the role play portion will not be recorded; (2) Consolidation Phase will consist of 6 twice a month peer-group supervision meetings for ongoing consultation on family cases, also held across a 3 month period. Length of these consolidations sessions will be up to 2 hours.</description>
