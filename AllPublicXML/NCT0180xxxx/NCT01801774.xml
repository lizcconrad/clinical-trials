      Phacoemulsification is a quick method with less complication for cataract surgery. Due to the
      use of ultrasonic energy, it produced more post-operative inflammation than other methods.
      Many routes of steroid had been used to control post-operative inflammation. The
      investigators here compare the efficacy of single depot steroid subtenon injection (20-mg
      triamcinolone) with four-time-a-day steroid eye drop (0.1% dexamethasone) in controlling
      inflammation after uneventful phacoemulsification.

    <textblock>
      Cataract is one of the most common causes of blindness in the world. Surgical removal of lens
      is the only treatment for cataract, which now shifts from extracapsular cataract extraction
      to phacoemulsification. Although phacoemulsification provides faster operating time and gives
      better optical result and rapid recovery to the patient, it causes more inflammation
      post-operatively compare with extracapsular cataract extraction. Corticosteroids eye drops
      are mainly use to control intraocular inflammation after the surgery.

      Other routes of corticosteroids have been introduced to increase the intraocular level and to
      increase the patient's compliance. Subtenon triamcinolone injection is easy and safe.
      Antiinflammatory effect of single subtenon triamcinolone injection lasts about 4-6 weeks.
      This method has been used in combination with corticosteroid eye drop to control the
      inflammation after cataract surgery in uveitic patients. It shows potency in controlling of
      intraocular inflammation with lower rate of increasing the intraocular pressure. The
      investigators here quantitatively compare the efficacy of subtenon 20-mg triamcinolone
      injection with 0.1% dexamethasone eye drop in controlling intraocular inflammation after
      uneventful phacoemulsification.
