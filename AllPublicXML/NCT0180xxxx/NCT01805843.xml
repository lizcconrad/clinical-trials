    <textblock>
      Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by
      a translocation between chromosome 9 and 22, leading to a pathogenic tyrosine kinase signal
      transduction protein. CML can be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which
      inhibit BCR/ABL kinase, such as imatinib. In about 20% of CML patients who are treated by
      imatinib, a complete cytogenetic response cannot be achieved. The other two novel TKIs
      (dasatinib and nilotinib), achieve higher rates of complete cytogenetic response and they are
      proposed as second-line therapy for imatinib-resistant patients or for those who do not
      tolerate imatinib. Dasatinib inhibits BCR/ABL kinase in about &gt;300 times in vitro in more
      than imatinib and also inhibits several other kinases, including the Src family. Src tyrosine
      kinase is crucial for potassium channel function in human pulmonary arteries. Imatinib and
      nilotinib do not inhibit the Src.

      Incident cases of precapillary PH have been reported in patients who have CML treated with
      the dasatinib. Improvements were usually observed after withdrawal of dasatinib.

      This study is designed to identify incident cases of dasatinib-associated PH and describe
      pulmonary vascular changes induced by dasatinib. As comparison population will be patients
      who receive another second-line TKI (nilotinib).

      Doppler echocardiography at rest will be performed in each patient. Patients without exercise
      capacity limitation an exercise test (Doppler echocardiography with spiroergometry) will be
      performed. Patients who show elevated SPAP at rest or during exercise (in this study SPAP â‰¥
      40 mmHg) or with reduced exercise capacity (peak VO2 &lt; 75%) a right heart catheterization
      (RHC) will be suggested. Additionally for the evaluation of exercise capacity a 6 MWD will be
      performed. This work- up of patients allows clinical and hemodynamic evaluation.
