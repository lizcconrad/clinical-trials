      Phase 1b: To evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended phase 2 dose for
      TRC105 when added to standard dose axitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

      Phase 2: To estimate the PFS of patients with advanced or metastatic RCC by RECIST 1.1
      criteria in patients treated with axitinib and TRC105 compared to those treated with axitinib
      alone, following failure of one prior VEGF TKI

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Axitinib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma
      concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
      cancer progression. Axitinib is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma,
      following progression on one prior systemic therapy. TRC105 is an antibody to CD105, an
      important angiogenic target on vascular endothelial cells that is distinct from VEGFR. TRC105
      inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models and complements the
      activity of bevacizumab and multi-kinase inhibitors that target VEGFR. In a phase 1 study of
      advanced solid tumors,TRC105 therapy caused a global reduction in angiogenic biomarkers and
      reduced tumor burden at doses that were well-tolerated. By targeting a non-VEGF pathway that
      is upregulated following VEGF inhibition, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGF
      inhibitors and could represent a major advance in cancer therapy. TRC105 potentiates
      bevacizumab and VEGFR tyrosine kinases (VEGFR TKI) in preclinical models. In a phase 1b
      study, the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab produced radiographic reductions in tumor
      volume in bevacizumab refractory patients. Together, the use of TRC105 with axitinib may
      result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that
      seen with axitinib alone.

             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for this study
