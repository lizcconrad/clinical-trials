    <textblock>
      Family-centered mental health treatment of children values and supports the role of parents
      in their child's recovery. However, medications are often the primary focus in community
      treatment. Young children, even preschool-age youth, are increasingly being treated with
      antipsychotic medication for serious mood and behavior problems. This medication may be
      necessary to address safety issues (such as severe aggression), but it can cause serious side
      effects, such as obesity. Also, medication-only treatment does not follow recommended care
      for these types of problems. Psychosocial treatments (for example, programs that coach and
      empower parents to manage their child's difficult behaviors) are highly recommended as part
      of comprehensive (medication and psychosocial) child treatment. Parent involvement in
      psychosocial treatment has clear benefits for their child's mental health and, unlike
      medication, the effects can last long after treatment is completed. However, problems related
      to access (for example, long waiting lists) and use (for example, parent mistrust of mental
      health services) of services are common. Maryland, like other states, has developed a system
      to improve medication safety by reviewing health information about the child to determine if
      the treatment is appropriate. This review reduces unnecessary medication treatment and makes
      sure that children have adequate health screening before starting any treatment. Children who
      are approved for medication treatment have moderate-to-severe mental health problems, which
      supports their need for comprehensive (medication and psychosocial)treatment, instead of
      medication-only treatment. In this study, investigators are partnering with parents/family
      advocates, child-serving agencies, and health providers to develop a Family Navigator Service
      to link with this medication program. Family Navigators are individuals who have cared for
      their own child with mental illness. The navigators will support parents, provide information
      on psychosocial treatment options, and address barriers to using services. The goals of this
      program are to improve use of psychosocial services, and to improve parent empowerment,
      support, and satisfaction with their child's mental health treatment. The investigators also
      expect that the Navigator Service will improve the child's overall mental health and reduce
      the likelihood that he/she will need a medication dose increase or another medication added
      over the initial treatment period. The Navigator Service will be provided for parents of
      public insured children who are 10 years old and have just been approved for antipsychotic
      medication treatment. The Navigator Services will be provided by phone, so this service can
      support families in both rural and urban settings. The investigators' long term goal is to
      develop a Family Navigator program that strongly supports Family-centered treatment of
      children and can be used to help families in other underserved areas beyond Maryland.

      Background: Emerging data on serious antipsychotic medication side effects (e.g. new onset
      diabetes)has heightened concerns about sharp increases in &quot;off label&quot; pediatric antipsychotic
      treatment of mood/behavioral disorders, and led to increased scrutiny of pediatric mental
      health treatment. Several states are developing antipsychotic medication pre-authorization
      programs to reduce inappropriate or unsafe prescribing. This Healthcare system change,
      however, fails to address a critical underlying problem that parents are not effectively
      engaged to utilize non-medication treatments and serve an active role in their child's mental
      health recovery. Psychosocial treatments (e.g. parenting skills training to manage aggressive
      behaviors) are evidence-based interventions that are poorly utilized in community care. The
      Maryland Medicaid program developed a pediatric Antipsychotic Pre-Authorization Program that
      requires providers to make at least one psychosocial treatment referral in order to obtain
      medication approval. This program was shaped by strong input from parents, health experts,
      and child serving agency administrators to promote psychosocial treatment referral, but it
      does not provide any Family-centered services to improve treatment utilization. Objectives:
      We propose to link the Antipsychotic Pre-Authorization Program with a Family Navigator
      Service. The investigators will examine if Navigator Services improve parent empowerment,
      support, and satisfaction with child services. The investigators will also assess if
      Navigator Services are associated with improved psychosocial service utilization, improved
      child functioning, and lower likelihood of medication increases (higher dose or addition of
      another medication). The investigators' long term objective is to develop a Family Navigator
      model that is highly portable, amenable for use in underserved areas, addresses the needs of
      low income families with young children, and promotes evidence-based mental health care.
      Methods: The investigators will conduct a randomized trial of a telephone Family Navigator
      Service versus usual care for 240 Medicaid insured youth 10 years old who are approved for
      antipsychotic medication treatment. The Family Navigator is a parent who has experienced
      their own child's mental illness. Navigators will provide support, information on
      psychosocial treatment options, and options to address barriers to care. The investigators
      will assess family-centered outcomes at baseline and 90 days (medication re-authorization).
      The investigators will use generalized linear mixed effects models with the appropriate link
      functions to assess whether there is a significant difference in improvement from baseline to
      the post-treatment assessment on the outcome variables between the Family Navigator condition
      and treatment as usual condition. A significant interaction between time and study condition
      would support the hypothesis that a Family Navigator will improve parent and child outcomes.

    <description>This 34-item, scale provides scores for parent empowerment related to their Family (e.g. &quot;I make efforts to help my child grow and develop.&quot;), Services System (&quot;My opinion is just as important as professionals who are providing services to my child.&quot;), and Community (&quot;I feel I can have a part in improving services for children in my community.&quot;). The subscales have demonstrated good reliability and validity, and provide comprehensive information about empowerment, including attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors.</description>

In a validation sample, the measure was found to have good internal consistency and it correlated with related domains of psychosocial functioning in expected directions. This measure has been widely used to assess social support among both identified medical and mental health patients as well as their family members.</description>

    <description>This 26-item questionnaire specifically targets parents' satisfaction with children's mental health services. The measure assesses five domains of parent satisfaction: cultural sensitivity, access, treatment participation, appropriateness, and outcome. This measure has been adopted by several State mental health systems to evaluate parent satisfaction with child services.</description>

    <description>We will use the preschool (ages 1 ½-5) and school age (6-12) versions of this measure, which asks parents to rate items about behavioral and emotional problems on a 0-2 scale. Both versions provide a Total Problem Score, and well as two broadband scores, Externalizing (behavioral) and Internalizing (mood) problems. These measures have been widely used in pediatric mental health research.</description>

    <description>We will utilize Medicaid claims data for any psychosocial services claims (e.g. individual, family, or group psychotherapy; parenting groups) to collect information on services used in the 90 days prior to the baseline and over 90 days (the initial medication authorization period). We will also collect parent report data on any other, non-Medicaid reimbursed psychosocial services utilized during those time periods (e.g. school services, parent mental health treatment, peer support groups).</description>
