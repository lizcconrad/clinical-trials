    <textblock>
      This study is designed to help us better understand the factors that affect the sexual lives
      of women who have been sexually mistreated during childhood. With this study we hope to learn
      about factors that may be promising targets for future treatments of sexual problems related
      to past sexual experiences. The investigators hypothesize that women who have experienced
      early sexual abuse are more likely to have sexual problems in adulthood than women who were
      not abuse in childhood.
