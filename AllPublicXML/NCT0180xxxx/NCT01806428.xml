      Objective: to test the hypothesis that recombinant activated protein C (aPC) therapy improves
      the microcirculation of severe septic patients.

      Design: Prospective, open study. Setting: University 12-beds intensive care unit. Patients:
      Septic patients with at least two sepsis-induced organ failures occurring within 48 hours of
      the onset of sepsis were included in a one year period.

      Interventions: Patients who had no contraindication to aPC administration received aPC at a
      dose of 24 mcg/kg/h for 96 hours. Patients with contraindications to aPC infusion were
      considered as controls.

    <measure>Microcirculatory Flow Index (MFI) before during and after aPC infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>102 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Microcirculatory Flow Index detected in vivo by side-dark field imaging at sublingual microcirculation. It represents the quality of blood flow at microcirculatory level. This study wants to verify any of the considered different types of blood transfused can improve MFI.</description>

    <measure>Perfused Vessel Density before during and after aPC infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>102 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Perfused Vessel Density (PVD) detected in vivo by side-dark field imaging at sublingual microcirculation. It represents the quantity of well perfused vessels at microcirculatory level. This study wants to verify any of the considered different types of blood transfused can improve PVD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) upslope before during and after aPC infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>102 hours</time_frame>
    <description>StO2 upslope is measured with Near InfraRed Spectroscopy at the tenar muscle. It represents the velocity of the recovery of the tissue oxygen saturation after a short period of ischemia of the hand, the Vascular Occlusion Test.</description>
