      Study Title:

      A pilot study to evaluate the effect of Forsteo® (Teriparatide, 1-34 rh-PTH) in Anorexia
      Nervosa patients with low mineral density and increased bone fragility (FAN-Trial)

      Short Title/Study ID:

      FAN-Trial / Psy-Rheu_2011/1

      Indication:

      Low bone mineral density (Z-Score &lt; -1.5 or T-Score &lt; -1.5 if available) and fragility
      fractures or very low bone mineral density (Z-Score &lt; -2.5 or T-Score &lt;-2.5 if available)
      without fragility fractures in Anorexia Nervosa patients

      Trial Design:

      Open-label, single-centre pilot study with study drug treatment duration of 24 months.

      Study Center:

      Single-centre (University Hospital of Zürich)

      Investigator(s)/Authors:

      PD Dr. med Gabriella F. Milos (Principle Investigator and author), Dept of Psychiatry, Centre
      for Eating Disorders, University Hospital Zürich, CH-8091 Zürich Dr. med. Diana P. Frey
      (Co-Investigator and author), Dept. of Rheumatology, University Hospital Zürich, CH-8091
      Zürich PD Dr. med. Daniel Uebelhart (author), SUVA Fribourg, CH-1701 Fribourg

      Objective(s)/Outcome(s):

      Primary endpoint:

      •To assess the efficacy of Teriparatide (Forsteo®) in increasing the bone mineral density in
      the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck in patients with anorexia nervosa and low bone
      density at months 12 and 24.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  To assess the changes in blood biomarkers

        -  To assess changes in whole body composition

        -  To assess the incidence of new fragility fractures

        -  To assess changes in bone structure

        -  To assess the changes in EDE-Q

        -  Longterm safety and tolerability of Teriparatide (Forsteo®) in patients with AN

      Assessments for primary endpoint:

      •BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, measured by DXA

      Assessments for secondary endpoints:

        -  bone resorption and bone formation markers measured in urine and serum

        -  whole body composition measured by DXA

        -  New clinical peripheral and vertebral fractures

        -  HRqCT of tibia and forearm

        -  EDE-Q Score at months 12 and 24

        -  Safety lab (blood and urine)

        -  Clinical adverse event monitoring at all visits Number of Subjects: 10

           -2.5 if available) of at least one of the assessed localizations (lumbar spine L1 - L4,
           total hip, femoral neck) without any previous fragility fracture

        -  or low bone mineral density (defined as Z-Score &lt; -1.5 or T-Score &lt; -1.5 if available)
           of at least one of the assessed localizations (lumbar spine L1 - L4, total hip, femoral
           neck) and at least one previous fragility fracture

        -  In- and out-patients of the Centre for Eating Disorders at the Clinic for Psychiatry and
           Psychotherapy of the University Hospital of Zurich.

           osteomalacia, Paget's disease of bone), pre-existing hypercalcemia, severe renal
           impairment (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min), prior external beam or implant radiation therapy to the
           skeleton, skeletal malignancies or bone metastases, any unknown elevation of serum
           alkaline phosphatase, severe psychiatric diseases other than AN, drug addiction, HIV
           positive patients, pregnancy, open epiphyses
