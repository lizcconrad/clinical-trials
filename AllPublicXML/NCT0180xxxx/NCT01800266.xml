  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the impact of varying supervision strategies on
      clinician fidelity and client outcomes in a community-based setting. Prior research has
      established that training approaches that do not include a period of intervention-specific
      supervision or consultation are ineffective and that implementation efforts that include only
      an initial period of supervision show an eventual attenuation of gains in knowledge and
      fidelity in practice. Ongoing supervision may be required for effective and sustained
      implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in community-based settings. However,
      supervision is one of the least investigated aspects of training. &quot;Gold standard&quot; elements of
      supervision from efficacy trials include review of sessions, standardized procedures for
      monitoring client outcomes and model fidelity, and ongoing skill-building (e.g., behavioral
      rehearsal). The degree (e.g., frequency, intensity) to which these strategies are used in
      community-based settings is unknown.

      There are a growing number of national and statewide efforts to increase the reach of EBPs
      through dissemination and implementation initiatives. There are 18 statewide initiatives to
      implement Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), an EBP for child trauma
      exposure and sequelae. Many of the community based TF-CBT implementation efforts, and those
      for other EBPs, include a specific focus on supervisors. However, the limited scientific
      literature provides very little guidance for these efforts. Aims of the current trial include
      1) studying supervision with existing implementation supports; particularly presence of gold
      standard elements; 2) evaluating the effects of varying supervision strategies on fidelity
      and client outcomes; and 3) testing the mediating effect of treatment fidelity on the
      relationship between supervision type and client outcomes. We propose a two-phased,
      within-subjects and between subjects design. In Phase I (9 months), we examined supervision
      with implementation support. In Phase II (30 months), we will examine two specific
      supervision conditions, each including varying EBP supervision elements.

    <measure>Coding Therapy Sessions to Assess Clinician Fidelity to TF-CBT Strategy.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evidence-Based Practices such as Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) usually include ongoing supervision to assess how true (e.g. fidelity) clinicians stay to their training in the specific treatment. We will be coding therapy audio recordings using an adapted TF-CBT Therapy Process Observational Coding System for Children (TF-CBT TPOCS-S) scoring manual. We will also use clinician self-report of fidelity using the Washington State Evidence Based Practice (EBP) Toolkit, and supervisor-report of fidelity in the EBP Toolkit.
We will ultimately be assessing how fidelity serves as a mediator for the relationship between supervision condition and client outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Client outcomes for Post-Traumatic Stress and overall functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will complete phone interviews with children and guardians to assess the client outcomes at baseline, 3 months post-baseline, and 6 months post-baseline. We will use the UCLA Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD RI) to assess trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress symptoms. We will use the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a short behavioral screening survey, to assess overall functioning.</description>
