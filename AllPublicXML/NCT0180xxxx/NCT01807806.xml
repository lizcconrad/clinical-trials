    <textblock>
      This project is a partnership between Soar Technology, the University of Southern California
      (USC) Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families (CIR) and the USC
      Creative Media and Behavioral Health Center (CM&amp;BHC) to conduct a Safety and Effectiveness
      Study (SES) for an educational role-playing game developed by Soar Technology, Inc. The
      purpose of the intervention to be delivered by Soar Technology is to educate families and
      friends with the ultimate goal of empowering them to have a conversation with the
      veteran/service member about readjustment issues. The study will assess the safety and
      effectiveness of the provided game using personal interviews, play testing, and surveys. The
      game playing experience is hypothesized to be safe and effective with respect to having
      conversations with veterans/service members following deployment.

      The intervention is a multi-scenario role playing simulation. Participants view the scenario
      and answer questions about what has been displayed as typical for post deployment service
      members. Participants receive immediate feedback with respect to expectations set by
      simulation developers.
