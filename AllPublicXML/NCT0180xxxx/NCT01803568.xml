  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal glucose uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscles are essential to keep blood glucose
      within normal range and hence, insulin resistance (possibly mediated by inflammatory
      processes) in skeletal muscle is a major pathogenic factor in type 2 diabetes. Physical
      activity seems to be of essential importance in the prevention and treatment of type 2
      diabetes. Myokines are proteins secreted from skeletal muscle that can execute important
      biological functions locally in the muscle (paracrine) or in other organs like the brain,
      heart and pancreas (endocrine). Evidence suggest that several interleukines and other
      cytokines are secreted by skeletal muscles. In the present project, the investigators will
      explore the relation between secreted myokines from muscle cells, insulin resistance and
      glucose metabolism before and after 12 weeks of exercise intervention. Subjects with normal
      as well as impaired glucose metabolism will be included in the study.
