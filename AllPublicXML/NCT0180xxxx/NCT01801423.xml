      Given large absolute numbers of individuals with sickle cell disease in Nigeria, hydroxyurea
      therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease may not be initially feasible; however,
      a targeted strategy of hydroxyurea use for primary prevention of strokes is an alternative to
      the standard therapy (observation) for high-risk individuals. The investigators propose a
      feasibility study, Sickle Cell Disease - Stroke Prevention in Nigeria (SPIN) Trial, to
      determine whether hydroxyurea can be used for primary prevention of strokes in Nigerian
      children with sickle cell anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease in the world. Approximately
      150,000 Nigerian children are born each year with SCD, making it the country with the largest
      burden of sickle cell disease in the world. SCD is the most common cause of stroke in
      children and results in considerable morbidity in affected children. The current primary
      prevention approach of regular monthly blood transfusion therapy of children at high risk of
      stroke (identified by elevated transcranial Doppler measurements) is not feasible in a low
      income country such as Nigeria due to scarcity of supply, cost, and high rate of blood borne
      infections. In the United States, hydroxyurea (HU) is standard therapy for adults with SCD
      and may be a reasonable prevention alternative to regular blood transfusion for treatment of
      primary stroke in high-risk children. Given large absolute numbers of individuals with SCD in
      Nigeria, HU therapy for all individuals with SCD may not be initially feasible; however, a
      targeted strategy of HU use for primary prevention of strokes is an alternative to the
      standard therapy (observation) for high-risk individuals. Study investigators therefore
      propose a feasibility study to determine the acceptability of HU for primary prevention of
      strokes in Nigerian children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in preparation for a National
      Institute of Health (NIH) sponsored Phase III Trial. Investigators will establish a safety
      protocol for using HU in a clinical trial setting and complete the necessary preparations for
      a definitive phase III trial. To accomplish these aims study investigators have assembled a
      strong multidisciplinary team representing Vanderbilt University and two premier in-country
      institutions: Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, and Friends in Global Health-Nigeria.
      Completion of a definitive trial will not only benefit children with SCA in sub-Saharan
      Africa, where the majority of children with SCA live in the world, but could provide
      reasonable evidence for an alternative to blood transfusion therapy for the primary
      prevention of strokes in the US. To our knowledge this would be the first stroke prevention
      trial in Nigeria and could establish a precedent to expand to secondary stroke prevention for
      children and adults with SCA, as regrettably, no therapy is available to prevent recurrent
      stroke in these high-risk patients in resource-poor nations.

    <measure>Hydroxyurea Safety protocol for Children with Sickle Cell Anemia</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Study investigators will evaluate the use of a standard safety protocol, non-dose escalating, for hydroxyurea in children with sickle cell anemia using a protocol similar to the recently completed National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Baby HUG study, published in Lancet.(1) Study investigators expect the proportion of serious adverse reactions, as well as hydroxyurea-related morbidity and mortality, to be very small compared to the benefits. Study investigators will compare the frequency of severe adverse events and hydroxyurea toxicity related events that are associated with hospitalization in those receiving hydroxyurea (n= 60) to those who had normal transcranial Doppler measurements (n= 210) over the course of one year.</description>

    <description>Study investigators propose to enroll 60 children with SCA and an elevated TCD measurement between 5 and 12 years of age in this one arm feasibility study of hydroxyurea therapy, with follow-up of at least 12 months per subject. The study intervention will include HU to begin at ~ 20 mg/kg/day(range 17.5 - 26 mg/kg/day). No dose escalation will occur. Given the success of the first year of enrollment and the favorable response of TCD measurement after 3 months on HU therapy, the study investigators have participants as an internal pilot. The definitive phase III trial will now compare low dose HU therapy to the result of no treatment arm from the STOP Trial.</description>

    <description>Hydroxyurea will be prescribed as an investigational therapy by the treating physician. Recommended guidelines for titration of hydroxyurea to maximal tolerated dose are below. The study intervention will include hydroxyurea to begin at ~20 mg/kg/day (range 17.5 - 26 mg/kg/day). No dose escalation will occur as this dose was shown to have some efficacy in infants with SCA and was associated with rare myelosuppression.(1)</description>

          -  Patients with hemoglobin SS or S beta zero thalassemia confirmed by hemoglobin
             electrophoresis;

          -  Informed consent from a parent or legal guardian and assent of participant ages 5
             through 12;

          -  Successful completion of screening procedures: cerebral blood flow velocity ≥ 200
             cm/sec in the terminal portion of the middle cerebral artery;

          -  Patient must be 5 through 12 years of age (i.e., must have attained their 5th but not
             their 13th birthday when the consent is signed).

        Exclusion Criteria for Screening:

          -  Prior overt stroke (a focal neurological deficit of acute onset) by history, focal
             neurological deficit on standardized neurological examination, or concern for moderate
             or severe neurological deficit (which could be due to stroke) based on a positive &quot;10
             questions&quot; screening (an established tool in resource poor countries).(2,3) A
             &quot;positive&quot; screening is defined as answering yes to any one of the 10 questions. The
             negative predictive value (child does not have moderate or several neurological
             impairment) of the &quot;10 questions&quot; is greater than 94% in children (2);

          -  Other exclusions: significant cytopenias [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500/ul,
             platelets &lt;150,000/ul, reticulocytes &lt;80,000/ul, unless Hb is &gt; 9 g/dl], renal
             insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 0.8 mg/dl); other significant organ system dysfunction, or
             other contraindication to hydroxyurea therapy; and history of seizures or diagnosis of
             epilepsy;

          -  Patients for whom hydroxyurea therapy is under consideration prior to study
             consent/education;

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with hydroxyurea and are being considered to
             restart hydroxyurea therapy;

          -  Other significant organ system dysfunction;

          -  Any other condition or chronic illness, which in the opinion of the site's Principal
             Investigator (PI) makes participation ill-advised or unsafe.

          -  Participants of child bearing age who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not
             take hydroxyurea. If a participant becomes pregnant during the study, their
             hydroxyurea treatment will be stopped immediately. The onsite will notify the clinical
             coordinating center and the principal investigators of the case. The site principal
             investigator and study principal investigators will determine what therapy the
             participant should receive during pregnancy that is of standard care.
