      To study the safety and efficacy of anti-CD20 blockade with ofatumumab in the context of
      allogeneic HCT in CLL
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a consequent anti-CD20
      therapy with the antibody ofatumumab in the context of allogeneic HCT. Allogeneic HCT itself
      is not a study intervention and is triggered by the availability of an HLA-compatible stem
      cell donor. The study is divided into an induction part and a maintenance part. During
      induction where the antibody is combined with high dose dexamethasone, the main goal is to
      reduce the tumor load prior to allogeneic HCT. Patients who achieved disease control (CR, PR
      and SD) by the antibody proceed to maintenance therapy with the antibody. Patients with
      progressive disease go off study. The idea behind maintenance therapy is that ofatumumab may
      contribute to tumor control early after allogeneic stem cell transplantation while T-cell
      based graft-versus leukemia effects are still not fully established. External tumor control
      could lower the pressure to taper immunosuppressive drugs early after transplantation and
      could thereby indirectly contribute to better GVHD-prophylaxis. Furthermore, anti-CD20
      antibodies have proven activity in the treatment of chronic GVHD. In summary, the concept of
      a consequent CD20 blockade in the context of allogeneic transplantation could result in
      better leukemic control and better GVHD prophylaxis, which is a highly attractive goal.

    <description>Study treatment comprises eight weeks of induction therapy with ofatumumab in combination with high-dose dexamethasone. The first dose of ofatumumab is 300 mg followed by seven infusions of 2000 mg ofatumumab. Dexamethasone will be given orally at doses of 40 mg on days 1-4 in weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. Patients who achieved a CR, PR shall proceed to maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy consists of 6 monthly infusions of 1000 mg ofatumumab.
An HLA-matched sibling donor or HLA-matched unrelated donor can be identified for approximately 70% of patients. Donor search will be completed within six weeks for 95% of the patients. Patients with a donor will proceed to allogeneic HCT as soon as possible prior to, or during maintenance therapy.</description>
