  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non randomized (the study medication is not assigned by chance), open-label (all
      participants and study staff know the identity of the treatment), multi-center, prospective
      (looking forward using observations collected following participant enrollment), and
      non-comparative study in which participants with erectile dysfunction will be observed to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mirodenafil for 12 weeks. Safety evaluations will
      include assessment of adverse events, and record of concomitant medications. The study will
      be conducted in Korea.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function is used for the assessment of erectile dysfunction, with scores ranging from 0 to 30. Evaluation of points are as follows: 1-10 = severe erectile dysfunction, 11-16 = moderate dysfunction, 17-21 = mild to moderate dysfunction, 22-25 = mild dysfunction, 26-30 = no dysfunction. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Sexual Encounter Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Sexual Encounter Profile is assessed after each sexual attempt consisting of a series of yes/no questions regarding specific aspects of each encounter. Question 1 asks, &quot;Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?&quot; and question 2 asks, &quot;Did your erection last long enough for you to complete intercourse with ejaculation?&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Global assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Assessment Questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire (Yes/No) that allows men to rate improvement in erectile function. Question 1 asks &quot;Has the treatment you have been taking over the past 4 weeks improved your erections?&quot; and if the answer is yes, question 2 then asks &quot;Has the treatment improved your ability to engage in sexual activity&quot;</description>
