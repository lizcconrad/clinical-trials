    <textblock>
      Many medicinal effects of Pomegranate juices are already known. Mainly known for its
      anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-oxide tendency of pomegranate juice.

      Many studies which have demonstrated antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice in the blood
      and blood cells were published.

      In addition, published studies have demonstrated the anti-oxidant activity which inhibit the
      development of atherosclerosis and stroke, even in patients with diabetes, and its effect of
      decreasing systolic blood pressure in patients with systemic hypertension.

      The purpose of the work is to examine the effect of drinking pomegranate juice on the level
      of anti-oxidants in human breast milk.
