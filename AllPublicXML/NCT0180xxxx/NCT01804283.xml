  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest could regulate expression of microRNAs in
           patients undergoing double valve replacement (aortic and mitral).

        2. The modulation of myocardial microRNAs by cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest
           may be rescued by ischemic postconditioning.

        3. Downstream effectors would also be affected.

    <description>Samples were harvested from all the patients, respectively, before cardiopulmonary bypass and at 5 min after aortic de-clamping. Real-time quantitative stem-loop reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to detect the expression of microRNAs.</description>

    <description>multiple brief ischemic-reperfusion episodes immediately after sustained ischemic insult
Postconditioning was started at 30 s after aortic cross declamping, and the aorta was re-clamped for 30 s rendering global myocardial ischemia. Meanwhile aortic root suction was established during aortic re-clamping, and thereafter, the aortic clamp was released for 30 s for full myocardial reperfusion. The cycle was repeated three times after cardioplegic arrest.</description>
