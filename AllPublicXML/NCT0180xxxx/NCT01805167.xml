  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Differences in speech-understanding and the quality of the subjective perception among
      cochlear implant patients (Digisonic SP) depends on numerous factors. The electrical field
      distribution (interaction between electrodes) could also explain the disparity of the
      performances? The objective of our study was to quantify the influence of the electrical
      field interactions between the channels of stimulation according to the vocal performances of
      the implanted subjects, for various subjective levels of electric stimulation.

    <measure>Quantify the interactions between electrical stimulation channels based vocal performance of implanted subjects, for different subjective levels of electrical stimulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion - Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The vocal performance will be noted in percentage of voice recognition in the silence and in the noise.
And the electric interaction between the channels of stimulations will be estimated by the measure of the refractory period of the circuits of the hearing system with the PEAEP after stimulations of electrodes of intermediate situation in the cochl√©e (electrodes 11, 12 and 13)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparative study of PEAEP (Auditory Evoked Potentials Early electric) in vocal performance</measure>
    <time_frame>At the inclusion - Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Collection of the PEAEP after stimulation of 4 different electrodes distributed on the totality of door-electrode: generally, electrodes 4, 7, 10 and 13 will be stimulated. The amplitudes and the latencies of the waves II, III and V will be analyzed and compared with the vocal performances.</description>
