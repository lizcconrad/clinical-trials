    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the short term effectiveness and return to function
      of subjects undergoing primary Total Hip Arthroplasty using an Anterior Approach (incision on
      the front part of the hip joint) versus Posterior Approach (incision over back part of the
      hip joint).

    <measure>Returning to Quality of Life by using either Anterior Approach versus Posterior Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Functional activities (distance walked, assistive devices used) Length of hospital stay/Harris Hip Score Elements/Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score/Timed walking tests/Complications/Patient Withdrawal/Revision/Deaths (as applicable) At Two years, we will measure Harris Hip Score,UCLA activity score, and Radiographic evalution score.
At 5 years, we will measure Harris Hip Score, UCLA activity score and Radiographic evaluation score.
At each time interval we will evaluate expected non-interval change between the Anterior and Posterior approach. The outcome measures at 2 and 5 years have been validated outcome measures for joint replacement surgery for peer reviewed orthopedic literature.
Note: The outcome we are measuring at each interval is to return to quality of life as measured by the validated outcome measures noted above. Thus we are measuring one outcome at each interval.</description>
