  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (RYGB) is a bariatric procedure with known safety and effectiveness. Laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a newer procedure gaining popularity. The aim of the study is to
      compare outcomes of these two surgical methods in terms of weight loss, improvement of common
      comorbidities of obesity and influence on metabolic and hormonal status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Authors of the study believe that a more detailed head-to-head comparison of RYGB and LSG is
      necessary. The former method is the established &quot;gold standard&quot; procedure with good outcomes
      reported in many studies. However it is much more complex and the learning curve is longer.
      The latter method was introduced as an initial procedure in superobese patients because of
      its relative simplicity. It produced good outcomes in this population of superobese patients
      and surgeons in some centers started to use it as a primary bariatric procedure. RYGB is a
      restrictive and partially malabsorptive procedure and it is believed to have additional
      benefits in patients with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.
      Purely restrictive procedures such as LSG are theoretically less beneficial in this group of
      patients. In the present study authors will look at weight loss as well as improvement in
      comorbidities and several biochemical parameters and indices to assess also metabolic action
      of these two procedures.
