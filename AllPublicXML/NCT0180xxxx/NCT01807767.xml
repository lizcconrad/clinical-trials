  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Everolimus conversion
      in liver transplantation. Most large US liver centers transplant patients with high Model for
      End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. However, many of the sponsored liver transplant trials
      in the US do not include patients with high MELD scores making it difficult to extrapolate
      these trial data to the patients cared for at larger liver transplant centers. The greatest
      potential benefit of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors is the avoidance of the
      side-effects of calcineurin-inhibitors, namely, renal insufficiency, diabetes and
      hypertension. Therefore, this protocol is designed to study the efficacy and safety of
      everolimus and Myfortic in liver transplant patients with high MELD scores at two large
      centers with a vast experience in the administration of mTOR inhibitors.
