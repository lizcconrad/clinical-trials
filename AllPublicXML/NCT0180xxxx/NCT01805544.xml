      National, multicenter, prospective, observational, non-interventional study. The objective is
      to determine if the switch from Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto in subjects treated
      with VKA with issues in deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and prevention of recurrent DVT and
      pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with an improvement of the treatment satisfaction after
      3 months. The treatment satisfaction will be measured by the Anti Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS)
      score.
