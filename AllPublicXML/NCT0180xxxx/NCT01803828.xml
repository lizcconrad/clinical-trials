    <textblock>
      Pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is yet unclear and gender differences at
      baseline and a specific treatment have not been indicated. The investigators already
      demonstrated the positive impact of phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) inhibition in men. The
      investigators' study aims to characterize DCM, measuring molecular and neuroendocrine
      assessment to relate to intramyocardial metabolism and cardiac kinetic. The investigators
      will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolling 164 diabetic
      patients (females and males) with DCM, to evaluate gender responses to 6 months of PDE5A
      inhibitors (PDE5Ai). The investigators' study will describe gender differences in DCM
      features. The proposed research will test whether PDE5Ai could become a new target for
      antiremodeling drugs and to discover a molecular pathways affected by this class of drugs and
      a network of circulating markers for the early diagnosis, monitoring and prediction of
      response to treatment of DCM.

      Pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is yet unclear and gender differences at
      baseline and a specific treatment have not been indicated. The investigators demonstrated the
      positive impact of phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) inhibition in men. The investigators'
      study aims to characterize DCM, measuring molecular and neuroendocrine assessment to relate
      to intramyocardial metabolism and cardiac kinetic. The investigators will perform a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolling 164 diabetic patients (females
      and males) with DCM, to evaluate gender responses to 6 months of PDE5A inhibitors (PDE5Ai).
      The investigators' study will describe gender differences in DCM features. The proposed
      research will test whether PDE5Ai could become a new target for antiremodeling drugs and to
      discover a molecular pathways affected by this class of drugs and a network of circulating
      markers for the early diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of DCM.

      The investigators will allow identifying a cluster of cardiovascular, metabolic and oxidative
      stress markers and miRNAs, whose variations together correlate with the DCM evolution and the
      prediction of risk and response to treatment.

      The investigators will evaluate if PDE5Ai could become a new target for antiremodeling drugs;
      if the mechanism of action is direct on cardiac tissue, independently of other secondary
      effects and gender related difference.

      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with cardiac remodeling that may occur independently
      of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, or macrovascular complications.

      In vitro studies have shown that phosphodiesterase 5 overexpression reduces cGMP levels and
      exacerbates remodeling. The investigators already studied the effects of 3-month daily
      Inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis through a phosphodiesterase 5A inhibitor (PDE5i) on cardiac
      remodeling in a cohort of asymptomatic, middle-aged men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      CMR imaging revealed that diabetic cardiomyopathy in these patients produced an uncoupling in
      left ventricular contraction between longitudinal strain, which is reduced, and cardiac axial
      rotation, which is increased. Characterized DCM at early asymptomatic stages in men, we
      identified two circulating markers, TGF-beta and MCP-1 increased and significantly related to
      cardiac kinetic parameters. Then, the investigators found that long-term PDE5i restored
      coupling by reducing torsion and improving strain. It also reduced the ratio of left
      ventricular mass to end-diastolic volume that is increased in the presence of concentric
      hypertrophy. Circulating markers TGF-beta and MCP-1, significantly decreased after PDE5i vs.
      Placebo.These data suggest that phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition could work as an
      antiremodeling drug by acting directly on cardiac tissue, independently of other secondary
      vascular, endothelial, or metabolic effects.

      However, these data need to be validated on a wide sample, for a longer duration of
      treatment, and including women, because of their high vulnerability to diabetic damage with
      preferential evolution in chronic heart failure, compared to males that frequently have
      ischemic complications.

      Recently, animal and human studies have described gene expression profiles associated with
      pathological hypertrophy. In particular, some microRNAs (miRNAs) altered expression in the
      cardiomyocyte (small RNA molecules involved in transcriptional regulation) [miR-208/1/133],
      were related to the onset of hypertrophy. Is unknown whether these or other miRNAs are able
      to predict the development of DCM and/or the effectiveness of treatment with PDE5i in T2DM.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        -  there are gender differences in left ventricular myocardial remodeling of T2DM patients
           detectable with tagged-CMR in terms of myocardial strain and ventricular torsion

        -  gender-related features determine different cardiac response to PDE5i treatment detected
           by changes in ventricular contractility (strain and torsion on tagged-CMR) and
           metabolism (PCr-to-ATP ratio on 31P-CMR spectroscopy)

        -  neuroendocrine (e.g. natriuretic peptides) and metabolic markers and chemokines (e.g.
           MCP-1, TGF-ß) might identify those asymptomatic patients at greatest risk of developing
           the LV remodeling

        -  there are neuroendocrine (e.g. natriuretic peptides) , metabolic markers and chemokines
           (e.g. MCP-1,TGF-ß) able to predict response to treatment with PDE5i and the evolution of
           disease

        -  miRNA expression [miR-208a, 499, 1, 133, 126, 29, 233.222] will predict the development
           and evolution of cardiac remodeling and the effectiveness of treatment with PDE5i in
           T2DM patients

      The aims of the study are:

      Characterization of gender differences in DCM remodeling through a cluster of biomarkers
      indicative of the stage of the disease and CMR quantification of kinetic parameters
      (myocardial strain, ventricular torsion), fibrosis amount (T1-mapping technique) and
      metabolism (PCr-to- ATP ratio, measured by 31P-Spectroscopy) Quantification of a cluster of
      biomarkers predictive of disease progression: metabolic and neuroendocrine markers,
      pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory circulating chemokines and miRNAs Evaluation of gender
      differences in the anti-remodeling effect of PDE5A inhibition in T2DM patients Quantification
      of a cluster of biomarkers predictive of anti-remodeling response to PDE5Ai chronic
      administration The investigators will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      study enrolling 164 patients (females and males) with T2DM and diabetic cardiomyopathy.
      Patients will be randomized to treatment with PDE5Ai 5 mg / day or placebo for 6 consecutive
      months.

      The outcomes will be evaluated before and 1,3 and 6 months after therapy.

      Cardiovascular (NT-ProBNP, TGFb, MCP1), endothelial (ET1, VEGF, P Selectin, ICAM1) and
      metabolic indices, and oxidative stress markers (iNOS, COX2, ROS, RANTES) will be evaluated
      in all patients and related to CMR cardiac kinetic and metabolic parameters and fibrosis in
      order to identify:

        -  gender differences in cardiac remodeling at baseline (overall patients included in the
           study) and in its evolution (Placebo group);

        -  effectiveness of PDE5i administration (PDE5i group) and potential gender differences in
           response to treatment.

      To identify circulating miRNAs the investigators performed specific quantitative Real-Time
      PCR analysis to target expression of different mature circulating miRNAs before and after
      one, three and six months of PDE5i treatment. In particular the investigators will analyze a
      panel of selected miRNAs, including heart-associated (miR-1, -133a, -208b, and -499),
      fibrosis-associated (miR-21 and miR-29b), leukocyte-associated (miR-146, -155, and -223),
      hyperglycemia-associate (miR-29, -222), vascular-associate (miR-126) miRNA. Then, we will
      analyze putative gender differences in miRNAs expression and the investigators will correlate
      miRNAs' expression pattern to cardiovascular and metabolic features.

      CMR assessment will perform in order to identify:

        -  gender differences in kinetic parameters of left ventricle (end-diastolic volume,
           end-systolic volume, stroke volume, wall motion score index, myocardial strain, torsion
           angle);

        -  changes in myocardial fibrosis replacement amount (global contrast-enhanced T1
           relaxation time, percentage of myocardial surface area, quantified by T1-mapping
           technique);

        -  changes in myocardial metabolism (PCr-to-TP ratio, measured by 31P-Spectroscopy).

      All patients presenting unknown ischemic cardiomyopathy on CMR performed at baseline will be
      excluded from the study.

      Evaluation of potential toxicity will be monitored throughout the course of treatment.
