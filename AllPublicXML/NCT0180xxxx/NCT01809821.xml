  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is an essential component of good physical and mental health. Previous studies have
      reported that poor quality sleep is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, stroke
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension is the most common and important risk factor
      for CVD, and even modest reductions in blood pressure result in significant reductions in
      stroke and myocardial infarction. In this randomised trial, the investigators aim to evaluate
      whether a simple, multi-component, online sleep intervention reduces blood pressure in
      patients with essential hypertension.
