  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open label demonstration study with PrEP and Client Centered Care Coordination (C4) to
      assess the initiation, acceptability, safety, and feasibility of PrEP for Black MSM (BMSM) in
      three US Cities. A subset of participants will also be recruited to participate in
      qualitative interviews about facilitators and barriers regarding PrEP. The study will recruit
      HIV-uninfected BMSM at risk for HIV infection in three US Cities. Enrollment will include
      those aged 18 and over with an effort to recruit an equal number of BMSM under age 25 and
      over age 25 with a total of 225 participants (75 per site).
