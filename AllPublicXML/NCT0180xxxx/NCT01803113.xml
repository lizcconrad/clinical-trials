  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this field study is to demonstrate the clinical performance of the Sofia hCG
      FIA Test, using urine specimens from females of childbearing age.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects presenting for pregnancy testing will provide urine specimens that will be tested
      with the Sofia hCG FIA test and the comparator pregnancy test that will detect levels of hCG
      of 20mIU as positive for pregnancy.
