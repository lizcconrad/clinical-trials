  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to investigate whether acute total deprivation affects metabolism as
      measured through blood and peripheral tissues. Its aim is also to investigate how acute total
      sleep deprivation affects neurodegenerative markers, as well as hormones, memory performance
      and aspects of appetite regulation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is predicted that acute total sleep deprivation will affect gene expression and DNA
      methylation. It is also predicted that sleep deprivation will up-regulate ghrelin, and affect
      other neuroendocrine markers and hormones in a negative manner. It is further predicted that
      sleep deprivation will decrease participants' memory performance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gene expression and DNA methylation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (ie. around 1930 in the evening - before sleep intervention) to 12 hours later (around 0730 in the morning after the nighttime intervention), and to 15 hours later (around 1030 in the morning after the nighttime intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This study has been designed to measure the changes in gene expression and DNA methylation in circulating blood, i.e. mainly of white blood cells with active transcription and DNA regulation, and how this relates to possible changes in peripheral tissues involved in metabolism.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circulating hormone and neuromolecular levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in circulating hormone levels from baseline (ie. around 1930 in the evening - before sleep intervention) to 12 hours later (around 0730 in the morning after the nighttime intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have their circulating hormone levels and neuromolecular levels taken and analyzed, including ghrelin, to determine if sleep deprivation alters hormone and neuromolecular levels related primarily to obesity, cognition or weight gain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetitive evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in appetitive ratings after the sleep intervetion (from around 0700 in the morning after the nighttime intervention), repeated each hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated on their appetitive ratings in the morning following either nighttime intervention (acute total sleep deprivation or normal 8-hour sleep).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Portion Size Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in selected portion size in the morning, at around 0830 hours in the morning following each nighttime intervention, and 2h30min later, i.e. 30 min after consuming an Oral glucose tolerance test, i.e. around 1100 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated on their tendency to choose larger or smaller portions of a variety of meal items on a computer screen. This will be conducted both following partial sleep deprivation and normal sleep, and changes before and after glucose ingestion will be compared between these conditions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inhibitory task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in cognitive inhibitory performance at around 0810 hours in the morning following the respective nighttime intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants perform a binary decision on each presented stimuli. Of the two possible outcomes, participants are instructed to make a motor response (go) for one type, and are to withhold a response (no-go) for the other type. Reaction time and accuracy are measured for each event.</description>
