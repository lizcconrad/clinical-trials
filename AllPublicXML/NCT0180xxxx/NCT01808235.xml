    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test an intervention to improve oral health for
      individuals with memory problems. The results from this study will assist in developing
      prevention and intervention programs aimed at maintaining good oral health, or at least
      slowing its deterioration.

      This project will involve two phases. The main purpose of Phase 1 is to conduct a focus group
      with 6 individuals with mild dementia (IMDs) and their live-in partners (usually spouse) and
      conduct in-depth interviews with staff at community organizations (e.g., dementia caregiver
      support group staff) to develop the protocol. Information from Phase 1 will provide input to
      refine the proposed pilot intervention that will be Phase 2 of this project. The pilot oral
      health intervention will last 6 months and will be conducted with up to ten IMDs and their
      live-in partners.

    <description>The dental hygienist will assess the IMD's tooth brushing technique and will provide specific feedback on the tooth brushing technique, including areas of the dentition missed in brushing. The IMDs will be given a powered toothbrush that records time, date and duration of toothbrushing activity, along with the direction and extent of motion of the toothbrushing activity. In addition, use of interdental cleaning aids will be recommended. The dental hygienist will review the findings from the oral health evaluation with the IMDs and caregivers, and provide detailed feedback on treatment and prevention of the oral health conditions and symptoms. The dental hygienist or study coordinator will call subjects by telephone biweekly to monitor oral hygiene practices and to provide coaching, if needed. Oral hygiene technique assessments will be conducted again three months after the first visit, and once more three months later, at the end of the intervention.</description>
