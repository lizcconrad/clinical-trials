  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-in-human, Two-stage, Multi-centre study. Part A is an open-label, single
      ascending dose study in fed or fasted subjects and Part B is a randomized, placebo-controlled
      multiple ascending dose study. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of ascending doses of SB 9200 given as monotherapy for up to 14 days to subjects with chronic
      Hepatitis C infection, and to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship
      over this dose range.

          -  Must have HCV and laboratory evidence of HCV infection for at least six months before
             the Screening Visit.

          -  Must have HCV-1 (1a or 1b or non-sub-typeable HCV-1), HCV-2 or HCV-3, as applicable

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past five years, regardless of whether
             there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential.

          -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring

             Ishak or Metavir scoring system or equivalent (i.e. greater than moderate fibrosis).

             pulmonary, gastrointestinal cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Blood donation of approximately 500 mL or significant blood loss within 56 days prior
             to dosing.

          -  Any other medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality which, in the
             view of the Investigator, is likely to interfere with the study or put the subject at
             risk.

          -  Concurrent participation in another clinical trial.
