    <textblock>
      This study intends to explore the levels of MSRV expression by analyzing the levels of MSRV
      transcripts in blood, as well as the levels of the MSRV-Env protein in serum in the normal
      population. This study is important for establishing a baseline to analyze results obtained
      in MS patients (another dedicated study is performed in parallel in MS patients). The study
      will be conducted over one year in a cohort of healthy subjects. The MSRV RNA level, MSRV-Env
      protein levels, reverse transcriptase activity, inflammatory markers assessed by cytokines
      levels will be analysed to define control levels in the normal population and their variation
      during one year. The data obtained in this study in healthy controls will be compared to
      those obtained in a parallel similar study, GN-E-002, conducted in different types of MS
      patients.
