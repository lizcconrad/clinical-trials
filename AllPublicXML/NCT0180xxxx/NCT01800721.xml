  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study includes a randomized clinical trial of a peer health education
      intervention and a 12-month longitudinal study. The sample will include Black Men who have
      Sex with Men (MSM) who will be randomized into an experimental or control condition and then
      asked to recruit peer and risk network members for HIV testing over a 3 month period. Some of
      the network members who are recruited for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) will enroll
      into the longitudinal study for assessments only. Both index and network participants will be
      assessed at baseline, 6, and 12-months.

      The specific aims of the proposed study are to:

        1. Train Black MSM (index participants in the experimental condition) to conduct peer
           health education, to promote VCT and HIV risk reduction among social network members,
           and to recruit social network members for VCT.

        2. Examine changes in HIV risk behaviors and VCT among index participants and their network
           members in the experimental intervention as compared to those in the control condition.

        3. Examine mediating effects of social environments (networks, social norms) on HIV risk
           behaviors and VCT, among indexes and network members.

        4. Examine mediating effects of individual level factors (substance use and depression) on
           HIV risk behaviors and VCT among indexes and network members.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this funded research is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of
      an experimental behavioral intervention that will train African American men who have sex
      with men (AA MSM) to 1) conduct peer health education, 2) to promote HIV risk reduction among
      their social network members, 3) promote HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) among
      their social network members and 4) recruit social network members for VCT. Index
      participants are African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who are randomized to
      either a peer education intervention or comparison condition. After the baseline is complete,
      index participants refer social network members (i.e. network participants) to the research
      clinic for HIV antibody testing. In addition, a subset of network participants participate in
      the longitudinal portion of the study.
