  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fat has been shown to modulate cholesterol and fatty acids homeostasis and several
      lines of evidence suggest that this effect is associated with changes in the regulation of
      different genes at the intestine level involved in the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism
      pathways. The present study will examine the impact of a short-term high fat diet versus a
      short-term low fat diet on expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette transporters (ABCG5/8), microsomal triglyceride transfer
      protein (MTP) and fatty acid transport protein-4 (FATP4), which have been shown to play a
      critical role in intestinal cholesterol absorption, chylomicron synthesis and dietary lipid
      absorption. Gene expression studies will be performed on duodenal biopsies. The primary
      hypothesis is that a short-term high fat diet will significantly decrease duodenal messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of NPC1L1, ABCG5/8, MTP and FATP4 as compared with a
      short-term low fat diet.
