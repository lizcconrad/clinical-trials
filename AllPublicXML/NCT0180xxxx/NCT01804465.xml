  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects taking ipilimumab, as an immediate or
      delayed treatment, following completion of sipuleucel-T (SipT) treatment, has on patients and
      their prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining SipT with
      ipilimumab in patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC).

      All patients will be treated with standard SipT (Q2wks x 3). Patients will be randomized to
      one of two arms:

      Arm 1 (Immediate Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 1 day following the final dose of
      SipT (Day 0).

      Arm 2 (Delayed Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 3 weeks following the final dose of
      SipT (Day 0).

      Following this ipilimumab treatment, patients will then be followed monthly for 3 months and
      then quarterly until disease progression. The definition of unacceptable toxicity is grade 3
      or higher treatment-related toxicities (NCI CTCAE v4) excluding irAEs. The study will assess
      for the immunogenicity and clinical activity of sequential sipuleucel-T treatment followed by
      ipilimumab. Patients who experience an initial clinical response to ipilimumab followed by
      subsequent disease progression will be offered reinduction treatment with ipilimumab.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed, metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma (positive bone scan
             and/or measurable disease on CT scan and/or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis).

          2. Progressive disease after androgen deprivation, as defined by PSA Working Group 2
             and/or RECIST criteria. Patients must have disease progression by one or both of the
             following:

               -  For patients with measurable disease, progression is defined as at least a 20%
                  increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions or the
                  appearance of one or more new lesions, as per RECIST criteria version 1.1.

               -  For patients with no measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated PSA
                  will be required. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA
                  level of at least 2 ng/ml, which has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at
                  least 1 week apart. If the confirmatory PSA value is not greater than the
                  screening PSA value, then an additional test for rising PSA will be required to
                  document progression.

               -  If no prior orchiectomy has been performed, patients must remain on LHRH agonist
                  or antagonist (e.g. degarelix) therapy. Patients who are receiving an
                  antiandrogen as part of primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease
                  progression following discontinuation of the antiandrogen, defined as two
                  consecutive rising PSA values, obtained at least two weeks apart, or documented
                  osseous or soft tissue progression. At least one of the PSA values must be
                  obtained at least four weeks (flutamide) or six weeks (bicalutamide or
                  nilutamide) after discontinuation.

          3. Laboratory requirements:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL

               -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL

               -  PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL

               -  AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min by the Cockcroft Gault equation

               -  Testosterone less than or equal to 50 ng/dL

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 1 and life expectancy
             ≥ 12 weeks.

          5. At least 18 years of age or older.

          6. Patients receiving any other hormonal therapy, including any dose of megestrol acetate
             (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (e.g.
             Saw Palmetto, PC-SPES), or any systemic corticosteroid, must discontinue the agent for
             at least four weeks prior to study treatment. Progressive disease as defined above
             must be documented after discontinuation of any hormonal therapy (with the exception
             of a LHRH agonist).

          7. Prior radiation therapy must be completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment and the
             patient must have recovered from all toxicity. Prior radiopharmaceuticals (strontium,
             samarium) must be completed ≥ 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          8. Because of the unknown potential risk to a gamete and/or developing embryo from these
             investigational therapies, patients must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier
             method for males) for the duration of study participation, and for three months after
             discontinuing therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, with the exception of neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy, because of the potential effect of chemotherapy on the immune system.

          2. Prior sipuleucel-T treatment or investigational immunotherapy.

          3. Prostate cancer pain requiring regularly scheduled narcotics.

          4. Current treatment with systemic steroid therapy (inhaled/topical steroids are
             acceptable). Systemic corticosteroids must be discontinued for at least 4 weeks prior
             to first treatment.

          5. History of autoimmune disease including, but not limited to:

               -  Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), scleroderma, CREST syndrome, rheumatoid
                  arthritis

               -  Inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune
                  hepatitis

               -  Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, giant cell arteritis

               -  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), cryoglobulinemia, antiphospholipid antibody
                  syndrome (APLS)

               -  Diabetes mellitus type I, myasthenia gravis, Grave's disease

               -  Wegener's granulomatosis or other vasculitis

               -  A history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, psoriasis, or eczema, any of which has been
                  inactive for at least one year, or isolated Raynaud's phenomenon is acceptable

          6. Known central nervous system or visceral metastases.

          7. Medical or psychiatric illness that would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             preclude participation in the study or the ability of patients to provide informed
             consent for themselves.

          8. Cardiovascular disease that meets one of the following: congestive heart failure (New
             York Heart Association Class III or IV), active angina pectoris, or recent myocardial
             infarction (within the last 6 months).

          9. Concurrent or prior malignancy except for the following:

               -  Adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer

               -  Adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in
                  complete remission

               -  Any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

         10. Known HIV or other history of immunodeficiency disorder.

         11. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or medical (e.g. infectious) illness.

         12. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

         13. A history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or prior CD137 agonist or CTLA-4
             inhibitor or agonist.
