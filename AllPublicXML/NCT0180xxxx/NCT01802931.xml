    <textblock>
      The study will determine the effect of 400 mg once daily of ketoconazole at steady state on
      the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of GSK239512 in young healthy volunteers.
      Ketoconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which is involved in metabolism of drugs. A
      two-cohort design will be applied with cohort 1 aimed at providing a first estimate of the
      interaction potential of GSK239512 and ketoconazole in terms of pharmacokinetic parameters in
      a small number of subjects. Data from Cohort 1 will inform the decision of which dose to use
      in Cohort 2, in which a larger number of subjects will be exposed to GSK239512 without and
      with ketoconazole. The target maximum exposure is aimed to be similar to the exposure by a
      single dose of 80 mcg of GSK239512 without CYP3A4 inhibition. In summary, the results from
      this study will help to estimate the maximum increase in exposure of GSK239512 during
      concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and will help define the subsequent dosing
      strategy around GSK239512 and co-medications with potential to inhibit CYP3A4.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>

             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          3. ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          4. QTcF &lt; 450 msec.

          5. Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of

          7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within 30 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dosing
             day in the current study.

             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

         10. History of sensitivity to ketoconazole, or to the excipients contained in GSK239512 or
             Nizoral, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
