  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the use of EVADO with respect
      to a conventional cardio-pulmonary bypass (CBP) system on surgical morbidity and mortality.
      As secondary aim this study wants to conduct appropriate laboratory investigations in order
      to detect the major biological mechanisms potentially responsible for the beneficial effects
      of the EVADO system on the coagulation cascade and inflammatory activation.

      The present study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, randomized, open label,
      controlled, 2-arm parallel group, superiority trial.

      Participating centres are selected based on previous experience with the use of the EVADO
      system.

      Patients elected to open heart surgery for a variety of cardiac conditions related to
      coronary, valvular or aortic disease or their combination in the participating centers will
      be screened.

      This study as secondary aim wants to confirm the results of earlier investigation by a
      multicentre trial conducted on a larger population of patients undergoing a wide spectrum of
      open heart cardiac operations and either assess a number of cost-efficacy-efficiency
      indicators.

    <description>The E.V.A.D.O. system is made of the following components:
The ADMIRAL oxygenator, that requires low priming volumes (, has a limited contact surface and contains an accessory independent cardiotomy reservoir, allowing separation of pericardial suction blood.
The HARMONY Smart Suction System, which allows automatic regulation of a pumpless extracavity blood sucker, whose rates and pressures depend on whether suction is required for blood/air surfaces (skimming), or for fluids (pooled).
Paediatric circuits with 3/8&quot; tubing for both arterial and venous lines.</description>

    <description>EVADO (Extracorporeal Vacuum-Assisted Device Optimized) device enables separation of cardiotomy suction blood, which is stored in a separate reservoir, and, if re-infusion into the CPB circuit is required, this is performed only after selective filtering and by cell saver procedures. Moreover, by using a vacuum-assisted system for blood aspiration, EVADO allows complete elimination of roller pumps, therefore reducing the extent of mechanical cellular trauma. EVADO contains a phosphorylcholine-coated oxygenator, that confers superior biocompatibility. Finally, by requiring relatively limited priming volumes, it allows reducing haemodilution.</description>
