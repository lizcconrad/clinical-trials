      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe and effective the combination of two
      different drugs (brentuximab vedotin and rituximab) is in patients with certain types of
      lymphoma. This study is for patients who have a type of lymphoma that expresses a tumor
      marker called CD30 and/or a type that is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-related
      lymphoma) and who have not yet received any treatment for their cancer, except for
      dose-reduction or discontinuation (stoppage) of medications used to prevent rejection of
      transplanted organs (for those patients who have undergone transplantation). This study is
      investigating the combination of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab as a first treatment for
      lymphoma patients

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab in patients with lymphoid
      malignancies that are cluster of differentiation (CD) 30 positive (+) and/or Epstein-Barr
      virus (EBV)+, and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination. (Phase
      I) II. To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by response rates, of brentuximab vedotin and
      rituximab in patients with lymphoid malignancies that are CD30+ and/or EBV+. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicity. (Phase II) II. To further
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab, as
      measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at one year after the
      end of treatment. (Phase II) III. To determine the effects of the combination of brentuximab
      vedotin and rituximab on markers of EBV activation and proliferation. (Phase II) IV. Further
      evaluate efficacy as measured by time to cytotoxic chemotherapy. (Phase II) V. Further
      evaluate efficacy as measured by observed rates of graft rejection. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether and to what extent CD30 expression predicts for response and outcome.

      II. To determine whether and to what extent expression of EBV markers predicts for response
      and outcome.

      III. To determine whether changes in serum levels of EBV correlate with response and
      subsequent loss of response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase
      II study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once
      weekly for 3 weeks and rituximab IV once weekly for 4 weeks. Patients unable to achieve
      complete remission (CR) may receive additional optional consolidation therapy identical to
      induction therapy.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV once every 3 weeks and rituximab
      IV once every 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed CD30+ and/or EBV+ lymphoid malignancy; in addition, there

          -  In cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) arising in patients
             who are pharmacologically immunosuppressed, reduction of immunosuppression (RI) must
             be attempted prior to or in conjunction with enrollment, with the exception of those
             for whom RI would pose excessive threat of clinically significant graft rejection (as
             judged by local investigator)

          -  No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for PTLD or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
             (DLBCL), with the exception of corticosteroids for 10 or fewer days at any dose (no
             washout period required)

          -  No prior surgical intervention, unless performed for the sake of tissue diagnosis or
             on an urgent basis for disease-related threat to life, limb, or organ function

          -  Bi-dimensionally measurable disease (at least 1 cm)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 750/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 50,000/mcl

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum pyruvate glutamate transaminase [SPGT])
             =&lt; 3 X institutional ULN

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 2 X institutional ULN

          -  NOTE: Patients who do not meet the above criteria because of disease involvement of
             the organ in question, or because of acute systemic illness due to lymphoma, may
             enroll with permission of the study Principal Investigator (PI) and approval from the
             Data Monitoring Committee; this flexibility be allowed due to the heterogeneity of the
             patient population, the wide range of complications seen in the initial presentation
             of EBV-related malignancy, and the frequent difficulty encountered in attempting to
             clearly document that organ dysfunction is the result of an underlying
             lymphoproliferative disorder

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy;
             should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months)

          -  Patients must be free of any prior malignancies for &gt;= 1 year; NOTE: the exception to
             this would be currently treated squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or bladder, or surgically removed melanoma in
             situ of the skin (stage 0) with histologically confirmed free margins of excision; in
             addition, it is well-recognized that patients at highest risk for EBV-related lymphoma
             (ie, those with chronic immunosuppression) are also at high risk for various
             malignancies, both invasive and non-invasive; therefore, exceptions may also be
             granted on a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the PI with approval from the
             Data Monitoring Committee, for those patients with good clinical control of active
             malignancy, if the EBV-related lymphoma is considered to be a more immediate threat to
             the subject's health and/or life

             patients must have signed, witnessed informed consent prior to registration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy (including monoclonal antibodies) or radiotherapy, administered for any
             condition, within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or incomplete recovery from
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier
