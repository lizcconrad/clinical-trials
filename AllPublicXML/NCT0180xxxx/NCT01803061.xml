  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-reported information on outcomes such as symptom-burden and health-related quality of
      life (QoL) is regarded as a useful tool to improve quality of care in clinical cancer
      research. However, integrating patient-reported information in the routine clinical practice
      is often difficult due to excessive time use and practical barriers. Electronic data
      acquisitions, where the treating physician has immediately access to the patient-reported
      data in the subsequent consultation, have been shown to be beneficial in the everyday
      clinical decision making.

      The aim of this study is to develop and test a computer-based patient-reported assessment
      tool that will assist the clinicians in tracking long term and late effects in head and neck
      cancer patients and investigate if the tool leads to improved symptom assessment of a range
      of head and neck cancer specific symptoms, which again may lead to improved symptom control
      and enhanced quality of life in the patients.

      Patients with a diagnosis of head and neck cancer attending the oncology outpatient clinics
      at Herlev Hospital and physicians and nurses who work at the clinic will be invited to
      participate. The assessment tool will be developed with inspiration from prior international
      studies of symptom assessment in head and neck cancer patients and tailored so that it will
      fit into a Danish context. The tool will be tested in a controlled intervention study. In the
      intervention group, patients will complete the assessment tool in the patients waiting area
      prior to every scheduled consultation. The result will then be printed and provided to the
      treating physician. In the control group, the patients will complete the assessment tool
      prior to consultations. However, the data will not be provided to the physicians at any time.

      To assess the impact of the tool on number of symptoms addressed during consultations and
      patients' overall quality of life, medical records will be reviewed for before start of
      intervention and again at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The patients will also complete the
      EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 at baseline and at 6 and 12 months follow-up.
      Furthermore, we will conduct a qualitative evaluation (semi structured interview and
      participant observations) of attitudes among clinicians and patients regarding the use of
      tool at the point of care.
