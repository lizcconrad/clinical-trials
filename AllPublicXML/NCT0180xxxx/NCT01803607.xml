  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess to what extent sequential treatment with odanacatib
      results in incremental gains in bone mineral density (BMD) over time in female participants
      who have received at least 3 years of bisphosphonate therapy. It was hypothesized that
      odanacatib treatment would increase femoral neck BMD relative to placebo after 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) without a history of a prior
             fragility fracture. For participants with a history of a prior fragility fracture
             (except hip fracture), BMD T-score can be ≤-1.5 and &gt;-3.5 at any hip site.

             cathepsin K inhibitors; RANK ligand inhibitors; fluoride treatment at a dose greater
             than 1 mg/day for more than 2 weeks.

          -  Use of following medications within the 6 months prior to the screening visit:
             activated vitamin D; estrogen, with or without progestin, at a dose high enough to
             have systemic effects; raloxifene or other selective estrogen receptor modulator
             (SERM), tibolone or any aromatase inhibitor; sub-cutaneous calcitonin (Note: use of
             intranasal calcitonin is allowed at any time); anabolic steroid; PTH (1-34 or 1-84);
             growth hormone; systemic glucocorticoids (≥5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for
             more than 2 weeks; cyclosporine for more than 2 weeks.

          -  Concurrent use of cancer chemotherapy or heparin; protease inhibitors for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment; and vitamin A (excluding beta carotene)
             &gt;10,000 IU daily, unless willing to discontinue this dose during the study.

          -  Current treatment with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers or treatment with CYP3A4
             inducer within 4 weeks of screening.
