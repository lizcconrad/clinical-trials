    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility (ability to be done) of experimental
      technologies to determine a tumor's molecular makeup (gene expression profile) and mutations.
      This technology called the &quot;Pediatric Gene Analysis Platform&quot; includes a genomic report (gene
      expression profile) and a DNA Mutation Panel Report that are being used to discover new ways
      to understand cancers and potentially predict the best treatments for patients with cancer in
      the future.

    <description>A total of 48 neuroblastoma, brain tumor, and rare tumor patients who are refractory or relapsed on conventional therapy will be treated. Guided therapy will allow the use of any therapeutic combination (up to 4 agents) provided it includes medications contained in the study report. All patients will be followed for survival, disease response, progression and safety. All patients will be treated according to the discretion of the treating oncologist and study committee (minimum 3 oncologists and one pharmacist). Extent of disease will be measured and assessed for changes throughout the course of the study and at 6-8 week intervals (every 2 cycles).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have histologically proven neuroblastoma, brain tumor, or rare tumor and
             confirmation of refractory or recurrent disease with histologic confirmation at
             diagnosis or at the time of recurrence/progression

          -  Subjects must be age &gt;12 months at enrollment.

          -  Subjects must be age ≤ 21 years at initial diagnosis.

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease as demonstrated by residual abnormal tissue at a
             primary or metastatic site measuring more than 1 cm in any dimension by standardized
             imaging (CT or MRI); tumor must be accessible for biopsy. Patients with bone marrow
             only disease expected to be &gt;75% tumor are eligible to enroll.

             therapy

          -  Lansky or Karnofsky Score must be more than 50

          -  Adequate liver function must be demonstrated, defined as:

               1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age AND

             used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended.

          -  Informed Consent: All subjects and/or legal guardians must sign informed written
             consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional

             14 days (radiation may be included in treatment decision after biopsy).

             illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with
             the interpretation of the results or which would interfere with a subject's ability to
             sign or the legal guardian's ability to sign the informed consent, and subject's
             ability to cooperate and participate in the study
