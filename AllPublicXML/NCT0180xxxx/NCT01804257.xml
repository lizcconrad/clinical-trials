      Feasibility study of using a digital health feedback system (DHFS) to monitor
      medication-taking and physiologic and behavioral parameters in patients with bipolar disorder
      or schizophrenia. Hypothesis: Using a digital health feedback system to characterize
      medication-taking behavior and activities of daily living is safe and tolerable in
      appropriately selected patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this 4-week observational study conducted between May 2010 and May 2011 at 2 US academic
      clinical study sites, 12 adults with bipolar disorder and 16 adults with schizophrenia (all
      diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria) utilized a digital health feedback system (DHFS). All
      subjects were on a stable regimen of oral medication. The DHFS utilized a digital tablet,
      consisting of an ingestion sensor that was embedded in a tablet containing nonpharmacologic
      excipients, which subjects coingested with their regularly prescribed medication.

      The primary study objective was to compare the accuracy of DHFS in confirming digital tablet
      ingestion versus a method of directly observed ingestion; secondary aims included
      characterization of adherence and physiologic measures longitudinally in these cohorts.

Scheduling adherence defined as number of ingestion sensors detected by the DHFS within a ± 2-hour time window around the prescribed (planned) dosing time, divided by the total number of ingestion sensors detected by the DHFS.</description>
