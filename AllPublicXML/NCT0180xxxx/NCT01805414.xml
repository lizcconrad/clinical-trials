  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A standard hospital meal often contains a high percentage of carbohydrates (CHO), which may
      not be ideal for patients with diabetes. This concern is particularly pertinent to the
      breakfast meal, which often contains mainly CHO. Clinical observations suggested that such
      diets elevate pre-lunch blood glucose (BG) values. The study team compared standard hospital
      &quot;no concentrated sweets (NCS)&quot; breakfast meals with more balanced meals. The study team
      hypothesized that a balanced breakfast would improve pre-lunch BG values.

      This 8-week pilot study was conducted at Duke Hospital on two non-ICU cardiology wards. Ward
      A consisted mainly of patients with a primary diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).
      Ward B consisted mainly of patients with a primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure
      (CHF). The intervention breakfast menu included 5 choices containing 40-45g of CHO. All
      patients on Ward A (with and without diabetes) were given the intervention breakfast for the
      first 4 weeks of the study, while those on Ward B received standard menus (60-75g CHO in NCS
      meals). After 4 weeks, the standard and intervention wards were switched. Data were collected
      only on patients with diabetes who were able to consume meals.

    <time_frame>Pre-breakfast to pre-lunch, approximately 4 hours, daily for the study duration of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the relative change between the pre-breakfast and pre-lunch blood glucose levels after the intervention breakfast. The hypothesis is that the intervention breakfast will lead to lower pre-lunch blood sugars.
Blood glucoses will be measured before breakfast and lunch on eligible patients. This will occur every day for the duration of the study (8 weeks).
The relative change between the pre-breakfast and pre-lunch blood glucose will be assessed by BG2 (pre-lunch) minus BG1 (pre-breakfast).</description>
