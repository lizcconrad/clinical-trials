      treatment modalities in pediatric urinary lithiasis.

    <textblock>
      Between March 2008 and February 2012, 81 patients were randomized and included in this study.
      Shock wave lithotripsy was performed by using a Dornier Compact Delta instrument.
      Localizations of radiopaque and non-opaque stones were estimated by using flouroscopy and
      ultrasonography, respectively. Treatment energy was set on 13 kV in the conventional group.
      In the stepwise group, treatment energy was initially set on 10 kV and gradually increased up
      to 13 kV per 250 shocks. The maximum numbers of shocks in both groups were limited to 3000.
      Patients were followed up with 15 days interval. In each visit, patients were respectively
      questioned for pain, hematuria and history of stone passage. In case of treatment failure,
      shock wave lithotripsy was repeated.

    <description>The stone burden was defined as the stone area that was calculated by multiplying the largest length(cm)and width (cm)of the individual stones measured from the abdominal plain X-ray. To detect fragmentation of the stone and necessity of re-treatment a plain film were used during control. Stone clearance was assessed at three months. Stone-free state was defined as the absence of stone fragments on a good quality plain X-ray. Clinical success was considered if the residual fragments were 2-3 mm or less in asymptomatic patients.</description>

    <description>All procedures were performed under continu¬ous intravenous sedo-analgesia (using a combi-nation of ketamine 1 mg/kg and propofol 0,5-1 mg/kg) with fluoroscopic or ultrasonograpic imaging in a supine position. Shock wave number was limited to a maximum of 3000 waves/session. In the conventional group the voltage was only 13 kV. The stone burden was defined as the stone area that was calculated by multiply¬ing the largest length and width of the individual stones measured from the abdominal plain X-ray.</description>
