  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is clinically characterized by irreversible dilation of the bronchi and
      bronchioles leading to persistent cough, purulent sputum, and airway ﬂow limitation, which
      may be accompanied by recurrent exacerbations.It has been increasingly recognized that
      respiratory viruses are mainly responsible for acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary
      diseases, i.e. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis.
      However,little is known about the roles of viral infection in driving exacerbations of
      bronchiectasis.This study aims to identify the frequency of common viral infections and
      determine the roles that viruses play in acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterised by a vicious cycle of persistent
      bacterial colonization,inflammation and progressive tissue destruction.Patients with
      bronchiectasis frequently developed acute exacerbations characterised by acute worsening
      requiring changes in concomitant use of medication,with attendant adverse effects on their
      morbidity and health-related quality of life. The detailed pathogenesis of exacerbations of
      bronchiectasis, however, remains poorly understood.

      Recent data suggested that airway infection and inflammation are important drivers of
      exacerbations,therefore the imbalance between chronic bacterial infection and host immune
      response may result in bronchiectasis exacerbations. Viral infection may be an important
      factor that leads to this events.It has been established that respiratory viruses are mainly
      responsible for the exacerbations of other chronic respiratory diseases, i.e. asthma, COPD
      and cystic fibosis. However, the data regarding prospective studies that sought to
      investigate the roles of viruses in acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis are lacking.
      Furthermore,the associations between viruses and bacteria during exacerbation need to be
      assessed. This study targets at indentifying the frenquency of common viral infections in
      adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and may shed light on the effects they have on
      clinical parameters,i.e. the length of exacerbated symptom to recovery,lung function,
      pulmonary inflammation, bacterial load and quality of life.

A total of at least 3 (not more than 8) spirometric maneuvers are performed, with the variation between the best two maneuvers of &lt;5% or 200ml in FVC and FEV1.
