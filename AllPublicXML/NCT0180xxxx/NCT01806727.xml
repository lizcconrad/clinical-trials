      This study is evaluating two approaches to improving the control blood sugar, and other risk
      factors for heart disease in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes. The first
      approach has participants focus on weight loss via reducing food intake and increasing
      physical activity, while attending weekly group sessions led by trained community health
      workers for 12 months. The second approach has participants receive education on diabetes
      self management, which focuses primarily on glucose control, while attending monthly group
      sessions led by a study staff member for 12 months. We are recruiting persons with type 2
      diabetes who live in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area of North Carolina who are willing
      to attend sessions at the Downtown Health Plaza of Wake Forest Baptist Health. We will
      measure risk factors for heart disease (glucose control, blood pressure, blood cholesterol)
      and calculate the predicted risk of heart disease, and see which intervention lowers risk to
      a greater extent at 12 months, as well as 24 months.

      The Look AHEAD trial has demonstrated improved risk factor control among overweight or obese
      diabetes patients who received an intensive lifestyle intervention at both one and four years
      after enrollment. Translating such findings into accessible and effective weight loss
      programs is a major public health challenge. We are conducting &quot;Lifestyle Interventions for
      Treatment of Diabetes&quot; (LIFT Diabetes). The overall goal is to investigate two approaches to
      improving risk factor control; one which is modeled after Look AHEAD and is designed to
      achieve 7% weight loss and increase physical activity to &gt; 175 minutes per week among
      minority and lower income diabetes patients via a 12-month, group based lifestyle
      intervention, using community health workers supervised by an interventionist. Participants
      will have up to 4 group visits/month and up to 12 individual contacts/year. The other
      approach will promote Diabetes Self Management (DSM) by educating participants regarding
      health behaviors which lead to improved diabetes control; this arm is also 12 months, and is
      delivered in the clinic by intervention staff via monthly group visits and up to 12
      individual contacts/year. We will randomize 260 overweight or obese adults with diabetes to
      either intervention, and determine the impact on outcomes (UKPDS-estimated CVD risk, risk
      factor control), weight, cost, resource utilization, and safety at 12 months, and after
      transitioning back to usual care, at 24 months. The hypotheses are that the community based
      intervention results in 10% relative reduction in CVD risk compared to clinic-based
      intervention; the interventions are equivalent with respect to adherence and participant
      satisfaction; and the community based intervention is associated with lower cost than the
      clinic based intervention. Translating evidence based, lifestyle strategies, and targeting
      minority and underserved patients, will yield, if successful, models for addressing
      diabetes-related health disparities.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 21 years of age and older residing in the Forsyth County, North Carolina
             region.

          -  Disease: Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

          -  Overweight or obese: defined as body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m2 (&gt;27 if on
             insulin).

          -  If not on diabetes medication, persons with hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to
             6.5% and less than 11.0%

          -  If on diabetes medication, hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 5.0% and less than
             11.0%

          -  Blood pressure: BP â‰¤ 160/100 mmHg.

          -  A usual source of medical care: The intervention may induce hypoglycemia and have
             other risks, and weight loss and increased physical activity may modify the need for
             drugs used to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, and lipids. Patients must have a
             source for ongoing care. Usual source of care will be documented via a &quot;medical
             clearance&quot; form with physician signature verifying that MD is aware their patient is
             participating in this trial.

          -  Able to exercise: Increasing moderate intensity physical activity is an integral part
             of this intervention. Must be able to walk 1/4 mile without assistance.

          -  Able to communicate in English

          -  Other: Willing to give consent to participate in this research program, including
             random allocation to either study arm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes: defined by hemoglobin A1c&gt;11%

          -  Cardiovascular disease: Clinical history of cardiovascular disease, or newly diagnosed
             at screening. This includes myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic heart
             disease, stroke and other vascular disease. Persons suspected of having angina (chest
             pain) or other potentially ischemic symptoms will be required to be evaluated by their
             health care provider.

          -  Weight Loss: Currently involved in a supervised medical or surgical weight loss
             program or with a history of prior weight loss surgery.

          -  Age: We will exclude children (&lt;21 years)

          -  Pregnancy: Diabetes during pregnancy has specific management criteria, and the role of
             weight loss via caloric restriction and increased physical activity is of uncertain
             efficacy and safety. Among women of child-bearing potential, planning to become
             pregnant within 12 months will be an exclusion criteria. Women who have recently given
             birth and are breast feeding are also excluded

          -  Serious Illness with anticipated decreased life expectancy during the 2 year (24
             month) time frame of the intervention, such as cancer diagnosis or treatment within
             the past 5 years (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer).

          -  Inability to exercise: Patients who are wheel chair bound, have had an amputation, are
             undergoing treatment for lower extremity infections, or who self report being unable
             to ambulate 400 meters (1/4 mile) without assistance.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial involving intervention(s) which affect any
             component of cardiovascular risk. Potential participants who are enrolled in purely
             observational studies remain eligible.

          -  Renal disease: Persons with stage 3 chronic renal disease (estimated glomerular
             filtration rate &lt;60ml/min by the chronic kidney disease formula used by Wake Forest
             Baptist) will be excluded.

          -  Other: Conditions/criteria likely to interfere with participation and acceptance of
             randomized assignment, including the following: inability/unwillingness to give
             informed consent, major psychiatric or cognitive problems (schizophrenia, dementia),
             self-reported active illegal substance or alcohol abuse, and clinical judgment.
