      This study is an open-label, single arm, phase II study of chlorambucil in subjects with
      previously untreated CLL.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the response to chlorambucil in Japanese subjects with
      previously untreated CLL.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of chlorambucil in
      Japanese subjects.

      Chlorambucil is an effective and well-tolerated chemotherapeutic agent currently approved for
      treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the United States of America (US),
      European Union (EU) and other countries globally but not in Japan. Other more aggressive
      treatment options such as a combination of fludarabine (F) and cyclophosphamide are
      available, but are associated with significantly greater toxicities. The addition of
      ofatumumab to chlorambucil offers potentially a more effective therapy, with limited
      additional toxicity.

      Study OMB110911 has been conducted mainly in the US and EU to evaluate progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall response (OR) in subjects with previously untreated CLL with
      ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil versus (vs.) chlorambucil monotherapy.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate overall response of chlorambucil in Japanese
      subjects with previously untreated CLL.

After completion of the Treatment Phase (for participants in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status assessment visits were performed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 days, and 168 days after the day of FU 1 (FU 85 and FU 169, respectively). For participants experiencing disease progression during the Treatment Phase, the post progressive disease (PD) follow-up for safety assessments were performed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU 1).

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by the Investigator and the IRC</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment of investigational product until the first documented sign of PD or death due to any cause. PD requires at least one of the following: lymphadenopathy, appearance of any new lesion such as enlargerd lymph nodes (&gt;1.5 cm) spleen or liver or other infiltrates or an increase by 50% or more in the greatest diameter of any previous site; an increase by 50% or more in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen, an increase by 50% or more in the numbers of blood lymphocytes with at least 5000 lymphocytes per microliter, transformation to a more aggressive histology, or occurrence of cytopenia attributable to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Par. who were alive and had not progressed at the time of analysis or if a progression event or death occurred after extensive lost-to-follow-up time or if new anti-cancer therapy was started were censored at the date of the last visit with adequate assessment.</description>

        <description>ECOG PS is a scale to assess disease progression, extent to which disease affects the daily living abilities and determines appropriate treatment and prognosis. It is scored on a scale of 0 to 5 as, 0 (fully active), 1 (restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature), 2 (ambulatory and capable of all self cares but unable to carry out any work activities, Up and about &gt; 50% of waking hours), 3 (capable of only limited self cares, confined to bed or chair &gt; 50% of waking hours), 4 (completely disabled, cannot carry on any self cares, totally confined to bed or chair), 5 (death). Improvement is defined as decrease from baseline by at least one step on the ECOG performance status scale (yes/no). Baseline was last pre-dose assessment performed on Cycle 1 Day 1(C1 D1). When C1 D1 was missing, the last assessment performed prior to pre-dose C1 D1 was used. It was performed on Day 1 of each cycle and follow-up (FU).</description>

After completion of the Treatment Phase (for participants in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status assessment visits were performed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 days, and 168 days after the day of FU 1 (FU 85 and FU 169, respectively). For participants experiencing disease progression during the Treatment Phase, the post progressive disease (PD) follow-up for safety assessments were performed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU 1). Subsequent follow-up was performed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU 1 (PDFU 85 and PDFU 169, respectively) to assess survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy.

        <description>Immunoglobulins, or antibodies, are large proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses. Their normal blood levels indicate proper immune status. Low levels indicate immuno-suppression. IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured in the blood samples of the participants.Peripheral samples were collected for the analysis of IgA, IgG, and IgM at Baseline and 28 days after Day 1 of the last treatment cycle (FU 1-PDFU 1) for all participants, and 168 days after day of FU 1-PDFU 1 for participants with CR, PR, and SD. Baseline was the last pre-dose assessment performed on Cycle 1-Day 1. The the last assessment performed prior to pre-dose Cycle 1-Day 1 was used if Cycle 1-Day 1 was missing. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of chlorambucil were collected on Day 1 and Day 4 in Cycle 1, and on Day 1 in Cycle 3. In each sampling, blood samples (2 milliliter [mL]/sample) were collected at pre-dose, and 15 minute (min), 30 min, 1 hour (hr), 1.5 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, and 10 hr post dosing. Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), minimum serum concentration (Cmin) were determined. Between participants coefficient of variation (%CVb) was calculated according to the following methods: Transformed Data : 100 * (square root of the exponential [standard deviation of loge-transformed ]2-1).</description>

After completion of the Treatment Phase (for participants in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status assessment visits were performed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 days, and 168 days after the day of FU 1 (FU 85 and FU 169, respectively). For participants experiencing disease progression during the Treatment Phase, the post progressive disease (PD) follow-up for safety assessments were performed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU 1). Subsequent follow-up was performed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU 1 (PDFU 85 and PDFU 169, respectively) to assess survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy.
