  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate a new treatment strategy for advanced pancreatic
      cancer disease by combining the new investigational medicinal product Atu027 with the
      standard chemotherapeutic gemcitabine. This combination aims at enhancing gemcitabine´s
      anti-tumor activity with Atu027.

      The objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate safety and activity of two Atu027
      schedules in combination with standard gemcitabine treatment in patients with advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
