      The purpose of the study is to evaluate an afterschool program to teach nutrition through
      basic cooking skills. This after school extracurricular program increases the students'
      confidence, knowledge, and skills for cooking as one of the first steps for dietary
      improvement. In addition to the life lessons students learn during this class, they gain
      self-confidence and become self-sufficient culinary experts that are capable of educating
      their siblings, parents, and social circles. This research project will test the impact this
      program has on nutritional knowledge, culinary efficacy, and nutritional choices made in and
      out of the home. The Pink and Dude Chef Afterschool Cooking Program was developed through
      STRIDE (Science through Translational Research in Diet and Exercise at California Polytechnic
      state University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, CA.

      Hypothesis: Middle school students participating in the Pink and Dude Chef afterschool
      cooking program will increase nutritional knowledge, culinary efficacy, motivation to eat
      fruits and vegetables, and fruit and vegetable intake compared to an attention control group.
