  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to test whether Internet-based relapse prevention plus
      medication has a better protective effect compared to medication only, for persons with
      residual depressive symptoms who are currently in paid employment or in education. We
      hypothesise that during the two years following the intervention:

        -  The persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention plus medication
           will be absent from work for fewer days due to sick-leave compared to those in the
           medication-only group.

        -  Fewer persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention + medication will
           experience long term sick-leave (60 days or more) compared to those in the
           medication-only group.

        -  The persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention plus medication
           will suffer fewer depressive relapses compared to those in the medication-only group.

        -  At follow-up, the persons in the group receiving Internet-based relapse prevention plus
           medication will have higher health related quality of life and lower levels of
           depressive symptoms compared to those in the medication-only group.
