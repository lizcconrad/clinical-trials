  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt)
      inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients with previously treated colon or rectal cancer
      that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body or nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes and cannot be removed by surgery. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate to MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206), defined as complete
      response (CR) + partial response (PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response rate to MK-2206 in patients with phosphatase and tensin homolog
      (PTEN) loss or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PIK3CA) mutation in a pretreatment biopsy from a metastatic site.

      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). III. To determine
      the time to treatment failure (TTF), and duration of tumor response (DR).

      IV. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in this patient
      population.

      V. To determine effect of PTEN, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF),
      PIK3CA, and AKT mutations and semi-quantitative grading of PTEN expression on clinical
      response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR): Disappearance all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): &gt; 30% decrease in sum diameters of target lesions, reference baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): &gt; 20% increase in sum diameters of target lesions, reference smallest sum on study (includes baseline sum if smallest on study). In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must demonstrate absolute increase of &gt;5 mm. (Note: appearance of 1/&gt; new lesions also considered progressions). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, reference smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

        <description>Complete Response (CR): Disappearance all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): &gt; 30% decrease in sum diameters of target lesions, reference baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): &gt; 20% increase in sum diameters of target lesions, reference smallest sum on study (includes baseline sum if smallest on study). In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must demonstrate absolute increase of &gt;5 mm. (Note: appearance of 1/&gt; new lesions also considered progressions). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, reference smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
