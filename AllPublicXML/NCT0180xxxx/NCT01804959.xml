  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SSc-associated gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is common, with no effective treatment.
      Probiotics may have beneficial effects on symptoms as supported by one small open-label study
      (n=10) that demonstrated decreased bloating symptoms in SSc patients after 2 months of
      probiotics. This study aims to determine (i) whether 60 days of Vivomixx probiotics result in
      greater GI symptom improvement than placebo in SSc outpatients, assessed using an
      interview-administered 34-item Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) questionnaire and (ii) whether 60
      days versus 120 days of probiotics result in greater GI symptom improvement in SSc
      outpatients, assessed using the GIT questionnaire.
