  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed study is to insure the protection and safety of human
      subjects who have been previously exposed to interpersonal traumatic events and who are
      participants in symptom provocation research. The investigators intend to examine trauma
      history, cognitive, interpersonal, and genetic predictors of participants' unfavorable
      reaction to participation in research involving trauma-related script-driven imagery (SDI).
      The design includes comparing participants in a consent as usual group to participants in an
      enhanced consent group to see which minimizes unfavorable effects of participating in a
      research provocation study. In addition, the two different consent groups will be assessed
      for their effects on psychobiological and neurobiological stress response. Furthermore, the
      investigators will examine the relationship between the psychobiological responses and neural
      mechanism during SDI, and unfavorable reactions to participation in symptom provocation
      research.

      reaction to participation in research involving trauma-related script-driven imagery (SDI).
      The design includes comparing participants with and without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD) in a consent as usual group to participants in an enhanced consent group to see which
      group minimizes unfavorable effects of participating in a research provocation study. In
      addition, the two different consent groups will be assessed for their effects on
      psychobiological and neurobiological stress response. Furthermore, the investigators will
      examine the relationship between the psychobiological responses and neural mechanism during
      SDI, and unfavorable reactions to participation in symptom provocation research.
