      The investigators will conduct a voluntary anonymous survey at four separate Sacramento area
      family planning clinics. The investigators will ask the staff at each facility to offer a
      survey to all women 18 and older presenting to the clinic to have a first trimester (&lt;12
      weeks gestation) surgical abortion. Gestational age will be based on what the woman believes
      is her gestational age at presentation, before any evaluation in the clinic. Women who cannot
      understand or read the survey will be excluded. The investigators hope to implement the
      survey at these clinics for 3-4 months reaching a minimum of 200 women (based on a target
      population of 600 women receiving surgical first trimester abortions at these two clinics
      over a 3-4 month period with a 95% confidence interval).

      We will conduct a voluntary anonymous survey at four separate Sacramento area family planning
      clinics. We will introduce the research project to clinic staff, recruiting their support and
      participation, as they will be the main implementers. The survey will be offered to women in
      the waiting room before any pre-procedure counseling. We will include all women presenting to
      the clinic who are 18 years and older and planning to have a first trimester (&lt;12 weeks
      gestation) surgical abortion. Gestational age will be based on what the woman believes is her
      gestational age at presentation, before any evaluation in the clinic. Women who cannot
      understand or read the survey will be excluded. We hope to implement the survey at these two
      clinics for 3-4 months reaching a minimum of 200 women so as to obtain an adequate power for
      our study. The brief survey will include a cover letter explaining the study and stressing
      the anonymity and confidentiality. The surveys will include an envelope in which to place
      completed surveys; the envelope can be sealed by the participant and dropped in a collection
      bin. This process will allow the data to be collected anonymously. The survey data will then
      be synthesized first by descriptive analysis, followed by chi-square and multiple regression
      analyses. A statistician in the University of California Davis Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology will help when necessary.
