  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to surgery, gynecologists and urogynecologists have routinely prescribed preoperative
      mechanical bowel preparations in attempts to decrease the risk of infection, while also
      providing easier bowel manipulation and better visualization during surgery. However, many of
      these proposed benefits have never been proven, and usage of bowel preparations amongst
      surgeons remains highly variable. In both the general surgery and gynecology literature,
      researchers have begun to question the need for the vigorous preparations.

      Aside from surgical visualization, urogynecologists have additional concerns about how bowel
      preparations may impact postoperative bowel function given up to half of women with pelvic
      floor disorders have baseline constipation and straining is known to impact surgical
      recovery. Many studies have addressed various postoperative fiber and laxative preparations
      in attempts to improve postoperative bowel-related symptomatology, but none have specifically
      looked at preoperative bowel preparations.

      This study aims to determine if mechanical bowel preparation prior to minimally invasive
      sacral colpopexy affects patients' postoperative recovery, specifically related to bowel
      symptomatology; operative or post-operative complications; surgeons' perceptions of surgical
      difficulty directly attributed to the bowel; and post-operative return of normal bowel
      function.

    <description>Bowel symptomatology and bowel-related discomfort will be assessed with the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire (PAC-SYM), a 12-item questionnaire covering three domains: abdominal, rectal, and stool.</description>

    <measure>Surgeon perception of bowel preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after completing the surgical case, surgeons will complete a 13-item surgeon questionnaire assessing degree of surgical difficulty and how it relates to the bowel. Operative time and consultations will also be recorded as objective measures of surgical difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Return of normal bowel function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A seven-day bowel diary will be obtained at baseline and in the first week after surgery. This log will include daily assessment of bowel frequency, type of bowel movement using the validated Bristol stool scale, degree of straining, and used of narcotics or laxatives.</description>
