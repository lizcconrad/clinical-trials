      HaploSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen will be performed in patients
      with high-risk solid tumors. Both parents will be evaluated for their KIR genotype and
      phenotype and the one with the greatest degree of KIR-L mismatch with the patient will be
      selected as the donor. In addition, ex-vivo expanded NK cells derived from the donor will
      then be administered after haploSCT to increase the GVT effect. Low-dose IL-2 will be given
      after expanded NK cell infusion to enhance NK cell alloreactivity.
