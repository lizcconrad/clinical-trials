  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The third generation oral aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are increasingly being used in the
      management of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. One of the issues related with
      administration of oral AIs is their side effects, particularly on the musculoskeletal system.
      Although the prevalence and importance of arthralgia and myalgia occurring in BC patients
      receiving adjuvant AIs are evident, the mechanisms clearly explaining these invalidating
      symptoms are unknown.

      In this project, we aim to unravel the interaction between vitamin D and musculoskeletal
      adverse events experienced by AI users. We will also evaluate how vitamin D supplementation
      affects AI-induced musculoskeletal symptoms in breast cancer patients, by means of a
      randomized placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial. We will assess changes in the
      musculoskeletal system by using magnetic resonance imaging of joints, hand grip strength and
      also monitor serum IGF-I and estrogen levels together with bone resorption and formation
      markers.
