  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to find out about the effects of this drug in women with
      metastatic breast cancer. The study has two major parts; dose escalation and dose expansion.
      In the first part or dose escalation, subjects will be treated at the lowest dose effective
      in men: 300 mg two times daily. Orteronel (TAK-700) will be increased to reach the highest
      dose tolerated in men: 400 mg two times daily. This part of the study is designed to see if
      female subjects can safely tolerate orteronel (TAK-700), and to measure the changes in
      estrogens and androgens at different levels of TAK-700.

      In the second part of the study (dose expansion), seven women will be treated with the dose
      identified in the first part of the study as being safest and most effective. In this part of
      the study, the investigators want to see if orteronel (TAK-700) will routinely and
      significantly decrease the estrogen levels at the dose which will be used for any future
      studies.

          -  They have received treatment with orteronel or another lyase inhibitor in the past.
