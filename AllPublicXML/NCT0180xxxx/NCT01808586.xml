    <textblock>
      A) Background Chronic neck pain is a significant and common issue which is difficult to
      treat. Tight bands of muscle (trigger points) can be a source of chronic neck pain and they
      are sometimes injected to manage chronic neck pain. However, these injections seldom lead to
      significant, long-lasting relief. In some cases, these trigger points may originate from
      injury or damage to a specific joint in the neck (the facet joint). Treatment of this joint
      with cortisone injection may lead to improved pain relief and function.

      B) Hypothesis By injecting the facet joint with cortisone, the pain associated with tight
      bands of muscle in the neck and shoulders will be relieved to a greater extent than that
      attained through trigger point injection.

      C) Methods Patients with neck pain will have a test to determine if any pain originates from
      the facet joint. Among those who have significant pain from these joints, a comparison
      between the effect of cortisone injection into these joints versus injection into the trigger
      points will be evaluated.

      D) Expected Results and Significance

      It is expected that injection with cortisone into the facet joints will lead to improved pain
      and function when compared to that attained from trigger point injection. In addition, the
      number of trigger points, and the pain and headache that originate from these trigger points,
      are expected to decrease with cortisone injection into the facets to a statistically and
      clinically significant extent. Results from this pilot study will then influence the design
      of future trials into chronic neck pain treatment, leading to better clinical
      recommendations. A peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations will facilitate
      dissemination.
