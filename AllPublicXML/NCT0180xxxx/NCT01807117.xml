    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and PET-computed tomography (CT) as diagnostic imaging in patients with colon
      and/or rectal cancer. New diagnostic imaging procedures, such as PET-MRI, may help find and
      diagnose rectal cancer or recurrence of colorectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the diagnostic performance of PET- MRI in the staging of preoperative high-grade
      rectal cancer patients, defined by T3 stage or higher or N1 stage or higher or presence of
      metastasis, that are referred to PET-CT and MRI.

      II. To test the diagnostic performance of PET-MRI the follow up of colorectal cancer patients
      that are referred to PET-CT with or without a diagnostic MRI request by their physicians.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test different attenuation correction MR sequences and novel diagnostic MR sequences.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET-CT and PET-MRI.

          -  Either having a T3 (the cancer has grown through the muscularis propria and into the
             outermost layers of the colon or rectum but not through them) or higher, node
