  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients relapse and eventually die, particularly if they were
      initially diagnosed with large nodes involvement and/or T3/4 diseases. When analyses focus on
      patients with ER+/Her2-negative breast cancer, with ≥4N+, 30% had relapsed at 5 years,
      emphasizing the need for new drugs in this setting (PACS01 data, UNICANCER internal data).

      Strong evidence suggests that cross-talk between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and ER signaling is linked to hormone
      resistance in breast cancer patients.

      In the present study, we plan to evaluate the benefit from adding everolimus to standard
      endocrine treatments after three years of treatment for patient ER+/HER2- at high risk of
      relapse due to high nodes involvement (≥4) and/or persistent node involvement after
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Genomic signatures have emerged during the last 10 years as a new and additive means to
      evaluate more precisely long term prognosis, and in some instances the amount of benefit from
      chemotherapy or endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting. Therefore the UNIRAD study can be
      proposed to patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes at primary surgery and a high risk of
      relapse with the EndoPredict test.

      This study is a unique opportunity to prove the efficacy of everolimus in adjuvant setting.
      The study could be practice changing in case of positive results and could allow improving
      outcome of breast cancer patients presenting high risk of metastatic relapse.
