    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the absorption of a niacin metabolite
      (1-methylnicotinamide, 1-MNA) from TRIA-662 (1-methylnicotinamide chloride)relative to the
      production of 1-MNA from Niaspan. The 1-MNA information obtained from this study will be used
      to adjust the top dose of a planned TRIA-622 efficacy study.

          2. Body weight within 30% of ideal body weight.

          3. Healthy, according to the medical history, ECG, vital signs, laboratory results and
             physical examination as determined by the Principal Investigator/Sub-Investigator.

          4. Systolic blood pressure between 100-140 mmHg, inclusive, and diastolic blood pressure
             between 60-90 mmHg, inclusive, and heart rate between 50-100 bpm, inclusive, unless
             deemed otherwise by the Principal Investigator/Sub-Investigator.

        Main Exclusion Criteria

             known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the
             drug experienced within 7 days prior to first drug administration, as determined by
             the Principal Investigator/Sub-Investigator.

          5. Intolerance to and/or difficulty with blood sampling through venipuncture.

          6. Use of any prescription medication within 30 days prior to drug administration (except
             for hormonal contraceptives).

          7. Use of any over-the-counter medications or vitamins (including herbal and/or dietary
             supplements and/or teas) within 14 days prior to drug administration (except for
             spermicidal/barrier contraceptive products).

          8. Use of any statins (e.g. lovastatin, simvastatin), bile acid sequestrants (e.g.
