      Background The Institute of Medicine (IOM) published guidelines in 2009 for optimal
      gestational weight gain (GWG) during pregnancy. These guidelines include trajectories for
      optimal GWG, based on a woman's pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), to be used throughout
      the duration of a pregnancy. Although there is a significant association between the total
      GWG recommended by these guidelines and maternal and perinatal outcomes, research has
      demonstrated that only approximately one-third of pregnant women have total GWG within the
      recommended amounts. Factors known to influence GWG include maternal age, parity, being in a
      committed relationship and smoking. In addition, recommendations by primary care providers
      have been shown to influence actual GWG. Women appreciate advice from their primary care
      providers, however, despite this, there is evidence that many patients report not being
      advised at all about GWG by their primary care providers.

      Relevance Excess weight gain in pregnancy has been shown to be a modifiable risk factor for
      excess weight in childhood, thus contributing to the intergenerational cycle of obesity.
      There is an opportunity to interfere with this cycle during the peri-pregnancy period, as
      women's motivation to engage in behaviour change is elevated and contact with their primary
      care providers is frequent.

      Research Question and Hypothesis What impact does training family physicians to regularly
      refer to the IOM trajectories and provide feedback about GWG (&quot;training in the use of IOM
      charts&quot;) during routine prenatal visits, compared to usual care, have on congruence of total
      GWG with IOM guidelines? Null Hypothesis: there is no difference in the congruence of total
      GWG with IOM guidelines between women whose family physicians were assigned to training in
      the use of the IOM charts and those whose family physicians were assigned to usual care.

      Objectives

      The following are the objectives for this study:

        1. To compare the congruence of total GWG with IOM guidelines between women whose family
           physicians were assigned to training in the use of IOM trajectories and those whose
           family physicians were assigned to usual care.

        2. To explore the relationship between other independent variables (maternal age, parity,
           committed relationship and smoking) and congruence of total GWG with IOM guidelines, for
           women whose family physicians were assigned to training in the use of IOM trajectories
           and for those whose family physicians were assigned to usual care.
