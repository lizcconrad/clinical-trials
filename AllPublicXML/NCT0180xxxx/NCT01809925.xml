  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, 3-period crossover
      design study to evaluate the effects of psyllium 6.8 g provided as sugarfree Metamucil fiber
      supplement powder dissolved in water versus placebo on satiety measures in healthy
      volunteers. This study will be conducted at a single study site.

    <textblock>
      A total of 45 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Approximately equal numbers of men and
      women will be enrolled, with a race distribution consistent with the US population. Eligible
      subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 test product sequences at Test Period 1 (Visit
      2) using a block randomization. Subjects will participate in 3 test periods (Test Period 1,
      Visits 2-4; Test Period 2, Visits 5-7; and Test Period 3, Visits 8-10) and will receive test
      product once a day before breakfast for 3 days within each period. Test periods will be
      separated by a minimum 4-day washout period in which no test product will be administered.

    <measure>satiety (VAS Hunger 3-day average)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hours 0-4.5</time_frame>
    <description>VAS Hunger 3-day average. This endpoint will be calculated by averaging all evaluable post-breakfast scores across Days 1, 2, and 3. VAS Hunger is assessed on a horizontal 100-mm VAS anchored on the left by the phrase &quot;Not at all hungry&quot; (score = 0) and on the right by &quot;As hungry as I have ever felt&quot; (score = 100).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satiety Labeled Intensity Magnitude (SLIM) 3-day average</measure>
    <time_frame>Hours 0-4.5</time_frame>
    <description>SLIM 3-day average is calculated by averaging all evaluable post-breakfast scores across Days 1, 2, and 3. SLIM scale gauges perceived hunger/fullness following a meal using 11 phrases placed along a vertical line scale anchored at the bottom by &quot;Greatest imaginable hunger&quot; (score = -100) and at the top by &quot;Greatest imaginable fullness&quot; (score = 100).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS Desire to Eat 3-day average</measure>
    <time_frame>Hours 0-4.5</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS Desire to Eat 3-day average is calculated by averaging all evaluable post-breakfast scores across Days 1, 2, and 3. The VAS Desire to Eat Scale asks subjects to rate their desire to eat using a horizontal 100-mm VAS anchored on the left by the phrase &quot;No desire at all&quot; (score = 0) and on the right by &quot;As strong as I have ever felt&quot; (score = 100)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS Hunger 3-day average for hours 3.0 - 4.5</measure>
    <time_frame>Hours 3.0 - 4.5</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS Hunger 3-day average for hours 3.0 - 4.5 is calculated by averaging all evaluable post-breakfast scores for hours 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 across Days 1, 2, and 3. The VAS Desire to Eat Scale asks subjects to rate their desire to eat using a horizontal 100-mm VAS anchored on the left by the phrase &quot;No desire at all&quot; (score = 0) and on the right by &quot;As strong as I have ever felt&quot; (score = 100).</description>
