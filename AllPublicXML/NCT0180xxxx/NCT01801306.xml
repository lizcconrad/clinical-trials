    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of a new brain tissue probe for multi-parameter neuromonitoring
      (NeMo Probe) and the accuracy of measurement values.

      To demonstrate the ability of the NeMo probe to detect changes in cerebral hemodynamics and
      oxygenation during cerebrovascular events monitored with established methods including brain
      tissue oxygenation tension and microdialysis

    <time_frame>Day 90 after Removal of Medical Device</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility: User acceptance rate in comparison to conventional probes for ICP-monitoring. The following parameters will be analysed:
Incidence of concerns of users in relation to the installation of the NeMo System
Incidence of concerns of users in relation to the function of the NeMo System Incidence of concerns of users in relation to the removal of the NeMo System
User-friendliness with a 3-graded scale (equal, better, worse) compared to conventional probes for ICP monitoring Accuracy of measurement values: Results from repeated measurements of mttICG, CBV, and CBF.
Safety endpoints:
-Adverse events profile (including adverse device effects): Incidence of complications (infections, brain tissue damage, hemorrhage) in comparison to historical series (conventional probes for ICP-monitoring):</description>

    <time_frame>Day 90 after Removal of Medical Device</time_frame>
    <description>Results concerning the response to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) monitored with electrocorticography (ECoG):
Increase of brain tissue oxygenation (SbtO2), total hemoglobin (dHbtotal, aHbtotal), CBV, CBV Hb and CBF &gt;20% Decrease of SbtO2, dHbtotal, aHbtotal, CBV, CBV Hb and CBF &gt;20% Changes of SbtO2, dHbtotal, aHbtotal, CBV, CBV Hb and CBF &lt;20%
Results concerning the sensitivity and specificity to detect delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) monitored with ptiO2 and MD:
Correlation of CBF values &lt;15 ml/100g/min with defined criteria for DCI (ptiO2 &lt;15 mmHg, Gluc brain&lt;0.7 mmol/l, Lactate-Pyruvate-Ratio &gt;40), number of false negative and false positive events, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.</description>

    <description>The NeMo System is used for intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain temperature monitoring, as well as the determination of the brain tissue oxygenation saturation (SbtO2) and cerebral blood flow. The sensors for NIRS are implemented into a conventional brain tissue probe for ICP monitoring (NeMo Probe).</description>
