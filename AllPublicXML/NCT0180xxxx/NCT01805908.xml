    <textblock>
      The general objective of the study is to improve the care of women with Human Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2) positive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer by
      using a radio-labelled biomarker with whole body Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography
      (SPECT) imaging to predict who will respond to treatment with Trastuzumab.

    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>The imaging outcome for exploring the association between imaging and clinical outcome is the percent change in tumour SUV from baseline to Day 8 (Day 8 SUV - baseline SUV) /baseline SUV times 100%. The Positron Emission Tomography Evaluation Response Criteria In Solid Tumours (PERCIST) criterion will be used to measure SUV change.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetics of 111In-PmAb and tumour and normal tissue localization properties of 111In-PmAb will be measured. Standard PK parameters (t1/2 alpha, t1/2β, V1, Vss and CL) will be calculated.</description>

    <description>The imaging outcome for exploring the association between imaging and clinical outcome is the percent change in tumour SUV from baseline to Day 36 (Day 36 SUV - baseline SUV) /baseline SUV times 100%.
