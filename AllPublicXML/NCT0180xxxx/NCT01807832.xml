      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the capsaicin challenge can improve the
      diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and follow-up in patients with chronic cough.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicin is administrated in incremental concentrations with two inhalations of normal
      saline solution. Patients are instructed to exhale to functional residual capacity and than
      to inhale through the mouthpiece for 1 second (single breath inhalation). The number of
      coughs in the first 10 seconds after each inhalation is counted. C2; the concentration of
      which the patient responded by 2 coughs, C5;the concentration of which the patient responded
      by 5 coughs. The challenge ends at C5.
