  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed suction drains are commonly used following surgery, if the wound is expected to
      discharge significant amounts of fluid. To this date, no evidence base exists as to the exact
      post operative time period or discharge volume necessitating presence of a drain. In
      orthopedic common practice, drains are removed on the second post operative day, fearing the
      drain will serve as a point of entry for nosocomial infection. In this study, drains will be
      left in place as long as daily discharge volume exceeds 50cc, regardless of the amount of
      days following surgery. Daily cultures and antibiotic levels will be taken from the drains
      receptacle, to determine if and when the drains is colonized by aerobic bacteria.
