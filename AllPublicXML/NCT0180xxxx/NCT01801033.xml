      Background:

      - Hypothyroidism is a condition caused by the loss of function of the thyroid gland. The
      thyroid gland produces two hormones, T4 and T3. These hormones control the metabolism and
      function of many organs. Lack of energy, depression, and constipation are common symptoms of
      hypothyroidism. T4 is converted into T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, by two enzymes
      called deiodinases. People with hypothyroidism are treated with a synthetic T4 hormone, which
      the enzymes convert to T3. This treatment is usually effective, but some people continue to
      have symptoms even after treatment. Some researchers think that this may be caused by a
      problem with the enzymes that convert T4 into T3. They want to look at how the enzymes
      regulate the levels of T4 and T3 in the blood. They will do so by using a drug that blocks
      the action of one of the two enzymes.

      Objectives:

      - To look at how thyroid hormone enzyme blocking affects hypothyroidism treatment medication.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have hypothyroidism and are on thyroid hormone
      replacement therapy.

      Design:

        -  The study consists of one screening visit, 9 days of inpatient hospital admission, and a
           follow-up visit 2 weeks after discharge.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will
           provide blood samples.

        -  Participants will receive balanced-diet meals to take home for the 2 days before they
           enter the hospital. They will continue this diet while in the hospital.

        -  During the inpatient stay, participants will be monitored with regular blood tests. They
           will have the following procedures:

        -  Continued thyroid hormone replacement for all 9 days.

        -  Drug to block thyroid enzyme for 7 days.

        -  Metabolism test, with room temperature changes, on days 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.

        -  Measurements of body fat on days 2, 5, and 8.

        -  Blood glucose tests on days 1 and 9.

        -  Muscle contraction tests on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

        -  Heart imaging studies on days 2, 5, and 8.

        -  Optional skeletal muscle and fat tissue biopsies on days 1 and 9.

        -  There will be a follow-up visit 2 weeks after leaving the hospital. Participants will
           have a final physical exam and provide blood samples.

    <textblock>
      Thyroid hormone action is an important regulator of the metabolism and the function of many
      organs. The active form of thyroid hormone is T3, and its blood and tissue levels are the
      result of the secretion of T3 and its precursor, thyroxine (T4), from the thyroid gland, of
      the peripheral conversion of T4 into T3, and of the degradation of these hormones. In
      hypothyroid patients (particularly patients who underwent total thyroidectomy), the levels of
      T3 are entirely dependent on the exogenously administered T4 (Levothyroxine, L-T4) which is
      converted to T3 or to the inactive form, rT3, by enzymes called deiodinases. This complex
      system has only been partially studied in humans and very little is known about the
      correlation between circulating levels of T3 and end-organ target tissue thyroid hormone
      action.

      The aim of this protocol is to characterize the contribution of the two activating
      deiodinases (type-1 and type-2) to the blood levels and biological effects of T3. To achieve
      this goal we intend to study hypothyroid patients treated with adequate replacement of L-T4
      therapy while simultaneously blocking the activity of the type-1 deiodinase with
      propylthiouracil (PTU).

      Twenty hypothyroid patients who underwent total thyroidectomy or are affected by
      hypothyroidism and are on L-T4 therapy with normal TSH values will be recruited. After
      enrollment in the study, the patients eligibility will be determined during an outpatient
      visit. Patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a 9-day period and will
      receive PTU at a dose of 200 mg four times daily for seven days. During the hospitalization
      for this research protocol, the following studies will be performed: serial blood sampling
      for circulating thyroid hormones to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters of T3, lipids, glucose
      and insulin; body composition; resting energy expenditure at room temperature and during
      exposure to mild cold; echocardiogram and EKG; skeletal muscle strength measurement and
      cardiac MRI.

      The results obtained from this study will help in further characterizing the effects of
      thyroid hormone on metabolism, and may lead to important information on how to optimize the
      thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypothyroidism.
