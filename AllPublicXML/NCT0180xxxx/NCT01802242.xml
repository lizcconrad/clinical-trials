  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is common in males and may develop over the course of an individual's life.
      This cancer is often discovered at the time of routine physical examinations and/or blood
      work or on rectal examination. Once diagnosed, most patients do require some form of
      treatment so that the prostate cancer does not progress to cause damage and/or shortened
      lifespan. Occasionally, after patients receive treatment, the investigators have found that
      an area of cancer remains within the prostate. Those patients with a large area of cancer
      (i.e. seen on MRI image) appear to have a higher chance of remaining or recurrent prostate
      cancer even after standard treatment. Thus, the investigators believe that the area of the
      prostate gland occupied by a dense area of cancer may need more radiation therapy than normal
      to remain cancer free.

      Standard therapy currently in place in North America: Currently patients who are diagnosed
      with prostate cancer have 3 common options: surgery, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
      alone or internal radiation (brachytherapy). Patients may or may not receive hormone therapy
      alongside the radiation depending on their physician's preference. For those who receive
      radiation therapy, the tumor typically receives the same dose as the rest of the prostate
      gland.

      Findings to date: In the past few years the investigators have discovered that patients with
      a tumor large enough to be seen on MRI images (&gt;5mm) have a higher chance than normal of
      having cancer remain in the prostate, despite receiving treatment for their cancer 3 years
      earlier. Using new technology investigators can deliver radiation therapy after viewing the
      prostate tumor on MRI. This guides therapy, allowing the radiation treatment to be targeted
      to the tumor within the prostate. Based on this earlier success the investigators believe
      that they can now safely give a higher dose of radiation to specifically target the cancer
      within the prostate gland.

      Reason for the study: The investigators would like to test this technology and expertise to
      give radiation to a higher than normal dose to the tumor nodule in prostate gland.

      This is a prospective two arm phase 2 trial investigating the technical and clinical
      performance of tumor-targeted (rather than prostate targeted) radiotherapy.

      Cohort 1 (Control group): This group consists of patients who have had previous radiation.
      This group will not receive any active treatment but will have a biopsy at 3 years from the
      time they completed their radiation therapy. Patient in this group will also continue to have
      their PSA checked per standard practice

      Cohort 2 (Experimental group): Patients in this group will receive one of 2 treatment arms of
      their choice. In addition to the MRI-guided prostate biopsy at 3 years and regular standard
      of care PSA checks, this group will also complete a quality of life questionnaire and have
      regular imaging per standard practice.

      Both groups will be followed by the research team per protocol.
