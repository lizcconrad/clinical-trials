    <textblock>
      Through funding from the U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Teaching Research Institute
      at Western Oregon University (WOU) will be conducting research on the effect of a
      parent-delivered massage program on measures of autism and general development in young
      children with autism. Families will participate in an initial training, and receive 24
      sessions of ongoing support and training from a trained therapist over the first nine months.

      Children will be randomly divided into treatment groups and wait-list control groups. The
      control groups begin treatment five months after the treatment groups begin.

      All children will be tested on three occasions in the first year: prior to beginning
      treatment, and five and twelve months later. Follow-up testing will be conducted at the end
      of the second year. Results will be shared with parents at the end of each year. Testers will
      remain blinded as to which group is currently receiving treatment.

      There is no cost to parents for participation in this research study. Families meeting the
      eligibility criteria will be accepted into the study on a first-come, first-served basis.
