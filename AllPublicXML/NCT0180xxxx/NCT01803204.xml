    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness in the use of an educational material through: Assessment of
      knowledge about post-operative orthognathic surgery; assessing levels of anxiety with the
      survey of Anxiety Inventory-STATE-TRAIT; clinical evaluation of self-care in the management
      of postoperative signs and symptoms

  <detailed_description>

      It is a clinical randomized controlled trial being developed from February 2013 to December
      2014, divided into two phases: a pilot study without randomization for impact testing and
      evaluation of intervention and, in the second time, the clinical randomized study with
      possible changes after the pilot study.

      Will be entered in the study patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery originating at
      outpatient clinic located in the municipality of São Paulo. The study aims to evaluate the
      effects of educational material in postoperative education orthognathic surgery, with
      intervals between pre and postoperative serials.

      Recruitment plan of patients: the patients seen in oral and maxillofacial surgery and
      traumatology clinic located in the municipality of São Paulo with indication for orthognathic
      surgery will be covered by personally and invited to participate in intervention research. To
      control the bias will be included in the study patients of the same surgical team, to ensure
      the same surgical technique and postoperative guidance conduct by the surgeon.

      Study variables: it is intended to analyse the socio-demographic variables: sex, age, level
      of education; independent variables: surgical technique, recovery time, difficulties
      experienced during the postoperative period, possible surgical complications; dependent
      variables: signs and symptoms postoperatively (presence or absence) and monitoring of care
      during the postoperative period; level of knowledge about the post-op of orthognathic surgery
      and anxiety levels (State-trait anxiety inventory-IDATE).
