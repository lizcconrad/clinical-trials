      Generally, a contrast medium is used when performing a CT scan or radiographic tests such as
      angiography because it heightens image clarity and can increase diagnosis accuracy. Despite
      these advantages, contrast media can cause allergic reactions in the body or a decline in
      renal function. Therefore, they should be handled carefully and explained sufficiently to the
      patient. For intensive care patients, the use of contrast agents has been revealed as a major
      cause of acute renal damage, and many studies have investigated this complication by
      examining incidence rates and prevention strategies. Hypothesis: Among intensive care
      patients, the group in which a contrast medium was used will have a higher risk of renal
      function decline compared with the group in which a contrast medium was not used, and, hence,
      the use of contrast media becomes a cause of renal function deterioration. Categorizing
      patients with renal function decline according to the new RIFLE criteria can have an
      association with the prognosis of intensive care patients, such as hospitalization period and
      death rate, which can promote faster intervention.

    <description>The occurrence of acute renal damage was examined, and these patients were compared with the group that did not develop acute renal damage to investigate whether the use of contrast agents acts as an independent variable. In addition, the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) categorization and the existing classification method were used to compare their predictive value for acute renal damage related to contrast media.</description>
