  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of continuing versus withdrawing therapy with adalimumab 40 mg given
      every other week SC in maintaining remission in subjects with moderate to severe
      non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.

    <textblock>
      The study duration included a 42-day Screening Period, a 28-week open-label 40 mg adalimumab
      every other week (eow) treatment period (Period 1), a 40-week double-blind placebo controlled
      eow treatment period (Period 2) with an opportunity to receive at least 12 weeks of rescue
      therapy with open-label adalimumab (participants that flared at Weeks 60, 64 or 68 were
      allowed 12 weeks of rescue therapy and final visits were at Weeks 72, 76 or 80 respectively),
      plus a 70-day follow-up phone call. Participants in sustained Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease
      Activity Score (ASDAS) inactive disease were randomized at Week 28 at a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either blinded adalimumab 40 mg eow or matching placebo. The length of exposure to adalimumab
      depended on remission or flare status and ranged from 20 (first time Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Disease Activity Score [ASDAS] remission was calculated) to 80 weeks of treatment.

    <time_frame>From Week 28 through 68</time_frame>
    <description>The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) tool is a self-administered questionnaire/objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire assesses disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and duration of morning stiffness on a numeric rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of ≥2 hours). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (mg/L) (hs-CRP). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and hs-CRP) are combined to yield a score (0 to no defined upper limit). During Period 2 participants visited study sites at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64 and 68 or if they discontinued early from the study. A flare was defined as having any 2 consecutive study visits with ASDAS ≥ 2.100.</description>

Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and hs-CRP) are combined to yield a score (0 to no defined upper limit). During Period 2 participants visited study sites at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64 and 68 or if they discontinued early from the study. A partial flare was defined as having any 2 consecutive study visits with ASDAS ≥ 1.300 but &lt;2.100.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Did Not Experience a Flare During Period 2 by Week 68</title>
        <description>The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) tool is a self-administered questionnaire/objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire assesses disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and duration of morning stiffness on a numeric rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of ≥2 hours). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (mg/L) (hs-CRP). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and hs-CRP) are combined to yield a score (0 to no defined upper limit). During Period 2 participants visited study sites at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64 and 68 or if they discontinued early from the study. A flare was defined as having any 2 consecutive study visits with ASDAS ≥ 2.100.</description>

        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Disease Activity Index assesses disease activity by asking the participant to answer 6 questions (each on a 10 point numeric rating scale [NRS]) pertaining to symptoms experienced for the past week. For 5 questions (level of fatigue/tiredness, level of AS neck, back or hip pain, level of pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back or hips, level of discomfort from any areas tender to touch or pressure, and level of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); for Question 6 (duration of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (≥ 2 hours). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10. Lower scores indicate less disease activity. BASDAI50 is a 50% improvement from baseline in BASDAI score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disability Index of Health Assessment Questionnaire Modified for the Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) at 12 Weeks After Initiation of Rescue Therapy</title>
        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) is a self-reported measure to assess the physical function and health-related quality of life. The Disability Index (DI) of HAQ-S is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 [without any difficulty] to 3 [unable to do]): Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. Five additional items in the functional status measure were included in the HAQ-S, including carrying heavy packages, sitting for long periods, able to work at a flat topped table, and (if the participant had a driver's license or a car) able to look in the rear view mirror and able to turn head to drive in reverse. The overall score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (very severe, high-dependency disability). Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) Inactive Disease at Weeks 28 and 68</title>
        <description>The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) tool is a self-administered questionnaire/objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire assesses disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and duration of morning stiffness on a numeric rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of ≥2 hours). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (mg/L) (hs-CRP). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and hs-CRP) are combined to yield a score (0 to no defined upper limit). ASDAS Inactive Disease is defined as a score of &lt;1.300.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving an Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 Response at Weeks 28 and 68</title>
        <description>ASAS20 response was defined as improvement of ≥ 20% relative to baseline and absolute improvement of ≥ 1 unit (on a scale from 0 to 10) in ≥ 3 of the following 4 domains with no deterioration (defined as a worsening of ≥ 20% and a net worsening of ≥ 1 unit) in the potential remaining domain:
Patient's Global Assessment of disease activity, measured on a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 (none) to 10 (severe);
Pain, measured by the total back pain NRS from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe);
Function, measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) which consists of 10 items assessing participants' ability to perform activities on an NRS ranging from 0 (easy) to 10 (impossible);
Inflammation, measured by the mean of the 2 morning stiffness-related Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) NRS scores (items 5 [level of stiffness] and 6 [duration of stiffness]) each on a scale from 0 (none/0 hours) to 10 (very severe/2 hours or more duration).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 Response at Weeks 28 and 68</title>
        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Disease Activity Index assesses disease activity by asking the participant to answer 6 questions (each on a 10 point numeric rating scale [NRS]) pertaining to symptoms experienced for the past week. For 5 questions (level of fatigue/tiredness, level of AS neck, back or hip pain, level of pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back or hips, level of discomfort from any areas tender to touch or pressure, and level of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); for Question 6 (duration of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (≥ 2 hours). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10. Lower scores indicate less disease activity. BASDAI50 is a 50% improvement from baseline in BASDAI score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disability Index of Health Assessment Questionnaire Modified for the Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) at Weeks 28 and 68</title>
        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) is a self-reported measure to assess the physical function and health-related quality of life. The Disability Index (DI) of HAQ-S is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 [without any difficulty] to 3 [unable to do]): Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. Five additional items in the functional status measure were included in the HAQ-S, including carrying heavy packages, sitting for long periods, able to work at a flat topped table, and (if the participant had a driver's license or a car) able to look in the rear view mirror and able to turn head to drive in reverse. The overall score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (very severe, high-dependency disability). Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Time to Flare at Week 68</title>
        <description>The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) tool is a self-administered questionnaire/objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire assesses disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling on a numeric rating scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (very severe)) and duration of morning stiffness on a numeric rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of ≥2 hours). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (mg/L) (hs-CRP). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and hs-CRP) are combined to yield a score (0 to no defined upper limit).
