  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the new vehicle formulations containing ingenol
      mebutate are as safe and effective as Picato® gel 0.05% (it's current vehicle formulation)
      when applied to AK lesions on the forearm for two consecutive days.

      This study will be run in 2 parts. The first part involves applying escalating concentrations
      of the new vehicle formulations containing ingenol mebutate to AKs on the forearms. Reactions
      and safety will be compared to Picato® (a registered and marketed ingenol mebutate gel) to
      ascertain if the new vehicle formulations are at least as safe and effective as Picato® . The
      purpose of part 2 is to select the concentration in the &quot;new formulation&quot; that produces this
      same, if not better response, as Picato® and with a similar or better safety profile.
