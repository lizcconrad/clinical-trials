      To determine the safety of administering anakinra plus the physician's chemotherapy choice
      (TPC) of nab paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC), as well as determining blood immune cell transcriptional signatures in
      patients who undergo IL-1 receptor blockade.

    <textblock>
      In an attempt to reverse the immune suppressive microenvironment and to enhance chemotherapy
      effectiveness, decrease tumor metagenicity and decrease IL-1-induced fatigue, metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC) patients will be treated with chemotherapy plus anakinra. This is a pilot
      safety, single arm, open label trial. The objective is to determine the safety of anakinra
      plus the physician's chemotherapy choice (TPC) of nab paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, or
      vinorelbine in patients with MBC and to define an anakinra-induced anti-IL-1 whole blood
      transcriptional profile.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety - Adverse Events in participants</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will receive anakinra plus the physicians chemotherapy choice of nab paclitaxel, or capecitabine, or eribulin, or vinorelbine for metastatic breast cancer. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the trial, and regardless of the severity will be followed up by investigator until resolution is satisfactory. All adverse events and toxicities will be recorded and assessed for 30 days following the last dose of anakinra at a maximum of 6 months. Grading will be done using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine investigator-assessed objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, and rates of chemotherapy or cancer-related anemia (HgB&lt;10), and an anakinra-induced anti-IL-1 blood transcriptional signatures</measure>
    <time_frame>upto 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in patients will be determined using radiological assessment of tumors (CT/MRI/X-ray/PET), clinical and functional evaluation of patients with 95% confidence intervals. Whole blood transcriptional profiling will be performed to determine a gene expression signature that is induced by IL-1 receptor blockade by anakinra. The gene expression signatures from baseline will be compared to those signatures obtained after the 2-week run-in treatment with anakinra alone. During the treatment, complete blood count with differential/platelet count and complete metabolic profiling will be done to identify any baseline changes.</description>
