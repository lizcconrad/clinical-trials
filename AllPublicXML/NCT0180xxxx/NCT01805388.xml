  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to characterize the composition of the hard and soft tissues
      present after regenerative endodontic procedures in root canals of teeth previously diagnosed
      with the need for extraction for orthodontic treatment and incomplete root formation.
      Although the protocol addressed in this study is currently being used in clinical practice,
      there are no prospective clinical trials investigating its efficacy in stimulating continued
      root development and the nature of the newly formed tissues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty subjects with permanent bilateral premolar teeth with incomplete root development and
      scheduled for extraction due to orthodontic requirement will be treated with a regeneration
      protocol. Teeth (n=20/group) will be extracted at 3 months following the regenerative
      protocol or the pulpectomy control. The protocol relies on disinfection of the canal space by
      copious irrigation with common endodontic irrigants and placement of a triple antibiotic
      paste (regenerative group) or calcium hydroxide dressing (control group) to disinfect the
      root for a period of one month. In each patient, both treatment arms will be performed. Thus,
      each treatment sample will have a contralateral matching control (paired designs). At the end
      of one month, the intracanal medicaments (triple antibiotic paste) is irrigated out of the
      canal and a blood clot is stimulated in the canal with the aid of endodontic files that are
      introduced into the periapical tissues; this blood clot will serve as a scaffold for tissue
      proliferation within the canal. The regenerative treatment tooth is then restored to prevent
      bacteria from the oral cavity from re-contaminating the canal space. For the contralateral
      control tooth, the medication will remain in the tooth until the extraction date. The
      subjects in this study will have the treated teeth extracted at 3 months after initial
      treatment. The extracted teeth from each study participant will be placed in storage medium
      until Immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to characterize the tissue/cells within
      the canal.

    <time_frame>Following tooth extraction at the 3 month followup visit. Correlation of all data collected from the extracted teeth will occur at the completion of the study at year 5.</time_frame>
    <description>Although we predict histological identification of dentin/odontoblasts (due to the proximity of the apical papilla and associated SCAP stem cells) using our scanning laser confocal microscopy system, our methods are sufficiently sensitive to permit identification of bone/osteoblasts and cementum/cementoblasts as alternative hypotheses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Whether stem cells enter the canal space when bleeding is stimulated through manipulation of the apical papilla.</measure>
    <time_frame>Canal bleeding is evoked during the second treatment visit thirty days following the first treatment. Blood collected by paper points will be saved till the end of the study (year 5) for analysis.</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome measure will be conducted by measuring markers of stem cells prior to and after the formation of the blood clot. We predict that evoking bleeding into the root canal system will increase the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells.</description>
