    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, simulated breast cancer screening study. The goal of the study is to explore
      these scanning modalities:

      1) Combined digital breast tomosynthesis(DBT)/dual-sides 3 dimensional-automated
      ultrasound(AUS)

      2. Explore the utility of photoacoustic imaging as an adjunct to digital breast
      tomosynthesis(DBT)/ultrasound(US)alone.

      This is a pilot, simulated breast cancer screening study. In a population enriched with
      mammographic call-backs, we will study whether:

      1) Combined digital breast tomosynthesis(DBT)/dual-sides 3 dimensional-automated
      ultrasound(AUS)will result in a lower call-back rate than digital breast
      tomosynthesis(DBT)alone.

      2. Explore the utility of photoacoustic imaging as an adjunct to digital breast
      tomosynthesis(DBT)/ultrasound(US)alone.

      This study will compare two new breast imaging systems to digital mammography and hand-held
      ultrasound that are commonly used to find and evaluate breast masses. Images will be done
      with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and 3-D automated ultrasound(AUS) which will be done
      in the breast imaging clinic of the main hospital followed by the second light and ultrasound
      imaging that will be completed in the research lab.

    <description>To simulate the performance of the combination of three new breast imaging systems to digital mammography and hand-held ultrasound that are currently used to find and evaluate breast masses.
These three different systems make images of the breast in several ways to find breast masses and to distinguish normal and abnormal masses. This may result in less unnecessary call-backs from mammography.</description>

    <description>Digital tomosynthesis mammogram uses a low radiation dose, taking x-ray pictures of the breast from many angles to make a 3D(dimensional)image. The participant will be seated and her breast positioned as in a normal mammogram, though with reduced pressure. The x-ray tube will move quickly above the breast to take the images. Then, an ultrasound scan will be done using gel on your breast to assist in acquiring quality imaging.</description>

    <description>The participant will be seated in front of the laser device with the breast positioned on the laser device platform. Each subject will be given a laser protective eye mask/goggles to wear and will be instructed how to wear the mask/goggles during the scan. In addition pulse monitor leads may be placed on the participant's chest to allow the computer to record ultrasound blood flow in the breast. The low intensity laser light will be focused on the targeted area of the breast.</description>

        The study population includes women who have had a mammogram at University of Michigan
        within one year who have been referred to the study. Participants may have a breast mass,
        either benign or cancerous.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with possible masses

          -  All women should have had mammograms at University of Michigan Health System within 1
             year before this research study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are physically unable to tolerate the length of the scan.

          -  Women who are less than 30 years of age or older than 80 years of age

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Women whose mass is in an area of the breast which makes it difficult to see in the
             research scans

          -  Womens with a single diagnosis of mammographic calcifications

          -  Women who have had a breast cancer with lumpectomy

          -  Women who are prisoners

          -  Women who are students or staff of investigators

          -  Women who cannot give consent

          -  Women with mammograms classified as probably benign because of follow-up of a recent
             benign biopsy.

          -  Women with breast pain who have been categorized as BIRADS(Breast Imaging Reporting
             and Data System) category 0(incomplete) on their most recent mammograms.

          -  Males, because their breast tissue is not easily imaged and numbers of potential cases
             are too few.
