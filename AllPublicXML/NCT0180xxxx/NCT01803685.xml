      This register study will collect the treatment information of the intracranial arteriovenous
      malformation patients in China. We aim to understand the current treatment situation of the
      disease in China.

      Intracranial arteriovenous malformations are congenital lesions that consist of multiple
      arteries and veins, connecting as a fistula without intervening normal capillary bed. The
      treatment strategy including surgical removal, endovascular embolism and stereotaxic
      radiosurgery and comprehensive treatment. China is a united multi-ethnic nation of 56 ethnic
      groups, and has the largest population in the world. We have most extensive and valuable
      clinical resources of intracranial arteriovenous malformation in the world. But we know
      little about the current treatment situation of the disease in China.

      In order to realize the treatment situation of intracranial arteriovenous malformation in
      China, we designed a retrospective and prospective register study to collect the treatment
      and outcome information all over China.
