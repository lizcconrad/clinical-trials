  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence indicate that a significant proportion of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) events are attributable to the presence of a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and
      perturbations, defined as the metabolic syndrome. It has been estimated that approximately
      25% of the North American adult population is living with the metabolic syndrome. Recent
      studies from the investigators group show that overaccumulation of atherogenic
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) seen in insulin-resistant patients is partly due to
      increased production rate of intestinally derived apolipoprotein (apo) B-48-containing
      lipoproteins. This is of interest because substantial evidence exists indicating that
      elevated levels of intestinal lipoproteins are associated with increased CVD risk. In this
      regard, there is some evidence that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) may beneficially modify
      lipoprotein metabolism in hypertriglyceridemic patients. However, as emphasized in the body
      of this grant proposal, the specific impact of MCTs on the intestinal lipoprotein secretion
      and on expression of genes that regulate intestinal lipid absorption and chylomicron
      synthesis has not yet been investigated in humans.

      The general objective of the proposed research is to investigate the mechanisms by which MCTs
      beneficially modify intestinal lipoprotein metabolism in patients with the metabolic
      syndrome. The primary hypothesis is that MCT supplementation will decrease plasma levels of
      intestinal lipoproteins by reducing secretion of these particles.
