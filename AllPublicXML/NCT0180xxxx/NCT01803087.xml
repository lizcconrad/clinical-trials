      This clinical pharmacology want to investigate the systemic availability of BDP/B17MP (active
      metabolite of BDP) and formoterol after single oral inhalation of CHF 1535 100/6 pMDI with
      and without spacer device (AeroChamber Plus™) and in comparison to a free combination of BDP
      pMDI plus formoterol pMDI licensed products; this will be additionally compared to the
      systemic exposure in adults without the spacer device.

      The proposed clinical pharmacology study is aimed to investigate the systemic availability of
      BDP/B17MP (active metabolite of BDP) and formoterol after single oral inhalation of CHF 1535
      100/6 pMDI (to reach a total dose of BDP 400 µg and formoterol 24 µg) with and without spacer
      device (AeroChamber Plus™) and in comparison to a free combination of BDP pMDI plus
      formoterol pMDI licensed products (to reach the same total dose of BDP and formoterol) in
      adolescent asthmatic patients. The systemic exposure to BDP/B17MP and formoterol after
      inhalation of CHF 1535 pMDI in adolescents will be additionally compared to the systemic
      exposure in adults without the spacer device.

      The chosen doses correspond to the maximum daily dose of the two components administered as
      fixed combination.

         10. History of drug addiction or excessive use of alcohol (weekly intake in excess of 28
             units alcohol; one unit being a glass of beer, wine or a measure of spirits), or
             excessive consumption of xanthine containing substances (daily intake in excess of 5
             cups of coffee, tea, cola, etc) or psychological or other emotional problems likely to
             invalidate informed consent, or limit the ability of the subject to comply with the
             protocol requirements;

         11. Treatment with a xanthine derivative (e.g. theophylline) formulations in the 4 weeks
             prior to screening;

         12. Blood donation (450 mL or more) (for the adult population) or significant blood loss
             in the 12 weeks before the screening visit.
