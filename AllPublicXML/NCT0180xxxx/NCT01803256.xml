  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The full body marker sets that are typically used in opto-electronic 3D gait analyses either
      disregard the spine entirely or regard it as a rigid structure. Therefore, the purpose of
      this study is to identify the possibilities and limitations of an enhanced trunk marker set
      for the measurement of spine dynamics during gait in adolescents with and without structural
      spine deformities.

      It has been hypothesized that the enhance trunk marker set:

        1. is a valid method for the measurement of spine deformations in the sagittal, frontal and
           indirectly transverse planes.

        2. is an applicable and reliable method for the measurement of spine dynamics during gait
           in healthy adolescents and in patients with structural deformities such as seen in
           scoliosis.

        3. is sensitive enough to distinguish the spinal movement pattern during gait measured in
           scoliosis patients from the one measured in healthy adolescents.

      To verify the hypotheses, the following measurements will be carried out:

        -  Biplanar radiographs (a-p and lateral) with radio-opaque markers in scoliosis patients.

        -  Instrumented gait analysis with a standard full body marker set and the enhanced trunk
           marker set in scoliosis patients and healthy controls.
