    <textblock>
      Posterior lumbar spinal surgical pain leads to a severe degree of pain, and, hence, various
      means of pain management are required. Opioid pain medications such as morphine and fentanyl
      are frequently used as intravenously administered medications. To reduce the use of opioids
      for pain relief, a non-opioid form of pain relief, such as a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory
      Drug (NSAID), is often added to the regimen.

      With the use of NSAIDs, however, the risk of systemic side effects such as bleeding,
      gastroduodenal bleeding, and kidney damage are being reported, and there is also a report of
      inhibition of spinal fusion; these risks limit the use of NSAIDs.

      Nefopam, a new centrally-acting analgesic agent, has been reported in an animal study to
      desensitize post-surgical pain, and when used with an opioid analgesic, it indirectly
      controlled the NMDA receptor, which inhibited the generation of c-fos gene at the spine.
      There are also reports that Nefopam managed pain by inhibiting the serotonin reuptake
      receptors.

      In clinical practice, the administration of Nefopam in patients who required post-surgical
      pain management reduced the use of opioid analgesics by 20-50 % and also reduced the
      prevalence of nausea and vomiting.

      Therefore, the investigators considered whether the addition of Nefopam for intravenous
      patient-controlled analgesia in patients with lumbar spinal surgery would reduce the side
      effects seen in monotherapy with opioid analgesia and result in effective pain management.
      This study was conducted to address this question.

    <description>The chief investigator prepared the medications according to the selected randomized table, and investigators who were not involved in medication preparation recorded the pain and prevalence of complications in study subjects. The double-blind restriction was lifted if the patient withdrew from the study, and the next patient was classified into a group while blinded by using the randomized table.Intramuscular midazolam 0.05 mg/kg was administered as a premedication, and then a blood pressure machine, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximeter were connected to the patient in the operating room.</description>
