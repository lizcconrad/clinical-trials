    <textblock>
      This trial studies biomarker expression in tissue samples from patients with bone sarcomas.
      Studying biomarker in tissue samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer

      STUDY SUBTYPE: Ancillary/Correlative

      OBSERVATIONAL STUDY MODEL: Case-only

      TIME PERSPECTIVE: Retrospective

      BIOSPECIMEN RETENTION: Samples without DNA

      BIOSPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Tissue samples obtained from Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN)

      STUDY POPULATION DESCRIPTION: Patients enrolled on P9754 and AOST0121 clinical trials

      SAMPLING METHOD: Non-probability sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there is differential expression of tumor factor (TF) among patients with
      osteosarcoma.

      II. To determine if there is an association between overall survival and disease free
      survival and the extent of TF expression.

      III. To determine if TF expression correlates with presence of gross metastatic disease at
      presentation, and development of subsequent metastases.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue samples are analyzed for tumor factor expression levels by immunohistochemistry.

    <description>Estimated in the analytic population as the number of samples in the population in which such expression is noted divided by 33. An assessment of the precision of such estimates will be provided by an exact binomial confidence interval. Comparison of normalized TF expression in non-metastatic versus metastatic patients will be done using the two-sample t-test.</description>
