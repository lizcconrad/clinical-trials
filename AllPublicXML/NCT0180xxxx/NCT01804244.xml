      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of TMC278 after a
      single oral dose of TMC278 25 mg tablet (27.5 mg as the hydrochloride salt) under fed
      conditions in healthy Japanese adult male participants.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label (all study staff and participants will know the identity
      of the treatment assigned), single dose study in healthy Japanese adult male participants.
      The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase up to 26 days; an inpatient phase from Day
      -2 to Day 8; and a follow-up assessment phase that occurs on Day 15 (± 2 days) or at the time
      of the participant's early withdrawal from the study. Participants who meet the selection
      criteria will be admitted to the investigational institute on two days before the dose (Day
      -2). All enrolled participants will receive orally (by mouth) a single dose of one TMC278 25
      mg tablet on Day 1 within 10 minutes after completion of the standardized breakfast. Enrolled
      participants will remain in the investigational institute for the entire duration of the
      inpatient phase. Participants will be discharged on Day 8 after the completion of all
      required assessments. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of TMC278 will
      be collected over a period of 168 hours (7 days). The maximum study duration for each
      participant is 45 days, including the screening phase, in-patient period, and follow-up
      visit.
