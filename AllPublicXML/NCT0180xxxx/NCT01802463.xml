  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular blood flow has been consistently demonstrated to be altered in glaucoma patients when
      compared to otherwise healthy individuals. Numerous Doppler studies have shown a decrease in
      flow velocities in the retrobulbar arteries in what appears to be related to the degree of
      the glaucomatous disease.

      The anatomic pathway of the several arteries into the eye is intricately complicate, with at
      least one of them (the central retina artery) penetrating the optic nerve before entering the
      eye and supplying the innermost structures of the globe. As the optic nerve is surrounded by
      a layer of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is in continuity with the rest of the central
      nervous system, this central retinal artery has also to cross this CSF containing
      compartment. Because of the intrinsic pressure this CSF - corresponding to the intracranial
      pressure at the orbital level - the possibility exists that this pressure around the optic
      disc could affect the blood flow of the arteries that go through it.

      The investigators will try to detect if a correlation exists between the optic nerve sheath
      diameter and the blood flow in the retrobulbar vessels of glaucoma patients.

      1. Visual field testing will be performed.

        2. Structural analysis of the retinal nerve fiber layer (through confocal microscopy)will
           be performed.

        3. Color Doppler Imaging of the retrobulbar vessels will be performed. Peak and end
           diastolic velocities, resistivity index will be calculated from the Doppler waveform.

        4. B-scan ultrasound of the optic nerve sheath diameter will be performed. the measure will
           take place at 3mm behind the globe.
