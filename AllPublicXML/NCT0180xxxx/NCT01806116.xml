  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only potentially curative therapy for
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Relapse
      remains a leading cause for treatment failure after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      in patientsï¼Œso that there is the need to continue to look for alternative therapies.
      Decitabine, is known to inhibit DNA methyltransferase which results in DNA hypomethylation
      and expression of silenced genes including those involved in apoptosis. The approval of
      decitabine for the treatment of MDS and AML has provided an alternative strategy to inhibit
      disease progression in transplant-eligible patients. To assess the effect of pretransplant
      decitabine treatment on post transplant outcomes, we recently reviewed our institutional
      experience with MDS and AML patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 8- 65 years

          -  Diseases must be myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelocytic leukemia

          -  Must need a bone marrow transplant

          -  Must have the ability to observe the efficacy and events

          -  Patient must have ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed
             consent prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because decitabine is a Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with decitabine,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with decitabine; these
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Must not have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to decitabine
