  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators want to determine if N-acetylcysteine(NAC), given
      intravenously, will decrease complications in patients with Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia
      Purpura (TTP) who are receiving treatment with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). The
      investigators want to determine, through anti-oxidant activity, if NAC will have additional
      efficacy in TTP by improving cleavage of the patients' VWF by ADAMTS13, and preventing
      propagation of platelet/VWF strings. This will be manifest by a more rapid improvement in the
      patient's platelet count, decrease in number of days requiring TPE, and decrease in
      microvascular thrombotic complications. The investigators will additionally: 1) Assess safety
      of NAC by evaluating subjects for adverse events and significant adverse events 2) Determine
      effects on TTP by measuring clinical and research laboratory values 3) Determine drug effects
      by measuring clinical and research laboratory values.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare hemostatic disorder with life threatening
      consequences secondary to microvascular thrombosis. While the use of therapeutic plasma
      exchange (TPE) has greatly improved survival, end organ damage, resistance to therapy, and
      relapses occur in many patients. Ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) are
      pathogenic in TTP. The investigators have found that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) cleaves ULVWF in
      vitro and in vivo in the ADAMTS13 deficient mice that are at increased risk of TTP. NAC is
      well tolerated in humans at intravenous doses used for treatment of acetaminophen overdose.
      This dosage correlates with that producing an effect in the murine studies noted above, and
      thus is an attractive treatment for patients with TTP. By cleaving VWF and preventing
      propagation of platelet/VWF strings, the investigators hypothesize that NAC treatment will
      decrease complications in patients with TTP receiving treatment with TPE. This will be
      manifest by a more rapid improvement in platelet count, decrease in number of days requiring
      plasma exchange, and decrease in microvascular thrombotic complications. To prepare for a
      larger trial the investigators propose a pilot study in 3 patients with suspected TTP at the
      University of Washington (UW) Medical Center. The study will be approved by the UW IRB prior
      to study initiation. Patients who consent to the study will receive daily NAC infusions
      beginning after the first TPE, in doses used for acetaminophen overdose. Blood samples will
      be collected for laboratory assays to determine optimal timing for sample collection in the
      larger multicenter trial, and to pilot the data collection forms. The investigators will also
      evaluate safety and patient tolerability.
