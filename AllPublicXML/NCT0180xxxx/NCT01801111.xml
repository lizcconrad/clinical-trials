  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter phase I/II study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of RO5424802 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have ALK mutation and
      failed crizotinib treatment. In Part 1, cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of
      RO5424802 orally twice daily. In Part 2, patients will receive the recommended phase II dose
      of RO5424802 as determined in Part 1. Treatment will continue in Part 1 and Part 2 on the
      same dose until disease progression. In Part 3, following disease progression, patients
      without EGFR mutation will be offered continued treatment with RO5424802, patients with EGFR
      mutations will be offered a combination of RO5424802 and Tarceva (erlotinib).

      <pre_assignment_details>Part 1 of study was planned to determine recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of alectinib to be used in Part 2. During the conduct of Part 1 for this study, RP2D was confirmed in Study NP28761 (NCT01871805). Hence Part 1 participants were merged into Part 2. Part 3 was post-progression treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of the first treatment and the date of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression (according to RECIST version 1.1) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study or absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesion. Progression was assessed by IRC and by the investigator in safety population as well as in subgroups of participants who received prior chemotherapy and who did not receive prior chemotherapy. PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI was assessed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

PR was achieved if all of the following criteria met: at least 50% decrease compared with screening in the sum of the products of the diameters (SPD) of measurable enhancing measurable lesions; No progression of non-measurable disease (enhancing and non-enhancing [T2/FLAIR] lesions); No new lesions; Participant must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only), and clinically stable or improved.

        <description>Duration of response in participants with CNS response was defined as the time from the first observation of a CNS response (CR or PR) until first observation of CNS progression or death from any cause based on IRC review of radiographs by RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the screening sum diameters) and no progression of target lesions. Progression was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study or absolute increase of at lease 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesion. Duration of response was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI was assessed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>
