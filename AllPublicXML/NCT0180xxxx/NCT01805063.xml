  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Firefighters are at increased risk of death from heart attacks when compared to other
      emergencyy service professionals whose jobs involve similar components such as emergency
      call-outs and shift work. In the largest analysis of cause of death amongst on-duty
      firefighters, firefighter deaths were classified according to the duty performed during the
      onset of symptoms or immediately prior to any sudden death. The majority of deaths due to a
      cardiovascular cause (i.e. heart attack) occurred during fire suppression whilst this
      activity represented a relatively small amount of a firefighters professional time. There was
      also a risk of death associated with other duties such as emergency non-fire response and
      physical exertion.

      The investigators hypothesize that participation in active fire-fighting duties impairs blood
      vessel function and increases blood clot formation when compared with non-fire-fighting
      activities. In this study, healthy career firefighters will be assessed after three periods
      of duty: fire-suppression, emergency response without fire suppression and following a
      sedentary shift. The investigators will take blood samples to measure platelet activity
      (platelets are the particles in blood that help blood clot) and will examine how blood clots
      outside of the body. The investigators will then perform studies placing small needles in the
      arm to assess blood vessel function following these duties. By undertaking this comprehensive
      assessment of blood, blood vessel and heart function the investigators hope to understand the
      mechanisms whereby the risk of a heart attack, fatal or otherwise, is posed throughout these
      distinct duties that firefighters undertake on a daily basis.
