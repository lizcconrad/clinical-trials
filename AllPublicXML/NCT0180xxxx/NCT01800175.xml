      The purpose of this study is to evaluate retention and replacement of the OTX Punctum Plug
      when placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid. Subjects will be followed for up to 1 year in
      order to assess retention and replacement of the OTX Punctum Plug for this duration. At the
      Day 90 visit, subjects will receive a second OTX Punctum Plug after removal of the initial
      OTX Punctum Plug. The subject will return for visits at Day 180, 270 and 360. On Days 180 and
      270, the subject will again receive a new OTX Punctum Plug after the previous OTX Punctum
      Plug is removed.

    <description>Two formulations of the OTX Punctum Plug will be evaluated in this trial. The difference in formulations is the time required for degradation of the PEG hydrogel. The persistence of OTX Punctum Plug (Formulation C) is anticipated to be slightly shorter than the persistence of OTX Punctum Plug (Formulation D).</description>
