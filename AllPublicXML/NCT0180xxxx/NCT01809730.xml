      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional pilot observational study designed to follow
      high-risk patients through their surgical and hospital stay. The investigators will collect 2
      4ml vial's of blood (total of 8ml) prior to surgery to assess CV biomarkers - inflammatory,
      metabolic, hypercoagulable and platelet.

      This study is primarily an observational pilot study. After identifying patients as high-risk
      according to the following criteria: CAD and/or CVD and/or PAD and/or &gt;=60 years old and at
      least 2 of the following - renal insufficiency, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, active smoker
      (or active within 6 months of consent), cancer, congestive heart failure, or any blood clot -
      they will be asked to sign a consent form. Patients surgical and hospital course will
      continue as per standard of care. Prior to surgery, 8ml of blood will be collected for to
      assess cardiovascular biomarkers including inflammatory, metabolic, hypercoagulable and
      platelet biomarkers to be tested independently in Dr. Berger's lab in Smilow. Study staff
      will perform electrocardiograms on POD 2. Results of these ECGs will not be placed in the
      patients' charts. No other procedures will be done for research purposes only.

        This pilot, observational study is designed to identify and follow orthopedic surgical
        patients meeting specific high-risk criteria for postoperative cardiovascular events. All
        normal standard of care will be maintained. Patients will be observed from Pre-Admission
        Testing (PAT) visit through hospital discharge.
