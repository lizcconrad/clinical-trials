      The study allows continued use of single agent panobinostat in patients who are on single
      agent panobinostat treatment in a Novartis-sponsored study which has met its endpoint and are
      benefiting from the treatment as judged by the investigator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center open label study to provide continued use of single agent oral
      panobinostat to patients currently treated in a Novartis-sponsored study (parent study) which
      has met its endpoint and are benefiting from continuation of the treatment with single-agent
      panobinostat as judged by the investigator. Patients from multiple parent studies will be
      transferred over to this protocol and will be continuing to receive single agent panobinostat
      at the last assigned dose and regimen of the parent protocol. There will be no screening
      period, and patients will have to visit the study center at least on a quarterly basis.
      During these visits limited information on study treatment and occurrence of SAEs will be
      collected for the clinical database. SAEs will be only reported to the Novartis safety
      database.Other assessments and possibly more frequent visits will occur as per standard of
      care at the site. Patients will continue treatment until they are no longer benefiting from
      panobinostat treatment develop unacceptable toxicities, withdraw consent, are non-compliant
      to the protocol, the investigator feels it is no longer in the best interest to continue, the
      patient dies, or for other administrative reasons. An end of treatment visit and a safety
      follow-up for 30 days after the last dose will be performed. The study is expected to remain
      open for 5 years or until such time that enrolled patients no longer need treatment with
      panobinostat, whichever comes earlier.
