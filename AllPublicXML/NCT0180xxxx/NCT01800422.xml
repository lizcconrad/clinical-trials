    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the medication that blocks the
      effects of the hormone progesterone (CDB-4124 or Proellex) will decrease the growth rate of
      breast cancer cells as compared to a placebo. CDB-4124 (also called Proellex) is a medication
      that works against the hormone, progesterone. The researchers in this study would like to
      compare changes in breast cancer cells of women who have taken CDB-4124 prior to surgery to
      those from women who have taken a placebo pill prior to surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that treatment with the selective progesterone receptor modulator
      (SPRM) CDB-4124 (telapristone acetate) will have an anti-tumor effect in women with
      early-stage breast cancer, defined as a significant decrease in tumor proliferation (Ki67
      labeling index).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure changes in apoptosis using IHC (cleaved caspase 3 or TUNEL). II. Measure changes
      in blood estradiol and progesterone levels. III. Compare the breast tissue concentrations of
      CDB-4124 and its metabolite (CDB4453) to plasma concentrations at the end of therapy.

      IV. Assess adverse events.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure protein expression of related targets (including estrogen receptor alpha (ERA),
      estrogen receptor beta (ERB), progesterone receptor isoforms progesterone receptor alpha
      [PRA], progesterone receptor beta [PRB], tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member
      11a, NFKB activator [RANK], tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11 [RANKL],
      and either cyclin-dependent kinase 2 [cdk2] or cyclin-dependent kinase 4 [cdk4],) using IHC
      at baseline and after treatment.

      II. Perform ribonucleic acid (RNA) microarray analysis comparing tumors and normal tissue
      from the intervention and control groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive telapristone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 2-10 weeks and
      then undergo surgical resection.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo orally once daily for 2-10 weeks and then undergo surgical
      resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
