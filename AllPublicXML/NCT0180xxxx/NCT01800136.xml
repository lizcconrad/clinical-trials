    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare analgesic efficacy of two non invasive techniques based
      on motor cortex stimulation in neuropathic pain patients. High frequency repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) of primary motor cortex has been demonstrated to
      induce an analgesic effect significantly different from placebo; this effect is clinically
      useful if rTMS sessions are applied daily during five consecutive days. Transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) is a new approach of non invasive cortical stimulation but its
      efficacy in neuropathic pain has been not yet established. The investigators propose to
      compare the analgesic effect of 5 tDCS sessions applied daily to a similar protocol using
      HF-rTMS. In parallel to the clinical therapeutic evaluation, functional-MRI will be performed
      before and after the five sessions of rTMS and tDCS, in order to reveal the potential
      plasticity induced within motor somatotopic map of the primary motor cortex.
