  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three treatment modalities for central, or mixed
      obstructive and central, sleep apnea in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced
      ejection fraction. The modalities to be tested are nocturnal supplemental oxygen (NSO) and
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The main outcome measures will be left
      ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiogram and peak oxygen consumption on
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent disease, with a lifetime risk of
      approximately 20%. Sleep apnea is a common co-morbid condition, occurring in approximately
      half of patients with chronic HF, and often has predominantly central or mixed obstructive
      and central characteristics. Although it is associated with increased mortality in patients
      with HF, sleep apnea is usually asymptomatic and patients are therefore often unwilling to
      accept standard therapy with positive airway pressure. At the outset of this study, there
      were three treatment modalities currently recommended by the American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine for the treatment of predominantly central sleep apnea in HF patients: nocturnal
      supplemental oxygen (NSO), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive
      servo-ventilation (ASV). Recently, ASV was found to increase mortality in patients with heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction and central sleep apnea. There are only limited data
      on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of these three modalities. The present study is
      designed to compare these modalities with respect to effects on ventricular function,
      exercise capacity, and other measures of cardiovascular risk.

    <description>24-hour blood pressure will be measured using a blood pressure cuff that is connected by rubber tubing to a small pressure monitoring device, programmed to measure BP at 20 minute intervals during the day and 30 minute intervals at night (11 PM to 7 AM) for a period of 24 hours. The investigators will assess 24-hour mean arterial pressure as the primary blood pressure outcome, with additional assessment of nocturnal versus diurnal blood pressure effects.</description>
