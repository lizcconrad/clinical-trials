      1. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ivabradine (S 16257) and its main active
           metabolite S 18982 in Korean healthy volunteers after oral administration of ivabradine
           at the doses of 2.5, 5, 10mg and after repeated oral administrations of ivabradine for
           4.5 days at the same doses twice daily versus placebo and to use the study results for
           bridging with Caucasian data.

        2. The pharmacodynamic profile of ivabradine versus placebo by measuring its effects on
           heart rate after single and then after repeated administrations.

        3. Clinical safety of ivabradine versus placebo.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cmax,tmax, AUC(Area under the time-concentration curve) of ivabradine and metabolite</measure>
    <time_frame>within 60 days after blood sampling (blood sample analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>For PK measurements, blood samplings were done: pre-dose then 20 min, 40 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, 16 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h, and 72 h following the D1 single administration (P1) and the Day 8 (D8) last repeated dose (P2), respectively.Ivabradine and its main metabolite were determined using LC-MS/MS, then pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental approach. Descriptive statistics were performed on the PK individual parameters calculated from the plasma concentration-time profiles.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pharmacodynamics: The change of heart rate between baseline and over 24-hour, diurnal, nocturnal, awake, and asleep periods after administration of ivabradine</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 days after administration</time_frame>
    <description>For PD measurements, 24-hour Holter recordings were performed on Day0, Day1, Day8, and Day10. a resting 12-lead ECG were also performed.
The changes of heart rate between day 1 and baseline values, between day 8 and baseline values were studied over 24-hour, diurnal, nocturnal, awake and asleep period for each ivabradine dose in comparison with placebo. Descriptive statistics by dose were performed and confidence intervals of the differences between each dose of ivabradine and placebo were constructed using a non-parametric method based on Hodges &amp; Lehman estimate for independent samples.</description>

Subjects were given a single administration of ivabradine during Period 1 (P1), following a 3-day washout, they were given repeated administrations twice daily for 4.5 days during Period 2 (P2).</description>
