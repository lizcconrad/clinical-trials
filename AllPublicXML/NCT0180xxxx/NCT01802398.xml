  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope (temporary loss of consciousness) is a frequent reason for an emergency department
      (ED) visit among older adults. The current ED evaluation of syncope frequently leads to
      hospitalization, results in low diagnostic yield, and is enormously costly. The purpose of
      this protocol is to improve risk prediction for syncope. Improved risk prediction will inform
      the design of interventions to safely reduce unnecessary health service use.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational cohort study of older (age≥60 years)
      adults who present to an emergency department with syncope (otherwise known as fainting). The
      primary outcome is a composite of 30-day cardiac death and serious cardiac events.

      Study Aims and Hypotheses are:

      Specific Aim 1. Describe serious outcomes after unexplained syncope; rates and reasons for
      admission; and frequency, diagnostic yield, and therapeutic impact of inpatient diagnostic
      tests.

      H1: Current patterns of care representing a diversity of practice settings and patient
      populations are costly with low clinical benefit.

      Specific Aim 2. Derive and validate a novel risk prediction model for 30-day cardiac death
      and serious cardiac outcomes after unexplained syncope.

      H2: Explicit criteria including contemporary cardiac biomarkers will improve risk
      stratification compared to unstructured physician assessment and published risk models.

      Specific Aim 3. Assess safety and costs of a risk-tailored diagnostic algorithm compared to
      existing care for unexplained syncope.

      H3: A risk-tailored diagnostic algorithm can safely reduce the costs of evaluating
      unexplained syncope in older adults.

      Serum samples will be collected for standardized cardiac biomarker testing. Samples will be
      split into two aliquots for testing and long-term storage. Aliquots in long-term -80˚C
      storage will be used for future studies of novel tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age≥60 years; AND

          2. a complaint of syncope or near-syncope. Syncope is defined as a transient loss of
             consciousness (LOC), associated with loss of postural tone, with immediate,
             spontaneous, and complete recovery. Near-syncope is the sensation of imminent syncope
             without loss of consciousness.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Seizure as presumptive cause of LOC

          -  Stroke or transient ischemic attack as presumptive cause of LOC

          -  LOC AFTER head trauma Confusion from baseline mental status

          -  Intoxicated (alcohol or other drugs)

          -  Medical or electrical intervention to restore consciousness

          -  Hypoglycemia as presumptive cause of LOC

          -  inability to provide follow-up information, including patients who do not speak
             English (or Spanish, if applicable for study site), lack phone access, or lack a
             permanent address

          -  Inability or unwillingness of individual or legal guardian/representative to give
             written informed consent
