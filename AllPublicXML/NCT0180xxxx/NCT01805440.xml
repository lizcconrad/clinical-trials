      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the investigational drug
      uridine as a treatment for depressed adolescents with bipolar disorder (i.e. &quot;bipolar
      depression&quot;). Participants initially randomized to placebo who complete the 6-week protocol
      will be offered 6 months of open-label uridine treatment and follow-up. Participants
      initially randomized to uridine will be offered the open-label treatment as well.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the investigational drug
      uridine as a treatment for depressed adolescents with bipolar disorder (i.e. &quot;bipolar
      depression&quot;).

      In addition to treatment with the investigational drug versus placebo, the study includes a
      translational neuroimaging component: magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) brain scans
      are performed at baseline, and then repeated following 6 weeks of treatment with uridine or
      placebo. The scans do not use radiation, and are performed on a 3 Tesla MRI system that is
      approved for clinical use. The scans allow researchers to measure the concentrations of
      several chemicals in the brain that are believed to be involved in bipolar disorder and
      depression.

      The primary hypothesis is that uridine treatment will be associated with a significant
      decrease in GLX (i.e. glutamate + glutamine) levels, compared to placebo, in a part of the
      brain known as the anterior cingulate cortex.

      The secondary hypothesis is that decreased depressive symptoms measured with the Children
      Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale
      (MADRS) will be correlated with reductions in GLX.

      All participants who complete the initial 6-week protocol, including two brain scans, will be
      offered 6 months of open-label treatment with uridine.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is a safe, non-invasive method for measuring brain chemicals thought to be involved in mood disorders, such as GLX (glutamate + glutamine). Previous research indicates that adolescents with bipolar depression have elevated Glx concentrations, compared with controls. The measurement of Glx with 1H-MRS has the potential to identify translational biomarkers of juvenile BD pathophysiology and treatment response.</description>

    <measure>Change in Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS-R is a brief rating scale based on a semi-structured interview with the participant (and/or their parent or guardian). The scale can be administered and scored in under 30 minutes. The CDRS-R gives you a single summary score -- with an interpretation of, and clinical recommendations for, six different score ranges. Total possible scores range from 17 to 113, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms reported by the participant (and/or their parent or guardian).</description>

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is used to measure suicidal thoughts and behaviors in Investigational New Drug (IND) studies. The C-SSRS rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation (SI) on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; The scale identifies SI severity and intensity, which may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit suicide. C-SSRS SI severity subscale ranges from 0 (no SI) to 5 (active SI with plan and intent).</description>

        <title>Change in GLX (Glutamate + Glutamine) to Creatine (Cr) Ratio in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex of the Brain, as Measured With Proton-1 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS).</title>
        <description>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is a safe, non-invasive method for measuring brain chemicals thought to be involved in mood disorders, such as GLX (glutamate + glutamine). Previous research indicates that adolescents with bipolar depression have elevated Glx concentrations, compared with controls. The measurement of Glx with 1H-MRS has the potential to identify translational biomarkers of juvenile BD pathophysiology and treatment response.</description>

The C-SSRS rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation (SI) on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; The scale identifies SI severity and intensity, which may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit suicide. C-SSRS SI severity subscale ranges from 0 (no SI) to 5 (active SI with plan and intent).</description>
