  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The imbalance between anti- and pro-inflammation often occurs in patients with sepsis. And
      continuous such imbalance could lead to immunoparalysis, which is characterized by loss of
      delayed type hypersensitivity, failure of primary infections eradication, and a
      predisposition of secondary nosocomial infections development. However, in which phase of
      sepsis does immunoparalysis occur is still unknown. So this study aims to tentatively
      understand this problem by checking monocytes/macrophages` antigen presentation and cytokine
      secretion，and by checking monocytes/macrophages` expression of Tim-3 (the T cell
      transmembrane, immunoglobulin, and mucin-3), which is an inhibitory regulatory molecule, in
      sepsis patients` peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
