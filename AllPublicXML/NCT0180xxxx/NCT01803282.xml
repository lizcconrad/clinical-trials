  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, sequential dose-escalation, and expansion study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of andecaliximab
      (formerly GS-5745) alone and in combination with chemotherapy.

      The study consists of 2 parts (Parts A and B). Participants can only qualify for and
      participate in 1 part.

      Part A is a sequential dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      andecaliximab in participants with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to or intolerant
      to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. In Part A, participants will
      receive andecaliximab only. Part A will consist of between 12 to 48 participants.

      Part B is a dose expansion to obtain additional safety and tolerability data for
      andecaliximab in participants with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma,
      lung squamous cell carcinoma, esophagogastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, or breast
      cancer. In Part B, participants will receive andecaliximab in combination with
      standard-of-care chemotherapy. Part B will consist of between 115 to 295 participants.

      Please note the study is currently only recruiting in the breast cancer cohorts.
