      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Up to two documented common or external iliac artery lesions (one on each side), with
             &gt;50% diameter stenosis, suitable for stenting

          -  iliac artery reference vessel diameter of 5-10 mm

          -  Rutherford Category 1, 2, 3, or 4.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years of age

          -  lesion site &lt;10 or &gt;100 mm in length

          -  external iliac artery lesion visually estimated to be 100% occluded

          -  presence of infrarenal aortic aneurysm &gt;4 cm (treated or untreated)

          -  presence of any aneurysm (treated or untreated) within target vessel

          -  significant stenosis (&gt;50%) or occlusion of inflow tract (infrarenal aortic lesions)
             not successfully treated before this procedure (success is measured as &lt; 30% residual
             stenosis)

          -  absence of at least one patent runoff vessel with ≤ 50% stenosis throughout its course
             (i.e., confirmed in-line patency to the level of the foot)

          -  angiographically evident thrombus within the target vessel (treated or untreated)

          -  lesion is in an iliac artery that has been previously stented
