    <textblock>
      Nocturnal leg cramps is involuntary strong contraction of leg muscle, mostly in calves. It
      occurs suddenly and induces pain. Patients with frequent nocturnal leg cramps suffer from
      sleep disturbance in company with pain. In the present study, we examined the effects of the
      myofascial trigger point injections, which are known to be helpful for ease of nocturnal leg
      cramps, on pain and sleep disturbance in patients with nocturnal leg cramps with trigger
      points on gastrocnemius muscle.

    <intervention_name>Myofascial trigger point injections on gastrocnemius muscle</intervention_name>
    <description>On the first visit (T0), we record numeric rating scale (NRS), the frequency of cramps and insomnia severity index using questionnaires. Then we check trigger points of gastrocnemius muscle and inject lidocaine 1 ~ 2 ml each up to four points. One week later (T1) we record numeric rating scale (NRS), the frequency of cramps and insomnia severity index again, check trigger points, and if any, inject lidocaine. If the patient do not come, we get numeric rating scale (NRS), the frequency of cramps and insomnia severity index over the telephone. Two weeks after the first visit (T2), we repeat the procedure of the first visit (T0). And four weeks after the first visit (T3) we record numeric rating scale (NRS), the frequency of cramps and insomnia severity index through face-to-face interview or by telephone.</description>
