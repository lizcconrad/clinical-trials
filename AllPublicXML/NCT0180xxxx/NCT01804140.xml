  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a screening study to detect BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients for enrollment into
      clinical research studies of Zelboraf (vemurafenib). Tumor samples will be collected and
      analyzed from eligible patients with solid tumors (other than metastatic melanoma or
      papillary thyroid cancer) or multiple myeloma. All institutions with identified patients as
      defined by this screening protocol will have potential access to the separate vemurafenib
      protocol MO28072.

    <description>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPEs) tumor samples (at least 5 serially-cut, unstained, 5 micrometer [μm] sections) were collected from eligible participants who consented to participate in the study. FFPE tumor samples were either from archived sections (from the initial diagnosis of cancer) or from fresh biopsies that were performed according to local standards. Tumor samples were then sent to a central laboratory to identify activating BRAF V600 mutations.

        <description>FFPEs tumor samples (at least 5 serially-cut, unstained, 5 μm sections) were collected from eligible participants who consented to participate in the study. FFPE tumor samples were either from archived sections (from the initial diagnosis of cancer) or from fresh biopsies that were performed according to local standards. Tumor samples were then sent to a central laboratory to identify activating BRAF V600 mutations. Identification of mutations was done using bidirectional direct Sanger sequencing procedure. V600E, V600K, V600D, and V600R are the different types of BRAF V600 mutations.</description>
