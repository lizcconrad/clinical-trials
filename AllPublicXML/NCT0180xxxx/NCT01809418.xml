      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that a new device would produce a significant
      decrease in obstructive breathing events during sleep as indexed by the Apnea Hyperpnoea
      Index (AHI) or Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) and measures of oxygen saturation during
      sleep.

    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) syndrome is a disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of
      upper airway obstruction that occur during sleep. Associated features include loud snoring
      and fragmented non-refreshing sleep and have profound impact on quality of life, on safety on
      the roads and at work, and on the cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that a new device would produce a significant
      decrease in obstructive breathing events during sleep as indexed by the AHI/RDI and measures
      of oxygen saturation during sleep.
