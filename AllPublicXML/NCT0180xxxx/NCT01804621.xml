    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to implement a randomized control trial testing effects of
      information scanning on cancer prevention and screening behaviors in a population sample of
      50-70 year olds. Participants will receive one of five versions of an e-newsletter once/month
      for 12 months and will be asked to complete baseline, mid-point, and end-of-project surveys.
