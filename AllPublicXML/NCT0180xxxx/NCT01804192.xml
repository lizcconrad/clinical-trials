  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners believe that health can be maintained if the
      body has a balanced ying-yang or the qi flows in correct strength and quality along the
      meridians.Stimulation of the acupoints such as by acupuncture can awaken and modulate qi in
      the channels and is able to regulate and restore yin-yang balance.However, there are some
      drawbacks associated with acupuncture which may limit its applications. These include
      transmission of infectious disease, pneumothorax and other problems associated with organ
      punctures, cardiac tamponade, and broken needles with remnants migrating to other
      locations.Studies have shown that when TENS is applied over acupoints (Acu-TENS), it is
      effective in reducing dyspnoea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease,facilitate early haemodynamic recovery after open-heart surgery,relieve labor
      pain,increase in blood β-endorphin level,reduce blood pressure changes in normal healthy
      subjects and decrease airway resistance.Despite these promising results, how Acu-TENS works
      still remain unclear.This study aimed to investigate the effects of Acu-TENS over Hegu (LI4)
      and Quichi (LI4) on the autonomic nervous system activities and to investigate whether the
      subject could experience distinct sensation as deqi.
