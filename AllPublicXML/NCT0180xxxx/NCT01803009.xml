  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the impact of risk assessment tools on decision-making by patients and
      clinicians. In particular, even though the NCI Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is one
      of the most prominent risk assessment tools available, no study has quantified its usability
      or impact on decision-making or uptake of screening. In this study, we will measure patients'
      satisfaction with the NCI CRC RAT, their perception of its usability and helpfulness, and its
      impact on their decision-making and behavior. In addition, we will assess the impact of
      adding information about their chance of having an advanced adenoma.
