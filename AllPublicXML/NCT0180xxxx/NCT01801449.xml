  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) is a condition that causes repeated
      episodes of inflammation. People with DIRA can have rashes, fever, and joint pain. Most
      treatments for DIRA are intended to control the immune system to stop these inflammations.
      There are drugs that can treat DIRA, but they have to be given daily as injections.
      Researchers want to try another drug, rilonacept, as a treatment for DIRA. It needs to be
      given only once a week. Rilonacept will be given to individuals who are at least 3 months old
      and who have DIRA.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of rilonacept for children and adults with DIRA.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 3 months old who have DIRA.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Other tests to study pain and movement will be given. Imaging
           studies such as bone density scans and x-rays may also be taken.

        -  Participants will have a minimum of four to five study visits over 12 months. Those who
           are on different anti-inflammatory drugs (such as anakinra) will stop taking them before
           beginning the study visits.

        -  Participants will have rilonacept injections weekly while on this study. The dose will
           be adjusted as needed to help treat the DIRA symptoms. Participants will keep a diary to
           monitor their symptoms and any side effects.

        -  Treatment with rilonacept will be given for 1 year. Participants will have study visits
           to monitor the treatment. They will provide blood samples and have other tests at these
           study visits.

    <textblock>
      Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that,
      unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or
      antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that specific
      cytokine pathways are dysregulated. Monogenic defects in the IL-1 pathway cause cryopyrin
      associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA),
      the latter is caused by mutations affecting the IL-1-receptor antagonist gene (IL1RN). Both
      disorders respond with complete resolution of the inflammatory response to treatment with the
      short acting IL-1 blocking agent anakinra. This exploratory study aims to examine the utility
      of the long acting IL-1 inhibitor rilonacept (rilonacept; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)

      This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility and dosage of rilonacept needed to
      achieve inflammatory remission in children with DIRA who have shown a response to treatment
      with anakinra [Kineret[registered]]; and 2) to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics in
      young children on rilonacept.

      Rilonacept is a recombinant fusion protein with picomolar affinity for IL-1 and a half-life
      of approximately 7.5 days in humans. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of adults and children 12 years of age and older with Cryopyrin-Associated
      Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), and was tested in the clinically milder forms of CAPS including
      Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS).

      In this study, clinical, and laboratory parameters will initially be measured at baseline
      following a withdrawal of anakinra for 24 hours. Subjects will receive a course of therapy
      with rilonacept that is predicted to induce inflammatory remission. Clinical and laboratory
      measures of inflammation will be assessed; rilonacept dose escalation will be implemented as
      necessary to achieve clinical and laboratory remission. Subjects will remain on study for 12
      months and primary end point will be evaluated at 6 months.

      Those subjects who complete the 1-year treatment period and maintain improved clinical and
      laboratory parameters compared to baseline values, may continue to receive study medication
      at their current dose. Principal investigator will help to obtain insurance coverage for
      rilonacept for their continued treatment, and will discuss with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,
      Inc. for additional supplies of rilonacept for these subjects.

                  indicating DIRA. For the first five patients enrolled, they must have been on a
                  stable dose of anakinra during the 2-week period prior to screening visit. If the
                  subject is on other medications such as NSAIDs, methotrexate and/or oral
                  steroids, it is a requirement that these doses have been stable during the 2-week
                  period prior to screening visit.

               2. Subjects greater or equal to 3 months of age (however the first 5 patients
                  enrolled will be over 2 years of age). Subjects 3 months old or older will be
                  enrolled after SMC data review of the first 5 enrolled patients.

               3. Participation in NIH study #03-AR-0173 ( Studies of the Natural History,

                  prior to treatment with anakinra will be sufficient. Subjects will not take
                  anakinra 24 hours before initiation of drug treatment. Treatment naive patients
                  will also be enrolled after SMC data review of the first 5 enrolled patients.

               5. Females of childbearing potential (young women who have had at least one
                  menstrual period regardless of age) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at

        <title>Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ)</title>
        <description>The Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) is a patient self-assessment (or parent assessment) tool for how illness affects ability to function in daily life. Includes overall score, overall pain rating, overall global evaluation, subcategories for dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. Measured on scale of 0-3 from 'Without any difficulty' (0) to 'Unable to do' (3). The scores are summed and divided by the number of total categories answered to arrive at a final value.</description>

          <description>The Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) is a patient self-assessment (or parent assessment) tool for how illness affects ability to function in daily life. Includes overall score, overall pain rating, overall global evaluation, subcategories for dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. Measured on scale of 0-3 from 'Without any difficulty' (0) to 'Unable to do' (3). The scores are summed and divided by the number of total categories answered to arrive at a final value.</description>
