      The purpose of this study will be to find out the effect of two different interventions on
      muscle strength, ability to produce muscle force quickly (power), daily function, and number
      of steps and physical activity an individual with total knee replacement do daily.

      The research hypotheses for this study will be as follows:

        -  For individuals who are at least 6 months post-total knee replacement, home-based
           high-velocity training exercises will result in significantly greater improvements in
           muscle strength and power compared to those who receive a walking program only.

        -  For individuals who are at least 6 months post-total knee replacement, home based
           high-velocity training exercises will result in significantly greater improvements of
           daily function(eg. sit to stand, climb a set of stairs)than those who receive a walking
           program only.

        -  For individuals who are at least 6 months post-total knee replacement, home based
           high-velocity training exercises will result in significantly greater improvements in
           physical activity behavior (eg. number of steps per day)compared to those who receive a
           walking program only.

    <description>Exercise group Consist of functional exercises such as mini-squats, sit to stand, and exercises with use of thera-bands. For each exercise, participants will be taught to perform the concentric phase forcefully and as fast as they can and return to the initial position slowly and with control. Participants will be asked to perform the exercises 3 times per week as a home exercise program daily throughout the 8-week intervention period. Additionally, they will be asked to wear a pedometer daily throughout the 8-week intervention to monitor steps. A step goal will be provided to gradually increase daily to become &quot;somewhat active&quot; or &quot;active&quot; by the end of the 8-week intervention.</description>
