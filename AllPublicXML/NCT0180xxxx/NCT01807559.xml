      The objective of this multi-site observational study is to further assess the long-term
      patient use of the Sonitus SoundBite Hearing System. Information can be gained by assessing
      benefit for the subjects that were enrolled in the SoundBite Hearing System Long Term Multi
      Site Study (Protocol CLN006) for an additional 12 months.

    <description>The Sonitus Medical SoundBite Hearing System prosthetic device is a bone conduction device that has been FDA cleared for the treatment of single-sided deafness (SSD) and conductive hearing loss (CHL). The Sonitus Medical SoundBite Hearing System consists of an In-the-Mouth (ITM) component, an external microphone component worn behind the ear (BTE), a calibration interface cable and PC-controlled software for subject calibration. A charger is also provided to charge the ITM and the BTE. The objective of this study is multi-site observational study is to asses the long-term patient use of the Sonitus Medical SoundBite Hearing System.</description>

        All trial subjects are individuals who are already currently using SoundBite Hearing System
        for treatment of their SSD or CHL and were enrolled in the SoundBite Hearing System Long
        Term Multi Site Patient Use Study (Protocol CLN0006). Participants are willing to
        participate in this study.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who previously were enrolled in SoundBite Hearing System Long Term Multi Site
             Patient Use Study (Protocol CLN006) and completed the 12 month study visit.

          -  Additionally, subjects must meet one of the two criteria for hearing loss:

               1. Moderately severe, severe, or profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear and
                  normal hearing in the other ear (i.e. single sided deafness or &quot;SSD&quot;). Normal
                  hearing is defined as a pure tone average (PTA) air-conduction (AC) hearing
                  threshold (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) of better than or equal to 25 dB HL.

                  OR

               2. Conductive hearing loss where the pure tone average bone-conduction hearing
                  threshold (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) is better than or equal to 25 dB HL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that do not meet one of the two the audiometric criteria as measured on the
             audiogram for the 12 month study appointment for Protocol CLN006:

               1. A moderately severe, severe, or profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear
                  and normal hearing in the other ear (i.e. single sided deafness or ―SSD‖). Normal
                  hearing is defined as a pure tone average (PTA) air-conduction (AC) hearing
                  threshold (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) of better than or equal to 25 dB HL.

               2. Patients with conductive hearing loss where the pure tone average bone-conduction
                  hearing threshold (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) is better than or equal to
                  25 dB HL

                    -  The SoundBite Hearing System and all portions of it are contraindicated for
                       use in an MRI Environment and should be removed prior to MRI exposure

                    -  The SoundBite Hearing System is not to be used in patients with known
                       hypersensitivity to any of the components including allergies to polymers.

                    -  The SoundBite Hearing system is contraindicated for vulnerable populations
                       that are unable to use their hands such as paraplegics or others that are
                       unable to comply with the warnings in the product's labeling.
