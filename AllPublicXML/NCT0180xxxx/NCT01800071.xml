    <textblock>
      This clinical study is looking at a vaccine called MVA-EBNA1/LMP2. This is a new vaccine that
      has already been studied in small number of cancer patients.

      The vaccine is designed to boost a patient's immunity against a common virus. The virus is
      called Epstein Barr virus or EBV. EBV is sometimes found inside cancer cells and is commonly
      found in nasopharyngeal cancer cells.

      The main aims of the clinical study are to find out more about how the immune system responds
      to the vaccine, more about the potential side effects of the vaccine and the effects of
      giving an additional booster vaccination on the immune system.

      Approximately 18 patients with EBV positive nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) will be recruited to
      the trial. Patients will receive up to four vaccinations with the MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine. The
      first three vaccines will be given at 3 weekly intervals, followed by a fourth vaccine 12
      weeks later. The vaccine will be given by intradermal injection with the dose divided across
      multiple injection sites on the arm, or on the thigh.

      Patients will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from first vaccination and
      attend hospital approximately 11 times during this period. Standard safety assessments will
      be performed throughout the trial and at each clinic visit patients will be asked to provide
      research blood samples. These samples will be used to monitor the effects of the vaccine on
      the patient's immune system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed NPC in which the presence of EBV has been confirmed in the
             tumour by immunohistochemistry for viral antigens or EBV early RNA (EBER) fluorescent
             in situ hybridisation (FISH).

          2. Patients in remission or with current disease for whom no standard therapy is
             currently appropriate or required.

          3. Patients who have received primary treatment for their malignancy (radiotherapy ±
             chemotherapy) and up to one additional second-line course of therapy.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          5. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix 1).

          6. Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These
             measurements must be performed within one week (Day -7 to Day 1) before the patient
             receives their first vaccination with MVA-EBNA1/LMP2.

             Laboratory Test Value required Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥10.0 g/dL, Lymphocyte count ≥0.5 x
             10^9/L after ≥ 6 weeks have elapsed from completion of chemotherapy, Absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 x 10^9/L, Platelet count ≥ 75 x 10^9/L, Serum bilirubin
             ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) AND alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) OR aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN, Calculated
             creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (uncorrected value)

          7. 18 years or over.

          8. Written (signed and dated) informed consent and be capable of co-operating with

          3. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia

             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree
             to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted
             hormonal contraception and condom, have a intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or
             neonate.
