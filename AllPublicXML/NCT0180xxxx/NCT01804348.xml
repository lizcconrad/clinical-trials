      Clinical diagnosis of amniotic fluid leak will be determined, according the hospital standard
      procedure, using pooling test and/or sterile speculum examination and /or pH test, and
      AmniSure, N-Dia, Inc. (immunoassay for diagnosis of ruptured fetal membranes (ROM)). Amniotic
      fluid leak test, using the AL- SENSE 1-Step device, will be considered positive in case of
      presence of a blue or green or grey stain on a yellow background of the AL-SENSE 1-Step, as
      observed by the patient and the clinician (positive/negative).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women arriving at the hospital and reporting unidentified wetness (undetermined
      whether they sense amniotic fluid leakage or urinary incontinence) will receive a single
      AL-SENSE 1-Step to use up to 12 hours or until they notice any wetness. The clinician will
      explain the proper use and handling of the AL-SENSE 1-Step and how to read the result.

      In each case, the subject and the clinician/midwife (non bias to the hospital standard
      procedure results) will be required to read and record any occurrence of color change of the
      AL-SENSE 1-Step immediately after removing the test to mark if it changes color to blue or to
      green or to grey on the designated form.

      The non bias physician, who is not aware to the AL-SENSE 1-Step result (other than the
      clinician/midwife who records the AL-SENSE 1-Step results) will perform a diagnosis tests for
      amniotic fluid leak detection, according to the hospital standard procedure.

      The investigator will compare the AL-SENSE 1-Step results reading of the patient to the
      clinical diagnosis.
