        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female ≥18 years old

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed solid tumors who:

             o Part 1: have tumor progression following standard therapy, have treatment-refractory
             disease, or for whom there is no effective standard of therapy

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of
             initiation of dosing and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control.
             Women of non-childbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically
             sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥1 year. Fertile men must also agree to use an
             acceptable method of birth control while on study drug and up to 3 months after the
             last dose of study drug.

          -  All associated toxicity from previous or concurrent cancer therapy must be resolved
             (to ≤Grade 1 or Baseline) prior to study treatment administration

          -  Patients with stable, treated brain metastases are eligible for this trial. However,
             patients must not have required steroid treatment for their brain metastases within 30
             days of Screening.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study related
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥70%

          -  Life expectancy ≥3 months

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Other than the primary malignancy, active cancer (either concurrent or within the last
             3 years) that requires non-surgical therapy (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation therapy),
             with the exception of surgically treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             melanoma in situ, or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix

          -  Chemotherapy within 28 days prior to C1D1

          -  Biological therapy within 5 half-lives prior to C1D1

          -  Radiation therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives prior to C1D1, whichever is longer

          -  Investigational drug use within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to
             C1D1

          -  Part 1 only: (a) Patients with active or a history of glucose intolerance or diabetes
             mellitus and (b) Hemoglobin A1c ≥7%

          -  ≥Grade 2 sensory neuropathy at baseline

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (i.e., active infection) or concurrent condition
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study endpoints or
             the patient's ability to participate

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, small bowel resection that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would preclude adequate absorption

          -  Mean QTcF ≥450 msec (for males) or ≥470 msec (for females) at Screening

          -  The presence of a medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, makes the patient inappropriate for inclusion in this study
