  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and recombinant activated factor VII
      (rFVIIa) are the only two drugs that are available to treat bleeds in haemophilia A patients
      with high titer inhibitors. However, management of bleeds in these patients can be
      challenging due to variation in response and lack of standardized methods to monitor the
      effect. We hypothesized that significant increase in whole blood clot stability could be
      achieved when tranexamic acid was given concomitantly with bypassing-agents while thrombin
      generation remains unaffected. In this prospective crossover study the effect of aPCC and
      rFVIIa with and without TXA on clot stability and thrombin generation capacity (ETP) were
      studied, using thromboelastography (ROTEM) and thrombin generation assay (TGA), respectively.
      In addition, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was
      assessed.

      Patients receive the first day aPCC (75IU/kg) and aPCC in addition to TXA (20mg/kg orally)
      the second day. After a 14 days washout period they crosse over using rFVIIa (90 µg/kg)
      otherwise the same experimental setup. Blood sampling is performed at baseline, 15, 30, 60,
      120, 180 and 240 minutes post-treatment.
