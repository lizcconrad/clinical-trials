  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness and
      safety of two transvaginal apical suspension strategies for uterovaginal prolapse: a mesh
      augmented hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy and uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS).
      The primary aim is to determine whether treatment success in women who undergo the above
      strategies differ at time points through 3 years.

      A supplemental study investigates anterior vaginal wall movement resulting from descent or
      rotation of the vaginal apex and/or anterior vaginal elongation, in women in both of the
      study arms of SUPeR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be adult women (&gt;21 years of age) with symptomatic uterovaginal
      prolapse at or beyond the hymen who desire vaginal surgical management. This study is
      intended to be done only on women who have completed child-bearing and have an inactive
      uterus, defined as amenorrhea for 1 year. Therefore women will be postmenopausal or will have
      amenorrhea from an endometrial ablation. Amenorrhea caused from exogenous steroids, or
      hypothalamic disorders will not allow inclusion.

      Participants will be obtained from the clinic population of each of the eight Pelvic Floor
      Disorders Network (PFDN) sites. Participants will be randomly assigned to have either vaginal
      hysterectomy and USLS or mesh hysteropexy suspension for treatment of their uterovaginal
      prolapse. The surgical assignment will be revealed in the operating room, after the
      participant is under anesthesia.

      Participants will be followed for at least 36-months (3-years) post surgery and up to a
      maximum of 60-months (5-years). Follow-up data will be obtained during in-person clinic
      visits, and study staff who are masked to the surgical assignment will be the primary person
      who obtain follow-up data. Although the primary study outcome does not depend on masked
      participants and blinded evaluators, several important participant reported secondary aims
      are subject to reporting bias if the participant is aware of her study assignment. Therefore,
      study participants, coordinators, and nurses will be masked to the study assignment. Study
      surgeons and anatomic evaluators will be unmasked. Evaluators conducting the POPQ exam will
      be a co-investigator, fellow or other qualified nurse who did not perform the study surgery.

      Surgical failure rates will be compared using survival analysis approaches appropriate for
      interval censored data (classic log-rank tests and survival models using a generalized linear
      model approach with a complementary log-log link) and secondary outcomes will be reported as
      rates in each group or as group means and evaluated with the appropriate parametric or
      nonparametric statistical tests.

      Throughout the study, the PFDN Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMB) will review study
      data and decide if the study can or cannot continue. Additionally, this study will adhere to
      the CONSORT guidelines for performing and reporting randomized controlled trials (Begg et al
      1996). Women who are eligible but decline enrollment will be characterized in a manner
      consistent with CONSORT requirements.

    <description>Bothersome vaginal bulge symptoms = positive response to Question 3 of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - 20 (PFDI-20): Do you usually have a bulge or something falling out that you can see or feel in your vaginal area? AND any degree of bother.

    <description>The efficacy of the study surgeries will be determined via collecting anatomic and functional data on participants, at the above mentioned time periods. Anatomic data will be obtained via the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) exam. Functional data will be obtained via a number of participant-completed measures. Specific secondary outcome measures are:
Patient perceived improvement in prolapse - PGI-I
Prolapse change - prolapse symptoms score from POPDI-6 of the PFDI-20
Urinary function post-operatively - UDI-6 of the PFDI-20
Recovery of urinary function post-operatively - duration of catheterization
Urinary function post-operatively - the Hunskaar Incontinence Severity Index
Sexual function post-operatively - the PISQ-IR
Post-operative bowel function-Colorectal - CRADI-8 of the PFDI-20
General quality of life - SF-12
Pelvic-organ related quality of life - PFIQ -7

    <description>The safety of the study surgeries will be determined via collection of data on adverse events, such as mesh related complications (mesh exposure in the vagina, mesh erosion in the viscera, and suture exposure in the vagina and in the viscera), occurrence of additional surgery, and categorization of intra- and post-operative complications using a modification of the Dindo Classification.</description>

    <description>The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a payer perspective and will be expressed as incremental cost required to produce one additional unit of quality-adjusted life year (QALY). At the above time points, data will be collected on: 1) each participant's use of medical and non-medical resources related to urologic or gynecologic conditions, 2) direct and indirect costs of the treatment of each of the study surgeries, and 3) participants preference for health states for improvement in pelvic organ prolapse will be estimated.</description>
