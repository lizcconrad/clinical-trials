      The objectives of this trial are:

      Primary objectives:

        1. To determine among HIV+ individuals whether varenicline or NRT is more effective at
           helping individuals remain abstinent from smoking tobacco.

        2. To determine among HIV+ individuals whether varenicline or NRT has the lowest
           side-effect profile.

        3. To determine if the HIV tailored Quit Smoking Counselling Intervention, plus smoking
           cessation drug therapy, improves smoking cessation rates compared to smoking cessation
           drug therapy alone with usual care.

      Secondary objective:

      1. To determine whether the use of varenicline/NRT is safe in HIV+ patients who exhibit
      depressive symptoms.

      Hypothesis:

      That varenicline will result in higher quit smoking rates and that NRT will result in a lower
      side effect profile. Further, the HIV tailored quit smoking intervention will result in
      higher rates of smoking cessation over and above the pharmacological treatment alone. And
      finally, varenicline will be safe to use for HIV + individuals who exhibit depressive
      symptoms.

    <description>The primary study end-point will be seven-day self-reported abstinence, and four week continuous abstinence rates at week 48, confirmed by expired carbon monoxide levels measured using a piCO+ Smokerlyzer (Smoke free defined as exhaled CO &lt; 10 ppm). Study participants who are lost to follow-up (e.g., study drop-outs and those unavailable for follow-up) will be considered as smokers for the purposes of outcome analyses.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Study Medication: Adherence to NRT and varenicline will be assessed by participant self-reported adherence to medication at each study visit.
Counseling Intervention: Each clinic site will have an HIV clinic health care provider who will be trained in administering the standardized HIV quit smoking intervention.
Program Satisfaction Form will be completed by all study participants at the end of the study. At post-quit dates, treatment adherence will be assessed by a self-report measure of the amount of NRT or varenicline taken, number of cigarettes smoked in the previous 7 days, and marked changes in mood.
Study coordinator will assess rates of discontinuation of varenicline or NRT. Participants who discontinue varenicline or NRT will still be followed according to the original schedule.</description>

    <description>Drug: Nicotine Replacement Therapy (Nico-Derm® and Nicorette®)
Dose: 7mg - 42mg depending on # of cigarettes smoked per day at study baseline, and withdrawal symptoms.
Mode of Administration: Transdermal Patch
Duration of Treatment: up to 24 Weeks
Additionally, participants will be provided with a supply of short-acting nicotine gum in order to supplement their long acting NRT patch regimen.
Individuals who smoke their first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking are advised to use the 2 mg NRT gum. Participants who smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking will be advised to use the 4 mg NRT gum. Both NRT gum dosages will be recommended for use on an ad lib basis to address cravings and/or withdrawal symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 pieces of NRT gum per day.</description>
