      Alopecia Areata (AA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease causing nonscarring hair
      loss. Many treatment modalities have been found to be helpful in AA, however, none on them
      cure the disease. UVB excimer light has recently emerged as a new therapeutic modality in
      many dermatologic diseases. There are no prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of UVB excimer light in AA. We plan on conducting a prospective split
      lesion single-blinded randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of UVB excimer
      light in the treatment of AA.

      Alopecia Areata (AA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease causing nonscarring hair
      loss. Many treatment modalities have been found to be helpful in AA, however, none on them
      cure the disease.

      Excimer laser has been shown to be effective in the treatment of AA in controlled studies.
      The main disadvantage of the previous studies evaluating excimer laser is choosing separate
      patches as a control which does not account for interlesional treatment response variability.
      UVB excimer light has recently emerged as a new therapeutic modality in many dermatologic
      diseases. However, there are only a few studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of UVB
      excimer light in AA. Those studies have shown that UVB excimer light is effective in the
      treatment of AA but none of them was conducted in a controlled fashion.

      There are no prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      UVB excimer light in AA. We plan on conducting a prospective split lesion single-blinded
      randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of UVB excimer light in the treatment
      of AA.

      Study Objectives

        1. To evaluate the potential for UVB excimer light to induce hair regrowth within AA
           patches.

        2. To assess the side effect profile of UVB excimer light when used in the treatment of AA.

    <description>Patches of alopecia will be treated twice weekly with UVB excimer light. Only one half of a single alopecia areata patch will be treated. In order to treat the same half during each visit, a transparent sheet will be marked, using a marking pen, to delineate the borders of the treatment area with a central dividing line. The other half will be covered and used as a control. Treatments will be given randomly (by sealed envelope randomization method) into one of the two halves in different patients but will be given into the same half in each patient in all treatment sessions. Only one investigator will know the intervention each half has received. A total of 23 treatments will be given over 12 weeks.</description>
