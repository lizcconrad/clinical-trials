    <description>The purpose of this experimental group is to evaluate the effectiveness of informational counseling alone. This type of counseling is considered the standard of care in audiologic practice. Patients in this will review this material in detail with a member of the study team for approximately 30 minutes at the second visit. Spouses in this experimental group will be will review material regarding VA services with a member of the study team for about 30 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The purpose of this experimental group is to evaluate the influence of spousal involvement when receiving informational counseling. In this manner, both patients and spouses are presented with the same information regarding hearing loss and hearing aids. Couples in this experimental group will be given the same information that the patients in the first group were given. At the second visit, couples in this group will review this information together with a member of the research team for approximately 30 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Patient Centered Counseling,patient only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In order to assess the effects of enhanced patient-centered counseling (PCC), the patients assigned to this group will meet together with either Dr. Lewis or the Research Audiologist for approximately 30 minutes of counseling. In addition to the PCC techniques used in audiology, this counseling also will involve the core components of motivational interviewing. These principles and methods will be used to allow the patient to clearly express his/her expectations of, concerns about, and motivations for hearing-aid use. The spouses in this experimental group will be given information regarding VA services. This material will be reviewed with a member of the research team for about 30 minutes at the second visit.</description>

    <description>In order to assess the influence of the spouse on the enhanced PCC process, the couples assigned to this group will meet together with either Dr. Lewis or the Research Audiologist for approximately 30 minutes of counseling. This counseling will be conducted with both the patient and the spouse together, giving both partners time to express their thoughts.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: Both men and women with hearing loss and their live-in partners will
        serve as subjects in this study. The subjects with hearing loss will have a mild to
        moderately-severe hearing loss in both of the ears, will have word recognition scores of
        40% or better bilaterally, and will be about to get new hearing aids. Live-in partners may
        also have up to a moderately-severe degree of hearing loss but cannot have prior experience
        with hearing aids nor have plans to get hearing aids during the course of their
        participation in this study. Their word recognition scores should also be 40% or better
        bilaterally. All subjects also will meet the following additional inclusion criteria:

          1. Age 20-85 years;

          2. Intact mental status as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein,
             Folstein &amp; McHugh, 1975);

          3. No evidence of any major medical illness requiring long-term assistive care, as
             determined by the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz,
