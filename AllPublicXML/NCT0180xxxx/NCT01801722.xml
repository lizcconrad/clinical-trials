  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the analysis of NT-proBNP might be used as an
      initial step for the diagnosis of chronic heart failure in patients with COPD in primary
      health care, and to select patients for a further examination by echocardiography.

    <textblock>
      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD were examined regarding chronic heart failure.

        1. An interview regarding symptoms: breathlessness, orthopnoea, night cough, nocturia,
           walking distance.

        2. Physical examination: weight and height, heart and lung auscultation, blood pressure
           measurement after 5 minutes' rest in the sitting position and the presence of peripheral
           oedema.

        3. Electrocardiography.

        4. Natriuretic peptide- NT-proBNP (Immulite 2500, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics AB
           Sweden).

        5. Patients with the NT-proBNP level of &gt; 1200 pg/ml were referred for echocardiography to
           assess left ventricular function.
