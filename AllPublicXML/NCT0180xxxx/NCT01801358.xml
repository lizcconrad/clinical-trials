    <textblock>
      A phase Ib dose-escalation study of the AEB071 and MEK162 combination in adult patients with
      confirmed metastatic uveal melanoma. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be assessed for dose
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination therapy is determined. The MTD or Phase 2 Recommended Dose (P2RD) will be used in
      a Phase II part of the study, which will enrol 55 patients each into two randomized groups:
      the combination therapy or MEK162 alone. The Phase II part will continue until proof of
      concept is established. Patients will continue treatment as long as clinical benefit is seen
      and no limiting adverse toxicity is observed

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to halted enrollment, the Phase II part of the study was not conducted. The Sponsor
      decided to permanently stop recruitment for the study prior to MTD determination.

      Remaining patients on treatment with binimetinib and sotrastaurin who were considered by the
      Investigator to be benefiting from their treatment could have continued treatment and were to
      be followed up as per protocol. No patients were ongoing as of the data cut-off date. After
      the last patient last visit (LPLV) was declared, the study was terminated.

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (up to 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value as defined in the protocol that is assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first 28 days of treatment with AEB071 and MEK162.</description>

    <measure>Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>

    <description>The time from date of randomization to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause.
Due to an enrollment halt, the Phase II part of the study was not conducted. The sponsor decided to permanently stop recruitment for the study prior to MTD determination.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1) to time to progression (up to 18 months from Last Patient First Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that occur after patient's signed informed consent has been obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase Ib/II: The Number of Subjects Experiencing At Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1) to time to progression (up to 18 months from Last Patient First Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one of the following:
Is fatal or life-threatening
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is medically significant
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Note that hospitalizations for the following reasons should not be reported as serious adverse events:
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition
Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to metastatic uveal melanoma and has not worsened since signing the informed consent
Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient's general condition</description>

        <description>Assessment of the preliminary anti-tumor activity of AEB071 and MEK162 in combination.
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>
