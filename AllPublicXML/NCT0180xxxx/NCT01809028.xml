  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the amount of tissue, called &quot;cell block&quot;, obtained from your pancreas.
      Patients who are asked to participate in this study have a growth (mass) in the pancreas that
      needs a biopsy so a diagnosis can be made. Although we usually perform 2 to 4 passes (number
      of times the doctor biopsies the mass), at this time we do not know the ideal number of
      passes needed to obtain adequate amount of tissue for making a diagnosis. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the amount of tissue obtained with 2 passes versus 4 passes.

      Primary Aim:

      To compare the number of passes required for obtaining adequate cell block material during
      EUS-guided FNA of solid pancreatic mass lesions.

      Primary Research Hypothesis:

      More specimen is required to obtain definitive diagnosis on cell block. This translates to
      less need for repeat procedures (due to nondiagnostic index procedure due to inadequate FNA
      passes), prompt treatment to patients and better use of health care resources. Therefore, we
      will be comparing 2 versus 4 FNA passes to determine which number of FNA pases will yield an
      adequate diagnostic cell block.

      Secondary Aims:

      To compare the rate of complications when performing 2 versus 4 EUS-FNA passes of solid
      pancreatic mass lesions.

      Secondary Research Hypothesis:

      EUS-guided FNA is a safe procedure with a complication rate of &lt; 1%. By performing more
      (four) NA passes one is likely to yield a better quality cell block while at the same time
      without compromising patient safety.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to compare the number of passes required to make definitive diagnosis on cell block. This will be assessed by amount (quantity) of the sample to make the diagnosis proportionate to which group the subject was randomized to (two passes versus four passes).</description>
