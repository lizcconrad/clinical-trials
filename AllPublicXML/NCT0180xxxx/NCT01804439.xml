  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important public health problem that affects millions of
      people worldwide. Associations between risk factors, such as smoking, dyslipidaemia or
      hypertension, and prevalent CVD are well documented. However, few studies have investigated
      associations with onset of disease. The initial manifestation of CVD, for example an episode
      of unstable angina, is important because it influences the prognosis, the quality of life and
      the management of disease. Furthermore, the extent to which social deprivation, alcohol
      consumption or atrial fibrillation affects presentation of CVD is poorly understood and
      deserves further consideration.

      Most previous studies have considered CVD as a single entity. However, differences in
      aetiology between coronary phenotypes suggest that risk factors may not be shared across
      specific coronary phenotypes and their relative importance is likely to differ for each
      phenotype. Gaining knowledge of these differences could provide insights into the
      pathophysiology of specific forms of CVD and could eventually lead to modification of
      recommendations for patient management and disease prevention.

      We propose to use the linkage of the national registry of coronary events to general practice
      records in the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), to investigate whether
      demographic, behavioral, and clinico-metabolic risk factors differentially influence the
      onset of specific types of CVD.

    <description>We will report findings from the CALIBER (CArdiovascular disease research using Linked BEspoke studies and Electronic Records) collaboration where we linked primary care data (from the General Practice Research Database [GPRD]) to three further sources of electronic health records: the Myocardial Ischemia National Audit Project registry (MINAP),cause specific discharge data from Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) and cause specific mortality from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</description>

        The study population will include all patients aged ≥30yrs old, registered in CPRD
        practices in England consenting to data linkage, with at least 1 year of up-to-standard
        pre-study follow-up and no history of any of the CVD endpoints considered. Follow-up for
