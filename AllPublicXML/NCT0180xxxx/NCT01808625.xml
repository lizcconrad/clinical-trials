  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for brain malignancies and is associated with
      significant neurotoxicity. Due to continuous increase in patient's survival, the long term
      risk for radiation-induced brain inflammation and necrosis inducing secondary cognitive
      impairments are increasing concerns. Currently there is no effective treatment for preventing
      long term radiation-induced brain damage.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the administration of high oxygen concentrations within a
      pressurized chamber to increase the cellular/mitochondrial delivery of oxygen. Oxygen
      stimulation by HBOT has become the definitive therapy for radiation-induced damage to soft
      tissues and bone due to its ability to stimulate healing processes by supplying the
      energy/oxygen needed while down-regulating genes involved in inflammation. Oxygen stimulation
      by HBOT is currently indicated for patients with overt radiation-induced neurotoxicity and
      was proven to reduce further development of radiation damage while stimulating &quot;idling&quot;
      neurons to return to function. Since HBOT is considered safe, we hypothesize that its
      application following radiation, before the manifestation of neurological side effects, may
      help avert development of early/delayed onset radiation-induced neurotoxicity.

      In the proposed study, for the first time, HBOT will be applied early after radiation to
      prevent the expected decrease in patients neurocognitive functions (NCF) and improve their
      quality of life (QOL). The study is designed to provide statistically significant assessment,
      in a prospective randomized clinical trial, of the effect of oxygen stimulation applied soon
      after brain radiotherapy, for patients with primary and secondary brain tumors, on patients
      QOL and NCF. In addition, advanced imaging methodologies will be applied to study the
      feasibility of quantifying oxygen stimulation effects on the tumor and surrounding brain
      tissue.
