  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post marketing study is to determine the plasma concentration of
      bortezomib (unchanged drug) to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK - the study of the way a drug
      enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) properties in the Taiwanese population. It
      will also provide expanded access (expanded access, sometimes called &quot;compassionate use,&quot; is
      the use of an investigational drug outside of a clinical trial to treat a participant with a
      serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition who has no comparable or
      satisfactory alternative treatment options) to bortezomib for the same group of participants
      with multiple myeloma (cancer of the types of cells normally found in bone marrow).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm,
      multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study to assess the PK of bortezomib and to
      provide expanded access to bortezomib for 14 Taiwanese participants with multiple myeloma who
      have received at least 2 previous lines of therapy (medicine or medical care given to a
      participant for a disease or condition) and are refractory (not responding to treatment) to
      or have relapsed (the return of a medical problem) after their last therapy. Eligible
      participants will receive bortezomib 1.3 milligram (mg) per meter square (m^2) on Days 1, 4,
      8, and 11 of each 3-week cycle for up to 8 cycles. Blood samples for PK assessment will be
      collected on specified time points of Day 1, Day 8, and Day 11 of Cycle 1. Efficacy of the
      participants will primarily be evaluated by recording 'response to treatment' and 'Karnofsky
      Performance Status'. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

        <description>The KPS Index allows participants to be classified as per their functional impairment (abnormal function). This can be used to compare effectiveness of different therapies (medicine or medical care given to a participant for a disease or condition) and to assess the prognosis (outlook, probable outcomes) in individual participants. KPS was recorded on an 11-point scale (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100.) where '0=Dead' and '100=Normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease'. The lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the survival for most serious illnesses.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With KPS Score at Day 1 of Cycle 7</title>
        <description>The KPS Index allows participants to be classified as per their functional impairment (abnormal function). This can be used to compare effectiveness of different therapies (medicine or medical care given to a participant for a disease or condition) and to assess the prognosis (outlook, probable outcomes) in individual participants. KPS was recorded on an 11-point scale (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100.) where '0=Dead' and '100=Normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease'. The lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the survival for most serious illnesses.</description>

        <title>Volume of Distribution at Steady-State (Vss) of Bortezomib on Day 1 of Cycle 1</title>
        <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state which is estimated by (D/AUC[0-infinity])*(AUMC[0-infinity])/AUC[0-infinity]) where D is the dose of study drug, AUMC(0-infinity) is the area under the first moment curve extrapolated to infinity and AUC(0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time.</description>
