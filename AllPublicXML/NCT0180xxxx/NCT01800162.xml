  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to compare three currently available management
      strategies for women with a persisting pregnancy of unknown location (PPUL), which makes them
      at-risk for ectopic pregnancy. We will recruit hemodynamically stable women with a confirmed
      PPUL to be randomized to one of three strategies: 1) Uterine evacuation followed by
      methotrexate (MTX) for some (those that have evidence of a non visualized ectopic pregnancy)
      2) Empiric treatment with MTX for all, and 3) Expectant management. Randomization will be
      2:2:1 into these three arms. After randomization, they will be followed and treated
      clinically as is indicated by the progression of their condition. Primary outcome measures:
      uneventful decline of hCG to 5 IU/mL. Secondary outcome measures: re-interventions, treatment
      complications, health-related quality of life, financial costs, future fertility, and
      patient's preferences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female with a persisting pregnancy of unknown location:

               1. A pregnancy of unknown location is defined as a women with a positive pregnancy
                  test but no definitive signs of pregnancy in the uterus or adnexa on ultrasound
                  imaging (Ultrasound must be performed within 7 days prior to randomization)

               2. Persistence of hCG is defined as 3 serial hCG values over 4-14 days or 2 serial
                  hCG values over 7-14 days, showing less than 30% rise, or less than 30% fall
                  between the first and last value. (This abnormal pattern of serial hCG confirms
                  that the gestation is nonviable.)

          2. Patient is hemodynamically stable, hemoglobin greater than 10 mg/dL,

          3. Greater than or 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hemodynamically unstable in need of acute treatment

          2. Most recent hCG greater than 5000 IU/mL

          3. Patient obtaining care in relation to a recently completed pregnancy (delivery,
             spontaneous or elective abortion),

          4. Diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease,

          5. Subject unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures,

          6. Presence of clinical contraindications for treatment with methotrexate (ACOG
             guidelines, Appendix B),

          7. Prior medical or surgical management of this gestation.

            <description>Subjects will undergo a uterine evacuation. If hCG levels do not sufficiently decrease after the uterine evacuation, the subject will be treated with methotrexate. If hCG levels do sufficiently decrease after the uterine evacuation, no further treatment is required.
Methotrexate: Two Dose Protocol: The patient will receive the first dose of MTX 50mg/m2 on treatment day 0. She will receive a second dose of MTX 50mg/m2 on treatment day 4 and a serum hCG level will be drawn. Subsequent doses of MTX will be administered based on hCG levels.
Uterine Evacuation: Uterine evacuation or dilation and curettage. At the clinician's discretion, this can be performed using local anesthesia, sedation or general anesthesia and can use a manual or electrical evacuation.</description>
