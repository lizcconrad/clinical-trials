  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged periods of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) cause high levels of plasma free
      haemoglobin(Hb) and are associated with increased morbidity. We hypothesized that repletion
      of nitric oxide (NO) during and after the surgical procedure on CPB may protect against
      endothelium dysfunction and organ failure caused by plasma-Hb induced NO scavenging.

      Prolonged periods of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) cause high levels of plasma free
      haemoglobin(Hb) and are associated with increased morbidity. We hypothesized that repletion
      of nitric oxide (NO) during and after the surgical procedure on CPB may protect against
      endothelium dysfunction and organ failure caused by plasma-Hb induced NO scavenging. There
      are three possible beneficial mechanisms of delivering NO:

        1. Nitric oxide reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury (such as in acute myocardial
           infarction, stroke, and acute tubular necrosis).

        2. Nitric oxide has anti-inflammatory properties. As antioxidants, exogenous NO may reduce
           injury by counteracting the cytotoxic effects of reactive oxygen species, modulating
           leukocyte recruitment, edema formation and tissue disruption.

        3. Exogenous nitric oxide prevents noxious effects of hemolysis-associated NO
           dysregulation. During hemolysis, nitric oxide gas oxidized of plasma oxyhemoglobin to
           methemoglobin, thereby inhibiting endogenous endothelium NO scavenging by cell-free Hb.

      NO depletion during hemolysis and its sequelae. The release of plasma free Hb (with Fe2+
      iron) by hemolysis avidly scavenges nitric oxide (NO) by the dioxygenation reaction. Elevated
      plasma ferrous Hb levels can induce a &quot;NO deficiency&quot; state. Reduced vascular nitric oxide
      levels can contribute to vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis, potentially
      contributing to systemic endothelial dysfunction after cardiac surgery with CPB.
