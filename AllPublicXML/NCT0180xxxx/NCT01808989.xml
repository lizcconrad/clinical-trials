      The measurement of the transcutaneous oxygen pressure records simultaneously the tcpO2 at the
      buttocks and chest level during walking. Before and after exercise the diagnosis,
      investigations and treatments ongoing or to be performed are recorded.

      The present study focuses on the clinical interest of the transcutaneous oxygen pressure
      during exercise in the diagnosis of claudication in patient referred for an oximetry exercise
      test.

      Pre-test diagnostic hypothesis with probability will be completed by the physician.

      Pre-test and post test ongoing or scheduled treatments will be completed by the
      physician.After the test, the same post test items will be evaluated.

      Analysis will be done on differences of pre and post test results.
