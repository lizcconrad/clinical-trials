      The investigators conducted the study in 4 teaching hospitals and 2 non-teaching hospitals of
      Shaanxi Province. Surgeons, clinical pharmacists and nurses took part in patient collection,
      information registration, protocol performance.

      The investigators recruited 1200 patients with inguinal hernia undergoing inguinal
      hernioplasty in the six hospitals from January 2010 to July 2011. The patients were randomly
      allocated into control group, cefazolin group and levofloxacin group, with digital meter
      method , 400 in each group. The data such as age, sex, case number, length of hospital stay,
      antibiotic usage, post-operative infection, infection site, bacterial culture were filled in
      self-designed forms on computer.

      All of the patients received tension-free inguinal hernia repair with a mesh plug. The
      surgical-site infection (SSI) was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention [5-6].

      We chose cefazolin sodium and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection as peri-operative
      antibiotics. Cefazolin sodium is an effective antibiotic with a short plasma elimination
      half-life against gram-positive cocci (GPC) except for enterococci and meticillin-resistant
      staphylococci. It is recommended as one of the prior antibacterial agents used for clearing
      cuts and preventing infection in many countries including China. Levofloxacin sodium chloride
      injection has a wide anti-bacterial spectrum composed of gram-negative bacteria and
      gram-positive anaerobic bacteria including anaerobic bacteria. It can remain a high
      concentration in urine, so it is recommended as an attractive antibiotic for urinary tract
      operation [5].

      In the control group, we gave normal saline as placebo by intravenous drip infusion for 30-60
      min before operation. Cefazolin group and levofloxacin group received intravenous
      administration of cefazolin sodium 1000 mg and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection 200 mg,
      respectively, for 30-60 min before operation.
