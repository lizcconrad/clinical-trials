  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of 4 sun protection
      interventions--education only; education and mailed sunscreen; education and text message
      reminders; and education, mailed sunscreen, and text message reminders--among Michigan
      Operating Engineers. Pre- and post-intervention surveys will be collected to determine
      changes in sunscreen use and sun burning, the primary outcome variables. The investigators
      hypothesize that all interventions will increase sunscreen use and reduce burning and that
      the education-only intervention will have the least effect of the 4 interventions while the
      education, mailed sunscreen, and text messaging arm will have the greatest effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The education intervention will be provided during regularly scheduled safety training
      sessions, and the text messages and mailed sun screen (SPF30)interventions will be offered
      during the summer when UV rays are at their highest. Inclusion criteria are Operating
      Engineers who:1)are greater than 18 years of age; 2) are interested in enrolling in the sun
      protection study; 3) own a cell-phone that accepts text messages; and 4) are willing to share
      their phone number with the study team. Based on power analysis, 256 subjects are needed to
      have 80% power to detect medium sized effects on primary outcomes. Accounting for a 20%
      attrition rate, 320 subjects will be recruited. The analyses will include: a) paired t-tests
      to determine changes over time (from pre-intervention to post-intervention) in outcome
      variables (sunscreen use and burning) separately in the 4 intervention groups, b) Repeated
      Measures Analysis of Variance (RM-ANOVA) to compare the changes in outcomes across the 4
      groups, and c) t-tests on change scores as follow-ups to the RM-ANOVA to determine exactly
      which groups differ from each other. Sub-analyses will explore if particular subgroups of
      Operating Engineers (e.g., demographic, heath behavior, and job type subgroups) differ in
      sunscreen use and sun burning pre-and post-intervention.

    <description>To reduce barriers to obtaining sunscreen and serve as cues to action, this group will be mailed during the months of May through September, a supply of SPF30 sunscreen lotion (known to prevent sun burning and skin cancer). The mailing will consist of large bottles of sunscreen and a small bottle that can be refilled and attached to their huge key rings that hang off of their belts.</description>

    <description>As cues to action, this group will receive 60 cellular telephone text-messages on three random mornings per week during the month of May, June, July, August, and September when UV rays are the highest. Using an internet text-messaging service, the messages will be computer generated and sent to Operating Engineers and contain information about weather conditions and various reminders (e.g., &quot;Put on sunscreen today&quot; or &quot;Wow, it's a hot one, you know what to do!&quot;).</description>

    <description>Just as multimodal interventions such as surgery and radiation can be used to treat skin cancer, multimodal behavioral interventions may reduce sun burning and prevent skin cancer. To determine if the combination of these interventional components results in improvements above and beyond the individual parts, both sunscreen and text messaging interventions will be provided in addition to education.</description>

    <description>A 30-minute, picture enhanced power point presentation will be offered to all Operating Engineers during their annual safety trainings. The content of the power point presentation will include information on incidence and prevalence of skin cancer especially among outdoor workers, types of skin cancers and skin cancer risk, sunburn, Sun Protection Factor (SPF), sun protection behaviors including sunscreen use, correct application of sunscreen, types of products, and the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling of sunscreen products. In addition, other sun protection behaviors such as wearing hats, sunglasses, using shade, etc., will be discussed.</description>
