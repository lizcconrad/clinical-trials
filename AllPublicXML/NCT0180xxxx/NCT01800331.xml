    <textblock>
      In Canada, the number of obese children and adolescents has increased tremendously.
      Interventions addressing diet and physical activity have been successful in the short-term.
      However, a great number of individuals have difficulties maintaining achieved weight loss and
      returning to treatment sessions.

      New technology interventions, through the web or delivered trough Personal Digital Assistants
      (PDAs) (e.g. iPhone or Blackberry), are increasingly being used in health interventions. PDAs
      have emerged as appealing in health interventions as they are easily accessible and their
      interactivity makes them well suited to promote long-term engagement in behaviour change
      interventions.

      This study will look at the utility of supplementing a family-based lifestyle program for
      overweight and obese adolescents (Shapedown BC) with a PDA intervention (Text2bHealthy)
      focussing mainly on physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and dietary intake to maintain
      treatment success by improving self-management skills. Adolescents and will receive
      Text2bHealthy for 3-months after 3 months participation in the Shapedown BC program.

      Results from this study will provide needed information on how to improve treatment adherence
      and maintenance outcomes through the use of innovative methods and will ultimately contribute
      to the improvement of long-term outcomes in obesity treatment.

      Around the world, the amount of people who are overweight is increasing. This has become a
      public health crisis. Obesity, especially in children, is a problem because it is associated
      with risk for health problems and psychological issues. These problems include heart disease
      and poor quality of life and can happen both in childhood and later life.

      Programs that help people change their lifestyle and behaviour are effective to help people
      lose weight and improve their mental health. In children, the main issue for treating obesity
      is to help the child keep weight off and to prevent a return to unhealthy behaviours. This
      means that long-term support is needed. But the health care system is not set up to do this
      because of a limited amount of resources. The aim of this study is to see if there are better
      long-term results if we use a technology tool along with a lifestyle program.

      The aim of this study is to examine a personal digital assistant (PDA) program
      (Text2bHealthy) supplemented to an existing family-based group treatment for overweight and
      obese children. This treatment is called the British Columbia Centre for Healthy Weights
      (BCCHW) Shapedown BC program. The aim of this study is to see if Text2bHealthy supplemented
      to the Shapedown BC program helps children to keep the weight of and improves physical
      activity as well as fruit, vegetable, and fat intake.

      We know from studies that reporting one's own behaviour, goal setting, and tailored feedback
      are key elements in changing health behaviours. Text2bHealthy includes these key elements.
      PDAs will be given to 30 10-16 year old children and adolescents after completing the
      Shapedown BC program. They will be explained how to use the PDA. Children who participate in
      the Text2bHealthy program will set weekly goals related to their physical activity, eating or
      sitting behaviours. Also, they will report on their lifestyle behaviours twice a week. They
      will receive personalized feedback on their progress. The feedback is designed to be
      supportive and to reinforce their behaviour in a positive way. The control group (N=30) will
      use a paper dairy to keep track of their lifestyle behaviours. At 0 and 3 months after
      completing the Shapedown BC program, measurements such as height and weight will be taken.
      Also, exercise and nutrition behaviour will be measured. Physical activity will be measured
      with pedometers and a recall and nutrition intake with questionnaires.

      Because it is hard to maintain weight loss, we need to provide programs that offer the
      long-term support of behaviour change. Tools such as PDAs seem to be ideal to offer long-term
      support. For the purpose of this study, PDAs will be used as a proof of concept; the
      programming can be incorporated into smart phones in the future. From previous studies we
      know that reporting one's own behaviour seems to improve weight loss in children. Also,
      behaviours are more likely to be reported when using mobile phones compared to paper &amp; pencil
      diaries. I am one of the first to study the effect of innovative technologies by using
      self-reporting, goal setting, and personalized feedback in childhood obesity treatment. We
      hope that the results from this study will increase our knowledge on the use and feasibility
      of digital devices in childhood obesity treatment.

      The outcomes of this research will be used to better understand how to improve weight loss
      maintenance among obese children. Obesity places children at higher risk for heart disease
      and poor quality of life when they are adults. Thus time and cost-effective long-term support
      programs need to be developed to improve weight loss maintenance. This new program has the
      potential to improve maintenance of weight loss and healthy lifestyle in overweight and obese
      children and adolescents.
