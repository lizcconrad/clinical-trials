    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, strength and function with aging and is associated
      with increased disability, falls and fractures. Older adults with diabetes and prediabetes
      are insulin resistant and have a higher risk of developing sarcopenia. This study examines
      the use of metformin, an antidiabetic drug, for preventing the development of sarcopenia in
      older adults with prediabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study utilizes clinical and translational research approaches to study
      sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is common in older adults and is associated with decreased strength,
      increased disability, falls and fractures. There are currently few interventions to prevent
      or treat sarcopenia and a poor understanding of the mechanisms for sarcopenia. Given the
      growing number of Veterans over the age of 65, studies to prevent sarcopenia and resulting
      disability are important for the health, independence and well-being of this population. The
      investigators' preliminary studies have shown that older adults with diabetes have an
      accelerated loss in muscle mass and gait speed, except when treated with metformin. Older
      adults with prediabetes also have a greater decline in muscle mass and higher incidence of
      disability. Therefore, this study further investigates these findings by addressing the
      following aims: (1) to determine whether metformin can prevent the loss in muscle mass and
      physical performance and (2) to examine changes in muscle histologic characteristics
      associated with metformin treatment in older adults with prediabetes.
