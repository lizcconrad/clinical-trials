      The objectives of the study are:

      (i) to evaluate the proportion of patients who attain a T&gt;MIC (Minimum Inhibitory
      Concentration) of 100% and the time frame in which they do so. The investigators therefore
      plan to measure unbound linezolid trough concentrations before administration of the second,
      third, fourth and fifth dose. Furthermore, the investigators will assess the AUC0 - 24h/MIC
      in all study subjects. Therefore, multiple plasma samples will be drawn after the fourth or
      fifth dose, when steady state conditions are reached.

      (ii) to describe the pharmacokinetic variability of unbound linezolid concentrations in this
      cohort using a population pharmacokinetic model and to assess the expected probability of
      target attainment (PTA) by MIC against MRSA.

      Twenty adult, MRSA-positive, morbidly obese patients with clinically and radiologically
      documented pneumonia are to be included. Therefore, a multi-centre, international
      observational study is necessary. Given the specific target population this study is not
      feasible in a single-centre approach. The goal is to find up to 6 centres that anticipate
      including 3 to 4 patients in the study within a time frame of one year.

      Included patients should receive at least 6 doses of linezolid. Linezolid must be
      administered intravenously (iv) over a one hour controlled infusion (with use of a volumetric
      infusion pump).

    <description>A total of 17 blood samples will be collected over 72 hours after the first administration of linezolid, using a catheter.
There will be evaluation of the proportion of patients who attain a T&gt;MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of 100% and the time frame in which they do so. The investigators therefore plan to measure unbound linezolid trough concentrations before administration of the second, third, fourth and fifth dose.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  BMI &gt;35

          -  Radiographically and clinically documented pneumonia and one of the following:

               -  the patient is MRSA screen-positive and is as such at high risk for MRSA
                  pneumonia (MIC for linezolid is known or possible to assess)

               -  the patient has a baseline respiratory tract sample positive for MRSA; MRSA
                  pneumonia is likely

               -  empiric therapy without linezolid is initiated (no obvious indication for MRSA
                  involvement), but the patient is switch to linezolid therapy once culture results
                  demonstrate MRSA as pathogen. CAVE: the patients must be included in the study
                  prior to the moment the first trough sample must be drawn. As such, patients
                  becoming MRSA-positive after &gt;1 dose of linezolid cannot be included in the
                  study.

          -  Decision to start treatment with linezolid for at least 3 days (6 doses of 600 mg).

          -  Patient is colonized or infected with MRSA (at any site) and it must be possible to
             sent a fresh isolate to the central laboratory for microbiology.

          -  Written informed consent by the patient or his/her legal representative.

        Exclusion:

        Contraindications as described in the summary of product characteristics (SPC).
