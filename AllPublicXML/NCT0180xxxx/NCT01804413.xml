      Hypothesis:

      Pegvisomant combined with the glucagon stimulation test (GST) can improve the accuracy of
      this test when used to diagnose adult GH and cortisol (steroid hormone)insufficiency.

      Study aims:

      Diagnosing GH and cortisol deficiency in adults requires a special test. At present, the
      insulin tolerance test (ITT) is considered the test of choice. However, this test is
      difficult to perform as it involves giving insulin through the veins to decrease blood sugars
      to very low levels, and this can be unpleasant, and cannot be performed in elderly adults and
      in those with a history of heart disease, seizure disorders or stroke. For this reason there
      is an urgent need for an alternative reliable test. At present, the GST is considered the
      alternative test to the ITT but its accuracy in obese patients and in those with diabetes
      remains unclear. Pegvisomant is a medication that can increase GH production in the body. The
      purpose of this study is to find out if combining pegvisomant with the GST can help improve
      the accuracy of this test so that it is comparable with the ITT in diagnosing adult GH and
      cortisol insufficiency.

      Study design:

      Subjects will be recruited from the Oregon Health &amp; Science University Dynamic Endocrine
      Testing Unit. A written informed consent will be obtained and a screening interview will be
      carried out. During the screening interview, the study will be explained to the subject in
      detail. For women of child-bearing age, a pregnancy test will be performed. The subjects will
      then take part in three studies on separate days: (1) GST; (2) pegvisomant (1 mg/kg)
      injection into the abdomen 3 days before the glucagon stimulation test (ii) insulin tolerance
      test. For the GST, glucagon will be injected into the muscle and blood draws will be
      performed every 30 mins for 240 mins. For the insulin tolerance test, a blood draw will be
      performed and insulin will be given into the vein followed by blood draws every 15 mins for
      120 mins. The data from all three studies will be analyzed in the study where the peak growth
      hormone and cortisol levels for all three tests will be compared. A questionnaire will be
      used at the end of the study for the subjects to rank the level of preference of the three
      tests. The data of the study will be analyzed using a computer statistical program where the
      identity of the subjects will be coded to maintain confidentiality.

      Background: The diagnosis of GH deficiency in adults is established by provocative testing of
      GH secretion. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is widely regarded as the gold standard test
      for diagnosing adult GH deficiency despite concerns about its practicality, safety,
      reproducibility, and its contraindications in elderly adults, adults with seizures and
      patients with ischemic heart disease. The glucagon stimulation test (GST) has been proposed
      as the alternative to the ITT for the following reasons: 1) availability; 2) low cost and 3)
      safety. This test has been validated in the past as a reliable test in assessing the GH
      reserve in both adults and children. In addition, a number of studies have also shown that
      the GST is capable of stimulating not only GH but also ACTH release. However, the accuracy
      and reliability of the GST in assessing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and GH
      reserve in obese and diabetic patients are still lacking.

      Pegvisomant (PV) (SomavertÂ®) is a GH receptor antagonist and is currently licensed by the FDA
      for the treatment of acromegaly. Physiological studies have demonstrated that acute high dose
      administration of PV can enhance endogenous GH stimulation. These data was more recently
      utilized by Radetti et al. to prime the L-DOPA test in assessing its reliability in the
      diagnostic work up of GH deficiency in short children. Using a PV dose of 1 mg/kg to prime
      the L-DOPA test in 21 short children, these investigators demonstrated an improvement in the
      reliability of the L-DOPA stimulation test in diagnosing GH deficiency with 10 out of the 18
      (56%) children that initially failed the L-DOPA test successfully passed the L-DOPA test
      following PV-priming. These investigators postulate that PV-priming unmasked potentially
      false diagnoses of GH deficiency by exploiting the acute IGF-lowering effect and reducing the
      negative feedback of GH on the hypothalamus.

      We therefore propose this proof-of-concept pilot study to investigate the potential of acute
      GH receptor blockade using PV to reduce false positive rates in adults undergoing GH testing
      with the GST. In addition, we plan to investigate the effects of PV on IGF-I bioactivity, as
      measured by the IGF-I kinase receptor activation (KIRA) assay (30).

      Subjects: Ten subjects with suspected pituitary disease will be invited to participate in the
      study. Subjects will be screened for eligibility before enrollment into the study.

      Intervention: After completing the GST, eligible subjects will be randomized to undergo
      either the PV-GST or the ITT. Subjects who are randomized to undergo the PV-GST first will
      then undergo the ITT, and vice versa, 4-6 weeks later. For the PV-GST, a blood test for serum
      IGF-I and IGF-I KIRA level will be measured and the patient will then receive PV at a dose of
      1 mg/kg injected subcutaneously. The patient will then return in 3 days' time to undergo the
      GST. For this part of the test, subjects will receive glucagon administered intramuscularly
      at a dose of 1 mg if subject weighs 90 kg or less and 1.5 mg if subject weighs more than 90
      kg.

      Measurements: Blood samples for the measurement of glucose, IGF-I, IGF-I KIRA, GH and
      cortisol will be performed at various time-points for the GST, PV-GST and ITT

      Specific Aims:

      Primary aims: 1) To investigate the potential of acute GH receptor blockade priming with PV
      to glucagon (PV-GST test) on the characteristics of peak GH and cortisol levels; 2) To
      ascertain cut-point levels for GH and cortisol with the PV-GST in comparison to the ITT in
      defining GH and cortisol deficiency.

      Secondary aims: 1) Correlation between peak GH and cortisol levels induced by the PV-GST and
      BMI; 2) Correlation between peak GH and cortisol levels induced by the PV-GST and fasting
      blood glucose levels; 3) Effects of PV on IGF-I bioactivity as determined by the IGF-I KIRA.

    <description>Presently, the insulin tolerance test (ITT) is regarded as the gold standard test in diagnosing adult GH deficiency but this test is difficult to perform in patients with diabetes mellitus, and contraindicated in the elderly, and in adults with seizures and ischemic heart disease. Glucagon test is the alternative test to the ITT but its accuracy and reliability is questionable in obesity and diabetes mellitus. Pegvisomant is a GH receptor blocker that increases GH secretion. When primed with glucagon, pegvisomant may enhance GH secretion by providing a stronger stimulus than glucagon alone. We plan to assess if by priming pegvisomant with glucagon will improve the accuracy of this test in diagnosing adult GH cortisol deficiency. Specifically, we will examine the characteristics of peak GH and cortisol levels, and ascertain the peak GH and cortisol levels in comparison to those generated using the ITT in diagnosing GH and cortisol deficiency.</description>
