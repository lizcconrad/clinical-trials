  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the impact of hybrid 18F-Fluoro-choline (18F-FCH) PET/MRI imaging on the clinical
      management of men with suspected recurrent prostate cancer post prostatectomy or
      radiotherapy.

      We hypothesize that hybrid imaging incorporating 18F-FCH PET/MRI imaging will be feasible and
      will lead to changes in management decisions among men being re-staged for suspected prostate
      cancer recurrence post-surgery or radiation who are potentially eligible for local salvage
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a non-randomized, prospective study of men with suspected local recurrence
      of prostate cancer post-prostatectomy or radiation with negative bone and CT scans. Hybrid
      PET/MRI using 18F-FCH will be obtained and a consensus staging report generated for the
      attending clinician. Clinical management questionnaires completed by the study investigator
      will be obtained pre and post imaging in order to gauge the impact of the hybrid imaging on
      clinical decision making.
