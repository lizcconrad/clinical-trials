    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to compare the safety and efficacy of X92001327 versus
      RID in subjects with head lice. The subjects received a single application on Day 0 of either
      X92001327 or RID shampoo based on the randomization schedule. A repeat application of the
      test product was administered on Day 7. Subjects visited the clinic four times: on Day 0, Day
      1, Day 7 and Day 10.
