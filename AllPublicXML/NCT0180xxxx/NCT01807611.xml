  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT), who do not have a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched
      related/sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) identified, will receive a
      haploidentical donor HCT with additional natural killer (NK) cells.

      The investigators anticipate enrollment of 75 donors and 75 recipients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the rate of successful engraftment at day +42 post-transplant in patients
           who receive haploidentical donor stem cell plus NK cell transplantation with TLI based
           conditioning regimen for high risk hematologic malignancy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the incidence of malignant relapse, event-free survival, and overall survival
           at one-year post-transplantation.

        -  Estimate incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GVHD).

        -  Estimate the rate of transplant related mortality (TRM) in the first 100 days after
           transplantation.

      Donors will undergo G-CSF mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) prior to
      undergoing two apheresis collections of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC,A) and one
      apheresis collection of therapeutic cell product of purified natural killer cells (TC-NK).

      The HPC products will be T-cell depleted (TCD) using the investigational CliniMACS device.
      CD34+ enrichment and CD45RA depletion will be utilized on sequential HPC grafts.

      Participants will undergo a preparative regimen of total lymphoid irradiation, fludarabine,
      cyclophosphamide, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), thiotepa, and melphalan.
      This is followed by infusions of donor cells that have been prepared using the CliniMACS
      system: HPC,A (CD34+ selected), HPC,A (CD45RA depleted), and TC-NK.

    <description>Ongoing assessment of toxicity will be done using the NCI CTCAE version 3.0. Acute and chronic graft-vs.-host disease will be evaluated using the standard grading criteria. The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GvHD will be estimated using Kalbfleisch-Prentice method. Death is the competing risk event. The analysis for this objective will be performed when the last evaluable participant has been followed for 100 days post transplant.</description>

    <description>The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products). These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest, such as CD3+ human T cells.</description>
