      To elucidate the audit's effect on caesarean section rate, and also define the factors
      influencing the caesarean section rate.

      From Jan 2007 , pregnant women who delivered in a medical center will be included
      retrospectively in this study. Our monthly cesarean section audit, focusing on discussing the
      indications of cesarean section, began from July 2008. Clinical data, indications of cesarean
      section, and perinatal outcomes were compared between the cases of before and after the
      audit. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors affecting cesarean
      section rate.
