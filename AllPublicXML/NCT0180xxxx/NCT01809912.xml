    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety and tolerability of a 28 day course of intravenous (IV) MG1102 in
      patients with solid tumors for which no standard therapy is available.

      This is an open-label, Dose Escalation Study, multicenter phase I study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability, determine the pharmacokinetics, and obtain preliminary information
      regarding pharmacodynamics and efficacy of MG1102 in subjects with solid tumor.

      Each subject will receive on dose of MG1102 followed by a 6-day rest period. If the initial
      dose is tolerated, subject will continue with the 21 days of MG1102 administration (5 days on
      treatment, 2 days off treatment for 3 weeks.) Subjects that have a tumor response as stable
      disease, may continue therapy on a compassionate use.

If no DLTs are observed during the 6 days following the initial infusion, the same dose will be administered once daily for 5 consecutive days followed by a 2-day rest period three times (over 21 days), completing the course on Day 27.
Additional 21 Day Courses In the absence of a DLT, and in the case of stable disease or better, a subject may continue to receive MG1102 (Recombinant human apolipoprotein(a) Kringle V
) on a compassionate use basis at the same dose and regimen .</description>
