  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prospect of disease-modifying therapies in the pipeline for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has
      intensified efforts to use brain imaging more effectively for diagnosis and monitoring of
      dementing illnesses. There is also emerging awareness of the destructive interplay between AD
      and Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD) in our aging population; both disorders share common
      vascular risk factors and may respond to similar prevention treatments. Brain mapping
      techniques capitalize on the fact that different neurodegenerative diseases target particular
      brain areas. Brain shrinkage and stroke disease can be quantified on Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) using computerized analysis.

      This ongoing study applies advanced MR imaging analysis, genetic testing and standardized
      cognitive and functional assessments done at yearly intervals to measure and monitor
      longitudinal change in patients with AD, vascular and other neurodegenerative diseases and
      potentially to measure modifying effects of emerging therapies. Over 1000 patients (Mild
      Cognitive Impairment or dementia from AD, Vascular, Frontotemporal or Lewy Body Disease) and
      125 normal elderly have already been enrolled, with 150 autopsies.

      This study utilizes specialized imaging analysis software packages to reliably quantify brain
      tissue volumes and small vessel disease, the most common type of CVD. Results from this study
      will help to improve diagnosis, to customize treatment, and to better monitor
      disease-modifying therapies currently under investigation should they become applicable to
      everyday practice.
