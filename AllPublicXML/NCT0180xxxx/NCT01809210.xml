  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label multicentre study of selumetinib administered orally in
      combination with first line chemotherapy regimens to patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC.
      The study has been designed to allow an investigation of the optimal dose of selumetinib in
      combination with various standard first line double-platinum chemotherapy regimens. Initial
      assessment will be based on tolerability of selumetinib in combination with one or more
      selected regimens that are considered to be tolerated also being assessed for preliminary
      evidence of activity.

      This study is a dose finding and optional cohort expansion; In addition all patients will be
      assessed for anti-cancer efficacy of the combination of selumetinib and chemotherapy.

          <title>Best Objective Response</title>
          <description>The best response a patient has had during their time in the study up until RECIST progression or last valuable assessment in the absence of RECIST progression. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1) for target lesions (TL) and assessed by MRI or CT: Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD); Progressive Disease (PD), &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of &gt;=5mm; Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm</description>
