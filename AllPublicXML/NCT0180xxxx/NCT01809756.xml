  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In the Netherlands 1731 people are being diagnosed with SCLC (Small Cell Lung
      Cancer) in 2010. This is approximately 14% of all new diagnosed lungcancers. Part of them
      will need a combination of chemo-radiationtherapy. A review of the incidence and severity of
      esophagitis in SCLC patients receiving a combination of chemotherapy and once daily
      radiotherapy revealed overall esophagitis rates up to 58% experiencing esophagitis grade 2
      and higher. As concurrent radiotherapy is moving to twice daily radiation (30 x 1,5 Gy in 3
      weeks) it is expected that the incidence of esophagitis will rise, the clinical symptoms are
      likely to arise earlier and become more severe.

      Mucositis of the upper tractus digestivus is a serious adverse event leading to pain,
      problems with swallowing and decreased food intake. It has a negative infect on QoL and can
      lead to prolonged hospital stay and delayed cancer treatment. Physicians seek improvements in
      treatment modalities to improve these daily patient toxicities.

      Caphosol® is an advanced electrolyte solution indicated as an adjunct to standard oral care
      in treating oral mucositis caused by radiation or high dose chemotherapy. Positive effects of
      Caphosol® oral rinse 4 times daily in a study with head and neck chemoradiation patients were
      found on the presence of mucositis and on oral comfort.

      It's supposed that the pathogenesis of chemo- or radiotherapy induced mucositis is the same
      for the whole tractus digestivus. The appearance does differ due to differences in cell
      proliferation.

      Swallowing Caphosol® after oral rinse could have a positive effect on esophageal mucositis on
      time of onset, severity and duration.

      Objective: Adding the use of Caphosol® (rinsing and swallowing four times a day) to the
      standard of care for esophagitis/mucositis, reduces the incidence, onset, duration and
      severity of esophagitis in SCLC patients, comparing to the standard of care alone.

      Study design: A multi-centre, open, randomized prospective phase II study. Study population:
      108 patients 18 years or older with histologically proven SCLC (all histological subtypes),
      treated with concurrent chemo- and radiotherapy are estimated to be included in this study
      (2:1 ratio inclusion; 72 patients with Caphosol® and 36 patients without Caphosol®; α=0.05,
      power 80%).

      Intervention (if applicable): 108 patients eligible for this study will be monitored during
      their SCLC chemo/radiotherapy treatment. One group of 72 patients will receive Caphosol®, 4
      times a day - next to the standard of care. Caphosol® will start at day 1 of treatment and
      will be continued until 3 weeks after the last radiotherapy (RT).Another group of 36 patients
      will receive only the current standard of care for esophagitis. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of the groups.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary objective is to estimate the incidence, onset,
      duration and severity of esophagitis in SCLC patients undergoing radiation therapy with
      chemotherapy who receive Caphosol®.

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):

        1. To correlate components of esophagitis data with clinical outcomes (pain, dysphagia,
           analgetic use, oral intake, weight loss, infection, need for hospitalization, QoL)

        2. Discontinuation or delay of chemotherapy due to esophagitis. Nature and extent of the
           burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The risks
           are very small. The patient has to fill in a Esophagitis Daily Questionnaire and during
           regular visits QOL questionaires are performed.

      Sputumswabs are collected on a weekly basis for determination of the microbiological flora of
      the mouth. During regular blood control max. 8 ml extra blood is taken for immunologic status
      research.

      Caphosol® is a saturated calciumphosphate solution. The daily intake of calcium and phosphor
      when swallowing Caphosol® 4 times daily is far beyond the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)(&lt;
      5%). Compared to daily nutrients like milk (270 mg calcium per unit milk (225 ml)) or meat
      (200 mg phosphor per 100 g meat) the intake of calcium and phosphor due to Caphosol® is
      negligible and is considered safe.
