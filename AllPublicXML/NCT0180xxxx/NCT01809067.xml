      Research Question:

      What effect if any does the use of lavender aromatherapy have on a patient's stress and
      anxiety during the MRI procedure in the Cardiovascular Services Department?

      Hypothesis:

        1. The use of lavender aromatherapy will reduce anxiety by 20% during MRI procedures.

        2. MRI cancellations related to stress and anxiety will decrease by 10%.

      Sample size of 30 patients is needed for the control group and the lavender aromatherapy
      group, for a total of 60 patients.

      Rationale:

      Patients undergoing MRI procedures may experience stress and anxiety related to the small and
      confining space required during the scan. Anyone with a history of claustrophobia, panic
      attacks, or fear of enclosed spaces is more likely to experience symptoms of panic, fear, or
      anxiety during the MRI procedure (Harris, Cumming, &amp; Menzies, 2004, p. 1). This stress and
      anxiety may cause the patient to abort the scan, the patient may refuse future scans, or the
      patient's nervous tremors or involuntary quivering may adversely affect the images obtained.
      Lavender aromatherapy has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety for patients in other
      settings; however, its use during MRI procedures has not been studied.

      This project investigates the use of lavender aromatherapy as a non-pharmacological way to
      help patients relax during their MRI procedure. Lavender aromatherapy has been studied and
      shown to reduce stress and anxiety for patients in other situations, but it has not been
      studied during MRI procedures. Lavender is known to be uplifting, as well as soothing and
      helpful for reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia (Herz, 2007, p. 264). If
      aromatherapy proves useful as an agent to reduce stress and anxiety, patient satisfaction
      with their MRI procedure will increase and the need for sedating medication could decrease.
