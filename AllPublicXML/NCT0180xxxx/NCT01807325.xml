  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nature of cysts and solid masses in the pancreas can be difficult to diagnose. They may
      be benign, precancerous, or cancer. Current tests such as cytology (looking under a
      microscope) and tumor markers do not always give us the answer. The investigators are looking
      for genetic markers on biopsy specimens from the pancreas that will give us a better test for
      diagnosis. This study is only for diagnosing these lesions. The investigators are not
      treating any patients.
