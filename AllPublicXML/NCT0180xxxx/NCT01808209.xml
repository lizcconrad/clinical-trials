      Clinical Performance of Stenfilcon vs. Filcon II 3
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the comfort and clinical performance of Stenfilcon
      vs. Filcon II 3 compared to subject's habitual contact lenses. The null hypothesis is that
      there is no difference in the clinical performance between the two sets of lenses.

             complete all specified evaluation.

          -  Read, indicate understanding of, and sign Written Informed Consent (Appendix 1)

          -  Require a contact lens prescription between -0.50 and -6.00 and have no more than
             -.75dioptor (D) of astigmatism in both eyes

          -  Achieve visual acuity of 6/9 or better in each eye with a spherical contact lens
             prescription.

          -  An existing soft contact lens wearer of any modality.

          -  Must be able to wear their lenses at least 6 full days over the 7 days; 14 hours per
             day, assuming there are no contraindications for doing so.

          -  Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the purposes of this
             study a normal eye is defined as one having:

          -  No amblyopia.

          -  No evidence of lid abnormality or infection (e.g. entropion, ectropion, chalazia,
             recurrent styes).

          -  No clinically significant slit lamp findings (e.g. infiltrates or other slit lamp
             findings greater than Grade 2: corneal edema, tarsal abnormalities, and conjunctival
             injection).

          -  No other active ocular disease (e.g. glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions,
             cornea [infiltrates], conjunctiva, lids, and intraocular infection or inflammation of
             an allergic, bacterial, or viral etiology.)

          -  No aphakia

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any of the following will render a subject ineligible for inclusion:

          -  Neophytes, who have not worn lenses before

          -  Greater than 0.75D of refractive astigmatism in either eye

          -  Presence of clinically significant (grade 3 or above) anterior segment abnormalities;
             inflammations such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated
             structures.

          -  Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medication which might interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as:

          -  Pathological dry eye or associated findings

          -  Pterygium, pinguecula or corneal scars within the visual axis

          -  Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm in from the limbus

          -  Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) Grade 3 or above

          -  Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present)

          -  Seborrheic eczema, seborrheic conjunctivitis

          -  History of corneal ulcer or fungal infections

          -  Poor personal hygiene

          -  A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity).

          -  Contact lens best corrected Snellen visual acuities (VA) worse than 6/9

          -  Aphakia, Keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea
