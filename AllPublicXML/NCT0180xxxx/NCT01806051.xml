  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This self-controlled, prospective, pilot study is designed to gather information regarding
      the diurnal variation (changes that occur each day) in the levels of plasma phenylalanine
      (Phe) and tyrosine in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and in the non-PKU population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic metabolic disease caused by a mutation that codes for
      an enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. An
      absence or deficiency of this enzyme activity results in a Phe elevation, where higher Phe
      levels result in neurological damage. Diurnal variations of Phe levels have been observed in
      PKU patients in a 24-hour period.

      As Kuvan has shown to stabilize Phe levels in PKU patients over time, our hypothesis is that
      this can be demonstrated within a 24-hour period of observation and indicate therefore that
      Kuvan may correlate with a lower plasma Phe variability. This study on PKU patients' diurnal
      variation will also provide important information as to the current method of blood Phe
      monitoring in a clinical setting to learn more about the optimal way to measure Phe
      concentration.

      The study will last about 4 weeks (6 study visits) for the PKU participants and about 1 week
      (2 study visits) for the control group.

      Participants will be required to follow a recommended diet, complete a dietary log, and
      undergo several blood draws, including a 24-Hour Blood Assessment in which blood will be
      obtained 8 times throughout the day.
