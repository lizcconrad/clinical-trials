  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nuedexta is effective in the treatment of
      symptoms (impaired speech, swallowing, and saliva control)associated with Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis (ALS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness, the cardinal feature of ALS, leads to progressive loss of motor function
      affecting the limbs, tongue, respiratory and pharyngeal muscles. Symptomatic treatments such
      as the placement of a feeding tube, can compensate for the inability to swallow. Riluzole,
      the only approved treatment for ALS, may slow disease progression but no treatment is
      curative and none have improved function.

      Unexpectedly, Nuedexta®, approved for the treatment of labile emotionality that occurs in
      association with ALS and other neurological disorders, has been observed to improve bulbar
      function, primarily speech and swallowing, in a number of neurological disorders, including
      ALS. The basis for this is conjectural but likely due to a direct effect of the drug on motor
      neurons in the part of the brain that controls speech and swallowing. The same part of the
      brain appears to modulate the expression of emotions and interestingly the site of action of
      the drug is the same as a site that has been implicated in a juvenile form of ALS.

      This is a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, cross over study
      evaluating the palliative effect of Nuedexta® on bulbar dysfunction. It is expected that
      approximately 60 ALS patients from 7 clinical centers in the US will be enrolled.

    <measure>Bulbar Function Scale (CNS-BFS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Average between Screening Visit to Visit 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Neurologic Study-Bulbar Function Scale (CNS-BFS) is a 21-item self report scale that assesses three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation. Scores for each question range from 1 (does not apply) to 5 (applies most of the time). The higher the score, the worse the speech, swallowing and salivation (sialorrhea). [Range of score: 21-105]
The scale was modeled on the Center for Neurologic Study Emotional Lability Scale (CNS-LS) that has been a robust endpoint in four clinical trials. The scale was validated in a large population of ALS patients (n=122) and detects impaired bulbar function at a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 0.97%. Test re-test correlation was 0.92% at six-months (n=53).</description>

    <description>The Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is a 7-item self report scale that assesses pseudobulbar affect (PBA) by measuring the perceived frequency of PBA episodes (laughing or crying). Each item is scored using a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (applies never) to 5 (applies most of the time). Scores range from 5-35. The higher the score, the worse the PBA.</description>

    <description>The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 min) ordinal rating scale used to determine a subject's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. There are 12 questions, graded by the subject 0-4 (4 is normal). Score of 0 (worst) to 48 (best). Reflects speech and swallowing, fine motor skills, large motor skills, and breathing.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale - Speech Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Average between Baseline Visit to Visit 3</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scales are useful for measuring complex clinical events and offer the advantage of self-administration and responsiveness to change over time. The scales designed for this study inventory three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation (sialorrhea). For each of these, subjects score themselves by indicating their level of function on a scale of 1 (severe impairment) to 10 (normal). Scores range from 1 to 10; the higher the score, the more normal the function.</description>

Data is generated from the clinical exam and scored from 1-5, the lowest score indicating normal tone and the highest muscle rigidity.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to read 'The Rainbow Passage' a commonly used test paragraph utilized by speech pathologists to assess speech rate (words/minute). Study staff will time the subject to determine how many words the subject reads per minute. It is used primarily because it contains every sound in the English language. Subjects will also be observed for loudness, nasality, and intelligibility.</description>

    <measure>Average Water Swallowing Test (WST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average between Baseline Visit to Visit 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Water Swallowing Test (WST) estimates swallowing speed, a useful and reproducible measure. While sitting, subjects are asked to drink 30 milliliters (mL) of liquid. The time for subjects to complete this task is a sensitive measure for the detection of swallowing dysfunction and is a simple measure for serial assessment of subjects. The test will be completed three times, with the best two scores recorded to obtain an average score. Following completion of the WST, the subject's swallowing abilities (choking, spillage, and effort) will be observed.</description>

Scores for each question range from 1 (does not apply) to 5 (applies most of the time). The higher the score, the worse the speech, swallowing and salivation (sialorrhea). [Range of score: 21-105]
The scale was modeled on the Center for Neurologic Study Emotional Lability Scale (CNS-LS) that has been a robust endpoint in four clinical trials. The scale was validated in a large population of ALS patients (n=122) and detects impaired bulbar function at a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 0.97%. Test re-test correlation was 0.92% at six-months (n=53).</description>

        <description>The Center for Neurologic Study-Bulbar Function Scale (CNS-BFS) is a 21-item self report scale that assesses three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation. Scores for each question range from 1 (does not apply) to 5 (applies most of the time). The higher the score, the worse the swallowing. There are 7 swallowing questions, with a score range of 7 to 35.</description>

        <description>Visual analog scales are useful for measuring complex clinical events and offer the advantage of self-administration and responsiveness to change over time. The scales designed for this study inventory three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation (sialorrhea). For each of these, subjects score themselves by indicating their level of function on a scale of 1 (severe impairment) to 10 (normal). Scores range from 1 to 10; the higher the score, the more normal the function.</description>

        <description>The Water Swallowing Test (WST) estimates swallowing speed, a useful and reproducible measure. While sitting, subjects are asked to drink 30 milliliters (mL) of liquid. The time for subjects to complete this task is a sensitive measure for the detection of swallowing dysfunction and is a simple measure for serial assessment of subjects. The test will be completed three times, with the best two scores recorded to obtain an average score. Following completion of the WST, the subject's swallowing abilities (choking, spillage, and effort) will be observed.</description>

        <title>Visual Analog Scale - Swallowing Score</title>
        <description>Visual analog scales are useful for measuring complex clinical events and offer the advantage of self-administration and responsiveness to change over time. The scales designed for this study inventory three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation (sialorrhea). For each of these, subjects score themselves by indicating their level of function on a scale of 1 (severe impairment) to 10 (normal). Scores range from 1 to 10; the higher the score, the more normal the function.</description>

The subject will be instructed to close their mouth, chew and subsequently swallow the bolus. The time to complete this task will be recorded. The test will be completed three times to obtain an average score.</description>
