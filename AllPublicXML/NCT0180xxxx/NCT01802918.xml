  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2838232 is a novel human immune virus (HIV) maturation inhibitor being developed for the
      treatment of chronic HIV infection. This study is the first administration of GSK2838232 in
      humans to establish the initial safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile following
      single doses of GSK2838232 and to evaluate the effect of food and ritonavir (RTV) on
      GSK2838232 in healthy subjects. There will be 2 cohorts in this study. In Cohort 1,
      approximately 8 healthy subjects will be enrolled (6 active and 2 placebo) at each dose
      visit. There will be four dosing sessions for each subject with subjects randomized to
      receive placebo in a random sequence. In Cohort 2, approximately 8 healthy subjects will be
      enrolled (6 active doses and 2 placebo doses at each dose visit). Cohort 2 will have four
      dosing sessions for each subject with subjects randomized to receive placebo in a random
      sequence.
