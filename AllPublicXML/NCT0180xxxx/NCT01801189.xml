    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether a single pre-operative dose of Pregabalin will
      alleviate post-operative pain and decrease post-operative analgesic requirements in morbidly
      obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.

      Pregabalin is a popular adjunct for relieving neuropathic pain in diabetics. There have been
      multiple studies evaluating its use in pre and post-operative pain control in various
      surgeries. Post-operative pain control is a challenging problem in bariatric patients due to
      the high doses of narcotic required, related to the high body mass, and the danger of
      concomitant respiratory depression. In the obese patient, the goal of postoperative pain
      management is provision of comfort, early mobilization and improved respiratory function,
      without causing inadequate pain control, respiratory compromise or increased nausea.

      Methods: A Randomized Controlled Trial, whereby patients undergoing Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass will be administered a single pre-operative dose of Pregabalin or a placebo.
      We plan to follow their immediate post-operative course in the hospital, with regard to the
      following primary endpoints:

        -  Post-operative analgesic requirements

        -  Post-operative pain scale (rated 0-10)

        -  Episodes of vomiting

        -  Post-operative antiemetic requirement

        -  Length of stay
