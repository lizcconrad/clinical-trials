      -  The study will re-confirm that the LightSheer Duet HS 805 nm handpiece is safe for
           removal of unwanted hair, and will result in hair removal and permanent hair count
           reduction.

        -  Twenty (20)subjects, Fitzpatrick Skin Type I-IV will be included in a single site.

        -  Each subject will receive five treatments at four to six week intervals and return for
           follow-up visits at three and six months after the last treatment for evaluation of the
           treated areas.
