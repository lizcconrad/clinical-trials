  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, an acute coronary event (ACE) may result in
      a decreased quality of life and increased distress. According to the American Diabetes
      Association, transition from the acute care setting is a high-risk time for all patients, but
      tailored support specific to diabetes is scarce in that period. The investigators developed
      an intervention by a diabetes nurse to help diabetic patients reduce distress after their
      first ACE. The intervention is based on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, Leventhal's Common
      Sense Model, and on results of focus groups which were conducted to define the needs and
      wishes of type 2 diabetes patients and their partners regarding professional support after an
      ACE. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention to reduce
      distress. The hypothesis is that patients who receive the intervention will have less
      diabetes related distress compared to the control group.

      Methods/Design: Randomized controlled trial. Patients will be recruited directly after
      discharge from hospital. A diabetes nurse will visit the patients in the intervention group
      (n = 100) within three weeks after discharge from hospital, two weeks later and two months
      later. The control group (n = 100) will receive a telephone consultation. The primary outcome
      is diabetes related distress, measured with the Problem Areas in Diabetes questionnaire
      (PAID). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, anxiety, depression, HbA1c, blood pressure
      and lipids. Mediating variables are self-management, self-efficacy and illness
      representations. Variables will be measured with questionnaires directly after discharge from
      hospital and five months later. Biomedical variables will be obtained from the records from
      the primary care physician and the hospital. Differences between groups in change over time
      will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

      Discussion: Type 2 diabetes patients who experience a first ACE need tailored support after
      discharge from the hospital. This trial will provide evidence of the effectiveness of a
      supportive intervention to reduce distress in these patients.

    <description>Diabetes related distress measure with the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire. The PAID is a Self-reported questionnaire consisting of twenty statements identified as common negative emotions related to living with diabetes. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;not a problem&quot;) to 4 (&quot;a serious problem&quot;). The total score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher score representing higher distress.</description>
