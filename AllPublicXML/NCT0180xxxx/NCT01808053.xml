      To adapt and refine the BodyGuardian remote health monitoring system to acquire ECG, Heart
      rate (HR), activity and breathing data, which will be integrated with weight, blood pressure
      and symptom data, in subjects in an independent living center, with wireless transmission of
      data to a central data analysis hub.

    <textblock>
      The elderly are facing an increasing prevalence of chronic disease and rapidly escalating
      healthcare costs threatening independent living. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a growing
      health epidemic and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and cost. Mayo Clinic
      and Preventice have developed a non-invasive, minimally obtrusive, interactive remote
      monitoring platform. It enables on-body monitoring and integration of ECG, heart rate,
      breathing, and activity, with measures of weight and blood pressure. It is designed as a
      platform for physician directed patient self-management. This technology may be useful in
      monitoring CHF patients. Our overall objective is to adapt, refine, test and validate this
      technology in subjects in an independent living center, with wireless transmission of data to
      a central data analysis hub.

    <description>The remote health management system connects personal health sensors with secure mobile communication devices. It is also able to give immediate feedback to the user. The solution is a multi-tiered mobile health platform. The front-end includes an adhesive snap-strip body sensor (BodyGuardian) that can measure HR, ECG, respiration rate (RR), and activity which is FDA approved for detection of non-lethal cardiac arrhythmias. It can wirelessly communicate with off-body sensors such as a BP cuff and scale to incorporate BP and weight data based on automated algorithms and can solicit symptoms from the user. It can also be used as an event recorder inputting symptoms and recording simultaneous physiologic data.</description>
