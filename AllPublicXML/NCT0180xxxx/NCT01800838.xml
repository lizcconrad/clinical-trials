      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of silicon phthalocyanine 4 and
      photodynamic therapy in treating patients with stage IA-IIA cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a drug, silicon phthalocyanine 4, that becomes
      active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, cancer cells
      are killed. This may be effective against cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be utilized for a single
      treatment of Pc 4-PDT (silicon phthalocyanine 4 photo dynamic therapy) on subjects with
      mycosis fungoides (MF)/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) stage IA-IIA, by evaluating an
      accelerated dose escalation protocol consisting of a single exposure to PDT using
      topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a wavelength of 675 nm, followed by assessment of
      skin biopsies to analyze cellular and molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT. (Cohort I)

      II. Determine safety and tolerability of repeated light (PDT) exposures after a single
      application of Pc 4 to a MF/CTCL plaque, using topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a
      wavelength of 675nm, followed by assessment of skin biopsies to analyze cellular and
      molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT. (Cohort II)

      III. Identification of targets for assessment of efficacy to assist in planning for a Phase
      II study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive silicon phthalocyanine 4 topically and then undergo PDT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks,
      and 30 days.

          -  Has been off topical therapies for at least 2 weeks
