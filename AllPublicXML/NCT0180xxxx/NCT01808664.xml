  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will develop and evaluate a novel intervention using
      standardized patients (SPs) -- or actors playing the roles of patients -- to enhance
      physicians' patient-centered counseling skills regarding two frequently overused, potentially
      inappropriate services in primary care: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for acute low back
      pain and bone densitometry in women at low-risk for osteoporosis. The investigators will
      further evaluate whether intervention effects on physician patient-centeredness generalize to
      counseling regarding other costly, unnecessary diagnostic tests.

    <measure>Actual diagnostic test ordering among real patients</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Among real patients seen by study physicians, we will assess diagnostic test ordering among actual adult patients during the post-intervention period. We will also assess comparable diagnostic test ordering during the pre-intervention period to enable adjustment for baseline test ordering.</description>

    <description>Primary care physicians (PCPs) randomized to intervention will receive over a three month run-in period two visits by standardized patient instructors portraying: 1) a 48 year-old patient with low back pain for less than six-weeks and no &quot;red flags&quot; for immediate spinal imaging; and 2) a 50 year-old recently menopausal woman establishing care with concerns about osteoporosis risk.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the latter half of visits with control PCPs, standardized patient instructors (SPIs) will share information regarding low back pain or bone health that are unrelated to diagnostic testing, but will not discuss patient-centered techniques or conduct training. The total duration of the control &quot;information sharing&quot; will be about one-third the SPI intervention to enhance patient-centeredness.</description>

    <description>In each case, patients will harbor underlying concerns about a serious underlying condition (e.g., either disc herniation or osteoporosis) and will request inappropriate tests. Standardized patient instructors (SPIs) will portray new patients visiting the clinic for the first time, and electronic medical records will be identical to that of actual new patients.
During the initial part of intervention visits, SPIs will assess the extent to which PCPs engage in patient-centered techniques specified in the final intervention model. SPIs will then break of their role and either teach or reinforce PCP use of the techniques, presenting techniques in a logical sequence while emphasizing flexibility in their use. SPIs will use scripts to deliver the interventions, providing opportunities for PCPs to ask questions, discuss concepts, and practice (by role playing) patient-centered techniques.</description>
