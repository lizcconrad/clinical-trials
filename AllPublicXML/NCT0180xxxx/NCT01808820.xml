  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic Cell vaccine manufactured and partially matured using our standard operating
      procedures, developed in collaboration with the HGG Immuno Group, then administered through
      imiquimod treated skin will be safe and feasible in patients with high grade glioma. This
      will result in anti-tumor immunity that will prolong survival of subjects treated. Study
      treatment will correlate with laboratory evidence of immune activation.

          1. Age: ≥ 13 years and ≤ 99 years.

          2. (2a) Relapse of high grade glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma World Health Organization
             (WHO) grade III or glioblastoma multiforme WHO grade IV), histologically proven at
             first stage of disease (radiological evidence for recurrence suffices); OR (2b)
             Relapse of glioma, which was grade II at initial diagnosis, but which is grade III or
             IV at relapse based on radiological or pathological criteria.

          3. Total or subtotal resection of tumor mass, confirmed by assessment by the neurosurgeon
             and by postoperative MRI scan within 72 hours after surgery. The post-operative
             assessment should demonstrate residual tumor less than or equal to 2 cm^3 as judged by
             surgeon and on MRI the tumor should only show linear contrast enhancement at the
             border of the resection cavity or nodule less than 2 cm^3.

          4. No radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy received for at least 1 month before first DC

          1. Pregnancy.

          2. Breast feeding females.

          3. Any concomitant participation in other therapeutic trials.

          4. Virus serology positive for HIV (testing is not required in the absence of clinical
             suspicion).

          5. Documented immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease.

          6. Mandatory treatment with corticosteroids or salicylates in the week prior to first
             vaccination.

          8. Patients with unresectable tumors, for instance pontine gliomas, are excluded.

          9. Refusal to use adequate contraception for fertile patients (females and males) during
             the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

         10. Any serious or uncontrolled medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of
             the investigator makes the patient not able to participate in the study.

         11. Application of gliadel wafers within the prior 4 months or a plan to place gliadel
             wafers at the time of resection for tumor acquisition for study.
