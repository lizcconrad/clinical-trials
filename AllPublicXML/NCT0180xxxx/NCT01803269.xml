  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving topotecan hydrochloride or
      cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 works in treating patients with recurrent
      small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet know
      whether topotecan hydrochloride is more effective than cyclodextrin-based
      polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 in treating patients with lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of second-line treatment with CRLX101 (cyclodextrin-based
      polymer-camptothecin CRLX101) compared to intravenous (IV) topotecan hydrochloride
      (topotecan) on progression free survival (PFS) of patients with extensive-stage small cell
      lung cancer (ES-SCLC) sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the effect of second-line treatment with CRLX101 on the three-month PFS rate
      of patients with ES-SCLC resistant to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate of second-line treatment with CRLX101 in patients with
      ES-SCLC who are sensitive or resistant to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the effect of second-line treatment with CRLX101 compared to IV topotecan on
      overall survival (OS) of patients with ES-SCLC sensitive to first-line platinum-based
      chemotherapy.

      III. To assess the overall survival of second-line treatment with CRLX101 in patients with
      ES-SCLC resistant to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

      IV. To assess the toxicity of second-line CRLX101 in patients sensitive or resistant to
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT A (Sensitive Relapse): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 IV over 60 minutes on
      days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B (Resistant Relapse): Patients receive cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin
      CRLX101 as in Arm B Cohort A. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
