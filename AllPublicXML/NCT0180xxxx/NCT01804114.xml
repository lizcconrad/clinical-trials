  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this study will determine if subjects receiving a continuous infusion
      of local anesthetic following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, with the pain pump
      installed as described to treat post surgical pain will have a lower incidence of pain than
      those patients treated with a placebo, saline-filled pain pump.The secondary endpoint of this
      study will determine if subjects receiving a continuous infusion of local anesthetic
      following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, with the pain pump installed as described to
      treat post surgical pain will have a lower utilization of narcotic analgesic medication than
      those patients treated with the placebo, saline-filled pain pump.

      Patients will be screened to determine study eligibility using inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      Following the consent process, subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment arm
      (anesthetic or placebo group). Baseline data will be collected prior surgical implantation of
      the pain pump delivery system. Both study and control groups will be able to receive
      supplemental medication for breakthrough pain as determined by the surgeon. Post-operative
      data will be collected up to three weeks following surgery.
