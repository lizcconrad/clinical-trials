  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving reduced intensity chemotherapy, haploidentical
      bone marrow, post-transplant cyclophosphamide and sirolimus is safe and feasible for patients
      with very high-risk solids tumors.

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be associated with a clinically
      significant &quot;graft-versus-tumor&quot; (GVT) effect, even against disease that is unresponsive to
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Graft-vs.-tumor (GVT) effects have been described after
      allogeneic HCT for neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma and
      hepatoblastoma.

      Our goal is to maximize a T cell and NK cell mediated graft versus tumor effect in poor
      prognosis solid tumor patients using haploidentical donors, T cell replete bone marrow, and a
      unique post-transplant immunosuppression regimen containing post transplantation Cy and an
      mTOR inhibitor. This therapy will be widely applicable because almost all patients have a
      half-matched donor available (parent or sibling). We hope to demonstrate the safety and
      feasibility of this therapy in anticipation of combining this platform with additional
      post-transplantation therapy such as cryoablation, Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI), stem cell
      directed therapy, immunologic checkpoint inhibitors, and/or metabolic inhibitors.

    <description>Given our promising results with low rates of GVHD and TRM using non-myeloablative haploidentical BMT in hematologic malignancies, we will use this backbone for very high risk solid tumors in order to maximize a graft versus tumor effect with allogeneic T cells and NK cells for patients with poor prognosis. We will modify our current regimen to include a reduced intensity dose of melphalan as an additional chemotherapeutic agent in the preparative regimen, as melphalan has commonly been incorporated into the myeloablative preparative regimens for solid tumors because of its tolerable side effect profile and anti-tumor efficacy.84 Sirolimus will be given post- transplant because of the potential for its additional anti-tumor benefit.</description>

        Criteria for donor eligibility:

          -  Age &gt;0.5 years

          -  Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the
             Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FACT).

          -  Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody Note: In some instances, low level,
             non-cytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a
             level well below that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a
             case-by-case basis by the PI and one of the immunogenetics directors.

          -  In the event that two or more eligible donors are identified, the following order of
             priority will be used to determine the preferred donor:

               1. Medically and psychologically fit and willing to donate

               2. Killer Immunoglobulin Receptor (KIR) Haplotype B Donor

               3. Red blood-cell compatibility (in order of preference)

                    2. Minor ABO incompatibility

                    3. Major ABO incompatibility

          -  For CMV seronegative recipients, a CMV seronegative donor. For CMV seropositive
             recipients, a CMV seropositive donor is preferred.

          -  If more than one preferred donor is identified from the above list and there is no
             medical reason to prefer one of them, then the following guidelines are recommended:

               1. If the patient is male, choose a male donor

               2. Choose the youngest preferred donor

               3. If the patient and family express a strong preference for a particular donor, use
                  that one

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will not be excluded on the basis of sex, racial or ethnic background.

          -  HIV-positive

          -  Donor (donor anti-recipient) ABO incompatibility if an ABO compatible donor is
             available.
