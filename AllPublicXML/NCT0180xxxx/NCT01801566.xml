    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the treatment with single implant overdenture for the edentulous
      mandible. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with lower overdenture retained by a
      single implant appears to have satisfactory effectiveness as a treatment for patients with
      specific conditions (such as maladaptive patients), with the advantages of simplicity and
      greater immediate benefits when compared to the conventional full denture, improving the
      retention and stability of the denture and better oral-related quality of life.

      This study is a longitudinal evaluation of clinical and patient-reported outcomes related to
      the single-implant mandibular overdenture treatment. Sixty completely edentulous individuals
      will be included. First, new complete dentures will be fabricated for all of them. Panoramic
      radiographs and conventional tomograms of the mandibular midline region will be obtained in
      order to plan the implant placement surgery. After the adaptation period related to the use
      of the new dentures, a single implant (Titamax IT Cortical, Neodent, Curitiba, Brazil) will
      be installed in the mandibular midline of all participants. According to the primary
      stability obtained in the implant placement patients will be treated with an immediate
      loading protocol when achieving torque of at least 30 Ncm and implant stability quotient
      (ISQ) of at least 60. In cases of values below cited, conventional loading protocol will be
      adopted. Ball O-ring will be used as the attachment system for the mandibular overdenture.
      Clinical and patient-reported outcomes will be collected after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after
      the installation of the overdentures.
