  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor for disease-free and
      overall survival in breast cancer. Accurate nodal staging can be achieved only by surgery.
      Today, in early-stage invasive breast cancers with clinically negative lymph nodes, minimally
      invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is considered the gold standard of regional lymph
      node staging. To optimize the effectiveness of SLNB, precise pre-and intraoperative mapping
      of lymphatic drainage is important. The (SLNB) technique is not standardized. The most common
      and most accurate way of lymphatic mapping is performed with the combined application of a
      gamma-emitting isotope labeled substance and blue dye, the so-called double labeling
      technique. Functional lymphatic drainage of SLNB double staining in the mammary gland, skin
      and axilla present a number of uncertainties.

      According to the axillary, lateral thoracic and thoracodorsal veins, Ibusuki et al. divided
      the axillary region into four subregions: brachial (lateral), pectoral (anterior), central
      and subscapular (posterior) zones. They revealed clear relationship between the anatomic
      location and status of the SLN, also confirmed by Gallowitsch et al. SLN was detected in
      Level I in 96% and in Level II in 4% by SPECT/CT.

      Knowedge of relationships between the drainage of sentinel lymph node staining into the
      axillary subregions, location of the primary tumor, tumor size, SLN positivity and its
      location within the subregion are of particular importance in the decision making whether or
      not axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) needs to be performed.

      In the prospective randomized phase 3 trial by Giuliano et al. (ACOSOG Z-11) ALND was not
      performed in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative axilla and
      breast-conserving surgery, for 1-2 macroscopically positive SLNs (10). After an average
      follow-up of 6.3 years, data were compared to the traditional ALND group and no difference
      was detected in 5-year overall survival or disease-free survival at 5 years.

      Aims of the investigation:

      To examine the location of SLN in the axillary subregion (anterior, posterior, central,
      lateral, apical) in patients with early breast cancer (T &lt;5 cm).

      To statistically assess correlations between the location, size, histological parameters of
      primary breast tumor and the subregion of the SLN.

      To statistically assess SLN positivity and its location within the sbregion.

      To statistically assess subregional localisation of positive SLN and the number of all
      positive regional lymph nodes, to predict a limited number of cases with lymph node
      metastasis, based on the test results of the ACOSOG Z-11 trial, by which ALND could be
      omitted.
