  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will allow to identify the prevalence of the SLC17A8 gene mutations in patients
      suffering from deafness. This phenotype also corresponds to DFNA15 deafness caused by POU4F3
      : mutations of this gene will be screened as well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DFNA are characterized as progressive bilateral deafness. To date, 21 genes and 57 loci are
      involved in these dominant deafness, with an unknown prevalence.A 22nd gene responsible of
      the disease has been found. This SLC17A8 gene encodes for the VGLUT3 protein which is
      specifically expressed in sensorial cells of the audition. VGlut3-/- mice present a deep
      deafness due to a deficiency of neurotransmitter release, although sensorial cells and
      neurons are intact. This kind of deafness is an ideal candidate for a genetic therapy because
      of the cells integrity.Mutations of SLC17A8 gene have been found in 2 american families that
      suffer from progressive deafness.The study aims to look for european families from the
      Mediterranean basin, which carry SLC17A8 gene mutations, and may benefit in a medium-term
      from genetic therapy. The study will allow to identify the prevalence of the SLC17A8 gene
      mutations in patients suffering from deafness. This phenotype also corresponds to DFNA15
      deafness caused by POU4F3 : mutations of this gene will be screened as well.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients with a

               1. suggestive neurosensory Deafness: The characteristics of the deafness will be
                  determined from the data of the questionnaire, of the interrogation, the
                  examination and results of the tonal audiometry.

                  *Neurosensory deafness: Audiometrics measurement(difference between the tonal
                  audiometric average loss for the frequencies 0,5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz in air
                  conduction and in osseous conduction) &lt; 15 dB for each of both ears.

                    -  Bilateral symetric: difference between the audiometric thresholds of both
                       ears &lt; or = 15 dB for at least two frequencies.

                    -  Light to severe: The degree of deafness is defined according to the
                       following classification (moderate hearing loss calculated on the
                       frequencies 500 Hz, 1, 2 and 4 kHz): light hearing deficiency from 20 to 40
                       dB, moderate hearing deficiency of 40 to 70 dB, severe hearing deficiency of
                       70 in 90 dB and deep hearing deficiency beyond 90 dB.

                    -  Whose thresholds frequency by frequency in tonal audiometry (air conduction)
                       are superior to the thresholds of the 90th percentile of the standard ISO
