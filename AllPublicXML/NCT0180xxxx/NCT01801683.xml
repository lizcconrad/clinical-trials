      Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the basis of work for physicians- practitioners in all
      specialties, including family medicine. Various issues in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis
      appear in daily work with patients and a physician should provide answers based on the best
      evidence stemming from research. In spite of having access to EBM databases in every GP's
      office in Croatia, searching and finding answers in consultation with a patient&quot;on the spot&quot;
      in real time is missing from practice.

      OBJECTIVES: To determine GP's knowledge and attitudes about EBM before and after applying
      modified academic detailing &quot;EBM intervention.&quot; provided by sixth- year medical students We
      assume that GP's knowledge and attitudes about EBM will change as a result of &quot;EBM
      intervention&quot; applied by students.

      STUDY DESIGN:An interventional non-randomized before-and-after study included 98 GPs (49 in
      the intervention group of mentors and 49 controls) and 174 medical students attending Family
      Medicine clinical rotations. A telephone survey on knowledge and attitudes towards EBM was
      conducted among participating physicians before and six months after the rotation. During the
      rotation, each mentor chose two cases from real life, and the students' task was to form an
      answerable clinical question, find the evidence-based answer and to write a brief report. The
      mentor reviewed the report and discussed it with the student.

      STUDY SETTING : The sixth year medical students within Family Medicine courses at
      MedicalSchool in Split, Zagreb and Rijeka have rotations at their mentors' offices. Before
      arrival of the students, mentors will respond to the questionnaire for physicians prepared
      for research purposes, and answer the same questionnaire six months after the &quot;EBM
      intervention.&quot; SUBJECTS: mentors /bearers of instructional practices in family medicine
      constitute the intervention group and the same number of physicians similar in all features
      to those from the intervention group except that they are not mentors/bearers of
      instructional practices constitute the control group. The intervention group will be
      subjected to students' &quot;EBM intervention&quot;, and the control will not.

      INTERVENTION: The sixth year medical students have practice at their mentors' offices within
      Family Medicine course. Each mentor chooses two patients / cases from real life, appearing to
      be diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic problems in the outpatient work. A student's task is
      to make a question according to Patient Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) scheme, find
      the best evidence / answer to that question and write a brief report in accordance
      withPractical Evidence about Real Life Situations PEARL. The report is then brought to the
      mentor for review and discussion. So, it is a students' &quot;EBM intervention&quot;, which will (?)
      affect the knowledge, attitudes and practice (work style) of a family physician.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-evaluation of knowledge and attitudes after the intervention,
      which would be a surrogate outcome measure for GP's change in behaviour and work style
      (adoption of EBM practice).

    <description>The intervention applied in this study was the modified academic detailing method, performed by sixth-year medical students as academic detailers. The students qualified for that role because they were taught about EBM in several courses during their undergraduate curriculum. During the family medicine rotation, each GP mentored six students in total. In Split each student visited two mentors for two weeks. In the course of rotation each mentor chose two patients (cases) from real life who represented diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic challenge. The students' task was to form an answerable question, using the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) scheme, find the best evidence-based answer to that question and to write a brief report according to Practical Evidence about Real Life Situations (PEARLS) pattern. The mentor then reviewed the report and discussed it with the student.</description>
