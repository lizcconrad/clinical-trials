      Purpose and Objective: Heart failure therapies including beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors,
      aldosterone antagonists, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices have proven beneficial but are underused in eligible
      patients. The investigators seek to determine if automating referral to cardiologists and
      electrophysiologists through an intelligent electronic medical record system can improve
      adherence to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) heart
      failure guideline recommended therapies.

      Study activities and population group: The AMERICA-HF trial will be a randomized,
      single-center, single blinded study comparing standard-practice provider initiated
      cardiovascular specialty referral to experimental automated medical record driven
      cardiovascular specialty referral. An investigational program will automatically screen all
      finalized electronic reports from clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiogram studies
      performed in the Duke University Echo Lab system and create an automated query to obtain HF
      ICD-9 codes. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to participate in a registry (n=125)
      or automated electronic medical record (EMR) based subspecialty care intervention arm
      (n=125).

      Data analysis: The primary endpoint is rate of adherence (%) to ACC/AHA HF guideline
      recommended therapies at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up among patients randomized to the
      registry compared to the intervention. Differences in characteristics (including use of
      guideline recommended therapies) will be tested using Pearson Chi-square tests for
      categorical variables and Wilcoxon two-sample tests for continuous variables. Time to event
      analysis will be performed for the secondary endpoints of hospitalization or death.

  <why_stopped>
    We observed a very high referral rate for patients with HF in the Duke Health System,
    eliminating the need for an automated referral process.

    <description>To determine the time-frame over which the intervention has a treatment effect, repeated measures analysis will be performed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention is made. The goal of this analysis to to determine how quickly adherence is achieved with the intervention and whether adherence is maintained long-term.</description>
