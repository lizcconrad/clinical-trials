    <textblock>
      Although proper sedation is mandatory for endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic submucosal
      dissection, the effects of sedation on ESD performance and complications have not been fully
      evaluated. In the investigators previous retrospective study, en bloc resection and complete
      resection rates, and procedure time could be improved by sedation with continuous propofol
      infusion with opioid administration by anesthesiologists. However, there are several
      limitations to the study including retrospective design. The investigators aimed to evaluate
      the relationship among sedation methods, satisfaction of endoscopists or patients, clinical
      outcomes, and complications after endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasia.

    <description>In this arm1, sedation during endoscopic submucosal dissection is controlled by endoscopists.
First, pethidine 50 mg with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg are injected in a bolus fashion.
When the patient seems to be discomfort or the patient's movements were observed, endoscopists should check the Modified Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAAS).
If MOAAS is 5 or 6, propofol 0.25 mg/kg will be injected. Otherwise, pethidine 12.5 mg will be injected.</description>

    <description>In this arm2, sedation during endoscopic submucosal dissection is controlled by anesthesiologists.
First, remifentanil 0.5 ug/kg with propofol 0.5 mg/kg are injected in a bolus fashion.
Then, remifentanil 0.08 ug/kg/min and propofol 2 mg/kg/h are infused continuously.
When the patient seems to be discomfort or the patient's movements were observed, anesthesiologists should check the MOAAS.
If MOAAS is 5 or 6, infusion rate of propofol will be increased by 0.5 mg/kg/h. Otherwise, infusion rate of remifentanil will be increased by 0.02 ug/kg/min.</description>
