  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that frailty assessment prior to concurrent chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy in the elderly will predict treatment-related toxicity and morbidity and
      that such assessment at serial time points will help improve treatment and outcomes for these
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have one of the following histologically or cytologically confirmed
             cancers: lung cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, anal cancer, rectal
             cancer, cervix cancer, or bladder cancer, and must have appropriate indications for
             the use of standard concurrent chemotherapy plus radiation therapy as defined in the
             NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) Guidelines for each of these specific
             organ-sites.

          -  Age &gt;70 years.

          -  ECOG (Easter Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Life expectancy Tables showing upper, middle, and lower quartiles of life expectancy
             for women and men age 70 and older should be used and life expectancy should be
             estimated to be of sufficient to justify the use of concurrent chemotherapy plus
             radiation for each organ site and indication.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered to baseline from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients who are receiving any investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known distant site metastases (M1 disease) or brain metastases should be
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients who have a history of one or more other concurrent cancers besides the cancer
             for which concurrent chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is considered are ineligible
             only if the other cancer or cancers are being considered for treatment or are actively
             being treated.

          -  Patients carrying a pre-existing diagnosis of HIV/AIDS and are on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with chemotherapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

          -  Patients with any standard contraindication to chemotherapy or radiation therapy are
             ineligible.

          -  Transplant recipient patients on immune-suppressant agents are ineligible due to
             increased risk of infection.
