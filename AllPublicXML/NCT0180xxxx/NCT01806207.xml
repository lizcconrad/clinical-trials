    <textblock>
      This was a study that compared Durolane injections to saline injections in the treatment of
      unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee. The patients were randomly assigned one of the two
      treatments unaware of which treatment they received. The study was conducted at 13 centers in
      Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Patients were followed for six weeks after study
      treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilateral knee osteoarthritis

          -  Osteoarthritis or clinically significant pain from other part of the musculoskeletal

          -  Kellgren Lawrence radiographic score grade IV for the study knee

          -  Change in physical therapy/occupational therapy for the knee within the last 3 months

          -  Treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including topical agents
             for the study knee) during the last week (or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is
             longer) prior to baseline visit
