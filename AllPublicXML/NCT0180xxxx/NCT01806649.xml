    <textblock>
      There is a need for more effective therapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma who developed disease progression after first line therapy. Currently, there is no
      standard second-line therapy for this disease.

      BKM-120 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor currently tested in clinical trials. In a cellular model of
      oral-esophageal carcinogenesis, it has shown that EGFR overexpression activated PI3/AKT
      pathway. Therfore, there is interest to see the efficacy and safety of BKM120 in this
      setting.
