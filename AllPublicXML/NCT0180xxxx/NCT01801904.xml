      The purpose of this study is to assess if panitumumab is active enough to warrant comparative
      studies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after treatment
      with cetuximab.

      The study was amended with modification of inclusion criteria (from wild-type tumor KRAS gene
      to wild-type RAS gene, including KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4)

      RAS mutational status of tumors of patients enrolled before amendment 1 approval will be
      centrally revised. Patients whose tumors will result RAS mutated at the biomarkers central
      revision, will be replaced. Therefore, the overall sample size at both the stages may be
      higher than the one initially planned.

             Patients may or may not have been treated with bevacizumab.

          -  Documented disease progression following a treatment with cetuximab in patients who
             showed either an objective response after 8 weeks or stable disease after 16 weeks of
             cetuximab treatment.
