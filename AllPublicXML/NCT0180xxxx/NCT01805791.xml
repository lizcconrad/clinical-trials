  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A placebo controlled study of two doses of HMPL-004 in patients with active mild to moderate
      ulcerative colitis (UC), with a modified Mayo Score 4-10 and an endoscopy subscore of 2-3,
      taking mesalamine (or equivalent) as a concomitant medication.

      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HMPL-004 with mesalamine (mesalamine
      treatment failures). Efficacy will be measured by a comparison of the proportion of patients
      in each treatment group attaining clinical remission at Week 8 as compared to placebo.

    <time_frame>After 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be evaluated for their change of disease activity after 8 weeks of treatment by means of a Modified Mayo Scoring system. Patients will be evaluated at week 8 for disease remission. For the current study, the definition of remission has been modified. The remission is defined as a total Mayo Score of &lt; 2 points with no individual sub-score &gt; 1 point AND rectal bleeding score = 0. For remission, the endoscopy will have no friability (meaning a score of 0 or 1). The endoscopy score has been modified such that any degree of friability will be scored as a 2 or greater. Safety will be assessed by the frequency, type and severity of Adverse Events during the 8 weeks of treatment for each dose of HMPL-004 used as compared to placebo.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be currently receiving mesalamine ≥ 2.4 g/day (or the equivalent) for at
             least 6 weeks prior to randomization and on a stable dosage for at least 2 weeks prior
             to entering the screening phase of the study to ensure a stable dose is established at
             least 2 weeks prior to the endoscopic procedures.

          -  Have active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis defined by a modified Mayo Score 4-10,
             and with endoscopy score activity of 2-3 points confirmed by centrally read
             colonoscopy (within 2 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Minimum modified Mayo endoscopy score of &gt;2 at the time of study colonoscopy.
