    <textblock>
      This study is being done for the following reasons:

      To determine the safety of LY2886721 and any side effects that may be associated with it and
      to see how much of the study drug is in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid when one dose
      is given to healthy participants and participants diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. It will
      also look at how safe and tolerable the study drug is when given to healthy participants in
      higher doses.

      This research study is being conducted in three groups, referred to as Groups (Cohorts) A, B
      or C.

      Group A will enroll participants with Alzheimer's disease while Groups B and C will enroll
      healthy participants.

      For Group A or B, participation in this research study could last up to 34 days. For Group C,
      participation could last up to 60 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy participants have a body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 32 kilograms per square
             meter (kg/m^2), inclusive, at screening. There are no restrictions on BMI in
             participants diagnosed with AD

          -  Healthy participants should not be taking any concomitant medications. For
             participants with AD, concomitant medications will be determined by the investigator
             in consultation with the Lilly clinical pharmacologist on an individual basis

        Cohort A:

          -  Participants are defined as otherwise healthy males or females as determined by
             medical history, physical examination and a diagnosis of AD and must be at least 45
             years of age

          -  Meets National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
             Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria
             for probable AD; as determined by a clinician approved by the sponsor or designee

          -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 16 through 28 at screening

          -  Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale (MHIS) score of &lt;4

          -  Capable of understanding and signing their own informed consent, in the opinion of the
             investigator, or if the participant has a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) then
             the LAR must be capable of understanding and signing the assent form and the
             participant may or may not sign the informed consent, as to be determined by the
             investigator.

          -  If receiving concurrent treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI)
             and/or memantine, has been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Day 1. Dosing
             must remain stable throughout the study. Note: If a participant has recently stopped
             ACHEIs and/or memantine, he or she must have discontinued treatment for at least 4
             weeks before Day 1
