  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As for the indication of vulvovaginal candidiasis, a single oral administration of
      fluconazole 150 mg has been approved and is recommended by guidelines overseas. However in
      Japan oral therapy with antifungal triazole such as Fluconazole has not been approved, and
      topical therapies such as vaginal tablets, pessary and cream are used clinically. The purpose
      of this trial is to confirm the efficacy and safety of single oral administration of
      fluconazole 150 mg for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in Japanese patients.

    <measure>Therapeutic Outcome: Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic outcome was determined by combination of clinical efficacy and mycological efficacy for each participant as Effective, Ineffective or Indeterminate. The therapeutic outcome was considered as Effective when the clinical efficacy was Cure and the mycological efficacy was Eradication.
Primary evaluation of therapeutic outcome was on Day 28.
Response rate was calculated based on the following formula, &quot;the number of participants assessed as effective&quot; over &quot;total participants excluding ones assessed as indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Cure Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Scores of severity in signs and symptoms at each observation dates were compared with those before the treatment and the clinical efficacy was determined as Cure (the clinical symptom disappeared), Improvement (the clinical symptom was improved: the total score of clinical symptom was reduced relative to the total score before the treatment), Failure (the criteria for Cure and Improvement were not met, or other systemic antifungal drugs or local antifungal drugs were administered for the treatment of the disease to be examined) or Indeterminate (efficacy for each item was not determined for the reasons including failure to conduct the test, or other systemic antifungal agents or local antifungal drugs were administered for the treatment of infections other than the disease to be examined).
Cure rate was calculated based on the following formula, &quot;the number of participants assessed as Cure&quot; over &quot;total participants excluding ones assessed as Indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Therapeutic Outcome: Response Rate</title>
        <description>Therapeutic outcome was determined by combination of clinical efficacy and mycological efficacy for each participant as Effective, Ineffective or Indeterminate. The therapeutic outcome was considered as Effective when the clinical efficacy was Cure and the mycological efficacy was Eradication.
Primary evaluation of therapeutic outcome was on Day 28.
Response rate was calculated based on the following formula, &quot;the number of participants assessed as effective&quot; over &quot;total participants excluding ones assessed as indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28</time_frame>

Primary evaluation of therapeutic outcome was on Day 28.
Response rate was calculated based on the following formula, &quot;the number of participants assessed as effective&quot; over &quot;total participants excluding ones assessed as indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.</description>
