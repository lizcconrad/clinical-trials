      The purpose of this prospective study is evaluate the best dose of busulfan for each patient
      undergoing Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Busulfan is an alkylating antineoplastic agent used commonly during the conditioning
           regimen in patients undergoing Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Due to
           the fact that this drug has a variable metabolism in different individuals, the
           investigators performed the plasmatic dosage of chemotherapy before starting the
           conditioning regimen (test dose) as a way to predict the best dose to them during the
           conditioning. Busulfan toxicities depends on the &quot;Area Under Curve&quot; and Concentration
           Steady State (CSS).

        -  The investigators randomized in groups according to the route of drug administration:
           per oral and intravenously. Dose test will be performed before conditioning and othe
           pharmacokinetics (Pk) study will be made in the first day of conditioning. The test dose
           of P.O busulfan will be 1 mg/Kg/dose and 32 mg/m2 for I.V busulfan. The target dose of
           busulfan during the conditioning will depends on the Pk obtained during the test dose.
           In the first day of regimen, other samples will be analysed and the new AUC will be
           adjusted. We will have a control group who have never performed monitoring before
           (retrospective group)

        -  Test Dose for oral busulfan will be performed with peripheral blood samples at the time:
           0h (before taking busulfan), 30', 1h, 1,5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h and 6h. In the first day of
           conditioning other samples will be collected again in the same moments.

        -  Test dose for I.V busulfan will be performed on time 0h, 30', 45', 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h,
           6h and 8h after receiving I.V busulfan. If the patients will receive I.V busulfan during
           conditioning, the blood samples should be collected on time 0h, 30', 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h,
           6h, 7h and 8h after taking busulfan. The blood samples will be centrifuged (4ยบ C/ 3200
           rpm/10 minutes) and analysed.

        -  Patients will be monitored with pharmacokinetic's drug and clinical outcomes. The
           investigators will evaluate acute and chronic toxicities after Stem Cell
           Transplantation.

    <description>Evaluate the Bu pharmacokinetics (PK) when the drug will be received by P.O or I.V and we will establish the target &quot;Area Under Curve- AUC&quot; based on a single daily dose (test dose) before HSCT. The test dose of orally Bu is 1 mg/Kg and the blood samples are collected and processed in time: 0h, 30 min, 1h, 1,5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h and 6h after drug intake. After extraction of the plasma samples busulfan, quantitative analyzes of busulfan on human plasma will be performed by the liquid chromatograph. For the patients that will receive intravenously busulfan, the test dose is 32 mg/m2 and blood samples are collected in time: 0h, 30', 45', 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h and 8h after drug intake. The dose during the conditioning will depend on the test dose and the AUC target.</description>
