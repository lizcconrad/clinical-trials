      Wheat allergy is affected 0.4-1% and is a major staple of the worldwide diet. Wheat avoidance
      is exceedingly difficult and imposes major dietary restriction. The purpose of this study
      were to determine the rate of oral tolerance and identify clinical and laboratory predictors
      of tolerance development in Thai children who allergic to wheat.

      All children in this study were sensitized to wheat. Each patient was clinically evaluated,
      with focus on wheat allergy by both a detailed medical examination and collection of medical
      history. Blood sample was taken for baseline determination of ImmunoglobulinE antibodies to
      wheat and to omega-5-gliadin. The oral wheat challenge were performed in all study subjects
      to identify a case of wheat outgrowing. The primary outcome was the development of oral
      tolerance to wheat. Oral wheat challenge were generally performed at least every 1 years if
      the child did not have an interval history of symptoms with unintentional exposure.
