    <textblock>
      This is a research study of a radiation treatment called stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) plus a medicine called sorafenib. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety
      of SBRT plus Sorafenib to see what effects (good and bad) it has on the treatment of liver
      cancer.

             body immobilization device as per institutional or manufacturer guidelines.

        4.1.15 Patients must have adequate liver function within 2 weeks of study registration.

        4.1.19 Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. The effects of Sorafenib on the
        developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because radiation therapy and
        Sorafenib used in this trial are may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and
        men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control)
        prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become

        trial.

        4.2.18 Any condition that impairs patient's ability to swallow whole pills. 4.2.19 Any
        malabsorption problem that would impair the patient's ability to absorb oral medication.

        4.2.20 Other severe, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
        abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
        administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
        judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
        study.
