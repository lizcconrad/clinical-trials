  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the perspectives of patients' undergoing surgery for lung or
      esophageal cancer. It will examine both pre-op and post-op patient perspectives and opinions
      regarding pain and surgical complications. This study will also assess a general health
      related quality of life pre-op and post-op. Additionally, it will examine the importance of
      receiving care close to home and their support system.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The data will allow investigators to better understand the willingness of patients to
           participate in prospective, randomized studies comparing minimally invasive and open
           thoracic surgery. Patients will not be willing to undergo randomization to an open
           versus minimally invasive surgical procedure.

        2. The pain associated with Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) will be perceived and
           documented as lesser than open surgery.

        3. Patients may be willing to accept a higher risk of complications or more post-operative
           pain if they were given the option to be cared for closer to their home.
