      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of natural killer T (NKT)
      cell-based autologous adoptive immunotherapy in subjects with metastatic,
      treatment-refractory breast cancer, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell lung
      cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer or prostate cancer.
