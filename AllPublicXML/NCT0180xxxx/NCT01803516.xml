  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the look of telangiectasias (small dilated blood
      vessels) on radiated breast skin when altered by the pulsed dye laser affects a patient's
      overall well being.

      Patients will have a set of treatments with a pulsed dye laser. This is a laser that targets
      red blood vessels and delivers heat causing the telangiectasias to become smaller and less
      visible. The laser has been used safely to treat telangiectasias on the skin of patients who
      received radiation for breast cancer.

      Patients in the study will be asked to complete a questionnaire asking how they feel about
      the telangiectasias, their radiated skin and its effect on their daily lives. The
      questionnaire will be given at every visit. The improvement in the look of patients' radiated
      skin will also be compared to answers to the questionnaire. We hope the study will improve
      our understanding of how patients feel about the long term effects of radiation on their
      skin.

    <description>in breast cancer survivors with chronic radiation-induced telangiectasias who are undergoing pulsed dye laser treatment. To assess quality of life in relation to the radiation-induced telangiectasias, two pre-existing validated scales will be utilized. The Skindex-16 and BREAST-Q are scales that have been validated to assess quality of life.</description>

    <description>This study will be offered to patients who, at the time of consultation are identified as having had adjuvant breast radiation treatment following surgical treatment for breast cancer and developed radiation-induced telangiectasias. The Skindex-16 and BREAST-Q questionnaires will be used to evaluate the quality of life of The study participants. For each instrument, for each evaluation time point, QOL scores will be summed and transformed into a scale from 0-100. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the QOL of the study participants.</description>
