  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The object of this randomized, parallel, positive controlled study is to explore the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile of the test drug after single-dose subcutaneous
      administration, compared to the comparator drug (EPIAO®) after multiple-dose subcutaneous
      administration, by assessing plasma concentration of the drug and the reticulocyte count,
      hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit following subcutaneous administration, evaluate the
      security and tolerability of the test drug in healthy subjects, and provide sufficient
      information for dose selection in the future phase II and III study.
