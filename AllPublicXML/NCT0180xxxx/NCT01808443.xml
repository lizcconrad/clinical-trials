      Cutaneous warts were a common skin diseases caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection.
      Although warts may spontaneously resolve, many patients seek for treatment for various
      reasons. There are many kinds of treatments for cutaneous warts, including salicylic acid,
      cryotherapy, laser, etc. A recent high quality RCT confirmed that the cure rate of topical
      salicylic acid and frozen has no difference at six months, but the efficacy of laser versus
      cryotherapy on the treatment of warts remains unclear. Therefore, we designed a randomized
      controlled trial to test the efficacy of laser versus cryotherapy on the treatment of warts.
