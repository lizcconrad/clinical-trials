    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhTPO in the maintenance
      treatment of ITP, to explore the appropriate dosing interval of the maintenance treatment of
      rhTPO .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eligible subjects with ITP firstly will receive a pre-treatment of rhTPO 300 IU/Kg once
      daily up to 14 days. The subjects with two consecutive platelet counts above 50×10^9/L in the
      pre-treatment period will begin to receive maintenance treatment of rhTPO 300 IU/Kg for 12
      weeks. In the period of maintenance treatment, starting dosing interval of rhTPO is every
      other day followed by the interval adjustments for keeping platelet counts between 30
      ×10^9/L～100 ×10^9/L. Subsequently, subjects will stop treatment of rhTPO and be followed up
      for 4 weeks after maintenance treatment.

      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms will be evaluated before and after treatment.

      Platelet transfusion will be administered to subjects with active bleeding symptoms.

      Toxicity will be monitored continuously during the entire study. Safety will be assessed by
      adverse events and laboratory tests.

    <description>Subcutaneously dosing of rhTPO is based on screening weight. Subjects will be given rhTPO 300 IU/Kg once daily up to 14 days in the pre-treatment period . When two consecutive platelet counts is above 50×10^9/L, the subjects will be begin to receive maintenance treatment of rhTPO 300 IU/Kg. In the period of maintenance treatment, starting dosing interval of rhTPO is every other day followed by the interval adjustments for keeping platelet counts between 30×10^9/L～100×10^9/L.</description>
