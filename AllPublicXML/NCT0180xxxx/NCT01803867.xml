      This is a Phase I, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      dose-escalation study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      immunogenicity of single intravenous (IV) administrations of rHIgM22 in patients with all
      clinical presentations of MS.

    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters will include; The maximum measured plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), half-life (T1/2), and the area under the concentration curve from time 0 to the concentration at last time point (AUC (0-last)).</description>

    <description>Cohorts 1-5: In each dosing cohort, the first 2 eligible patients will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive rHIgM22 or placebo, and monitored for safety for a minimum of 7 days before the remaining 8 patients in the cohort are randomized (7 active: 1 placebo) and dosed.
Expanded Cohort: Upon establishment of a Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD), a new group of 21 patients will be enrolled in an Expansion Cohort. Randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, Investigational Product (IP) at MTD, or IP at one full dose level lower than MTD.</description>
