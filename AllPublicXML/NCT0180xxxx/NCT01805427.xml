  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concentration of the third agent in antiretroviral therapy [Non Nucleoside Reverse
      Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), or boosted Protease inhibitor (PI) ] is different according
      to the body weight or body composition and therapeutic monitoring may be necessary in
      overweight HIV patients.

      The investigators aim at measuring the individual trough concentrations of interest [at
      steady state for NNRTI and boosted PI] in overweight and normal weight HIV+ patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our primary endpoint is the individual trough concentrations of interest at steady state for
      NNRTI or boosted PI; Principal outcome measure: comparison of the concentrations between
      patients &lt;25kg/m2 and patients&lt;25kg/m2

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Occurrence of virologic failure

        -  Occurrence of clinical/biological adverse events

        -  Percentage of patients with concentration within the therapeutic range

        -  Body composition Secondary outcome measures: comparison of the occurrence of virologic
           failure, occurrence or adverse event, patients with concentration within the therapeutic
           range between groups. Correlation between body composition and concentration.

      Methodology, study design:

      open-labelled monocentric study.

      Sample size:

      It will be a descriptive experimental study involving 120 overweight subjects, 120 normal
      weight subjects

      Inclusion criteria :

        -  Patients with HIV+

        -  Patients aged more than 18 years old.

        -  Patient giving its well-informed and free consent.

      Study design :

      Plasma concentration was performed during the usual clinical follow-up. Study duration: 12
      months Duration for a patient: 1 day Investigating center and participating units: one center
      enrolling the patients and the lab performing drug dosages.
