  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) for prevention of surgical site
      infection (SSI) following thyroid and parathyroid surgery remains uncertain. Present
      prospective randomized control study (Ito-RCT1) assessed the effectiveness of AMP in clean
      neck surgery associated with thyroid and parathyroid disease.

    <textblock>
      Between November 2010 and April 2012, 2164 consecutive patients who agreed to attend the
      randomized control study were enrolled. All the participants received surgery for thyroid and
      parathyroid disease at Ito Hospital and randomized in three groups; Group A (n=541):
      operation with AMP (PIPC, piperacillin sodium), Group B (n=541): operation with AMP (CEZ,
      cefazolin sodium), and Group C (n=1082): operation without AMP.

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Patients who did not agree to attend the randomized control study.

        -  Patients who received the operation including mediastinum with sternotomy.

        -  Patients who received the operation including additional resection of trachea, esophagus
           and larynx.

        -  Patients who received the re-operation for post-operative bleedings.

        -  Patients who had known allergy to cephem or penicillin.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical site infections after thyroid and parathyroid surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical site infection was defined as patients who are necessary to receive the treatment such as surgical drainage or antibiotic medication. When the patients receive the surgical drainage, microbial culture was performed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side effect of the drug for Antimicrobial prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The appearances of drug allergic reactions (skin rash and anaphylactic shock) were checked at operating room. Blood test to check up liver and renal dysfunction was done on the 3rd POD. Liver and renal dysfunction is clinically diagnosed by patients' own physicians and the author, and only counted the cases which function got worse compared to preoperative data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Urinary tract infection after operation with or without antimicrobial prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>1month after operation</time_frame>
    <description>If the patients had a symptom of urinary tract infection, additional blood test and urine test were done to diagnose infection accurately.</description>

    <description>Patients in group A (intervention PIPC) were given AMP of 2g PIPC intravenously just after intubation. If the operation time was longer than 3 hours, additional infusion of same dose PIPC was done. After coming back to the patients' own room, one more infusion of same dose of same drug was done.</description>
