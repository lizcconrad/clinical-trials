      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of oral, sublingual, vaginal, and no
      misoprostol prior to operative hysteroscopy in premenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The route of administration of misoprostol for cervical dilatation prior to operative
      hysteroscopy can be oral, vaginal, or sublingual. However, it is still unclear which route is
      more effective and less harmful for cervical dilation prior to operative hysteroscopy in
      premenopausal women. Furthermore, there have been no studies comparing among oral,
      sublingual, and vaginal misoprostol, no medication (control) in these women. The objective of
      this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral, sublingual, vaginal, and no
      misoprostol prior to operative hysteroscopy in premenopausal women.

    <description>The primary outcome measure was the preoperative cervical width at the time of operation. The cervical width was assessed by performing cervical dilation, starting with a number 10 Hegar dilator and subsequently inserting smaller Hegar dilators until dilator could pass through the internal os without resistance. The largest one that could be passed was recorded as the initial cervical width.</description>

        Exclusion criteria included any evidence of a contraindication to prostaglandins (history
        of severe asthma, glaucoma, preexisting severe cardiac disease, or renal failure), or
        allergy to prostaglandins, any sign of genital infection, presence of significant
        uterovaginal prolapse that could affect administration of vaginal tablets, history of
