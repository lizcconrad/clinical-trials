  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women diagnosed with an early stage cancer of the breast usually have the cancer removed by
      lumpectomy and then have radiation treatments to the entire breast. In 2008 the investigators
      published the result of a multicentre study showing that breast Intensity Modulated Radiation
      Therapy (IMRT) significantly reduces the occurrence of radiation burns. In this study the
      investigators will recall all patients at 8 years to assess if this technique also reduces
      permanent side effects including pain and cosmesis.

      In 2008 our group published the results of a multicentre, randomized, double-blinded study
      comparing standard radiotherapy to breast IMRT. The study showed a significant reduction
      moist desquamation using breast IMRT from 47.8% to 31.2% (p=0.002). There are two other Phase
      III trials showing improvement of long term cosmetic outcomes. Yet the use of breast IMRT
      remains not widely accepted. This trial aims at evaluating long term tolerance of breast IMRT
      compared to standard radiotherapy.

      The investigators hypothesize that breast IMRT reduces the occurence of chronic breast pain
      (primary objective), improves cosmesis, reduces the occurence of delayed and permanent
      radiation induced skin side effects (telangiectasia, dryness, induration, edema,
      discolorations), improves quality of life. The investigators also hypothesize that there will
      not be differences in the local control rate or survival.
