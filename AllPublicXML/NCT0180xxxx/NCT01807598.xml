    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with advanced
      systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab
      vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to
      grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate to SGN-35 (brentuximab vedotin) in patients with tumor
      necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8 (CD30+) advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM)
      (ASM or mast cell leukemia [MCL] with or without an associated hematological clonal non-mast
      cell lineage disease [AHNMD]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of SGN-35 in patients with SM.

      II. To evaluate expression of CD30 on neoplastic mast cells before and during therapy with
      SGN-35.

      III. To evaluate changes in mastocytosis related symptom scores and quality of life (QOL)
      using a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF).

      IV. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR). V. To evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 1 year and
      then every 12 weeks thereafter.
