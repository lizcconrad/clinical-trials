  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a double-blind randomized sham-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness
      of resistive capacitive diathermy in subjects affected by knee osteoarthritis in comparison
      with a &quot;sham&quot; diathermy treatment. The resistive capacitive diathermy is a medical device
      supplying low (448 KHz) radiofrequencies with maximum output power of 200 W, used to reduce
      pain and inflammation and allowing healing processes. The sham diathermy treatment is
      administered with the device set on &quot;on&quot; but not active (not supplying energy). Each subject,
      randomly assigned to either resistive capacitive diathermy treatment (group 1) or
      sham-treatment (group 2) is submitted to a thirty minutes session, three times per week for a
      total of ten sessions. The outcome measures are the WOMAC scale (Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Arthritis Index) to assess pain and physical functioning, a visual analogic
      scale (VAS) for pain, the femoral quadriceps strength (MRC = Medical Research Council Scale).
      Outcome measures are administered at baseline (T0), at the end of the treatment protocol
      (T1), at 1 month (T2) and 3 months (T3) after the end of treatment.
