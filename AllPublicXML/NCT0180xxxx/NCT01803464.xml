  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromuscular disorder that affects approximately 800,000
      individuals in the U.S. An estimated 70-80% of these individuals have spasticity which
      affects ambulation and requires management. Therefore, the treatment of spasticity is a
      primary goal of interventions for children with CP. One treatment widely used to reduce
      spasticity is Botox because of its ability to temporarily paralyze a muscle. However, no
      studies have determined the effect of Botox treatment on bone in humans. Also, a low
      magnitude vibration treatment has been shown to improve bone structure in the lower extremity
      bones of children with CP. The aims of this study are: 1) to determine the effect of Botox
      treatment in conjunction with a daily vibration treatment on bone mass and bone structure in
      children with spastic CP, and 2) to identify the mechanism that underlies the effect of Botox
      and vibration on bone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have been working with children diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) for the
      past 10 years. The investigators have found that bone structure is markedly underdeveloped
      and bone strength is severely compromised in children with CP. Also, an increased fracture
      rate has been observed in the lower extremity bones of children with CP. There is evidence
      that Botox, which is used to treat spasticity in CP, can improve motor function; however the
      effect of Botox on human bone is unknown. There is also evidence that low magnitude vibration
      treatment can improve bone mass and bone structure. The overall goal of this current research
      study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of Botox and vibration on bone in
      children with CP. The investigators will also examine the effect of Botox on muscle volume.

      A total of 36 participants will participate in this study. The investigators will assess bone
      structure and muscle volume using MRI. The investigators will assess bone mass using
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

          <description>Children with cerebral palsy who are recommended for and scheduled to receive Botox treatment will randomized to also receive vibration treatment. Children will be asked to stand on a vibration plate 10 minutes per day for 6 months.
Botox plus low-magnitude vibration: Half of the children who receive Botox treatment will be randomly assigned to receive a high-frequency, low magnitude vibration treatment. The other half of the children who receive Botox treatment and are randomly assigned to the Botox-only group will be offered the vibration treatment at the end of the study.</description>
