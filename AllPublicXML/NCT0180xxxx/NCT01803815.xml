  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the phenotypic characteristics of OSA patients
      and their pattern of antihypertensive drugs consumption. The investigators also aimed to
      investigate a hypothetical association between ongoing anti-hypertensive regimen and Blood
      pressure control rates in these patients. Additionally, the investigators were also
      interested in trying to understand if the control of OSA may be influenced by the use of
      different classes of anti-hypertensive drugs.
