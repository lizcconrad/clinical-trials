    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine approximately what percentage of an orally
      administered dose of PD-0332991 is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic
      circulation. This approximation is made by comparing the plasma pharmacokinetics of a 125 mg
      oral dose of PD-0332991 to the plasma pharmacokinetics of a 50 mg intravenous dose of
      PD-0332991 administered as a 4-hour infusion.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
