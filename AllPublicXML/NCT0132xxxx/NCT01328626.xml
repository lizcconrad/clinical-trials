  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and PK profile of
      ABT-199 under a once daily dosing schedule. Two arms will be implemented for dose escalation:
      Arm A, CLL/SLL subjects and Arm B, NHL subjects. Arm A is designed to enroll approximately
      116 subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL and Arm B is designed to enroll
      approximately 95 subjects with relapsed or refractory NHL. Fifty-six subjects were enrolled
      in Arm A and approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled in Arm B during the dose escalation
      portion of the study, with the objective of defining dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the
      MTD. Once the MTD is declared for the arm, approximately 60 additional CLL/SLL subjects in
      Arm A and approximately 20 additional DLBCL subjects and 20 additional follicular lymphoma
      subjects in Arm B will be enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study at the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) and schedule.
