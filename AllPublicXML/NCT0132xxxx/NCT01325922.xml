      Study Description The purpose of this study is to compare the defibrillation efficacy between
      the 50/50% tilt biphasic waveform and the Tuned biphasic waveform utilizing High Voltage Lead
      Integrity Check (HVLIC) impedance.

      Hypothesis The Tuned waveform reduces defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) when compared to the
      50/50% tilt waveform.

      Study Methods

        -  This is an acute, paired-sample, randomized (waveform testing sequence) study

        -  Patients are implanted with an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved St. Jude
           Medical (SJM) EpicTM+ DR/VR Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (or any other
           standard output ICD after Epic+) and defibrillation lead system.

        -  All study testing is completed at implant.

        -  Patients are randomized to begin DFT testing with either the 50/50% tilt or Tuned
           waveform.

        -  The HVLIC feature is used to measure the high voltage lead impedance and to program the
           Tuned and 50/50% tilt waveform pulse widths.

        -  The DFT is determined by an optimized binary search method that is designed to reduce
           the overall number of VF inductions to an average of 5.13 while maintaining very high
           resolution and accuracy.

        -  Total # of centers - 15 centers

        -  Sample size - 60 patients
