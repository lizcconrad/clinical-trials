  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study deals with the possible molecular mechanisms that underlie the etiology of bipolar
      disorders (BD). Previous studies have implicated Na+, K+-ATPase and endogenous digitalis-like
      compounds (DLC) in the depressive state of this disease. The possibility, however, that they
      are also involved in the manic phase of the disease was never addressed. The results of this
      study may have significant implications for the treatment of BD by DLC derivatives.

    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms are the hallmark major depressive disorder, dysthymia and bipolar
      depression within the context of bipolar disorder (BD). They share clinical characteristics
      including depressed mood, anhedonia, and low energy and require medical treatment. The Na+,
      K+-ATPase is a major transporter in the plasma membrane which has an important role in
      regulating cell volume, cytoplasmic pH and Ca++ levels. Digitalis-like compounds (DLC);
      steroids identified as normal constituents of human brain, plasma and other tissues,
      exclusively interact with the Na+, K+-ATPase and induce numerous biological effects. We
      raised the hypothesis that Na+, K+-ATPase/DLC system is involved in BD based on studies from
      ours and other laboratories, which tested the involvement of this system in the depressive
      state of BD. The possibility that the interaction of DLC with the Na+, K+-ATPase is involved
      in the manic state of BD was scarcely investigated. To address this issue we intend to
      determine circulating DLC levels in patients with BD at different states of the disease;
