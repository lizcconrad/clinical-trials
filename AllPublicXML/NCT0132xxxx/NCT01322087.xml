  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      The objective of this study was to investigate whether a new energy dense food concept, on
      order 24 hours a day, would lead to a minimum 75% intake of nutritional needs in patients at
      nutritional risk. The investigators target was for 70% of patients to reach 75% of their
      energy and protein requirements.

      Methods:

      An intervention study was conducted with inclusion of 40 patients at nutritional risk,
      according to the NRS-2002 criteria. The food concept consisted of 36 small delicious dishes.
      Patients could choose food from both the new concept and the ordinary patient buffet. The
      investigators monitored patients' nutritional requirements and daily nutritional intake.

    <time_frame>3 to 7 days recording of dietary intake</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's energy requirement was estimated both from the factorial method and by Harris and Benedicts formula and the protein requirements was taken to be 18 E % of the energy requirement.
Recording of the dietary intake was carried out on a daily basis over a period of 3 to 7 days, with nutritional registration forms filled in by the nurse and/or the patient. The nutritional registration forms contained information of the energy and protein content of the food</description>

    <description>The study was a 12 weeks intervention trial with inclusion of 40 patients at nutritional risk, according to the NRS-2002 system.
All included patients received nutritional counseling and information about the new food concept by a clinical dietician.
Recording of the dietary intake was carried out on a daily basis over a period of 3 to 7 days, with nutritional registration forms filled in by the nurse and/or the patient.</description>
