  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Effective
      treatment for tobacco dependence exists and includes counseling and pharmacotherapy with
      nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline. The health care system is a key channel for
      delivering this treatment to smokers. Brief clinical interventions delivered at office visits
      increase smoking cessation rates, are among the most cost-effective of medical interventions,
      and are recommended by U.S. Public Health Service. However, physicians and other clinicians
      often fail to provide them. Clinicians' rates of providing tobacco treatment in ambulatory
      care can be improved, but even when successful, clinicians can only reach smokers who make an
      office visit.

      A health care system might improve its delivery of tobacco treatment by supplementing
      visit-based efforts with a population-based strategy, using methods proven effective in
      public health settings. A population of smokers could be identified from electronic health
      records and offered treatment proactively in a way that maximizes convenience and minimizes
      barriers such the cost of pharmacotherapy. This study tests the effectiveness of a
      population-based Direct-to-Smoker (DTS) outreach program provided to smokers in one community
      health center in Revere, MA, that is part of an integrated health care system. It uses the
      system's population management tools to identify smokers and proactively offers them
      evidence-based tobacco treatment that is free and does require making an office visit. A
      randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of the DTS program to usual
      primary care. The hypothesis is that adding the DTS program to usual primary care will
      increase the proportion of smokers who use tobacco dependence treatment and thereby stop
      smoking.

    <description>Intervention group participants will be sent 3 letters at monthly intervals signed by the participant's PCP, encouraging the smoker to quit, and offering a free telephone consultation by Partners' Tobacco Treatment Coordinator (TTC). Participants can respond to the treatment offer by calling or emailing the TTC, who will provide a 15-minute consultation following the &quot;5A&quot; strategy recommended by the US Public Health Service's clinical guideline and help smokers access treatment by (1) offering a free 4-week supply of 21mg nicotine patches sent by secure mailing to their home (refillable once for a total of 8 weeks), (2) helping smokers obtain prescriptions from their PCP for other FDA-approved smoking cessation medication, (3) using a fax-referral system to facilitate connection to free multi-session counseling from the Massachusetts Smokers Quitline, and (4) referring to local in-person counseling programs.</description>
