    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab before
      surgery and radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy works in treating liver metastases in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry
      tumor-killing substances to them. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90
      DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A, can find tumor cells and carry tumor-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody
      before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs
      to be removed. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy after surgery may kill any
      tumor cells that remain after surgery

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival in colorectal cancer patients after hepatic
      resection of liver metastases and FOLFOX or leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan
      hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy [+/- Bevacizumab], or capecitabine and oxaliplatin
      (XELOX),followed by intravenous (IV) yttrium-90 (90Y) M5A anti-CEA antibody.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the feasibility and toxicities of such adjuvant therapy following resection
      and/or ablation of liver metastases and FOLFOX chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the biodistribution, clearance and metabolism of 90Y and 111In (indium-111)
      M5A administered IV.

      OUTLINE:

      FOLFOX* + BEVACIZUMAB CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes. Treatment repeats for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY (RIT): Within 4-12 weeks after completion of post-hepatic resection
      therapy chemotherapy, patients receive yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A IV
      over 25 minutes. Treatment repeats every 6-10 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE:*Patients previously failing oxaliplatin regimen receive FOLIFIRI chemotherapy
      comprising irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium over 2 hours,
      fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes.
      Treatment repeats for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

Treatment repeats for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RIT: Within 4-12 weeks after completion of post-hepatic resection therapy chemotherapy, patients receive yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A IV over 25 minutes. Treatment repeats every 6-10 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE:*Patients previously failing oxaliplatin regimen receive FOLIFIRI chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes.
