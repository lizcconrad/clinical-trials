      The purpose of this acute study is to perform a preliminary investigation of high septal
      right ventricular pacing in the vicinity of the His bundle region as an alternate or
      adjunctive means for cardiac resynchronization in patients with heart failure and wide QRS.

      The HISTORY Study is an acute, cross-sectional, multi-center, feasibility study with a
      randomized within patient test sequence designed to characterize the effects of high septal
      right ventricular pacing in the vicinity of the His bundle region compared to conventional
      biventricular pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy.
