  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients worldwide are vitamin D insufficient.
      There is no evidence of benefit of vitamin D supplementation for CF patients yet. However,
      descriptive cross-sectional studies suggest that vitamin D might be beneficial with respect
      to bone health, as well as to the newly described &quot;non-classical&quot; functions of vitamin D such
      as the potential anti-diabetic and immunomodulatory effects. To prove causation, and to
      determine which serum vitamin D concentration is optimal for CF patients, vitamin D
      supplementation interventional studies are needed, such as our trial.

    <description>This pilot study is primarily designed for establishing effective vitamin D dosing in our specific patient population, and only secondarily designed (and thus, not powered for) for the secondary outcome measures. The results of this study will make it possible for the first time to power the follow-up long-term study for some of the secondary outcome measures followed in this pilot study, some of which might therefore become primary outcome measures in the follow-up study.</description>
