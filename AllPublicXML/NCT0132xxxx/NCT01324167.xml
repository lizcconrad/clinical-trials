      The atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone,
      are effective in treating both the positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Kelleher
      et al., 2002). However, atypical antipsychotics have been linked to several forms of
      morbidity, including obesity, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (Bergman and
      Ader, 2005; Jin et al., 2004; Melkersson and Dahl, 2004). Compared with the general
      population, life expectancy in schizophrenic patients is shorter by as much as 20%,
      attributable to higher rates of suicide, accidental deaths, and natural causes such as
      cardiovascular disease and DM (Harris and Barraclough, 1998). Several studies have suggested
      that these metabolic abnormalities may lead to a greater vulnerability to cardiovascular
      disease and thus may contribute to the excessive mortality among schizophrenic patients.
