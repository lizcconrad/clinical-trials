        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant must be offered sufficient opportunity to review the informed consent
             form, agree to the form's contents and sign the protocol's informed consent;

          -  The participant must have bilateral MacTel;

          -  Women of childbearing potential and all men must agree to use an effective form of
             birth control during the study;

          -  Participant must be medically able to undergo ophthalmic surgery for ECT implant;

          -  The participant's best-corrected visual acuity 64 letters or better (20/50 or better)
             in the study eye;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is &lt; 21 years of age;

          -  Participant is medically unable to comply with study procedures or follow- up visits;

          -  Participant has evidence of ocular disease other than MacTel that may confound the
             outcome of the study (e.g., diabetic retinopathy with manifest macular edema, uveitis,
             etc.);

          -  Participant has a chronic requirement (e.g., â‰¥ 4 weeks at a time) for ocular
             medications and/or has a diagnosed disease, that in the judgment of the examining
             physician, may be vision threatening or may affect the primary outcome (artificial
             tears are permitted);

          -  Participant has evidence of subretinal neovascularization in either eye;

          -  Participant has evidence of central serous chorio-retinopathy (CSR) in either eye;

          -  Participant has evidence of pathologic myopia in either eye;

          -  Participant has had a vitrectomy, penetrating keratoplasty, trabeculectomy or
             trabeculoplasty;
