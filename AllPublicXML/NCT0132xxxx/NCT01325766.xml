  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lung disease that affects 30,000 children and adults in the US.
      Incorporation of regular exercise into the lives of patients with CF is of interest because
      it may improve lung function and quality of life. Yoga is an activity that may benefit
      patients with CF in many ways including strengthening muscles of breathing, improving lung
      function, and reducing stress which could improve quality of life and adherence to therapies.
      Yoga has been shown to be beneficial in patients with other lung diseases such as asthma, but
      has not yet been studied in CF.

      The investigators hypothesize that yoga will be an activity that is safe and tolerable for CF
      patients 12 to 25 years of age. The primary aim is to investigate the safety and tolerability
      of an 8 week yoga program for patients with CF. The secondary aim is to determine the effect
      of yoga on many aspects of CF disease including respiratory symptoms, adherence to regular CF
      therapies, quality of life, lung function, exercise tolerance, and nutritional status.

      The long-term goal is to use the data obtained in this study to design a future study of the
      efficacy of yoga in a larger population of CF patients at multiple CF centers. This research
      has the potential to influence the prevention and treatment of CF by providing data which
      could be used to help understand the most appropriate and beneficial type of physical
      activity for CF patients.

    <measure>Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale as a measure of tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be given a tolerance questionnaire after each yoga session which will assess their degree of musculoskeletal and chest pain on a visual analog scale. Vital signs will also be measured before and after each yoga session.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed with the Cystic fibrosis quality of life questionnaire-revised. This is a CF specific quality of life outcome measure and will be administered at each study visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using a cystic fibrosis respiratory symptom diary that will taken once per week at home throughout the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by participants taking a treatment adherence questionnaire once per week at home. Questions are asked regarding compliance with other CF therapies.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary function</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function will be monitored by spirometry at the screening visit and at both study visits. Participants will be assessed for response to bronchodilator at the screening visit. If there is a positive response, post-bronchodilator testing will be done again at the last study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of breathing</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the ease of breathing score which is a measure of shortness of breath after activity. This will be done at screening and at each study visit.</description>
