  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence that when resveratrol (a substance which is found in red grapes,
      peanuts and chocolate) is combined with Piperine (a substance found in pepper) it is more
      effective in fighting cancer. The purpose of this study is to see if resveratrol in
      combination with piperine is more effective than taking resveratrol alone. Since
      investigators don't know what dose of piperine to use in combination with resveratrol, two
      different doses of piperine will be studied.

      Twenty-four participants, equal numbers of males and females, will receive a single dose of
      resveratrol (2.5 grams) without piperine, resveratrol (2.5 grams) with piperine (5 mg), or
      resveratrol (2.5 grams) with piperine (25 mg).

          -  Women and men must agree to use an effective form of birth control prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation

          -  Willingness to abstain from foods containing resveratrol for 3 days prior to single
             dose administration and for 7 days after dosing. (Examples include red grapes, grape
             juice, peanuts, peanut butter.)

          -  Abstain from vitamin supplements from 2 weeks before study dosing and for 7 days
             following study dosing

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status â‰¤ 1 (Karnofsky &gt; 70%)

          -  Participants must have normal organ and hepatic functions

          -  Participants must abstain from alcohol beverages 72 hours prior to dosing with the
             study agent, and for 7 days after dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             cell carcinoma).

          -  Participants may not be currently receiving any other investigational agent(s) or have
             taken any within the past 9 months.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition of resveratrol and/or piperine.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
