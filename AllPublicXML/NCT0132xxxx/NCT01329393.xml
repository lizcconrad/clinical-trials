    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received treatment for a psychiatric disorder within 60 days of enrollment

          -  Receives SSI or SSDI payments totaling at least $600 per month

          -  Has an identified outpatient clinician

          -  Either i) Homeless within the past 3 months. Homeless is defined as having spent at
             least seven days in a shelter, outdoors (e.g. in a park, in a car), in a public or
             abandoned building (e.g. train station), or temporarily (less than a continuous month)
             housed by family or friends OR ii) Hospitalized within the past 3 months

        Justification for Inclusion Criteria: Homelessness and hospitalization are common reasons
        for payee assignment (Conrad, Matters et al. 1998). In a prior study, we found that a high
        proportion of hospitalized inpatients meet criteria for needing a payee (Rosen, Rosenheck
        et al. 2002a). There is no point enrolling clinically stable outpatients in this study
        because they are unlikely to need payees.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Already has a conservator or representative payee

          -  An application to assign a payee or conservator has been initiated

          -  Unable to speak and understand English
