  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the benefits of three types of individual treatment
      programs for cancer patients: Meaning-Centered counseling, Supportive counseling, and
      Enhanced Usual Care.

      We would like to train therapists in administering these types of counseling, so that they
      have expertise to work on the study. The therapists will administer either the
      Meaning-Centered counseling or the Supportive counseling, as part of their training.

      Many cancer patients use counseling or other resources to help with the emotional burden of
      their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving them a place to
      express their feelings. &quot;Meaning-Centered&quot; counseling aims to teach cancer patients how to
      maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives, despite cancer.
      &quot;Supportive&quot; counseling is intended to help the patient cope with cancer by giving them a
      place to express their feelings and get support. Enhanced Usual Care is intended to offer the
      patient referrals and resources that are matched to their individual needs in addition to the
      care they are already receiving at MSKCC.

    <description>IMCP is based on the principles of Viktor Frankl's Logotherapy, and is designed to help patients with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose in their lives even as they approach the end of life. IMCP is structured as a 7-session (1-hour weekly sessions) individual intervention that utilizes a mixture of didactics, discussion and experiential exercises that focus around particular themes related to meaning and advanced cancer. In addition we will be asking patients in the IMCP arm to complete an optional weekly session rating survey</description>

    <description>The ISP intervention utilized as the comparison treatment condition in this study, is adapted from the Supportive Group Psychotherapy manualized intervention developed by David Payne (1997) and adapted by Drs. Kissane, Breitbart and colleagues into the ISP manualized intervention. This intervention is a 7-session individual supportive psychotherapy utilizing an approach to supportive psychotherapy based on models described by Rogers. The essential components of supportive psychotherapy are integrated into this manualized intervention, including: reassurance, explanation, guidance, suggestion, encouragement, affecting changes in patient's environment, and permission for catharsis.</description>

    <description>We are therefore including what we refer to as an &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care arm to this randomized controlled trial to address the ethical issues raised by utilizing a usual care condition in a vulnerable advanced cancer population. Participants will receive feedback about their level of distress (based on the DT administered at screening) and given appropriate targeted referrals based on levels of distress and problem areas endorsed. Participants will be given a letter with a list of appropriate referrals.</description>

        Potential candidates for the study who meet the eligibility criteria of cancer diagnosis
        and stage will be identified by the research staff and/or participating oncology staff or
        co-investigators. Study investigators in the Pain &amp; Palliative Care Service the Breast
        Cancer Medicine Service, the Head &amp; Neck Oncology Service, the Thoracic Medicine Service,
        the Gastrointestinal Oncology Service, and the Genito-Urinary Oncology Service will serve
        as liaisons to the Research Staff and help screen and identify potential subjects for the
        study.
