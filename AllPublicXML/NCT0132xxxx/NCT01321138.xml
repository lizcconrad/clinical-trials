    <textblock>
      Femoral neuropathy after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with femoral nerve block
      may be as high as 24% at 6 postoperative weeks when evaluated prospectively and
      systematically through a clinical neurological and an electroneuromyography (ENMG). It is
      still unclear whether this neuropathy is the result of the surgery, especially the
      Tourniquet, or the block nerve. The goal of this study is to define the etiology of this
      postoperative neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is associated with moderate to severe postoperative
      pain. Among different analgesic strategies, continuous femoral nerve block is reported as an
      efficient method, reducing opioid consumption and allowing rapid rehabilitation; however,
      patients may develop a transient neuropathy after surgery, which could have a significant
      impact on active patients, particularly on athletes who need immediate rehabilitation and who
      will put their knee to greater use during the postoperative period. This study is designed to
      compare the incidence of femoral neuropathy in two groups of patients: one with a femoral
      nerve block, and one with a PCA of morphine (self-iv administration of morphine). All
      patients will have a clinical neurological exam with a preoperative ENMG in order to rule out
      a pre-existing neuropathy. Another clinical neurological exam with ENMG will be performed
      between 4 and 6 weeks and, if pathological, repeated at 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. The
      operation will be done under general anesthesia for all patients.
