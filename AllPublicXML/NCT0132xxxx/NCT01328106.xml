      The purpose of this study is to determine whether GSK1120212, a MEK inhibitor, is an
      effective and safe treatment for cancer subjects with metastatic uveal melanoma and
      mutation-positive GNAQ or GNA11 metastatic melanoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic uveal melanoma or
             previously documented mutation-positive GNAQ or GNA11 metastatic melanoma not
             previously treated with a MEK inhibitor.

          -  Provide archival tumor tissue or, if tissue blocks are not available, undergo fresh
             tumor biopsy prior to enrollment.

          -  The patient has a radiographically measurable tumor.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2.

          -  The patient is able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 4 months.

          -  Toxicities from previous anti-cancer therapy (except alopecia) are recovered (Grade 1
             or less) at the time of enrollment.

          -  The patient has adequate organ and bone marrow function.

          -  Sexually active patients must use medically acceptable methods of contraception during
             the course of the study.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has had any of the following within 21 days of starting study drug or
             anticipates the need for any of the following during the course of study treatment:
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, hormone therapy, major surgery, or
             tumor embolization.

          -  The patient has received experimental therapy within 21 days of starting study drug.

          -  The patient has received nitrosourea or mitomycin C within 42 days of starting study
             drug.

          -  The patient has received any herbal medications or palliative radiotherapy within 14
             days of starting study drug.

             controlled.

          -  Ongoing or newly diagnosed eye abnormality other than symptoms due to uveal melanoma.

          -  History of retinal vein occlusion or central serous retinopathy.

          -  History of leptomeningeal disease or spinal cord compression secondary to metastasis.

          -  Brain metastasis, unless previously treated with surgery, whole-brain radiation or
             stereotactic radiosurgery and the disease has been stable for at least 3 months
             without steroid use or on a stable dose of steroids for at least 1 month prior to
             starting study drug. Stability of brain metastases must be confirmed with imaging.

          -  The patient has a concurrent, active hematological malignancy or other solid tumor
             malignancy.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction.
