  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is conducted in Europe. The purpose of the trial is to investigate the
      influence on the pharmacokinetics (the rate at which the trial drug is eliminated from the
      body) of an oral contraceptive combination drug after multiple administration of semaglutide
      in female subjects with type 2 diabetes.
