    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ExAblate for the
      treatment of uterine fibroids.

      Women, seeking treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomata will be eligible for the
      study.Women who agree to participate will sign an informed consent and will be randomized to
      ExAblate treatment or myomectomy.

      All patients will be followed through the 36 month visit. Follow-up visits/telephone calls
      will be completed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months post
      treatment.

      Patients will be evaluated by assessing their overall physical and mental health as well as
      for device/procedure related adverse events.
