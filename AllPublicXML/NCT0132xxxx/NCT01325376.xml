  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a six month lifestyle management study to compare the effects of iWell; a dynamic
      online interactive technology to a self-directed program in overweight or obese individuals.

      The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that dynamic online interactive technology
      intervention is more effective than self-directed program in obtaining and maintaining weight
      loss and other biometric improvements.

      Optimal health behavior is difficult to sustain over extended periods. This study seeks to
      demonstrate that technology can be a low cost scaleable solution that will provide the user
      with sufficient customization and personalization through social networking approaches such
      that sustainability of optimal health behavior is realized.
