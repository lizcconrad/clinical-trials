    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of low-rate continuous
      Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) sampling and to estimate the number of participants who exhibit
      severe baseline instability of CSF amyloid beta isoform Aß40 concentrations in healthy
      participants.
