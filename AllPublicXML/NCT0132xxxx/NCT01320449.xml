  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epo increases red blood cell production and hence the amount of oxygen that can be
      transported around the body. It is shown that prolonged use of synthetic Epo (rHuEpo) leads
      to an increase in the period of time a given physical work can be performed, therefore it
      will continue to be abused by athletes, especially in endurance sports.

      The existing method for measuring the abuse of rHuEpo approved by the World Anti-Doping
      Agency (WADA) is based on differences in the sugar groups bound to rHuEpo and Epo produced in
      the body, respectively.

      Proteomics is a method by which one can look at all the proteins in blood at the same time.
      Even proteins that have changed very little can be distinguished. The main objective of this
      project is to investigate the effect of prolonged treatment with rHuEpo on changes in blood
      proteins in healthy young men.
