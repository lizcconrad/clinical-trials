      One way to better understand how various treatments for pain differ is to determine the
      effects of these treatments on different pain qualities or characteristics. For example, pain
      can be described as &quot;hot&quot;, &quot;electrical&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;achy&quot;, and &quot;piercing.&quot; In order to
      determine which pain quality/qualities that a pain treatment affects, researchers must
      develop measures of these pain qualities or characteristics. The purpose of this study is to
      learn more about the different pain qualities individuals who have low back pain, headaches
      and fibromyalgia experience. Identifying the common qualities of pain experienced by these
      groups will help researchers evaluate and develop more comprehensive pain quality measures,
      which will ultimately help them to be able to test the effectiveness of treatments for these
      different pain qualities.

          -  Confirms a diagnosis from a physician or certified medical provider of one of the
