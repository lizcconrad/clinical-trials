  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to test whether early central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis given at the
      beginning of therapy for young high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients is
      feasible and could reduce the risk of CNS relapses. Early CNS prophylaxis with two courses
      high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) in combination with
      rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednison (R-CHOP) is followed by four
      courses of R-CHOP14 and etoposide (E) and one course of HD-Ara-C. In addition the patients
      will receive three courses of liposomal cytarabine intrathecally. The results will be
      compared to a recent Nordic CRY-04 study. Shifting of CNS prophylaxis to the beginning of the
      therapy offers a potential to overcome the subclinical disease and thus reduce the risk of
      early clinical CNS recurrence. As flow cytometry (FCM) can improve the sensitivity for
      detecting occult leptomeningeal disease over cytology , FCM from cerebrospinal fluid will be
      incorporated into the staging procedures.
