  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe lung conditions occasionally require support with a special ventilator
      (breathing machine) called the High Frequency Oscillator (HFO). Effective ventilation
      requires that the pressure generated by the ventilator be as high as possible but not too
      high as this can damage the lungs. In patients on HFO, there is not a well defined way to
      measure this pressure. We will insert a small probe into the esophagus of patients on HFO to
      see if this is an accurate way to measure lung pressures for these patients. A better
      understanding of these pressures could lead to improved patient care.

      Trials have found that the use of lower tidal volumes (6 ml/kg) during conventional
      mechanical ventilation decreases morbidity and mortality. Compared to conventional
      ventilation, high frequency oscillation (HFO) is able to provide much smaller tidal volumes
      (1.1 - 2.5 ml/kg) and thus theoretically may provide additional lung protection. At this
      time, while trials of HFO in adults have been inconclusive, the use of HFO for the management
      of ALI/ARDS has become widespread

      Patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are
      critically ill and have a high mortality associated with their illness (approximately 50%).
      Currently, esophageal pressure monitors are used to optimize inflation pressures and improve
      oxygenation in conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with ALI/ARDS. With this in
      mind, the purpose of this study is twofold: (1) demonstrate that esophageal pressure monitors
      can easily be inserted in patients undergoing HFO and (2) report the transpulmonary pressures
      in these patients.

    <description>An esophageal pressure monitor will be placed through the mouth into the esophagus by a study physician. Placement will be confirmed by a bedside chest X-ray. Once placement has been confirmed all air will be evacuated from the balloon by syringe. One ml of air will then be injected to partially inflate the esophageal balloon. Pleural pressure measurements will be recorded after 1 minute without spontaneous breathing or patient care related movement. This measurement will be repeated at 30 minutes and at 60 minutes after the first measurement. Trans-pulmonary pressure is calculated as the difference between esophageal pressure and mouth pressure. Once the measurements have been recorded, the catheter will be removed.</description>
