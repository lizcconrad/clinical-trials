  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A contracture is a pathological condition limiting range and function of joints. Contractures
      of large and small joints alike will affect one's ability to independently perform daily
      activities such as eating, dressing or walking. Current treatments for contractures include
      physical stretching, the use of assistive devices or, rarely, surgery. Despite prolonged
      treatments, patients with contractures rarely regain complete mobility. Progress in
      preventing and treating contractures will be possible only through an understanding of the
      biological and molecular processes involved. Our group has established and validated an
      animal model to study the histological events and the molecular mechanisms involved in joint
      contractures. We have provided evidence for capsule stiffness, characterized cartilage
      degeneration, and identified four genes whose expression is altered in the cartilage of a
      knee joint with contracture. The work we propose in the current study aims at finding genes
      and pathways in the joint capsule associated with knee joint contractures. The results will
      identify new avenues for treating the large number of patients suffering from contractures.

      We propose to constitute a bank of capsule samples from people with osteoarthritis undergoing
      primary total knee arthroplasty. It is expected that about 1.3% of people will develop a
      contracture post arthroplasty. A second sample will be taken from those that require surgery
      for release of contracture or revision. We will study histological characteristics and
      compare gene expression between the primary sample and the contracture sample in the same
      patient. In order to determine whether intrinsic genetic factors influence the develpment of
      joint contractures in the osteoarthritis population, all specimens will be analyzed for
      differential gene expression between patients with and without knee contractures post
      arthroplasty.

      The remaining capsule tissue not used for this study will be banked and made available to
      other researchers.
