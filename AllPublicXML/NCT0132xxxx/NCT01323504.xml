  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 800,000 people in France suffer from peripheral artery disease (PAD), of
      whom 1-2% present the most severe form critical limb ischaemia (CLI). In this situation, the
      patient frequently presents painful non-healing ulcers and focal gangrene. Wound care is
      generally associated with increasing pain. Pain relief may be challenging in spite of major
      analgesics.

      Several studies in this country and elsewhere assessed the usefulness of music for chronic or
      acute pain relief during care. However, no data are published regarding the interest of music
      therapy for pain relief during local care in PAD patients.
