      The object of this study is to determine the benefit of follicular flushing with a double
      channel needle in a poor responder population for a maximum number of oocytes to be
      retrieved. The investigators compare two methods of oocyte retrieval with or without
      flushing. 220 patients undergoing an in vitro fertilization (IVF) or Intracytoplasmic Sperm
      Injection (ICSI) have to be included. All patients with less than 5 follicles of 14 mm and
      more the day of ovulation induction will be included, following a randomized protocol in two
      groups, Group A: Oocyte retrieval is performed with a single lumen aspiration needle 17G.
      Group B: Oocyte retrieval is performed with a double lumen aspiration needle 17G. all
      follicles are flushed with flushing solution in addition to direct aspiration of the
      follicular fluid, 20CC of flushing medium is provided for all the procedure and flushing
      medium is collected separately from direct fluid aspiration in order to follow up each oocyte
      one by one. First criterion of our comparison is the number of oocyte retrieved. Second
      criteria are: oocyte quality, fertilization rate, number and quality of embryos obtained,
      clinical pregnancy rate. In Group B the investigators will compare two subgroups: oocytes
      collected in flush medium and oocytes from direct follicle fluid. Then the investigators will
      know the capability of oocyte collected after follicular flushing to be fertilized and to
      increase the success chance of pregnancy for poor responder patients.
