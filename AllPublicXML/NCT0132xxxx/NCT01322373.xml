    <textblock>
      This follow-up study is designed to obtain longitudinal clinical and MEG scan data to gain
      information on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, the stability of healthy control (HC)
      MEG scan data, to enrich the Orasi database of AD and HC subjects, and is intended to extend
      the capabilities of the Synchronous Neural Interaction® (SNI) test, which is under
      development by the sponsor, Orasi Medical. The current study is intended to extend the
      database of AD and HC MEG scans and will include patients who previously enrolled and
      completed Orasi Protocol ADG 08-01. This study will include MEG scans on up to approximately
      50 AD subjects and 70 HC subjects. Additionally, AD subjects will complete 3 standard
      functional tests while HC subjects will complete 2 standard functional tests. ApoE genotyping
      also will be determined for all subjects. The results generated in this study will be used to
      improve the accuracy of the SNI test for diagnosing and tracking the progression of AD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject enrolled and completed Orasi Protocol ADG 08-01

          -  Subject understands the study procedures and agrees to participate in the study by
             giving written informed consent. In the event the subject lacks the capacity to sign
             the consent form then the subject's Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) may sign
             on the subject's behalf. See Section 5. Informed Consent for details.

          -  Subject is a non-smoker.

          -  Subject is judged to be in good health other than AD, if applicable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history or diagnosis of a significant neurological condition other than
             Alzheimer's disease including Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body
             dementia, frontal temporal dementia, human immunodeficiency virus, multiple sclerosis,
             seizures, epilepsy, stroke, ADHD, dyslexia, or severe traumatic brain injury.

          -  Subject has a history of primary psychotic disorder (e.g. schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder) or bipolar disorder.

          -  Subject has a Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale (HIS) score greater than 4.

          -  The subject has a recent history (within 2 years) of alcohol or substance
             abuse/dependence.

          -  Subject had an MRI within two weeks prior to Study Visit 2.

          -  Subject has metal dental braces, pacemaker or other common medical devices that may
             interfere with the MEG scan.

          -  Subject is unable to complete the MEG scan procedure.

          -  Investigator has any concern regarding the safe participation of a subject in the
             study, or if for any other reason the investigator considers the subject inappropriate
             for study participation
