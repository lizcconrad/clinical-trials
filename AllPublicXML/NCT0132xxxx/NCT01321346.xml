      This study is for patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL),
      Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), Hodgkin's Disease (HD) or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).
      Panobinostat is a new drug that is considered investigational because it has not been
      approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or in any other
      country. Panobinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and interferes with gene
      expression found in cells causing them to stop growing or die. Panobinostat has been used in
      several hundred adults who had leukemia, HD, NHL and other solid tumors. Panobinostat has not
      been given to children.

      This is a phase I study. In a phase I study, drugs are tested to the highest dose that can be
      safely given. Drugs are given at gradually increasing dosages until there are unacceptable
      side effects. The goal of the Phase I study is to find out the dose of panobinostat that can
      be safely given to children with relapsed ALL, AML, HD and NHL.
