        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits) and are
             available for all scheduled visits at the investigational site

          2. Adult male and or female subjects between 18 and 27 years old.

          3. Proven record of measles vaccination (longer than 5 years)

          4. Measles antibodies titre &lt; 350 IU/L or &gt; 750 IU/L measured in the previous study
             &quot;CEVAC sero-MV-001&quot;.

          5. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          6. Confirmed HIV negative based on the absence of antibodies and p24.

          7. Negative for Hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen, anti-hepatitis B core (HBc antibodies)
             antibody and anti-Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in another clinical study in the last 6 months in which the subject has
             been exposed to an investigational product (pharmaceutical product or placebo or
             device) or concurrent participation in another clinical study during the study period.

          2. Previous inclusion in an HIV vaccine study.

          3. Receipt of any other vaccination 1 month before or planning to receive any vaccination
             1 month after each study vaccination

          4. Receipt of tuberculin skin test 1 month before or planning to receive a tuberculin
             test 1 month after each study vaccination

          5. Receipt of allergy treatment with antigen injections 1 month before or planning to
             receive allergy treatment with antigen injections 1 month after each study vaccination

          6. Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulins within 120 days prior to enrolment.

          7. Measles vaccination or booster within the last 5 years as confirmed by medical
             history.

          8. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant within 9 months of
             enrolling into the study.

          9. Subject is of childbearing potential and does not agree to use a medically acceptable
             form of contraception for the duration of the study (9 months post the first
             investigational HIV vaccination). Medically acceptable forms of contraception include:
             Contraceptive Medication, Intrauterine device, Double barrier method (Condom* and
             Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

             * A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction between
             the two can result in either product failing.

         10. History of any significant immunodeficient condition.

         11. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other

         12. Individuals who are at high risk of acquired HIV infection as determined by the risk
             assessment questionnaire.

         13. Individuals who are living and/or working with severely immunocompromised people,
             children under 15 months old or pregnant women.

         14. Family history of immunodeficiency and/or personal history of autoimmune disease
             (including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroid disease).

         15. History of type I or type II diabetes mellitus including cases controlled with diet
             alone.

         16. History or ongoing malignancy.

         17. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness at the time of enrolment.

         18. History of serious adverse reactions to vaccine administration, including anaphylaxis
             and related symptoms, such as urticaria, respiratory difficulty, angioedema and
             abdominal pain to vaccines, or history of allergic reaction likely to be exacerbated
             by any component of the vaccine.

         19. Acute or chronic, clinically significant, as determined by the investigator,
             pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by
             physical examination or laboratory screening tests.
