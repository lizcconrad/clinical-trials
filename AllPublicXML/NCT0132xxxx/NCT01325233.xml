  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Astragalus membranaceus (AM) is used to treat stroke for a long time, and a number of studies
      have shown that AM can reduce cerebral infarction area and has anti-oxidation activity. PG2,
      a sterile powder of polysaccharides isolated from the root of astragulus (Huang-Chi) for
      intravenous injection, has been approved as a botanical drug by TFDA. Hemorrhagic stroke will
      induce secondary peri-blood clot edema and that may increase intracranial pressure to
      exacerbate clinical symptom. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate
      the efficacy of PG2 on hemorrhagic stroke.

      This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. An estimated 60 (at least
      48 evaluable) first hemorrhagic stroke patients will be randomly divided into the control and
      treatment groups. Each group will be treated as follows: 1) control group will accept placebo
      t.i.w treatment for 14 days from second day of admission, in addition to standard ordinary
      treatment.; 2) treatment group will accept PG2 t.i.w treatment for 14 days from second day of
      admission, in addition to standard ordinary treatment. Inflammatory index including the
      levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), S-100 protein,
      IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-beta levels will be measured and clinical symptoms including Glasgow
      outcome scale (GOS), modified rankin scale (MRS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and
      Barthel Index (BI) will be evaluated during this study.
