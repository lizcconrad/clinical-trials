      Aims of the study:

      Patients in a Chest Pain Unit (CPU) are examined to clarify if the cause of pain is cardiac
      or not. To identify patients with ST-elevation and other electrocardiogram (ECG)
      modifications a normal 12-lead ECG is used. The diagnosis non-st-elevation myocardial
      infarction is determined with the help of the ischemic marker Troponin. However, Troponin
      levels are elevated earliest 3 to 4 hours after the ischemic event, so that a negative
      Troponin result at the time of hospital admission is insufficient. Thus the guidelines of the
      German Society of Cardiology demand a second measurement after 6 to 12 hours. In rare cases
      false positive Troponin levels have been reported (e.g. in patients with renal
      insufficiency).

      The aim of this study is to determine if in the early phase of diagnostic assessment
      cardiogoniometry can improve differentiation between patients with cardiac (ischemic)
      emergency and patients with non-cardiac (non-ischemic) cause of pain. Furthermore it will be
      evaluated if cardiogoniometry is capable to diagnose patients with non-ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to the same extent as Troponin. This could avoid time loss
      until a possibly necessary catheter intervention (&quot;fast track&quot;).

      To clarify these questions the result of the cardiogoniometry will be compared with the
      leading diagnosis of the Chest Pain Unit, the diagnosis at hospital discharge as well as with
      the angiographic findings (as a gold standard). Therefore the performance of cardiac
      catheterization within 72 hours after start of symptoms is a mandatory inclusion criterion.

      The cardiogoniometry vectorcardiography is a procedure that allows a stress-free and
      non-invasive diagnosis of myocardial ischemia: five thoracic electrodes as well as the heart
      flow in orthogonal summation vectors are recorded by a computer-assisted method in three
      dimensions.

    <description>Aim is to examine if cardiogoniometry can provide additional information for the decision to perform a diagnostic coronary angiography and if so, which additional value it has. To assess the value of cardiogoniometry its results are compared with the leading diagnosis of the Chest Pain Unit, the diagnosis at hospital discharge as well as with the angiographic findings (as a gold standard).</description>
