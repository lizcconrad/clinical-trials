    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of single and repeated doses
      of EMD525797, and characterize Pharmacokinetics (PK). The secondary objectives are to
      investigate the immunogenicity and Progressive disease (PD), and to assess the anti-tumor
      activity of EMD525797.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or 4 haematological or non-haematological toxicity occurring at any dose level until the end of Week 4, and suspected to be reasonably related to the investigational medicinal product by the Investigator and/or Sponsor. Toxicities not considered to be DLTs are as follows- Allergic reactions or anaphylaxis; any Grade 3 or 4 out-of-range laboratory values without any clinical correlate, which were reversible within 7 days, unless the Investigator decided this event is clinically significant. For this reason Grade 3 or 4 out-of-range laboratory values must be re-assessed within 7 days. In case the Investigator provides the subject any treatment(s) due to the out-of-range laboratory values, the event was regarded as a DLT.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</title>
        <description>DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or 4 haematological or non-haematological toxicity occurring at any dose level until the end of Week 4, and suspected to be reasonably related to the investigational medicinal product by the Investigator and/or Sponsor. Toxicities not considered to be DLTs are as follows- Allergic reactions or anaphylaxis; any Grade 3 or 4 out-of-range laboratory values without any clinical correlate, which were reversible within 7 days, unless the Investigator decided this event is clinically significant. For this reason Grade 3 or 4 out-of-range laboratory values must be re-assessed within 7 days. In case the Investigator provides the subject any treatment(s) due to the out-of-range laboratory values, the event was regarded as a DLT.</description>

Per RECIST v1.0: CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of serum levels of tumor markers . PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease in sum of longest diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum longest diameters associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as reference smallest sum of longest dimensions since treatment started associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects With Clinical Benefit</title>
          <description>Clinical benefit was defined as presence of at least one confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) lasting at least 12 weeks according to RECIST v1.0. Per RECIST v1.0: CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of serum levels of tumor markers . PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease in sum of longest diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum longest diameters associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as reference smallest sum of longest dimensions since treatment started associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions.</description>
