  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to make Omegaven® available to cancer patients with liver
      disease and to determine if Omegaven® can improve or prevent further liver disease. The study
      will also look at the effects Omegaven® has on immune function.

      This compassionate use study will include patients with advanced cancer requiring PN for
      long-term nutrition support who have developed PN-induced hepatic injury or who have existing
      hepatic dysfunction. Therapy with Omegaven will be provided at an initial dose of 0.1 g/kg
      body weight (1ml/kg) and increased to 0.2 g/kg body weight (2ml/kg) on day 2 or 3 of
      treatment. For patients &gt; 120% ideal body weight, adjusted body weight will be used. The
      infusion rate will not exceed 0.5mL Omegaven/kg body weight/hr (corresponding to 0.05g fish
      oil/kg/hr). Omegaven will be co-administered via a y-site infusion, with containers being
      changed every 12 hours. The patient may receive other lipids to meet Essential Fatty Acid
      (EFA) and/or additional calorie needs. Patients will receive the initial infusion of PN
      containing Omegaven at Midwestern Regional Medical Center (MRMC) in the infusion center to
      observe for adverse reactions. If an adverse reaction is observed, IV steroids &amp; benadryl
      will be administered &amp; Omegaven will be discontinued. Patients will continue to receive
      infusions at CTCA for the first 2 to 3 days of dosing. After tolerance is established,
      patients will receive treatment at home with Coram. All study patients will have a Screening
      Visit; Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 visits; and weekly visits for one month (see Table 2).
