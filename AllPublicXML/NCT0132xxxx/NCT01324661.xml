    <textblock>
      This study examines youth's motivation for food or social rewards after a brief episode of
      simulated ostracism. The investigators hypothesize that youth who think about a friend after
      being ostracized will mediate their decision to resort to food, which is typically evidenced
      in socially isolated overweight youth.
