  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a two therapeutic models designed to
      enhance women's skills for managing reactive emotions in their current lives as well as to
      educate them about how using these skills can enhance their personal effectiveness and help
      them to gain control of post-traumatic stress reactions. The interventions adaptations of a
      manualized psychotherapy that has shown promise with adults with complex Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy; TARGET) compared
      to a supportive group therapy (SGT) that has been found to have modest benefits with women
      survivors of childhood abuse (Wallis, 2002).

      In a randomized treatment design, we will compare offenders receiving skills-based
      intervention (TARGET) and those receiving a similar amount of supportive intervention (SGT).
      We will assess the efficacy of treatment by determining if those receiving the TARGET skills
      training show an improvement in functionality, as compared to those receiving only supportive
      intervention. We will measure this by analyzing PTSD symptoms, psychological distress,
      psychosocial functioning, and social/legal adjustment and services using structured
      interviews, self-report questionnaires and qualitative questions. Questionnaires are listed
      below in the outcome measure's section. We will collect follow-up data on program
      participants who successfully finish the program at York. For those offenders who discharge
      into the community directly from York, we will collect follow-up data on program participants
      through CDOC Parole or Probation records. Statistically we anticipate a medium effect size
      difference between the treatment conditions.
