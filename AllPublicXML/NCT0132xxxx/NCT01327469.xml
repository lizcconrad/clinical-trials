  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Trichuris
      trichiura (whipworm) and Necator americanus/Ancylostoma duodenal (hookworms) are amongst the
      most prevalent parasites worldwide. An estimated 4.5 billion individuals are at risk for STH
      and more than one billion individuals are thought to be infected, of which 450 million have
      significant morbidity attributable from their infection, school-aged children in particular.
      In this population infections cause stunting of the linear growth, anemia, reduce the
      cognitive function and contribute to the existing malnutrition. In Jimma (Ethiopia), STH are
      highly prevalent, affecting more than 60% of the children (data not published).

      Current efforts to control STH infections involve periodic mass drug anthelmintic treatment
      of infected children in endemic areas and are likely to intensify as more attention is
      addressed to the importance of these neglected diseases. Monitoring drug efficacy in these
      control programs has become indispensable in order to detect the emergence of resistance
      and/or identify confounding factors affecting the drug efficacy. Recently a study has
      evaluated a single dose albendazole (ALB) in school age children across 7 countries,
      including Ethiopia, revealing that this regime is highly efficacious for the treatment of A.
      lumbricoides (99.5%) and hookworms (94.8%), but not for T. trichiura (50.8%). For this
      parasite a repeated dose regime of ALB on consecutive days is likely to be more appropriate.
      Alternative drugs are mebendazole (single dose 500mg) and pyrantel+oxantel (single dose
      10mg/kg), of which the latter holds promise as it can also be administrated to children
      between 6 months and 2 years. The main objective of the present study, therefore, is to
      assess the efficacy of 5 different treatment regimes against T. trichiura in schoolchildren
      in Jimma, Ethiopia, including albendazole (1 x 400mg, 2 x 400mg), mebendazole (1 x 500mg, 2x
      500mg) and pyrantel-oxantel (10mg/kg)+mebendazole (500mg).

    <description>The evaluation of the efficacy against T. trichiura of various treatment regimes. To this end, subjects infected with T. trichura (based on McMaster), will be randomly assigned to one of the five proposed treatment regimes. Two weeks after the treatment, faecal egg counts will be performed and the reduction in faecal egg counts will be evaluated</description>
