  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use excess tissue from endoscopic or surgical procedures to examine the
      elements of plaque that are found in the carotid walls of patients who have a type of heart
      and blood vessel disease called atherosclerosis. Tissue will be collected from patients
      undergoing carotid procedures as well as patients undergoing liver and/or intestinal
      biopsies. This lab study will examine the different types of proteins that play a role in
      developing heart plaque.
