    <textblock>
      The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS) is a
      multidisciplinary, community-based, prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining
      the influences of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of age-related
      health disparities among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.
      This study investigates whether health disparities develop or persist due to differences in
      SES, differences in race, or their interaction. This study is unique because it will assess
      over a 20-year period physical parameters as well as evaluate genetic, biologic, demographic,
      and psychosocial parameters of African American and white participants in higher and lower
      SES. It also employs novel research tools, mobile medical research vehicles, in hopes of
      improving participation rates and retention among non-traditional research participants. The
      domains of the HANDLS study include: nutrition, cognition, biologic biomarkers, body
      composition and bone quality, physical function and performance, sociodemographics,
      psychosocial, neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease. Utilizing data from these
      study domains will facilitate understand the driving factors behind persistent black-white
      health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.

      HANDLS recruited a fixed cohort as an area probability sample of Baltimore City from August
      2004 through November 2009 as Wave 1. HANDLS Wave 2 entitled The Association of Personality
      and Socioeconomic status with Health Status - An Interim Follow-up Study began in June 2006
      under a separate protocol. It was designed as a follow-up telephone interview approximately
      18 months after the initial examination (Wave 1) was complete. Wave 2 provided interim
      contact with study participants, and important interim information regarding their health.
      Now completed, waves 3 and 4 were the first and second follow-up examinations and
      participants second and third visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). The
      current protocol outlines Wave 5, the third follow-up examination and participants fourth
      visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). Planned as a follow-up after 3-4 years,
      Wave 5 consists of health examinations, questionnaires, a telephone dietary-recall interview,
      sensory assessments (visual, olfactory), health literacy assessment, skin color analysis,
      renal function assessments, environmental assessments and structural MRIs.
