      The purpose of this study is based on method Utstein, registering all recommended items of
      that model, in addition to adding more information, characterizing this way using a template
      Utstein modified for the epidemiology of PCR-hospital in Brazil.

      Objectives: establish a registry of patients suffering from respiratory (PCR)-hospital to
      assess demographic and clinical variables such as morbidity, mortality and standard practice
      in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In addition, assess independent predictors associated
      with survival in several times and survival curves.

      Bedding: Despite of ongoing advances and standardizing worldwide trumpeted by CPR guidelines,
      yet is little knowledge of the effectiveness of procedures for intra and extra-hospital CPR,
      so vast are the opportunities for documentation of these results in the field of clinical and
      epidemiological research. Utstein style emerged, then as a proposed methodology for the PCR
      during the Conference held at the former monastery Utstein, Norway. The &quot;Utstein Style&quot; was
      also the model for the construction of the National Registry of Cardiac Pulmonary
      Resuscitation (NRCPR), sponsored by the American Heart Association (AHA). The proposal of
      this study is based on method Utstein, registering all recommended items of that model, in
      addition to adding more information, characterizing this way using a template Utstein
      modified for the epidemiology of PCR-hospital in Brazil.

      Objectives: establish a registry of patients suffering from respiratory (PCR)-hospital to
      assess demographic and clinical variables such as morbidity, mortality and standard practice
      in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In addition, assess independent predictors associated
      with survival in several times and survival curves.

      Methods: Observational Study of prospective registration type, to document the clinical
      practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in-hospital effect in 17 hospitals and institutes
      of public and private Brazilian specialties. Additionally the longitudinal follow-up will be
      conducted until discharged, and measurement of mortality at 6 months and 12 months.
