  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using Cranial Electrical Stimulation (CES) helps
      improve symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). The investigators are studying the
      device's effectiveness in treating depression, as well as its safety. This is a pilot study.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either active CES or sham CES,
      every weekday for 3 weeks. During the visits, subjects will receive CES or sham CES treatment
      for 20 minutes.

      The primary outcome measure will be change in score on the HAM-D 17. The secondary outcome
      measure will be change in patient-reported sleep score.

      We examined efficacy and safety of one specific cranial electrical stimulator (CES) device at
      a fixed setting in subjects with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Thirty
      subjects with MDD and inadequate response to standard antidepressants were randomized to 3
      weeks of treatment with CES (15/500/15000 Hz, symmetrical rectangular biphasic current of 1-4
      mAmp, 40 Volts) or sham CES (device off) for 20 minutes, 5 days per week. The primary outcome
      measure was improvement in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17). Adverse
      effects (AEs) were assessed using the Patient Related Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE). We
      hypothesized that subjects who received active as opposed to sham CES would have a
      significantly greater improvement in their depression symptoms. Due to the small sample, we
      could not hypothesize an effect size, but would calculate one to determine signal strength to
      guide the design of a larger, more rigorous study. As an exploratory aim, we also examined
      whether CES would benefit sleep.

    <measure>Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17) Score From Baseline to Week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) used here is a 17-item scale that measures severity of depression. Items are individually scored from 0-4 or from 0-2 depending on the item, and the individual scores for each item are added to comprise one score. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depression. Possible scores on the scale range from a minimum of zero (0) to a maximum of 52. This section reports the improvement in depressive symptoms during the course of treatment, i.e. the change in overall score between baseline visit and week 3 visit. Change can occur in either direction (i.e. improvement or worsening). A score of greater than zero indicates a reduction of depressive symptoms (improvement), whereas a score of less than zero indicates an increase in depressive symptoms (worsening).</description>

    <measure>Change in Global Sleep Scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) From Baseline to Week 3.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a patient-rated instrument to assess sleep quality and quantity and its changes throughout the study. Scoring is based on 7 individual components. Each component is scored from 0-3. Higher scores indicate worse sleep. Total global sleep score ranges from zero (0) to 21. We report here the overall change in global sleep score for each treatment arm, i.e. the change in overall score between baseline visit and week 3 visit. Change can occur in either direction (i.e. improvement or worsening). A score of greater than zero indicates a reduction of sleep disturbance (improvement), whereas a score of less than zero indicates an increase in sleep disturbance (worsening).</description>

    <description>Active CES: The FW-100 Cranial Stimulator headset was placed on the scalp over the two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas. The power knob was turned to maximum setting. The waveform contains a 15000Hz square wave carrier from 0-4 mAmp. The first 15Hz modulating signal provides 50msec of &quot;on&quot; and 16.7msec of &quot;off&quot; time (total 66.7msec, 50% duty cycle). A second 500Hz modulating signal changes the &quot;on&quot; time series of 15000Hz pulses (750 pulses/50msec) into 25 smaller bursts of 15 pulses of the 15000Hz carrier signal, for 375 pulses in 50msec. The consecutive positive burst and &quot;off&quot; time is followed by an opposite negative burst and &quot;off&quot; time, balancing the current component to zero. Output voltage ranges from 0-40V, positive and negative. CES automatically shut off after 20 mins.</description>

    <description>Shame CES: The sham devices were modified to not deliver current to the headset. The current from the active device departs from the posts at the top of the device into the headsets, creating a loop when the headset is worn by the subject with the wet electrode sponges. This loop is eliminated in the sham devices by wrapping wire around the posts, thus containing the loop within the device, with no electricity leaving the headsets. This approach allows the loop to be maintained, and therefore all of the device's green and yellow amperage lights still light up, protecting the blind.</description>

        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) used here is a 17-item scale that measures severity of depression. Items are individually scored from 0-4 or from 0-2 depending on the item, and the individual scores for each item are added to comprise one score. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depression. Possible scores on the scale range from a minimum of zero (0) to a maximum of 52. This section reports the improvement in depressive symptoms during the course of treatment, i.e. the change in overall score between baseline visit and week 3 visit. Change can occur in either direction (i.e. improvement or worsening). A score of greater than zero indicates a reduction of depressive symptoms (improvement), whereas a score of less than zero indicates an increase in depressive symptoms (worsening).</description>

            <description>Active CES: The FW-100 Cranial Stimulator headset was placed on the scalp over the two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas. The power knob was turned to maximum setting. The waveform contains a 15000Hz square wave carrier from 0-4 mAmp. The first 15Hz modulating signal provides 50msec of “on” and 16.7msec of “off” time (total 66.7msec, 50% duty cycle). A second 500Hz modulating signal changes the “on” time series of 15000Hz pulses (750 pulses/50msec) into 25 smaller bursts of 15 pulses of the 15000Hz carrier signal, for 375 pulses in 50msec. The consecutive positive burst and “off” time is followed by an opposite negative burst and “off” time, balancing the current component to zero. Output voltage ranges from 0-40V, positive and negative. CES automatically shut off after 20 mins.

The current from the active device departs from the posts at the top of the device into the headsets, creating a loop when the headset is worn by the subject with the wet electrode sponges. This loop is eliminated in the sham devices by wrapping wire around the posts, thus containing the loop within the device, with no electricity leaving the headsets. This approach allows the loop to be maintained, and therefore all of the device’s green and yellow amperage lights still light up, protecting the blind.

        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a patient-rated instrument to assess sleep quality and quantity and its changes throughout the study. Scoring is based on 7 individual components. Each component is scored from 0-3. Higher scores indicate worse sleep. Total global sleep score ranges from zero (0) to 21. We report here the overall change in global sleep score for each treatment arm, i.e. the change in overall score between baseline visit and week 3 visit. Change can occur in either direction (i.e. improvement or worsening). A score of greater than zero indicates a reduction of sleep disturbance (improvement), whereas a score of less than zero indicates an increase in sleep disturbance (worsening).</description>

          <title>Active CES</title>
          <description>Active CES: The FW-100 Cranial Stimulator headset was placed on the scalp over the two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas. The power knob was turned to maximum setting. The waveform contains a 15000Hz square wave carrier from 0-4 mAmp. The first 15Hz modulating signal provides 50msec of “on” and 16.7msec of “off” time (total 66.7msec, 50% duty cycle). A second 500Hz modulating signal changes the “on” time series of 15000Hz pulses (750 pulses/50msec) into 25 smaller bursts of 15 pulses of the 15000Hz carrier signal, for 375 pulses in 50msec. The consecutive positive burst and “off” time is followed by an opposite negative burst and “off” time, balancing the current component to zero. Output voltage ranges from 0-40V, positive and negative. CES automatically shut off after 20 mins.

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Sham CES</title>
          <description>Shame CES: The sham devices were modified to not deliver current to the headset. The current from the active device departs from the posts at the top of the device into the headsets, creating a loop when the headset is worn by the subject with the wet electrode sponges. This loop is eliminated in the sham devices by wrapping wire around the posts, thus containing the loop within the device, with no electricity leaving the headsets. This approach allows the loop to be maintained, and therefore all of the device’s green and yellow amperage lights still light up, protecting the blind.
Sham CES: Sham CES (device off) for 20-minutes each day 5 days/week for 3 weeks.</description>
