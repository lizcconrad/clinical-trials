  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The mortality of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis remains high.
      This may at least be partly due to the insufficient removal of (especially protein-bound)
      uremic toxins which have been associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is
      unknown whether the combination of long-hour haemodialysis (HD) with convection increases the
      removal of these toxins. Long-hour HD and long-hour haemodiafiltration (HDF) may also improve
      haemodynamic stability which is an important factor in treatment quality. The investigators
      aim to study the removal of uremic toxins in long-hour HD and HDF and to compare the
      haemodynamics between 4-hour and 8-hour HD and HDF.

      Objectives: The primary aim is to study the removal of (especially protein-bound) uremic
      toxins in 4-hour and 8-hour HD and HDF. A secondary aim is to compare the haemodynamic
      response between 4-hour and 8-hour HD and HDF.

    <description>To measure uremic toxin and electrolyte removal, reduction ratios, dialytic clearances and mass removal in collected dialysate will be determined. Blood samples will be taken from the inlet blood lines immediately before the onset of dialysis and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes (4-hour and 8-hour sessions) and at 360 and 480 minutes (8-hour sessions). Furthermore, ultrafiltrate and dialysate will be continuously collected in a fractionated way.</description>

    <description>BP, heart rate, heart rate variability, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance will be measured every 30 minutes by the Task Force Monitor. Skin microcirculation will be measured with laser Doppler flowmetry every 120 min until the end of the treatment.</description>

    <description>Prevalent conventional HD (CHD) patients (dialysing 3 days a week during 4 hours per dialysis session) will undergo, in random order, a mid-week 4-hour HD session, a mid-week 4-hour HDF session, a mid-week 8-hour HD session, and a mid-week 8-hour HDF session with a 2-week interval between every session to assess the influence of treatment duration and of convection on the removal of uremic toxins and on the haemodynamic responses and autonomic nervous regulation. In between the study dialysis sessions these patients will receive routine CHD treatments.</description>
