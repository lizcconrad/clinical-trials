    <textblock>
      The incidence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to increase, and
      prevalence estimates for NAFLD range from 17-33%, making it is the most common cause of
      chronic liver disease in North America. It is associated with increased cardiovascular
      morbidity as well as progression to cirrhosis is a subset of patients. There is currently no
      approved treatment for NAFLD. A key barrier to the development of effective therapies is a
      lack of consensus on the criteria for diagnosis and endpoints for studies evaluating
      diagnostic markers, prognosis and therapeutic modalities.

      NAFLD encompasses an entire pathological spectrum of disease, from relatively benign
      accumulation of lipid (steatosis) to progressive non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
      associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and necrosis. It has been estimated that 20-30% of
      patients with NAFLD will exhibit biochemical and histological changes characteristic of NASH,
      and 15-20% of those patients will progress to have cirrhosis. NASH remains an important
      phenotypic state, because this sub-group of patients is deemed at high-risk for developing
      progressive disease resulting in cirrhosis, liver failure requiring transplantation, or
      death.

      Although NAFLD has not to date been included as a component of the metabolic syndrome, there
      is increasing evidence that NAFLD frequently accompanies the development of insulin
      resistance and therefore may be an indicator or predictor of future cardiometabolic risk.
      Moreover, recent findings in skeletal muscle of experimental insulin resistance (lipid
      infusion) as well as naturally occurring obese and type 2 diabetic, insulin resistant
      patients show that skeletal muscle inflammation leads to a pattern of extracellular matrix,
      structural, and remodeling abnormalities that closely resemble the TGFb, connective tissue
      growth factor (CTGF) mediated fibrotic response that differentiates simple steatotic liver
      from NASH. This suggests there may be a common underlying mechanism. Given the ready
      availability of skeletal muscle tissue using percutaneous needle muscle biopsies, compared to
      the more invasive liver biopsy, it may be possible to use characteristics of skeletal muscle
      to distinguish the severity of liver fibrosis.

      Given the preponderance of patients being identified with NAFLD, the recognition of less and
      non invasive tests that help to discriminate the different phenotypic types of NAFLD would be
      highly practical and useful. This would help identify patients at risk of progression to
      cirrhosis, and thus make them the target of any available therapeutic interventions.

      The investigators hypothesize that 1. Insulin resistance measured through glucose tolerance
      test directly correlates with the extent of liver and muscle fibrosis, and 2. Inflammation
      and fibrosis in the skeletal muscles correlates with the histopathological changes seen in
      patients with NAFLD, and potentially skeletal muscle inflammation may be used as a diagnostic
      predictor to differentiate patients with NASH from patients with simple steatosis.

      The overall goal of this project is to determine the extent to which inflammation and
      fibrosis in skeletal muscle mirrors and is predictive of the level of liver inflammation and
      can distinguish NASH from simple steatosis. Specifically, the investigators propose the
      following Aims:

        1. To use estimates of insulin sensitivity from modeling of oral glucose tolerance tests to
           test the hypothesis that the extent of liver and muscle fibrosis is directly related to
           insulin resistance.

        2. To use liver and muscle biopsies to characterize the changes in abundance of mRNAs and
           proteins that characterize inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis.
           The investigators will use quantitative rt-PCR and immunoblot analysis to compare mRNA
           expression and protein abundance of collagens I and III, fibronectin, and connective
           tissue growth factor (CTGF) to test the hypothesis that there is a direct relationship
           between the levels of these proteins in muscle and liver and the degree of fibrosis.

        3. To establish a biospecimen repository of serum, mRNA from circulating white blood cells,
           liver and muscle tissue, and DNA to serve as the substrate for future studies of the
           pathogenesis of NASH.
