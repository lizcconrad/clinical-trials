    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that develops rapidly and can cause death. Some
      patients experience anaphylaxis is association with exercise, a disorder called
      exercise-induced anaphylaxis. A subset of patients with unexplained anaphylaxis, especially
      those with hypotension during the anaphylactic episodes, have been shown to have abnormal,
      clonal populations of a certain cell type, mast cells, in the bone marrow. This has been
      described in at least one patient with exercise-induced anaphylaxis. The investigators would
      like review the findings in a group of patients with exercise-induced anaphylaxis who have
      undergone evaluation for the presence of abnormal, clonal mast cells.

    <description>Presence of clonal mast cells in bone marrow as assessed by D816V c-kit mutation or CD25 will be recorded for each participant. The data will be reported as the number of participant with exercise induced anaphylaxis carrying these clonal mast cells in this observational study. Presence of mast cells will be correlated with clinical parameters such as symptoms experienced during anapylaxis.</description>
