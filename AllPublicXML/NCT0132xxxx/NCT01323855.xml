  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study to compare the PK of preladenant administered to participants with
      CRI to the PK of preladenant administered to healthy participants. Part 1 will compare the PK
      of participants with severe CRI to healthy participants. Part 2 will compare the PK of
      participants with moderate CRI and participants with mild CRI to healthy participants. The
      primary hypotheses are that the plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to
      infinity after single dosing (AUC0-∞) of preladenant in participants with either severe,
      moderate or mild CRI is similar to that of matched healthy participants.
