      This study aimed to explore whether speed-dependent treadmill training is more effective at
      improving walking and balance performance than speed-stable treadmill training in patients
      with subacute stroke. Twenty-six patients with stroke completed 2 weeks of treadmill
      training. Results showed that speed-dependent treadmill training is more effective at
      improving walking speed and step length than speed-stable treadmill training in patients with
      subacute stroke.

      Objectives: To compare the effects of speed-dependent treadmill training (SDT) on gait and
      balance performance in patients with sub-acute stroke. Design: Double-blinded randomized
      controlled trial. Subjects: Twenty-six patients with sub-acute stroke were randomly assigned
      to SDT (n=13) and control (n=13) groups. Methods: Subjects in the SDT group underwent short
      interval of walking trials with stepwise increases in the treadmill speed, following the
      principles of sprint training. Control subjects received gait training on the treadmill with
      a steady speed (SST). Gait speed, stride length, cadence, and Berg's balance score (BBS) were
      recorded and analysed before and after the 10 training sessions. Results: Results of two-way
      repeated measures ANOVA showed significant group x time interactions for gait speed and
      stride length (p &lt; 0.05). Within each subject group, there were improvements in all gait
      parameters and BBS (all p &lt; 0.001) after the training program. In addition, the SDT group
      showed significantly larger percentage increases in gait speed (by 72.8%) and stride length
      (by 29.2%) than the control subjects (p &lt; 0.02). Conclusions: SDT in patients with sub-acute
      stroke resulted in larger gains in gait speed and stride length compared with SST. The
      positive findings provide evidence for clinical practice of SDT in enhancing gait function
      after stroke.

    <description>For SDT training, subjects received short intervals of locomotion training with a treadmill. After walking for 30s, the subjects were given two minutes of rest. If they completed the first walking trial safely and without stumbling, the belt speed was increased by 10% on the next trial. However, if a subject failed to complete the first trial, the belt speed was decreased by 10% on the next trial. The speed of the treadmill was adjusted in each subsequent trial according to the same principle. Subjects usually completed 7-8 walking trials in one session. The belt speed was increased by a maximum of five increments within one training session.</description>
