      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, BIBW 2992 (Afatinib)
      has on patients and their advanced prostate cancer which does not respond to hormone or
      chemotherapy any more. Only patients with tumors which have an increased amounts of a protein
      called HER2 on their cell surface will be included.

      BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) is a drug which in advanced clinical testing in lung and breast cancer.

      This is a phase II study of BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) in patients with hormone and chemotherapy
      (docetaxel) refractory, HER2 overexpressing prostate cancer. The exploratory study following
      a two stage Gehan design. In the first stage 29 patients with be treated. Additional patients
      will be recruited in a second stage depending on the number of responding patients in the
      first step. Patients will receive BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) orally at a dose of 50 mg daily.
      Response to therapy will be scored according to PSA values (Bubley criteria) and to CT scans
      (RECIST criteria). Patients will be seen at 2 or 4 weeks intervals by a medical professional
      while on the medication for toxicity assessment and physical examination. Disease evaluations
      will occur at baseline and every 2 months thereafter. These evaluations will include PSA
      testing and CT Scans (if appropriate).
