  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the Phase Ia (dose escalation) part of this trial is to assess the MTD of BI
      847325 administered at escalating doses in 2 treatment arms. In the Phase Ib expansion part
      of the trial, the aim is to further evaluate the safety profile of BI 847325 at the
      recommended dose and schedule and to assess target modulation and the potential antitumour
      efficacy in patients with selected tumour types.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced
             unresectable and/or metastatic solid tumour, and who have failed conventional
             treatment or for whom no therapy of proven efficacy exists or who are not amenable to
             standard therapies.

          2. Age 18 years and older

          3. Written informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP and local legislation

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0 or 1.

          5. Recovery of therapy-related toxicities from previous anti-tumour therapies to Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) = grade 1 (with the exception of
             alopecia).

          6. Written informed consent to the use of archival tumour sample for determination of the
             BRAF/RAS mutational status.

          7. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          8. In escalation phase, when PK close to predicted Cmax or when signs of PD modulation
             present, optional tumour biopsies (at same timepoints as in expansion phase) for the
             patients who consented to it.

             shown on their archival tumour sample to have KRAS or BRAF mutation.

         10. have a measurable disease.

         11. have documented/proven progressive disease within the last 6 months, according to
