  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clear, converging evidence from multiple prospective studies with well-diagnosed
      adolescents with ADHD and comparison, non-ADHD adolescents, that teen drivers with ADHD have
      more accidents and other adverse driving outcomes. Available research indicates parental
      monitoring and limit-setting for adolescent drivers is one of the most effective
      interventions for preventing negative driving outcomes. For children with ADHD, interventions
      to promote parenting capacity to effectively oversee and intervene in teen driving will
      likely need to be intensive and require multiple treatment components. The present proposal
      aims to compare the standard care for teen drivers (driver's education classes and driving
      practice) to the Supporting a Teen's Effective Entry to the Roadway (STEER) program, that
      includes a parent-teen intervention, adolescent skill building, parent training on effective
      adolescent management strategies, joint parent-teen negotiations sessions, practice on a
      driving simulator, parental monitoring of objective driving behaviors, and the targeting of
      safe teen driving via contingency management strategies (i.e., parent-teen contracts). To
      facilitate teen and parent engagement the intervention will be preceded by a motivational
      interview. The specific aims of the proposal are to investigate the efficacy of the STEER
      program relative to a standard care group in a randomized clinical trial (N=172) on measures
      of objective driving outcome and parenting capacity. It is hypothesized that the STEER
      program will result in improved outcomes relative to the standard care group at the end of
      intervention and 6 and 12 month follow-up assessments.
