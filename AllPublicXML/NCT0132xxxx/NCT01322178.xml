      The aim of this study is to explore whether cetuximab in combination with mFOLFOX6 as
      treatment could improve the resection rate in patients with KRAS wild-type, unresectable
      liver metastases of mCRC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has made
      considerable progress.However, approximately 25% of patients with colorectal cancer present
      with overt metastatic disease. In selected patients, synchronous or metachronous liver
      metastases (LM) can be resected in curative intention. Over the last 5 years there has been
      the recognition that preoperative, neoadjuvant, combination chemotherapy regimens, namely,
      5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) in combination with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin
      can facilitate to downsize the initially unresectable LM and make the resection possible. The
      addition of targeted therapies might render them even more effective.

      Due to these results, the investigators hypothesize that cetuximab in combination with
      mFOLFOX6 as treatment in patients with KRAS wild-type, unresectable liver metastases of mCRC
      may further improve clinical outcomes.

          -  Unresectable, histologically confirmed, synchronous or metachronous liver metastasis
             of colorectal cancer. Unresectable liver metastases is defined as:

               -  Liver metastases that are technically unresectable immediately, and expected
                  remaining functional liver tissue ≥ 30% after resection. (Patients should be
                  evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of three local surgeons and one local
                  radiologist, including surgical consultation for potentially resectable patients
                  on the basis of remaining liver volume, infiltration of all liver veins,
                  infiltration of both liver arteries, both portal branches or both bile ducts.)

          -  Tumor tissue (primary or metastasis) genotypologically classified as KRAS wild-type in
             codon 12 and codon 13 of the KRAS gene exon 2
