  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia is highly prevalent in PD patients, and it is an independent risk factor
      for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in these patients. Effective treatments are
      limited in suppressing plasma phosphorous. Because of the nearly linear relationship between
      protein and phosphorus intake, high dietary protein intake (DPI, 1.2-1.3g/kg/d recommended by
      KDOQI) would load high phosphorus burden in PD patients. It is suggested that
      hyperphosphatemia is hard to avoid under such a DPI level, even as the patients take
      sufficient phosphorus blinders and receive high PD dosage. The present study is to
      investigate whether systemic dietary instruction would show effects on control of
      hyperphosphatemia in PD patients.
