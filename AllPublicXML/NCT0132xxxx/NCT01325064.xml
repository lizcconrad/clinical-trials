  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between central and
      peripheral blood pressure (clinic and ambulatory) with vascular structure and function,
      assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), artery venous retinal index, pulse wave
      velocity (PWV) and ankle-brachial index in patients with diabetes type 2 and without diabetes
      type 2. Develop and validate a software to measure the retinal vessels and to estimate
      arterio-venous index automatically.

      Methods/design: The investigators will Perform a coss-sectional study with control group,
      with follow-up of 4 years in primary care. The study population will be diabetic type 2
      patients with a control group without diabetes mellitus. The investigators will include by
      consecutive sampling 300 patients between 34 and 75 and without previous cardiovascular
      disease, half of each group. Main measurements: age, sex, height, weight and waist
      circumference. Lipids, creatinine, microalbuminuria, blood glucose, HbA1C, insulin,
      fibrinogen, hs-CRP and markers of endothelial dysfunction. Clinic and ambulatory blood
      pressure (MAPA). Ultrasonography to assess carotid IMT, retinography to assess arterio-venous
      ratio. ECG to evaluate left ventricular hypertrophy, ankle-brachial index and morphology
      analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in Sphigmocor System.

      Discussion: The investigators provide information regarding various parameters derived from
      MAPA and pulse wave analysis of with target organ damage, especially with the vascular
      structure and function assessed by IMT and PWV and endothelial dysfunction in patients with
      diabetes type 2 and without this disease. The investigators also hope to demonstrate the
      usefulness of the tool developed for automatic evaluation of retinal vascularization in the
      early detection of abnormalities of vascular structure and function and the prognosis of
      cardiovascular disease in the medium term.
