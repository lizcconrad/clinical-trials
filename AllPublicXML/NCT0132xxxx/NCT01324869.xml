      This study is designed to access the safety and efficacy of multiple injections of KH902 in
      patients with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With improvement of our living standard, patients who suffered from Diabetes become more and
      more. As the investigators know, Diabetes can induce many ocular diseases leading to vision
      loss. And according to observations, DME is diagnosed as one main cause of vision loss in the
      patients with Diabetes.

      As the results of many studies conducted previously, anti-VEGF drugs and anti-VEGF treatments
      show its effect and safety not only in treating AMD, but also in patients with DME. The new
      drug Recombinant Human VEGF Receptor-Fc Fusion Protein (KH902) is a gene fusion protein. The
      previous clinical trials of KH902 show that KH902 is effective and safe in inhibiting the
      growth, migration, pullulation of vascular endothelial cells and neovascularization induced
      by VEGF. Due to these positive results, the investigators prepare to conduct a clinical trial
      to assess the safety and efficacy with intravitreal injection of KH902 in patients with DME.
