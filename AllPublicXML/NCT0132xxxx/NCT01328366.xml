  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of psoriasis on an individual's emotional and social well-being goes beyond skin
      symptoms of the disease. Data suggests patients with severe psoriasis experience a greater
      prevalence of depressive symptoms, mood disturbances, anxiety and even suicidal ideation.
      Given the nature of the disease and the treatment failures which are required before a
      patient commences a biologic therapy such as adalimumab, the patient's mental health at
      initiation of biologics is an important consideration for clinicians. This study seeks to
      explore if adalimumab treatment of psoriasis leads to a positive impact on psychosocial
      factors and disease-related quality of life.

      This was a multi-center, prospective, post-marketing observational study of participants with
      severe chronic plaque psoriasis who began adalimumab therapy in the United Kingdom. Although
      153 participants enrolled in the study, data was only analyzed on 143 individuals and there
      were no interventions or changes to participant management for the study. Prior to initiating
      adalimumab therapy (baseline), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Self-Administered
      Psoriasis Area Severity Index (SAPASI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
      Cutaneous Body Image (CBI) scale, Short Form 12 (SF-12) Health Survey, Female Sexual Function
      Index (FSFI) (female participants) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (male
      participants) questionnaires were completed by participants and at 4 weeks, 16 weeks and 6
      months following initiation.

        <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) questionnaire was used by the clinical staff to measure the severity of a participant’s psoriasis, taking into account the area of psoriasis legions on the body and the characteristics of these legions (redness, thickness, scaliness). Scores range from 0-72, a higher score indicating more severe psoriasis. Data are reported as the mean change in PASI score ± standard deviation.</description>
