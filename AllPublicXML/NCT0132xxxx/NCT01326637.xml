  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human factors engineering literature makes clear that appropriate, well-designed and
      well-timed information improves decision making and can reduce mental workload. Data from a
      previous study showed that appropriate, well-designed and well-timed information is not
      present in many primary care encounters with elderly patients. This puts primary care
      physicians at risk of higher mental workload and poor decision making which can affect the
      quality and safety of care delivered to patients. Elderly patients are at particular risk
      because they are more likely to have more comorbidities, medications, and cognitive
      impairments.

      Dr. Karsh and his research team will test an intervention to improve the performance of
      primary care physicians and, thus the safety of primary care of the elderly. The
      investigators will use a randomized experiment, with random assignment at the level of
      patient, to test and evaluate the intervention. The evaluation will involve 4 primary care
      clinics, with 4 primary care physicians per clinic. The investigators will collect data from
      768 patient visits pre-intervention and 1536 patient visits during the intervention.
      Intervention patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention or care as usual.

      The Intervention has two components:

      Pre-visit care coordination:

        -  5-7 days prior to a study patient's appointment with his/her doctor, the doctor's
           nurse/MA will call the study patient and collect pertinent clinical information about
           the patient using a data collection form the investigators call a Patient Overview
           Document or POD.

        -  The nurse/MA will ensure that any lab results, consultant reports, ER reports, imaging
           studies, etc., that will be needed by the physician are available to the doctor.

      Team Meeting:

      On the day of the patient's appointment and prior to the beginning of the clinic session, the
      nurse/MA will meet briefly with the doctor to jointly review the POD.

      Hypotheses:

      H1. Primary Care Physician (PCP): The intervention will increase situation awareness, reduce
      PCP mental workload, reduce PCP perceived likelihood of error, and improve PCP visit
      satisfaction. PCP efficiency, as measured by encounter problem density during a visit, will
      also improve.

      H2. Patient: The intervention will improve patients' perceptions of their visits on a variety
      of AHRQ CAHPS measures, such as physician knowledge of patient history.

      H3. Patient: The intervention will not impact the number or types of problems addressed
      during the visit.

      H4. Clinic: The intervention will not affect visit RVUs

    <description>There are no outcome measures for individual patients.
We will review the dictated clinic note for each study patient visit in order to
Make a list of the all problems (e.g., hypertension, asthma, annual influenza vaccination, etc.) that are discussed in the clinic note;
Record the number of problems that the patient and doctor discussed.
We will compare the number of problems and the kind of problems found in the intervention patient group with the number and kind of problems found in the care-as-usual group.</description>

    <measure>Resource utilization</measure>

    <description>There are no outcome measures for individual patients. We will look at the resource utilization (RVUs) during care-as-usual visits compared to resource utilization during intervention visits. To assess resource utilization, we will collect E&amp;M/CPT codes for each study visit and calculate the RVUs. A study patient is seen only once.</description>

    <description>The Intervention has two components:
Pre-visit care coordination:
5-7 days prior to a study patient's appointment with the doctor, the doctor's nurse/MA will call the study patient and collect pertinent clinical information using a data collection form we call a Patient Overview Document or POD. The purpose of the POD is to comprehensively inform the doctor about the patient before the doctor enters the exam room.
The nurse/MA will ensure that lab results, consultant reports, ER reports, imaging studies, etc., needed by the physician during the patient's visit, are available to the doctor in their usual place.
Team Meeting:
On the day of the patient's appointment, prior to the beginning of the clinic session, the nurse/MA and doctor will jointly review the POD.</description>
