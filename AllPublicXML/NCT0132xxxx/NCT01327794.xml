      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research trial is studying the relationship between vitamin D biomarkers and
      survival in blood samples from patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective

        -  To measure baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in a cohort of patients
           with advanced pancreatic cancer enrolled in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)
           study 80303 and evaluate the association between vitamin D status and overall survival
           (OS) or progression free survival (PFS).

      Secondary Objective

        -  To evaluate the association between common germ-line single nucleotide polymorphisms
           (SNPs) in the vitamin D pathway genes and 25(OH)D levels in patients with advanced
           pancreatic cancer.

        -  To evaluate the interaction between serum 25(OH)D levels and germ-line SNPs in the
           vitamin D pathway genes in predicting OS in advanced pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived serum samples are analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels by competitive
      chemiluminescence immunoassay. Results are then compared with the germ-line single nucleotide
      polymorphisms from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and patients' clinical data.

    <description>Participants in this correlative study (CALGB 151006) were enrolled in CALGB 80303, which was a national, multi-center, double-blind phase III study that randomly assigned patients (1:1) with advanced pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine plus bevacizumab vs gemcitabine plus placebo. Blood samples were collected from consenting participants in CALGB 80303 at the time of study registration at respective institutions and shipped to the CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office for storage (Columbus, OH).Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were measured and examined associations between baseline 25(OH)D levels and progression-free survival and OS using the Cox rank score test.</description>
