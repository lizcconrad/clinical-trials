      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids into the
      blood following consumption of krill oil compared with fish oil and placebo. An additional
      purpose is to evaluate the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of consumption of Krill Oil and
      Fish Oil to a placebo product. It has been shown that the ingestion of Krill Oil leads to
      better absorption of omega-3 fatty acids compared to ingestion of Fish Oil. It was also shown
      that consumption of krill oil and fish oil result in a favorable modification of lipid
      profiles. Therefore, it is anticipated that consumption of these krill oil and fish oil will
      improve lipid profile, as well as other health-related markers and will be safe and well
      tolerated.
