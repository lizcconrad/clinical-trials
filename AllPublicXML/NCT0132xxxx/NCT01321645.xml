      Acne is one of the most common skin problems in teenagers and adolescents. There are many
      lesser known homoeopathic medicines which have been mentioned in the literature for treatment
      of acne but their potential has not been properly assessed /documented and therefore these
      medicines don't form a part of many prescriptions. As a part of this study,efficacy of
      Azadirachta Indica will be studied in the treatment of Acne vulgaris
