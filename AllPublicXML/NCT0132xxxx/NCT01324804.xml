  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The negative effect of internal mammary harvesting on sternal perfusion is well known,
      especially in diabetic subjects. Microdialysis previously showed increased lactate tissue
      concentration after mammary artery preparation. Although high antibiotic concentration is of
      utmost importance in this region, no study previously measured the effect of internal mammary
      artery harvesting on target tissue antibiotic concentration.

      Study hypothesis:

      Internal mammary artery harvesting imposes an additional risk for deep sternal wound
      infection by impairing antibiotic tissue penetration. This effect is mediated by altered
      perfusion patterns and may be seen in cephalosporin and/or Teicoplanin treatment.

      Study objective:

      To evaluate the impact of left internal mammary artery preparation on target tissue
      antibiotic concentration of Cefazolin and Teicoplanin during cardiac surgery

      Design:

      This study is designed as an observational pharmacokinetic trial. Patients are their own
      controls by measuring antibiotic concentration in different subcutaneous tissues.

      Study population:

      Patients referred for coronary artery bypass grafting to the Department of Cardiothoracic
      Surgery with planned unilateral left internal mammary artery preparation and a high risk
      profile for deep sternal wound infections will be asked to participate in this trial.
