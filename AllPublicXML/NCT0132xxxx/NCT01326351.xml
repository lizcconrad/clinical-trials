    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that prolotherapy in conjunction with a
      physiotherapy program looking at reinforcing calf muscle and muscle of the plantar fascia,
      relieves pain and improves function of people suffering of plantar fasciitis, an inflammation
      of the plantar fascia, after basic treatment failure.

    <description>The Maryland Foot Score questionnaire will be used. This questionnaire assesses pain and function of injured foot using a summated rating scale of 10 questions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of pain intensity and pain-related function impairment during the course of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 weeks from week 0 to 36</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (short form) will be administered to assess pain intensity and pain-related functional impairment (physical and emotional). Four items assess the intensity of current pain and pain at ils least, worst, and average during the past day on scales form 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;). Seven more items measure pain-related functional interference in different domains (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) rated from 0 (&quot;does not interfere&quot;) to 10 (&quot;interferes completely&quot;).</description>

    <description>Injection of 10cc of a 15% dextrose and 0.6% lidocaine solution free of epinephrine in one injection site (lateral infiltration of the plantar fascia). This injection will be performed following posterior tibial nerve blockade (injection of 10cc of 1% lidocaine and 0.25% bupivacaine solution free of epinephrine behind the posterior tibial artery). The intervention will be administered every three weeks until symptoms are alleviated for a maximum of 5 injection sessions. Furthermore, patients must perform an at-home exercise program 3 times a week for a total of 12 weeks. The exercise program consists of 3 stretching exercises, 1 muscle release exercise and 1 strengthening exercise.</description>
