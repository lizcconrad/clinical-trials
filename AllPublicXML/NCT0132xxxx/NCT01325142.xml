      This study seeks to identify risk factors associated with the development of a jaw condition
      seen in patients with cancer treated with certain medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to build an index of risk for estimating an individual's risk of
      developing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The bisphosphonates are an important supportive
      therapy in the care of patients with metastatic bone disease; they are able to prevent
      catastrophic events such as fracture and spinal cord compression. However, ONJ has been
      associated with the use of the bisphosphonates and ONJ carries significant morbidity.
      Presently, there are insufficient data to calculate the ONJ risk benefit ratio of
      bisphosphonate use. An ONJ risk assessment tool would improve both the oncologist's and the
      dental health professional the ability to anticipate and potentially mitigate oral toxicities
      from bisphosphonate therapy.

      This protocol consists of a case (ONJ) control (no ONJ) study to identify factors associated
      with the risk of ONJ and to build an index predictive of an individual's risk of developing
      ONJ. The index of ONJ risk will be comprised of clinical, epidemiologic and genetic factors

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study candidate must have sufficient Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded
             (FFPE)Specimens (lymph node or tumor) for DNA extraction available for study SNP
             assessment

          -  Patients over the age of 21 with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer who
             have received nitrogen containing bisphosphonate therapy for metastatic bone disease.

          -  FFPE tissues are to have been removed for clinical indication and sufficience study
             volume of specimen must be available in an established tissue repository.

          -  - Study FFPE tissues include:

               -  formalin fixed paraffin embedded leukocytes from lymph nodes with or without
                  involvement by tumor AND/OR

               -  formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue (tumor block without invasive
                  cancer is acceptable if the specimen is believed to be sufficiently cellular
                  (breast tissue or noninvasive cancer) to yield adequate DNA)
