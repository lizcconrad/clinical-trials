    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with PMIM in patients
      with visceral leishmaniasis within the VL-endemic region of Bangladesh at EOT (21/22 days
      after treatment begins), and at 6 months after end of treatment (Day 202/203, -15 to +30
      days).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safe, effective and affordable treatments for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that are widely
      available to the poorest populations are urgently needed in Bangladesh in areas where the
      disease is endemic. Paromomycin IM Injection (PMIM) was approved for the treatment of VL in
      August 2006 by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), and it offers an attractive
      alternative to treatments that are currently available.
