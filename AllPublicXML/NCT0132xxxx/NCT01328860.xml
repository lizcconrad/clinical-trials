      The purpose of this research study is:

        1. To see if Bone Marrow Cell harvest and transplantation are safe in children with Spinal
           Cord Injury, and

        2. To determine if late functional outcome is improved following Bone Marrow Cell
           transplantation in children with Spinal Cord Injury, using pre-transplantation spinal
           cord function as the control.

    <textblock>
      Of the estimated 11,000 cases of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) which occur each year in
      North America, 5% involve children. The injury is divided into the primary mechanical event
      which causes the injury, and the secondary events which follow. Outcome for SCI depends of
      the severity of the primary injury (complete vs. incomplete) and the spinal cord level of the
      injury. Current therapy is designed only to minimize the secondary events of SCI and other
      trauma-associated injuries. Because the current therapy does nothing to reverse the primary
      insult, significant advances in reducing the disability associated with SCI are unlikely.
      Recent basic science and animal studies suggest that stem cell treatment can foster
      functional improvement after SCI by helping repair the primary injury and reducing the
      secondary injury.

      Stem cells are &quot;unspecialized&quot; cells in the body that do not have a specific function yet
      (for example, they have not become &quot;heart cells&quot; or &quot;brain cells&quot; yet.) Stem cells are able
      to divide and develop into more mature, function-specific cells and take the place of those
      cells that die, are injured or can no longer function the way they are supposed to. Stem
      cells are being studied a lot because of this ability and there is the possibility that they
      may be used to take the place of cells that are no longer working in different parts of the
      body because of disease (as in cancer, diabetes, and heart disease). Stem cells can be found
      throughout the body, but they are most common in the bone marrow, the thick, spongy material
      inside the bones.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of transplantation of the
      patient's own (autologous) Bone Marrow Progenitor Cells (BMPC) in children with SCI. The
      secondary objective is to determine if functional, physiological and anatomic outcome
      measures are improved after BMPC autologous transplantation in children with SCI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between 1 year and 15 years of age on the day of study BMPC infusion.

          2. Survived at least six months with PSCI, but are less than 4 years post injury (Â± 30
             days), and have fixed neurologic deficits related to their injury at the time of
             enrollment.

          3. Ability of child to understand and speak English.

          4. Ability of child and caregiver to travel to Houston, Texas, and stay for at least 4
             days, and to return for all Follow-up visits (patient is responsible for cost of
             travel and lodging while in Houston).

          5. Pediatric patients with any type of spinal cord injury as long as their spinal cords
             are continuous on MRI evaluation. This includes paraplegic and quadriplegic patients
             with complete or incomplete spinal cord injuries. This includes patients with ASIA
             impairment scales from A to D. The clinical classification will be described by the
             level below which motor/sensory function is impaired, and the degree of that
             impairment. (i.e. C-5 if the deltoid muscle is intact but the biceps and other muscle
             groups below the C-5 level are weak [incomplete motor injury] or paralyzed [complete
             motor injury]. A similar evaluation of sensory function will be established
             clinically.
