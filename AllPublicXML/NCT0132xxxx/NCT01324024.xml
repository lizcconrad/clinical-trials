  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication called Vyvanse®
      (lisdexamfetamine; LDX) has an impact on cognitive functioning, specifically measures of
      sustained attention, verbal encoding and recall and working memory, in menopausal aged women.
      LDX is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The
      cognitive difficulties that menopausal women report experiencing are typical of adults who
      are diagnosed with ADHD. The investigators will assess whether or not LDX is effective in
      alleviating those cognitive disruptions when compared to a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midlife decline in cognitive function, particularly attention and working memory, is a
      frequent complaint for which menopausal women seek clinical intervention. Many of the
      cognitive complaints detected in menopausal women including, short-term memory, organization
      of tasks, sustaining focus and concentration, and regulating emotions, overlap with symptoms
      frequently reported by adults with ADHD. These impairments are reported by many women who
      have no previous history of ADHD, and appear to be linked to reduced estrogen levels
      occurring in menopause.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study testing whether LDX, a stimulant
      medication, would be effective in alleviating midlife onset impairments of attention and
      working memory among menopausal women. There will be 3 days in which subjects will undergo a
      brief cognitive testing assessment; the first testing period will occur at baseline prior to
      beginning LDX or placebo treatment (PT) in trial A; the second testing period will occur
      following 4 weeks of double blind LDX or PT; and the final testing period will take place
      after another 4 weeks of double blind LDX or PT in Trial B. Each cognitive test period will
      involve 2 separate cognitive testing batteries that will take approximately 120 minutes total
      to complete.

    <measure>Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of first Intervention (4 weeks) and end of second Intervention (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The BADDS questionnaire is a clinician administered questionnaire that assesses the frequency and severity of five clusters of symptoms reflective of executive dysfunction reported by individuals with ADHD. Participants are asked to rate the frequency and severity of a symptom on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning that the problem described does not relate to them and 3 indicating that the problem is very true for them and occurs almost daily. The range of severity for the total BADDS score is 0 to 120, with scores of 55 and above being consistent with full-syndrome ADHD.</description>

    <measure>Penn Continuous Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of first Intervention (4 weeks) and end of second Intervention (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Penn Continuous Performance Test is a measure of visual attention and vigilance. In this task, a series of red vertical and horizontal lines flash in a digital numeric frame. The participant must press the spacebar whenever the lines form complete numbers or complete letters. The minimum to maximum score range for this task is 0-60 correct responses, with 60 being a perfect score. This data presented in the outcome measure table reflects the total number of correct responses.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, end of first Intervention (4 weeks) and end of second Intervention (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects hear 2 brief narratives, each containing 19-21 informational bits, and are asked to recall as many details as possible immediately after hearing each paragraph (A and B) and again following a 30 minute delay. Subjects receive credit for each informational bit recalled verbatim. Different paragraphs were read at each assessment. The maximum number of correct responses for paragraph A is 19 and the maximum number of correct responses for paragraph B is 21.</description>

        <title>Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS)</title>
        <description>The BADDS questionnaire is a clinician administered questionnaire that assesses the frequency and severity of five clusters of symptoms reflective of executive dysfunction reported by individuals with ADHD. Participants are asked to rate the frequency and severity of a symptom on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning that the problem described does not relate to them and 3 indicating that the problem is very true for them and occurs almost daily. The range of severity for the total BADDS score is 0 to 120, with scores of 55 and above being consistent with full-syndrome ADHD.</description>

        <population>Of the 55 participants who were consented for screening, 20 were excluded. Of the remaining 35 subjects, 32 completed both active and placebo treatment trials. The numbers in the lisdexamphetamine and placebo arms reflect the fact that 32 subjects completed both arms. 35 total participant data was analyzed for the baseline arm.</population>
