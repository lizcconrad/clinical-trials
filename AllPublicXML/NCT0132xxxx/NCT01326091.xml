  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, randomized controlled trial comparing two types of patient positioning
      and their effect on radiologic measures (pre-surgery visit, in the operating room prior to
      surgery, at the conclusion of surgery, and at 3 weeks after surgery at patients'
      postoperative visits) as well as surgeon satisfaction (prior to the end of the surgery) and
      patient outcomes using patient self reported scales (pre-surgery, post surgery at 3 weeks
      follow-up).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are evaluating how patient positioning affects radiologic metrics as well
      as surgeon satisfaction (surgeon being blinded to positioning). Patients will be allocated to
      either a hyperlordotic or a standard positioning group by computer generated randomization.
      Surgeons will perform all of their standard techniques to promote lordosis with
      instrumentation. Adult patients, ages 18-65, undergoing lumbar surgical fusion will be asked
      to participate.

    <description>X-rays will be performed at patients' pre-surgery visit, in the operating room prior to surgery and at the conclusion of surgery, and at 3 weeks after surgery at patients' postoperative visit. The specifics of the pelvic parameters will be measured at these visits. Also, the patient will complete VAS, ODI (Davidson, 2002; Fairbank, 2000 ), and WHOQOL-BREF prior to surgery and at 3 weeks follow-up. We will collect data on any complications occurring in the perioperative period till 3 weeks after surgery</description>

    <measure>Surgeon satisfaction with operative patient positioning</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction ratings with regard to comfort in performing decompression and fusion will be collected by the coordinator prior to the end of the surgery to ensure that the surgeon remains blinded to allocation. It will be measured through a questionnaire using a series of verbal analog scales where 0 is completely unsatisfied and 10 is completely satisfied, the surgeon's degree of satisfaction with patient positioning and ease or difficulty in performing the surgery.</description>

    <description>Hyperlordotic positioning will be achieved through pelvic pads positioned low on iliac crest to maximize lumbar hyperlordosis and increased hip flexion with as many pillows as tolerated at thighs and knees to allow for increased sacral slope. Regular position will involve the pelvic pads at above or iliac crest and without extra pillows at thighs and legs.</description>
