      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability, and potential clinical
      efficacy of JNJ 40411813 in schizophrenic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study of JNJ-40411813 in schizophrenic patients who are not
      currently receiving antipsychotic drug treatment (referred to as &quot;(sub) acute&quot; patients) and
      in patients who are currently taking antipsychotic drug treatment (referred to as &quot;stable&quot;
      patients). The study will consist of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will be open-label
      (patients will know the identity of study treatment), and (sub)acute schizophrenic patients
      will receive monotherapy (treatment with one drug) with JNJ-40411813. Part B will be
      double-blind (patient and study staff will not know the identity of study treatment) and will
      randomize (assign by chance) patients with stable but symptomatic schizophrenia to receive
      treatment with JNJ-40411813 or a placebo (treatment identical in appearance to JNJ-40411813
      but does not contain active drug) as add-on therapy to their currently prescribed
      antipsychotic medication. Parts A (JNJ-40411813 monotherapy) and B (JNJ-40411813 add-on
      therapy) will run simultaneously. Patients will take JNJ-40411813 and placebo capsules orally
      (by mouth) twice daily (bid) with a meal. Part A: Patients will take JNJ-40411813 50 mg (1
      capsule) bid up to 150 mg (3 capsules) bid for up to 12 weeks. Part B: Patients will take
      JNJ-40411813 50 mg bid or placebo bid for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the dose of JNJ-40411813
      may be increased up to 150 mg bid for 6 weeks, and patients assigned to placebo may take
      JNJ-40411813 50 mg bid to 150 mg bid for up to 10 weeks.
