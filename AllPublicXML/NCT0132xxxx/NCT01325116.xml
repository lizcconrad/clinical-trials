  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common presentation of heart attack
      constituting approximately 30% of all cases. Clinical guidelines around the world support the
      prolonged use of secondary preventative medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin,
      beta-blocker and angiotensin blockers with the highest recommendations. While in-hospital and
      discharge prescription rates are excellent, adherence to these essential life-saving
      medications is far less than ideal, even a few months following hospital discharge. The
      investigators plan to capitalize on the existing structure of the SMART-AMI project already
      underway in LHIN IV to undertake a randomized controlled trial evaluating a reminder sent on
      behalf of the interventional cardiologists, delivered by mail, at 1, 2, 5, 8, and 11-months
      post-discharge, reviewing the evidence for life-saving cardiac medications and urging
      long-term adherence to secondary preventative cardiac medications. This will be sent to the
      family physician and the patient, using audience-appropriate language. If the DERLA-STEMI
      project is accepted by physicians and patients, found to be both feasible and effective, then
      this simple and low-cost intervention will be studied in all patients with an abnormal
      coronary angiogram.

Specifically, we will assess whether patients are taking a statin, beta-blocker, angiotensin modifier (ACE or ARB), and aspirin at twelve months, and whether they are taking these plus a secondary antiplatelet (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) at three months.</description>

    <intervention_name>Educational Reminder</intervention_name>
    <description>Personalized letters sent via post to the patient and their family physician at one, five, eight, and eleven months after their angiogram, sent on behalf of the interventional cardiologist. The patient letter provides a review of the role of each of the cardiac medications and urges long-term adherence. The language in the patient letter is simplified to a grade 6 level; this letter was tested for understanding and acceptability amongst a series of Cardiology patients.At the same time, close examination of data from Ontario indicated large stepwise declines in adherence at 30 and 60 days post-STEMI. To address this, patients will be provided an additional postcard type reminder two months post-STEMI.</description>
