  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper airway resistance during sleep can present with a range of symptoms from simple snoring
      (SS) through to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Pharyngeal narrowing or collapse leads
      to reduction or cessation in airflow during sleep, and is associated with loud snoring.

      The investigators hypothesized that regular singing exercises could strengthen pharyngeal
      muscles and/or increase their resting tone, and lead to an improvement of symptoms and thus
      quality of life in patients with all forms of snoring.
