  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This crossover study with six treatment sessions is to evaluate the abuse potential of three
      doses of Sativex as compared to Marinol and placebo, in subjects with a history of
      recreational marijuana use.

      Subjects attended a two-session, randomized, double-blind, crossover qualification in which
      they received the positive control drug (Marinol 30 mg) and matching placebo 48 hours apart
      in a randomized fashion. To qualify, subjects must have discriminated between Marinol and
      placebo.

      Eligible subjects then went on to the main study divided into six treatment sessions each
      separated by 7-21 days.

      Serial pharmacodynamic evaluations were taken at each treatment session as well as occasional
      pharmacokinetic blood samples to verify proof of exposure. In addition, safety monitoring
      included regular assessments of vital signs, telemetry, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory
      tests and adverse events (AEs).

          -  Healthy male and female subjects, 19 to 45 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Current recreational marijuana users, defined as the use of smoked marijuana, hashish,
             or oral THC, at least once a week for the 3 months prior to screening and, on at least
             one occasion, four times in a given week in the 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Body mass index within the range of 19 to 30 kg/m2 inclusive and a minimum weight of
             at least 50 kg at screening.

          -  Free of any clinically significant abnormality, assessed at screening, on the basis of
             medical history, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and clinical
             laboratory tests, including haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and serology,
             as judged by the investigator or designee.

          -  A positive urine THC drug screen at screening and qualification, which was confirmed
             by quantitative analysis; the level must have been at least 50 ng of THC/mL.

          -  A negative urine drug screen for cocaine, opiates, amphetamine, and benzodiazepines
             upon admission to the screening, qualification session, or treatment sessions.
             Subjects who had a positive urine drug screen upon presentation to a study visit could
             have been rescheduled for another session at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  All female subjects were required to have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to the qualification session and to each
             drug treatment session.

          -  Subjects with reproductive potential could be entered into the study if they had been
             using and were willing to continue to use two methods of contraception for the
             duration of the study. These methods included male condom for men in addition to an
             oral contraceptive, contraceptive implant or injection, intrauterine device,
             diaphragm, or a contraceptive sponge for women. Adequate protection, as defined above,
             had to have been used for at least 1 month prior to screening for all, with the
             exception of oral contraceptives, which should have been used for at least 3 months
             prior to screening. These methods had to be continually used for 30 days after the end
             of the study. Subjects that had been surgically sterilized (tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, or vasectomy) or had been post-menopausal for at least 2 years (by
             history) were not considered to be of reproductive potential.

          -  Subjects had to pass a qualification session.

          -  Must have understood and provided written informed consent, prior to initiation of any
             protocol-specific procedures.

          -  Subjects were able to comply with study procedures.

          -  Negative breath alcohol test. Subjects who had a positive breath alcohol test could
             have been rescheduled at the discretion of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of drug or alcohol dependence (excluding nicotine and caffeine),
             including subjects who had ever been in a drug rehabilitation program.

          -  Clinically important impairment or dysfunction of any body system, including, but not
             limited to, the following: cardiovascular, haematological, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             renal, pulmonary, or neurological, as judged by the investigator or designee.

          -  Any known or suspected history (including family history) of schizophrenia or other
             psychotic illness. Presence or history of a psychiatric disorder, organic brain
             disorder, or seizure disorder that was deemed clinically significant by the
             investigator.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergy to cannabinoids, cannabis and/or its
             metabolites, to the study drug excipients, or to similar compounds (propylene glycol,
             ethanol, peppermint, and sesame oils) or allergic reactions to any other medication.

          -  Consumed caffeine-containing beverages in excess of 450 mg of caffeine (e.g. 5 cups of
             tea or 3 cups of regular coffee or 8 cans of cola) per day in the 6 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Consumed greater than 20 cigarettes per day.

          -  Treatment with another investigational or non-approved drug, within 4 weeks prior to
             the start of qualification session dosing (Day 1).

          -  Used prescription drugs (except oral contraceptives or sex hormone replacement),
             including smoked THC for medicinal purposes, within 14 days of the qualification
             session and for the duration of the study, unless in the opinion of the investigator
             (or designee), the medication received would not interfere with the study procedures
             or data integrity or compromise the safety of the subject.

          -  Used non-prescription drugs or natural health products other than acetaminophen up to
             2 g per day or vitamin or mineral supplements (including mega dose vitamin therapy),

             unless in the opinion of the investigator (or designee), the medication received would
             not interfere with the study procedures or data integrity or compromise the safety of
             the subject.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension at screening that was judged as clinically significant by
             the investigator (or designee).
