    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare outcomes of patients that have received
      care in medical intensive care units in a tertiary care facility with two different models;
      the traditional model including resident, pulmonary fellow and attending physician and a
      nontraditional model which has Nurse Practitioners as the direct care deliverer, a pulmonary
      fellow, and an attending.

      This will be a retrospective cohort study that is performed between two medical intensive
      care units (ICU). The goal is to compare outcomes of patients that have received care in
      medical intensive care units in a tertiary care facility with two different models; the
      traditional model including a resident, pulmonary fellow and attending and a nontraditional
      model which has Nurse Practitioners as the direct care deliverer, a pulmonary fellow, and an
      attending. Outcomes that will be measured include ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay
      after ICU discharge, ventilator days, daily spontaneous breathing trials, and daily awakening
      trials, as well as mortality in hospital and after discharge.
