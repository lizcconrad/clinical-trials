      Background:

      - Oxytocin, a substance produced mostly in the brain, plays a role in influencing social
      interactions and reactions to stress, and may be related to pain. Arginine vasopressin, a
      hormone that regulates water, sugar, and salt in the blood, influences hostile behaviors and
      reactions to stress, and may also be related to pain. Researchers are interested in
      investigating both substances and their relationship to pain in healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effects of oxytocin and arginine vasopressin on pain in healthy volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.

      Design:

        -  This study involves two 2-hour testing sessions held 1 day apart. Each session includes
           the administration of oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, or placebo (a nonactive
           substance), or no drug. The drugs and the placebo will be given by a nasal spray.

        -  At the first visit, participants will provide blood and saliva samples to measure
           hormone levels, and will be asked to fill out questionnaires about some psychological
           factors such as anxiety and empathy. Participants will then have an assessment of their
           sensitivity to pain, consisting of a brief electrical stimulation that lasts less than 1
           second. After the pain assessment, participants will receive oxytocin, arginine
           vasopressin, placebo, or no drug at all, and will be monitored to provide baseline
           information. Participants will then have another pain sensitivity test and will complete
           the questionnaires again, and provide another saliva sample.

        -  At the second visit, participants will provide another saliva sample; receive oxytocin,
           arginine vasopressin, placebo, or no drug at all; and have tests of pain sensitivity and
           a pain-relieving procedure. During the pain-relieving procedure, participants will
           receive brief, moderately painful electrical shocks on the back of the nondominant hand
           and a low-level electrical stimulation on the middle finger that counteracts or reduces
           the pain from the shocks. Participants will rate their pain perception at the end of
           each stimulation by using a visual scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum
           imaginable pain). The experiment ends with a final saliva collection and completion of
           the psychological questionnaires.

      Objective:

      It is well known that social and contextual cues and the whole atmosphere around the patient,
      such as words, attitudes, and providers behaviors, all contribute to evoke placebo responses.
      Moreover, an extensive literature investigating prosocial behaviors (e.g. ability to share
      another s feelings, imitation, mimicry) suggests that social modeling is critical in
      developing learning processes across species, including social influences on psychophysical
      aspects of pain. Only recently, it has been demonstrated that observing the beneficial
      effects in a demonstrator induces substantial placebo analgesic responses which are
      positively correlated with empathy. A crucial role in social behaviors is played by oxytocin
      (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), two neuropeptides, produced mostly in the hypothalamus
      and acting on certain brain regions whose function is associated with emotion perception
      (amygdale and nucleus accumbens), eye-gaze, trust and processing of positive and negative
      social cues. Since beliefs, trust and contextual cues are important elements of the
      clinicianpatient relationship and socially-induced placebo effects, it is reasonable to
      hypothesize that OXT and AVP may be one of the endogenous substances that trigger contextual
      and interpersonal placebo responses. By viewing interpersonal healing as a central causal
      process (or a set of related causal processes) within the domain of pain modulation, it is
      possible to probe the potential role for OXT and AVP in the modulation of a placebo response.
      In pursuit of this goal, we use a neuropharmacological intervention with OXT and AVP agonists
      in combination with a behavioral, brain imaging and genetic approach.

      Study population:

      Healthy men and women participants aging from 18 to 55 years.

      Design:

      We will investigate the role of oxytocinergic system in the processing of social cues by
      using a model of pain and interpersonal placebo analgesia already tested (9). The following
      drugs will be used: 1) oxytocin, 2) arginine vasopressin, and 3) placebo.

      Outcome measures:

      Primary outcomes are subjective pain reports (Experiment 1) and brain- and cortical -related
      responses (Experiments 2 and 3). Secondary measures include skin conductance response, heart
      rate, cortisol, subjective measures of empathy; trait and state anxiety measures; and
      functional pain-related genetic polymorphisms.
