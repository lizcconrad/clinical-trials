  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A group of 24 healthy volunteers receive one tablet of an association of levodopa 200 mg and
      benserazide 50 mg corresponding to two drug products: a test formulation (Evoser ®; Phoenix
      S.A.I.C. y F., Buenos Aires, Argentina) and a reference formulation (Madopar ®; Roche Pharma,
      Switzerland) to assess their relative bioavailability. After administration of each
      formulation 17 blood samples are taken and levodopa is measured by HPLC. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters (AUC, Tmax and Cmax) are compared.

    <time_frame>Blood samples are collected up to 6 hours after dosing. (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to comply with Argentine regulation for marketing approval this study includes 24 healthy volunteers to investigate whether the relative bioavailability of the test formulation met the regulatory criterion for the assumption of bioequivalence to the branded formulation. After dosing with each formulation, 17 blood samples are taken to measure plasma levodopa concentration by HPLC. With plasma concentration values, pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated and bioequivalence assessed with WinNonLin software.</description>
