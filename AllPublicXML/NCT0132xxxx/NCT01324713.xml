    <textblock>
      Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the
      current gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis and therapy monitoring. Like all
      quantitative tests, there is some variability in BMD results obtained when scanning a person
      more than once. As such, it is current clinical practice, based on the recommendation of the
      International Society for Clinical Densitometry, that each technologist perform a precision
      assessment. This approach consists of scanning 30 people twice; the data from which allow
      determination of what constitutes a real difference in BMD with 95% confidence. A precision
      assessment typically evaluates a specific clinic's population, using the age range and
      genders seen at that clinic. However men generally have larger, but often more arthritic,
      bones than women which may impact the precision results. Therefore, it is possible that
      gender-specific precision values should be used in clinical practice, however this issue has
      never been investigated.

    <description>The primary analysis will compare DXA BMD precision (mean square error/variance) in males and females, pooled across technicians, using the two-sample F-test for equality of variances. Separate analyses will also be performed for each technician. In addition, due to the sensitivity of the F-test to the normality assumption, a secondary analysis will perform the same comparisons using Levene's test. A nominal two-sided p-value of 0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant.</description>
