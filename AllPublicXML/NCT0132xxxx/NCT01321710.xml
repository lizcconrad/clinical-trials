    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a behavioral intervention to minimize sleep disruption
      and fatigue in new mothers after the birth of their first infant. This study also tests
      whether an acetaminophen intervention at the time of an infant's 2-month immunization series
      improves infant and maternal sleep.

    <measure>Maternal Sleep Quantity (Objective)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month postpartum (approximately)</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal sleep quantity is defined as total night-time sleep in hours as measured by wrist actigraphy over 3 nights.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal Sleep Quality (Objective)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month postpartum (approximately)</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal sleep quality is defined as sleep efficiency (percent sleep per time in bed averaged across 3 nights) as measured by wrist actigraphy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Infant Sleep Quantity (Objective)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours before and 24 hours after immunizations at approximately 2 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>Change in infant sleep quantity is defined as the difference between the number of hours slept in the 24 hours prior to immunization and the the number of hours slept after immunization (positive numbers indicate more sleep following immunization). Infant sleep was measured by ankle actigraphy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal Sleep Disturbance (Subjective)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month postpartum (approximately)</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal sleep disturbance is measured by the total score on the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS). The GSDS is a self-report questionnaire that measures perceived sleep disturbance in the past week. GSDS scores range from 0 to 147, with higher scores indicating more sleep disturbance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal Well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month postpartum (approximately)</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal well-being was measured by the total score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D measures depressive symptoms in the past week. CES-D scores can range 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more symptoms of depression.</description>
