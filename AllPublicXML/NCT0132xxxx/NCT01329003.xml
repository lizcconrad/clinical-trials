  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silicosis is well-known occupational disease caused by free crystalline silica (silicon
      dioxide) and is marked by inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. There are cumulative evidences
      that exposure to Caesar stone (quartz surface products that manufactured from up to 93%
      quartz, polymer resins and pigments) is particularly dangerous to exposed workers.

      Goals: To examine correlation between disease and exposure to Caesar stone and genetic
      differences regarding genes involved in oxidative stress to understand Genetic susceptibility

      It is a sub-study of &quot;DNA-damage biomarkers to monitor and early detect health impairment in
      workers exposed to Silica (Caesar Stone)&quot; study. Study participants would be recruited during
      two years of the study. They will be asked to come to a single visit at Pulmonary Laboratory
      of Tel Aviv Medical Center. During the meeting, participants will be given a precise
      explanation about the tests they will perform and after signing the informed consent will
      perform following tests:

        1. Induced sputum (IS)

        2. Exhaled Breath Condensate

        3. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)

        4. Participants will be asked to complete occupational questionnaire

      Genetic studies (DNA) will be done from peripheral blood samples (20 ml) to study differences
      in Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) gene sequencing between participants with evidences of clinically
      definite silicosis according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
      (ATS/ERS) guidelines and participants without evidences of clinically definite silicosis.DNA
      samples will be obtained and coded in the same day of a participant visit and after
      collecting reasonable amount of samples examination of genes of interest will be
      done.Analysis of data will be done after the completion of data collection and laboratory
      tests.

      Each sample will be given specific code to protect confidentiality of participants. Blood
      samples, test results and the code key will be kept in different places and only few research
      staff will have the accessibility to genetic information. In any case employers or any other
      persons that not included in research staff will not have any accessibility to this
      information. In this study genetic analysis is not connected to gender, nationality or any
      other social feature.
