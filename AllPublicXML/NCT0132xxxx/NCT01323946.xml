             entering the study.

          -  Parent/LAR access to a consistent means of telephone contact, land line or mobile, but
             NOT a pay phone or other multiple-user device.

          -  Subjects who are likely to reside in the vicinity of the study centre for the duration
             of the study. In studies using the home-based model for vaccination and follow-up,
             subjects who are likely to remain in the vicinity of the area where they were
             recruited.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s)
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the first vaccine dose.

          -  Planned administration of any vaccine 30 days prior and 21 days after any study
             vaccine administration.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccines such as egg protein or thiomersal.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory tests.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             prior to the enrolment in this study, or planned administration during the study
             period.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the subject unfit for
