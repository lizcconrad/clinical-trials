  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medications that lower blood pressure and cholesterol are known to improve the shape and
      function of our blood vessels. These improvements include a reduction in the thickness of the
      wall of the carotid artery (the main artery that runs up the neck to supply the brain) and a
      reduction in the stiffness of arteries generally including the main central artery -the
      aorta. Such medications are in the polypill (the Red Heart Pill) that is being used in the
      UMPIRE Study. In UMPIRE, patients' reported adherence to taking the single, once daily
      polypill is being compared to adherence to medications taken as separate tablets (usual
      care).The aim of the PESCA sub-study is to see whether or not the polypill differs from
      'usual care' in its direct effects on blood vessels as shown by ultrasound examination of the
      carotid arteries and assessment of central (aortic) blood pressure.

    <textblock>
      PESCA is a substudy of the UMPIRE clinical trial which is evaluating a 'polypill' treatment
      strategy for subjects with established cardiovascular disease or at high risk. All PESCA
      subjects will have already been recruited to UMPIRE and randomised to taking either a single
      'polypill' (comprising low dose aspirin, a cholesterol-lowering statin, and one of two blood
      pressure lowering medicines) or their usual treatment consisting of similar medication in
      more than one separate tablets.

      PESCA will evaluate whether: 1) progression of atherosclerosis (fatty deposits which narrow
      the arteries and impair blood flow to vital organs); and 2) central systolic blood pressure
      (the pressure in the body's main artery, the aorta, when the heart pumps out blood), are
      reduced in 'polypill' recipients compared to those who continue their usual treatment.
      Atherosclerosis and central blood pressure are both strongly associated with increased risk
      of heart attacks and stroke. Atherosclerosis will be assessed by ultrasound scanning of the
      carotid (neck) arteries to look at thickness of the artery walls (carotid intima media
      thickness)and plaques(fatty deposits). Direct measurement of central blood pressure is
      impractical but it will be estimated using a computerised &quot;pulsecor&quot; device. This uses an
      inflatable cuff on the arm but provides a detailed recording of the pressure wave as the cuff
      is deflated which enables &quot;pulsecor&quot; to calculate central blood pressure. Results from both
      ultrasound and blood pressure investigations will be reviewed by investigators who do not
      know whether the subjects have been randomised to the polypill or their usual treatment.

      PESCA assessments will be conducted at 2 visits:baseline (as soon as possible after
      recruitment to the UMPIRE study); and at the end of both studies (which will coincide).

      Parallel studies are being undertaken in the three European sites (UK, Eire and Netherlands)
      participating in the UMPIRE trial with each site aiming to recruit 300 participants.

    <description>The polypill will be taken once/day in the form of a hard capsule, to be taken orally. There are two versions of the polypill (Red Heart Pill):
Version 1 contains aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, Lisinopril 10mg and Atenolol 50mg; Version 2 contains aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, Lisinopril 10mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg.
Red Heart Pill Version 1 and Red Heart Pill Version 2. In general, participants with a history of coronary heart disease will be given version 1, and those with a history of stroke or cerebrovascular disease will be given version 2.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients must meet the inclusion criteria for the UMPIRE trial, and be consented to take
        part in the PESCA sub-study.

        Inclusion criteria

        Individuals are eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria are satisfied:

        Adults (≥ 18 years) The participant is able to give informed consent. Established
        atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or high cardiovascular risk, defined as;

          -  History of coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina
             pectoris, or coronary revascularisation procedure), or

          -  History of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic
             attack), or

          -  History of peripheral vascular disease (peripheral revascularisation procedure or
             amputation due to vascular disease), or

          -  For individuals without established cardiovascular disease, a calculated 5 year CVD
             risk of 15% or greater (calculated using the 1991 Anderson Framingham risk equation
             with adjustments as defined by the New Zealand Guidelines Group recommendations) The
             trial Investigator considers that each of the polypill components are indicated at the
             doses in the Red Heart Pill The trial Investigator is unsure as to whether a
             polypill-based strategy or usual care is better.

        Exclusion criteria

        Individuals will NOT be eligible if one or more of the following criteria are satisfied:

          -  Contraindication to any of the components of the polypill (e.g. known intolerance to
             aspirin, statins, or ACE inhibitors; pregnancy or likely to become pregnant or
             breastfeeding women during the treatment period).

          -  The treating doctor considers that changing a participant's cardiovascular medications
             would put the participant at risk (e.g. symptomatic heart failure, high dose β-blocker
             required to manage angina or for rate control in atrial fibrillation, accelerated
             hypertension, severe renal insufficiency, a history of severe resistant hypertension).

        Other potential reasons for exclusion include:

          -  Known situation where medication regimen might be altered for a significant length of
             time, e.g. current acute cardiovascular event, planned coronary bypass graft
             operation.

          -  Unlikely to complete the trial (e.g. life-threatening condition other than
             cardiovascular disease) or adhere to the trial procedures or attend study visits (e.g.
             major psychiatric condition, dementia).
