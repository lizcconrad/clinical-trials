      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and feasibility of low dose LPS
      administration to a small subset of humans in preparation for a larger USDA funded study
      examining what is the lowest effective dose of EPA + DHA (300, 600, 900 and 1,800 mg/day
      delivered as fish oil supplements) that significantly attenuates the inflammatory response
      the investigators wish to examine the effects of an endotoxemia model for inducing
      inflammation. Based on previous research, low dose LPS administration affects metabolism in
      humans with only minimal clinical effects (such as &quot;flu&quot; like illness). Therefore, each of
      the six subjects included in this small pilot study will receive a low dose of LPS and
      placebo in order to learn more about the metabolic changes that occur during administration
      and inflammation. The investigators hypothesis that LPS administration will elicit only
      minimal clinical effects (such as &quot;flu&quot; like illness) when compared to placebo (saline--water
      with the same amount of salt as in your blood).

    <description>LPS or placebo (salineâ€”salt water) will be injected (at approximately 7:30 am) in this catheter by a trained GCRC staff member involved with this study. Participants will not be told if they have received the drug or placebo. The LPS is a sterile solution of protein-free endotoxin which will be injected at a dose of 0.6 ng/kg body weight. Blood samples will be collected from a venous catheter for the first 12 hours and by venipuncture thereafter. Subjects will be continuously monitored by trained nursing staff for blood pressure (q 15 minutes) and body temperature (q 30 minutes), and the study will have physician oversight.</description>
