    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a treatment with TMC435 in
      combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in patients who did not clear their
      hepatitis C infection with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone within a previous trial
      conducted by Tibotec, or who participated in Tibotec trials in which antivirals directed
      against hepatitis C virus (HCV) were evaluated for short periods of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a roll over trial of TMC435 for patients with genotype-1 HCV infection who
      participated in the control (placebo; substance containing no active medication) group of a
      TMC435 trial or who received a treatment for up to 14 days with antivirals directed against
      HCV in a previous Tibotec trial. Patients in this study will receive TMC435 in combination
      with peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) and ribavirin (Copegus) followed by peginterferon
      alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. The total treatment duration will be 24 or 48 weeks, depending
      on how the patients respond to treatment and which was their previous response to
      peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. The study doctor will inform each patient about
      how to take their study medication and when they should stop taking it. After a patient stops
      taking study medication, they will contiue to come to the doctor's office for study visits
      until 24 weeks (in some cases up to 48 weeks) after end of treatment. The total duration of
      the study is 78 weeks (including screening). Patients will be monitored for safety throughout
      the study. Study assessments at each visit may include but are not limited to: blood and
      urine collection for testing, electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments (a measurement of the
      electrical activity of the heart) and physical examinations. TMC435 will be taken as an oral
      capsule of 150 mg once per day. Peginterferon (Pegasys) will be given as an injection of 180
      µg once each week. Ribavirin will be taken as tablets (Copegus) twice each day and the dose
      will depend on patient's body weight.
