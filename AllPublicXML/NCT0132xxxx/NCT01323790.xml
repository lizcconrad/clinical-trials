    <measure>Response (Responder/Non-responder) to Study Drug During Weeks 1 to 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Responder was defined as having at least 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs)/week with at least 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of the 12 treatment weeks and 3 out of the last 4 treatment weeks during the double-blind treatment period. An SBM is a bowel movement occurring 24 hours or more since the last use of rescue medication.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Degree of Straining</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>A single-item straining question was asked via the eDiary: &quot;How much did you strain during your bowel movement?&quot; Patients responded on a 5 point Likert scale: 1=Not at all; 2=A little bit; 3=A moderate amount; 4=A great deal; 5=An extreme amount. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Stool Consistency (Bristol Stool Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients rated stool consistency through completion of the BSS after each BM. The 7 stool types are: 1. Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass); 2. Sausage-shaped, but lumpy; 3. Like sausage, but with cracks on its surface; 4. Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; 5. Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily); 6. Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; 7. Watery, no solid pieces. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percent Numbers of Days With a CSBM (Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>A single-item question on the completeness of evacuation, developed and validated through 1:1 interviews with OIC patients, was asked via the eDiary: &quot;Did you feel like your bowels were completely empty after the bowel movement?&quot; Patients provided a yes or a no response. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Spontaneous Bowel Movements/Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of spontaneous bowel movements/week was determined from the patient's eDiary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time (in Hours) to First Post-dose Laxation Without the Use of Rescue Laxatives Within the Previous 24 Hours in the Laxative Inadequate Response (LIR) Subgroup</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first post-dose laxation without the use of rescue laxatives within the last 24 hours was calculated in hours as: Date/Time of first post-dose laxation without rescue - First dose date/time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms Questionnaire (PAC-SYM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The PAC-SYM questionnaire is a 12-item questionnaire that evaluates the severity of symptoms of constipation in 3 domains (stool, rectal, and abdominal symptoms) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe) in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items (ie, symptoms). The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'absent' for each item) to 4 (response is 'very severe' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) Satisfaction Domain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The PAC-QOL scale is a 28-item self-report instrument designed to evaluate the burden of constipation on patients' everyday functioning and well-being in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The instrument can be used to generate an overall score, but is also reported to assess 4 specific constipation-related domains including: 1) Worries and concerns (11 items), 2) Physical discomfort (4 items), 3) Psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and 4) Satisfaction (5 items). Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items. The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'not at all' for each item) to 4 (response is 'extremely' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Baseline laxative response status</title>
          <description>Laxative response status was determined at the screening visit (Visit 1) based on the Baseline Laxative Response Status Questionnaire. Patients were classified as: Laxative Inadequate Responder (LIR: patients who reported moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms in at least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains); Laxative Adequate Responder (LAR: patients who reported no symptoms or only mild symptoms); and Laxative Unknown Responder (LUR: patients who had not taken laxatives over the previous 2 weeks or who had taken 1 or more laxative classes on &lt;4 days over the previous 2 weeks).</description>

        <description>Patients rated stool consistency through completion of the BSS after each BM. The 7 stool types are: 1. Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass); 2. Sausage-shaped, but lumpy; 3. Like sausage, but with cracks on its surface; 4. Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; 5. Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily); 6. Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; 7. Watery, no solid pieces. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms Questionnaire (PAC-SYM)</title>
        <description>The PAC-SYM questionnaire is a 12-item questionnaire that evaluates the severity of symptoms of constipation in 3 domains (stool, rectal, and abdominal symptoms) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe) in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items (ie, symptoms). The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'absent' for each item) to 4 (response is 'very severe' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis set included all randomized patients who had evaluable data at baseline and post-baseline, with the exception of patients who randomized multiple times at different centers. MMRM analysis includes all patients with baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment, while the Ns at Week 12 reflect patients providing data at Week 12.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) Satisfaction Domain</title>
        <description>The PAC-QOL scale is a 28-item self-report instrument designed to evaluate the burden of constipation on patients’ everyday functioning and well-being in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The instrument can be used to generate an overall score, but is also reported to assess 4 specific constipation-related domains including: 1) Worries and concerns (11 items), 2) Physical discomfort (4 items), 3) Psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and 4) Satisfaction (5 items). Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items. The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'not at all' for each item) to 4 (response is 'extremely' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis set included all randomized patients who had evaluable data at baseline and post-baseline, with the exception of patients who randomized multiple times at different centers. MMRM analysis includes all patients with baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment, while the Ns at Week 12 reflect patients providing data at Week 12.</population>
