  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the change in Tear Osmolarity during the course of
      the day to support clinical diagnosis of aqueous deficiency or meibomian gland disease and
      differentiate between the two forms of dry eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The premise of this study is that dry eye disease, specifically tear osmolarity, changes
      during the course of the day based on the etiology of the dry eye and that aqueous-deficiency
      dry eye will worsen during the course of the day while meibomian gland deficiency will
      stabilize or possibly even improve during the course of the day.
