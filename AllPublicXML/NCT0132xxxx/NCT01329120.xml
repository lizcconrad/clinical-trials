  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of institutions have reported their early results with minimally invasive
      repair of pectus excavatum and open repair of pectus carinatum, but only few have addressed
      the outcomes relevant to the concerns of the patients and even fewer have reported long-term
      results following bar removal. Even fewer studies have investigated the prevalence and
      characteristics of long term persistent post-surgical pain following surgical repair of
      pectus deformities. The reasons as to why acute postoperative pain in some patients persists
      and becomes chronic whereas in others the pain dies down shortly after wound healing are
      largely unknown, and why some patients complain of loss of sensibility in wide regions of
      their chest following surgery also remains unclear.

    <description>Persistent post-surgical pain is in this study defined as pain developing after pectus surgery and lasting for at least 4 months. Other causes of pain (e.g. infection and malignancy) and pain continuing from a pre-existing pain problem will be excluded.
Persistent post-surgical pain present at time of the study will be assessed by means of a specifically developed questionnaire including items from the Danish translation of the Brief Pain inventory (BPI-short form) and the Danish translation of the short version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQol) will be assessed by means of a validated Danish version of the Short-Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 4 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with the result of the deformity repair and the perceived impact of the correction on health-related quality of life is assessed by means of questions about the emotional and practical consequences of, and satisfaction with pectus repair.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aesthetic outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 4 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess the surgical outcome following pectus repair in terms of aesthetic outcome more objectively, patients are encouraged to upload or e-mail a digital frontal image of their chests. Two thoracic surgeons, including the operating surgeon, and a research secretary are instructed to evaluate the breast symmetry, scars on the chest, and the overall cosmetic result of the repair.</description>
