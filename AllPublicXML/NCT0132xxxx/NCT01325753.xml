  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of cryotherapy (cryoablation [CA]) in
      treating patients with lung cancer. Cryotherapy kills cancer cells by freezing them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the initial safety of the CA for lung tumors less than or equal to 3.5 cm in size
      including acute toxicity (30 days).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate local control.

      II. To assess physical function for this cohort of patients.

      III. To evaluate the impact of treatment on generic and disease-specific quality of life.

      IV. To obtain pilot data useful for the design of a subsequent phase II or randomized phase
      II trial.

      V. Evaluate changes in pulmonary function at 3 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo computed tomography (CT)-guided CA

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24,
      36, 48, and 60 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition metastatic
             carcinoma or sarcoma involving the lungs or pleura.

          -  Pathologic diagnosis of stage 4 cancer prior to enrollment by biopsy or on imaging
             with known (biopsied) primary disease

          -  The target lesion is determined (by CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] images) to
             be in a location where cryoablation is technically achievable based on the proximity
             of adjacent organs and structures

          -  Maximum number of lesions per patient will be 5 total (a maximum of 3 on either the
             right or left side and 2 lesions on the respective contralateral side)

          -  Of these, any lesion not treated with cryoablation will be planned to be treated with
             radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation, such that all known active pulmonary disease
             is planned to be treated with a definitive local therapy

          -  If treatment of both lungs is to occur by cryoablation, these treatments must be
             separated by at least one week

          -  The lesion(s) treated with cryoablation may be intrapulmonary or pleural and must be
             =&lt; 3.5 cm in greatest dimension

          -  All patients are required to have been evaluated either in consultation with a
             radiation oncologist or at least in a multi-disciplinary tumor conference to ensure
             that all local therapy options are appropriately considered for each patient

          -  Performance Status 0-2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]); Karnofsky
             Performance Scale &gt;= 60

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Clinically suitable for cryoablation procedure as determined by the treating physician

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 within 60 days prior to study registration

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000 within 21 days prior to study registration

          -  A signed study specific consent form is required

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary lung cancer

          -  Unable to lie flat or has respiratory distress at rest

          -  Uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorders

          -  Evidence of active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection

          -  Pregnant, nursing or wishes to become pregnant during the study

          -  Debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude giving informed
             consent or receiving optimal treatment or follow up

          -  Currently participating in other experimental studies that could affect the primary
             endpoint
