      This clinical trial studies individualized temozolomide (TMZ) in treating patients with stage
      IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as TMZ, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving TMZ at different times, which are determined individually
      for each patient based on the phase (biorhythm) of the immune system response against the
      tumor may allow for a better drug response and may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the clinical activity of timed administration of TMZ therapy
      in patients with stage IV melanoma who have or have not received prior chemotherapy for
      metastatic melanoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the toxicity profile of timed
      administration of TMZ therapy in patients with stage IV melanoma who have or have not
      received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. II. To evaluate the parameters of
      immune homeostasis that are associated with the anti-tumor immune biorhythm in order to gain
      insight into the mechanism of the observed clinical and immunological effect of timed TMZ
      chemotherapy. III. To evaluate the impact of timed TMZ chemotherapy on immune biomarkers and
      the anti-tumor immune biorhythms. OUTLINE: Prior to initiation of therapy patients will
      undergo a period of immunologic monitoring to analyze the bioperiodicity of their anti-tumor
      immune response. Patients with an established biorhythm will receive TMZ orally (PO) starting
      on the recommended day for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 21-42 days (based on the
      established biorhythm) until of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      without an established biorhythm are given the option to go off study or receive TMZ PO on
      days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 2 years.
