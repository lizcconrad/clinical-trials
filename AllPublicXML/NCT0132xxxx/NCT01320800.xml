  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 5-year study addresses the unmet needs of adolescents with social phobia through the
      testing of a 12-week cognitive-behavioral, school-based group intervention delivered by
      trained school counselors compared to a nonspecific school counseling program. A secondary
      goal is to provide further examination of the efficacy of the CBT program delivered by school
      counselors as compared to the same program delivered by psychologists.

      The investigators have tested SASS, a school-based group CBT intervention for social phobia,
      and found it to be effective when delivered by psychologists (Masia Warner et al., 2005;
      Masia Warner et al., 2007). The proposed dissemination study extends this work through a
      controlled trial of SASS delivered by school counselors. The investigators will randomize 126
      adolescents with social anxiety disorder, ages 14 through 17, to one of 3 treatments: 1) SASS
      delivered by school counselors (SC-SASS), 2) SASS delivered by psychologists (Expert-SASS),
      or 3) a manualized adolescent group counseling program specifically designed for school
      counselors, called Skills for Living (SFL). A comprehensive evaluation will include
      diagnosis, illness severity, scale ratings of social anxiety and depression, clinical global
      improvement, overall functioning, and school-relevant indices of function. Outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline, mid-point (after 6 weeks of intervention), post-treatment, and 6 months
      following intervention completion.
