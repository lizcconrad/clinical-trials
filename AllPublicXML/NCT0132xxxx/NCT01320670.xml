  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy, defined as recurrent, unprovoked seizures, is a common condition, affecting 0.5-1%
      of the general population. People with uncontrolled epilepsy suffer poor health and increased
      mortality due to their condition. They frequently experience social stigma and are
      socioeconomically disadvantaged. It is therefore imperative to help them gain control of
      their seizures as quickly as possible. A wide range of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has become
      available to treat people with epilepsy. However, despite maximal therapy, approximately
      20-40% show pharmacoresistance (PR) and thus continue to have seizures.

      We do not understand why a significant proportion of people with epilepsy have PR. For any
      given patient presenting with a first unprovoked seizure, we are unable to predict PR at the
      time of presentation. At least 2 different AEDs must be tried at maximum doses for a year
      before we can diagnose PR. At this point, surgical therapies become an increasingly urgent
      consideration.

      Retrospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in the chronic stages of epilepsy have
      shown that patients with PR are more likely to have focal structural lesions in the brain,
      and in particular to have signs of damage to the hippocampi. For example, there are
      retrospective data suggesting that a decreased hippocampal N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine
      ratio (measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]) and hippocampal atrophy (determined
      by hippocampal volumetry) correlate with PR. However, it is not clear whether these findings
      reflect the underlying pathophysiology of PR, or simply reflect the effects of chronic
      seizures and chronic drug treatment on the brain.

      The First Seizure Clinic at the Halifax Infirmary represents a unique opportunity for
      prospective, longitudinal studies of patients who present with a first seizure or with newly
      diagnosed epilepsy. In these patients, advanced neuroimaging techniques at presentation might
      show changes that truly reflect the underlying pathophysiology of PR, rather than changes
      that develop as a consequence of prolonged seizures and drug treatment. Neuroimaging
      follow-up might help us to understand the pathophysiologic changes that accompany the
      evolution of PR. Ultimately, it is our hope to combine neuroimaging features and clinical
      features of patients with PR in a predictive model that would help us to predict PR at
      presentation.
