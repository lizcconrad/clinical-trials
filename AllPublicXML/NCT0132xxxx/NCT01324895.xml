  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of prokinetics versus antibiotics
      versus a combination of antibiotics plus prokinetics in the eradication of Small-Intestinal
      Bacterial Over-Growth Syndrome (SIBO) in those with and without a positive D-xylose Breath
      Test.

      Hypothesis: Patients with SIBO treated with a combination of prokinetics and in particular
      octreotide and antibiotics will have reduced recurrence rates of SIBO than either therapy
      given alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We want to determine whether treatment with prokinetics such as Octreotide, Azithromycin,
      Erythromycin or Tegaserod alone, versus antibiotics alone, or combination of antibiotics plus
      prokinetics results in symptomatic improvement in patients with SIBO (defined by a positive D
      xylose Breath test).
