    <textblock>
      Compound HP802-247 comprises two topical sprays, administered sequentially right after
      another; these deliver a suspension of fibroblasts and keratinocytes to the wound surface.
      HP802-247 is the subject of a larger Phase 2 multi-center trial for treating venous leg
      ulcers. The present study will enroll up to five patients who are suffering venous leg
      ulcers, have failed a prolonged course of standard wound therapy and one or more advanced
      technologies, but who would not qualify for the Phase 2 study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic (duration greater than six months) open wound that has been diagnosed as a
