    <textblock>
      The drug being studied is Trastuzumab, a medicine that is used to slow or stop the growth of
      cancerous tumors that are HER-2 positive. Patients are being asked to participate in this
      study because they have been diagnosed with having tumor cells in their spinal fluid. This
      study will investigate the safety and effects of this drug when given directly into the
      spinal fluid.

      Phase I/II Dose Escalation Trial to Assess Safety of Intrathecal Trastuzumab for the
      Treatment of Leptomeningeal Metastases in HER2 Positive Breast Cancer The purpose of this
      research study is to determine a safe dose of the drug Trastuzumab and then determine how
      effective this treatment is.

      Phase I: Patients will be treated in cohorts of 3-6 based on standard phase I dose escalation
      parameters requiring 0/3 or 1/6 patients per cohort to have a DLT before dose escalation.
      Dosing is as follows: Cohort 1-10 mg IT, cohort 2-20 mg IT, cohort 3-30 mg IT and cohort 4-40
      mg IT. Patients will be treated twice a week for 4 weeks, then once a week for 4 weeks, and
      then every 2 weeks. Toxicity for DLT will be assessed during first 4 weeks of treatment.
      Phase II: Patients will be treated with the MTD or maximal defined dose. Patients will be
      treated twice a week for 4 weeks, then once a week for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks.

    <description>The initial phase of this study will be a dose escalation trial of 3-6 patients per each dose level. Dose escalation will occur until the MTD or the maximal defined dose (MDD) (40 mg) is reached. The starting dose will be 10 mg for cohort 1, 20 mg for cohort 2, 30 mg for cohort 3 and 40 mg for cohort 4. Patients will be treated twice a week for 4 weeks, then once a week for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks. The starting dose is based on the safety of this dose and higher doses as reported in the literature. The MTD or MDD will be used for phase II.</description>

PK modeling of trastuzumab concentration-time data from 7 patients that were administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg had in a mean halflife of 5.8 days (range 1-32 days).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

          -  HER2 positive (IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive) breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal
             metastases by MRI or CSF (if MRI is negative).

             but will not preclude patients from entering the trial (pathology report is sufficient
             for registration).

          -  Patients can have concomitant brain metastases as long as they do not require active
             treatment or have been treated.

          -  Normal renal (creatinine &lt; 1.5 ULN), liver (bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, transaminases &lt; 3.0
             x ULN, except in known hepatic metastasis, wherein may be &lt; 5 x ULN) and blood counts
             (WBC &gt; 3.0, Neutrophils &gt; 1500, platelets &gt;100 000, Hemoglobin &gt; 10).

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Cannot be on systemic agents (chemotherapy) that have CNS penetration unless they
             develop leptomeningeal metastases while on these agent(s) and have controlled systemic
             disease. May continue on IV trastuzumab, lapatinib or hormonal agents if controlling
             systemic disease and developed LM while on therapy. Patients requiring systemic
             chemotherapy are eligible but will not be able to start treatment until after the
             first assessment by imaging and cytology.

          -  Patients may need a CSF flow study at the discretion of the treating principal
             investigator. If a spinal block is seen by CSF flow study or MRI, it will need local
             RT prior to treatment. Concurrent radiation is not allowed.

          -  Patients should be &gt; 2 weeks from RT treatment and all effects of treatment should
             have resolved

          -  No limit on prior systemic or IT therapies.

          -  CSF sampling to document LM if not documented on MRI.

             effective contraception while on study.

          -  Women may not be pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Ability to sign an informed consent; can be signed by family member or health care
             proxy. Informed consent must be done prior to registration on study.

          -  All patients must have given signed, informed consent prior to registration on study.

          -  No known hypersensitivity to trial medications Note: The eligibility criteria listed
             above are interpreted literally and cannot be waived.
