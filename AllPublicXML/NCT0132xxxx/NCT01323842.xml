  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal colic is a common (1300 visits per year at our institution) and painful condition
      caused by stones in the kidney and ureter, and can be mimicked by life threatening conditions
      such as a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This can create clinical uncertainty.
      Emergency department targeted ultrasound (EDTU) is performed by an emergency physician at the
      patient's bedside, and has been shown to be accurate, safe, and efficient. We have shown that
      EDTU can accurately identify hydronephrosis, which is a predictor of complications of kidney
      stones. A normal formal ultrasound (US) predicts an uncomplicated clinical course. We will
      assess the accuracy of EDTU for the diagnosis of hydronephrosis, and when normal, whether
      patients can be safely discharged.
