  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the absorption and bioavailability of codeine in
      relation to postnatal (PNA) and postconceptional (PCA) age; determine the parent drug
      (codeine), its active metabolites, their formation rates and their ratios in relation with
      PCA and PNA; and identify relevant genetic polymorphisms of opioid metabolism in the study
      population and their potential relationship to the biodisposition and pharmacodynamic effects
      of codeine. The study population is intubated and mechanically ventilated infants equal to or
      greater than 26 weeks gestational age at birth and less than 4 weeks postnatal age.

      This proposal has its origins in a larger initiative to elucidate the pharmacological basis
      for the interindividual differences observed in opioid responsiveness. Gaps in our knowledge
      related to opioid disposition in newborns need to be addressed to complete the design of the
      required overarching initiative in which age could be treated as a continuous variable within
      a context of PK, PD and PG determinants.This proposal is designed to generate preliminary
      data that addresses two issues. First, can newborns absorb enterally administered codeine and
      is this ability determined by PCA or PNA age? The second relates to the ability of newborn
      infants to catalyze those reactions required to metabolically activate both codeine and
      morphine. The latter will also be evaluated within the context of PCA versus PNA age.

      These data will not only fill an information gap that must be addressed before the larger
      initiative moves forward, but they also provide a platform for serious study of the ontogeny
      of certain pharmacokinetic processes that may prove critical to our understanding of newborn
      drug disposition. In this way, codeine can provide important insights concerning the ontogeny
      of drug disposition and permit the determination of the relative importance of PCA versus PNA
      ages to the functional expression of these processes.
