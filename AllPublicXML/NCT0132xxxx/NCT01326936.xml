  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to develop a comprehensive, computer-based education program for primary
      care physicians that will improve their skills in structured substance abuse screening, brief
      interventions, and referral and treatment (SBIRT). The investigators will develop two online
      education programs based on virtual patient (VP) technology. One program will include five
      typical, interactive, problem-solving VPs and the second will include five identical VPs
      except that two VPs will have been &quot;worked&quot; by substance abuse experts and presented as case
      studies. The remaining three VPs will be &quot;unworked&quot; (typical VPs). The investigators
      hypothesize that both education programs will significantly improve educational outcomes,
      compared to no training, as measured by a validated survey tool. A secondary hypothesis is
      that physicians using the &quot;worked&quot; (guided learning) program will achieve similar educational
      results as those using the typical VP approach, but will require less training time.
