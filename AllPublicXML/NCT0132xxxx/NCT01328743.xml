  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to examine the effects of a brief counseling intervention
      for heavy drinking HIV-infected men who have sex with men compared to HIV care as usual. The
      study tests the hypothesis that brief counseling will lower drinking in these patients and
      that reductions in drinking will be associated with better HIV-related outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial in which 224 heavy drinking men who have sex with
      men (MSM), who receive their HIV primary care at Fenway Health in Boston, are randomly
      assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus a brief intervention to reduce alcohol use
      (TAU-BI). TAU-BI will be based in Motivational Interviewing and include personalized feedback
      tailored to an HIV-infected MSM population. Follow-ups will occur at 3, 6, and 12 months. The
      first primary aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that TAU-BI, compared to TAU, will
      result in reduced alcohol consumption over a 12-month follow-up period as indicated by: (1) a
      lower number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week; (2) a lower number of drinking days
      within each follow-up period; and (3) a lower number of heavy drinking days within each
      follow-up period. The second primary aim is to test the hypothesis that greater reductions in
      alcohol use will be associated with (1) greater adherence to HIV medication regimens; (2)
      less engagement in high-risk sexual behavior that could result in HIV transmission; (3) lower
      plasma HIV RNA levels (viral load) (CD4 cell counts will be a secondary outcome in this
      sub-aim); (4) improved liver function tests; and (5) improved neurocognitive function.
