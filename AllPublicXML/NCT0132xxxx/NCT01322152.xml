      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of single-week
      regimen of irinotecan plus capecitabine in the first-line or second-line treatment of
      advanced colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irinotecan and capecitabine are approved to be the effective drugs for the advanced
      colorectal cancer patients. However, the combination of these two drugs are not regularly
      recommended due to the severe diarrhea as the most common adverse event.This study was
      designed to explore whether the single-week regimen of irinotecan plus capecitabine improves
      efficacy and does not increase the toxicity in advanced colorectal cancer patients in China.
