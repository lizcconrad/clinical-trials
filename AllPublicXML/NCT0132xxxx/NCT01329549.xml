  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I, open label dose escalation study will investigate the addition of BIBF 1120 to
      treatment with the combination of carboplatin and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) in
      patients with advanced, platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma
      or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients will be treated with BIBF 1120 together with
      carboplatin and PLD in up to 6-9 repeated 28 days treatment courses until disease progression
      is observed.
