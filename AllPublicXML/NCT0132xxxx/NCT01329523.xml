    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if insulin-like growth factors (IGF) play a role in
      the development of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study will compare
      results from genetic testing between patients with AD and two other groups: younger
      biological family members of the AD patients and individuals without AD matched by age to the
      AD patients.

    <description>This study consists of a single clinic visit. After subject has completed the informed consent process and meets eligibility criteria, a blood sample and a saliva sample will be collected. Genetic results from this one-time specimen collection will be evaluated and compared with results from participants in the other two study groups.

        There are three groups of participants for this research study: one group will consist of
        individuals diagnosed with dementia; another group will consist of younger biological
        family members of the patients with dementia; and the third group will consist of
        individuals without dementia who are matched in age to the patients with dementia.
