  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is one of the most serious food allergies because of its life long
      persistence, and the potential for severe allergic reactions. Effective oral immunotherapy
      would benefit patients by reducing the likelihood that they will have life-threatening
      accidental allergic reactions. This research study is being done to develop an effective oral
      immunotherapy treatment for patients with peanut allergy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that chronic antigen exposure during peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) will
      induce beneficial changes in the specific immune response, including: 1) anergy of IgE
      effector immune cells (e.g., mast cells, basophils) resulting in clinical desensitization; 2)
      induction of de novo, long lived (memory) B cell responses that antagonize specific IgE and
      confer immune tolerance. The investigators will test this hypothesis in the following
      specific aims:

        1. Induce desensitization in peanut allergic subjects with peanut OIT and evaluate the
           safety of the peanut OIT desensitization protocol.

        2. Induce long-standing tolerance in peanut allergic subjects with maintenance peanut OIT
           and evaluate the efficacy of allergen-specific testing to predict tolerance.

        3. Longitudinally evaluate basophil and mast cell reactivity in subjects receiving peanut
           OIT and their relationship to the induction of desensitization.

        4. Longitudinally evaluate the allergen-specific B-cell repertoire in subjects receiving
           peanut OIT and its relationship to the induction of tolerance.

    <description>Patients will receive daily escalating dosages (Peanut flour OIT) as determined in the modified rush phase as stated in the protocol. The dosage will be escalated until a daily dose of 4000 mg is reached. A Double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge will then consist of two challenges performed on the same day. One challenge will consist of 7 doses of peanut given every 10-20 minutes in increasing amounts up to a total of 10 grams of whole peanut (5 grams of peanut protein) masked by inclusion in vehicle food. The other challenge will consist of placebo material given similarly.</description>
