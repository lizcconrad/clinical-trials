  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether glycemic control (assessed with HbA1c
      measurement) in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes can be improved with a
      point-of-care measurement of HbA1c in the ophthalmologist's office combined with a
      personalized risk assessment for diabetic retinopathy and other complications of diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although each patient with diabetes should be receiving diabetic education as part of their
      on-going routine medical care, it is likely that such education is delivered with different
      details and intensity. Motivating a patient with diabetes to become involved in his or her
      care is of primary importance in achieving better systemic control.

      Ocular complications from diabetes remain the most common cause of blindness among American
      adults 20-74 years of age. A recent survey reported that loss of vision is the most feared of
      all diabetic complications. Thus, it is possible that an educational intervention at an
      ophthalmology office may have additional impact beyond the current standard of diabetes
      education at a primary care or diabetologist/endocrinologist office alone. This study will
      determine whether diabetes education in the ophthalmology office (which includes same-visit
      feedback of HbA1c levels, combined with standardized education regarding same-visit blood
      pressure, retinopathy status and overall diabetes education) can improve subsequent HbA1c as
      compared with current standard care in an ophthalmology office.

      Materials used in this research setting must be applicable for use in ophthalmology
      practices. Therefore, the materials and procedures for this study have been developed with
      the goal of easy translation to this audience.

    <description>At baseline and at annual visits, study participants in all treatment groups will complete self-assessment questionnaires in order to assess perception of emotional problems frequently reported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and to measure perceived adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations. At the annual visits, summary statistics will be presented on the responses as appropriate to the distribution and the treatment groups will be compared controlling for baseline responses.</description>

    <measure>Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months/24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>For analyses, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be converted to an overall mean blood pressure according to the following calculation: diastolic blood pressure + 1/3 (systolic blood pressure - diastolic blood pressure). Blood pressure will be analyzed as the change in the weighted mean blood pressure from baseline to 12 months adjusted for the baseline weighted mean blood pressure. Treatment group comparisons will be made using ANCOVA to adjust for the baseline blood pressure, with GEE to adjust for the correlation within subjects of the same cluster.</description>
