  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fiber is known to influence bowel function. The investigators hypothesize that the
      addition of a mixture of fibers to liquid diets will improve bowel function as measured by
      stool weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liquid diets are the sole source of nutrition for many patients. Consumption of liquid diets
      is linked to lower stool weight. The objective of this study is to feed liquid diets, with
      and without added fiber, to healthy human subjects to determine if mixed fiber sources can
      normalize stool weight. Secondary objectives of the study include measurement of gut
      microbiota and stool chemistry with fiber addition.
