      This retrospective study aims to assess treatment patterns within 1 year of initiating BPH
      treatment, including 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) monotherapy, alpha-blocker (AB)
      monotherapy, early combination therapy, and delayed combination therapy. The MarketScan
      database will be utilized for this study (2000-2008)
