  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids (OM3) can increase
      physical activity, inhibit rapid gain in body weight and BMI in both sedentary and normally
      active 8 year old children. The purpose is secondarily to explore patterns of associations
      between OM3 supplementation, baseline and follow-up levels in all studied parameters. The
      study also aims to study if basal levels of OM3 are correlated with physical activity and to
      study if there is an association between basal levels of OM3 and the effect of OM3
      supplementation on physical activity. To study if there is an effect of OM3 supplementation
      on triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels and to study if there are more pronounced effects
      on children with higher levels. To study if OM3 supplementation, compared with placebo reduce
      weight increase among children at risk to become overweight. To study if there is an
      association between effects of OM3 on physical activity, weight and risk markers in blood. To
      study if there are any gender differences.
