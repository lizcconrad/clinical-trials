    <textblock>
      Vulvar contact dermatitis (VCD) is a common problem presenting as vulvar pruritus, burning or
      irritation. Its estimated prevalence is 20-30% in vulvar clinics, but the prevalence in the
      general population is unknown.

      Contact dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin resulting from an external agent that acts
      as an irritant or as an allergen. The skin reaction may be acute, subacute or chronic,
      resulting from prolonged exposure to weak irritating substances.

      The most common form of VCD is irritant contact dermatitis, and it usually presents as vulvar
      itch. The causes that contribute to VCD are increased sensitivity of the vulvar skin to
      irritants compared to other body parts, decrease in the skin barrier function due to exposure
      to sweat, urine and vaginal discharge and constant friction of the vulvar area. In menopausal
      women, lack of estrogen contributes to tissue atrophy and thinning, and may increase the
      effect of irritants on the vulvar skin.

      One of the most common irritating substances that cause VCD is urine. The phenomenon of
      urine-induced VCD is known as&quot; diaper rash&quot; in babies, and it was also described in bedridden
      patients using diapers constantly. Women with urine incontinence (UI), a problem that its
      prevalence in women increases with aging, may use constantly panty liners or pads to prevent
      urine leakage. The urine is being absorbed in the pad, and the vulvar skin is continually
      exposed to urine. This can cause VCD, similar to diaper rash. The prevalence of this
      phenomenon in the general population is unknown.

      The patients complain of itch, burning or irritation of the vulvar skin, and on exam
      erythema, edema and irritated skin are found. As most patients do not connect between UI to
      their vulvar disorder, and as most care-givers do not ask routinely about UI, the vulvar
      symptoms are mistakenly attributed to yeast infection or other factors. As the cause to the
      vulvar complaints is not recognized, patients do not receive proper treatment that requires
      primary management of UI.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of VCD in women with UI and to recognize
      risk factors for UI induced VCD.

    <description>Patients will undergo the following evaluation:
Questionnaires- age, medical background, BMI, UI characteristics , usage of pads, other hygiene practices,hormonal therapy, presence of allergic tendency and history etc.
Medical history.
Gynecological exam including bladder/rectum/uterine prolapse, vaginal atrophy, discharge, findings of VCD (as part of the usual evaluation in the clinic).
Vaginal smear: this will be used for vaginal pH measurement and for wet mount, which will assess estrogen deficiency, yeast infection and other inflammatory conditions. Vaginal smears are done as part of the usual evaluation in the clinic.
Evaluation of the severity of urinary incontinence will be done by collection and weighting of pads during 24 hours.</description>

        The prevalence of UI induced VCD will be evaluated in 3 groups:

          1. Patients attending the urogynecological clinic for urinary incontinence-100 patients.
             In this group we will recruit patients with UI, and will assess co-existence of VCD

          2. Patients attending the vulvovaginal clinic with vulvar contact dermatitis (100
             patients). In this group we will recruit patients with VCD, and will assess
             co-existence of UI.

          3. Patients attending the general clinic for annual checkup, which will be matched for
             age with the two other groups (200 patients).

        These patients will be evaluated for symptoms of UI and VCD
