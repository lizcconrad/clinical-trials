  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of aerobic interval training in patients
      with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation, especially to see if the burden of atrial
      fibrillation and symptoms are reduced.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term endurance sport practice is associated with a higher incidence of atrial
      fibrillation. Moderate/light physical activity seems to be associated with a lower incidence.
      The underlying mechanisms are uncertain. In order to examine the effect of training in this
      population, the investigators will perform a randomised controlled study with aerobic
      interval training in patients with paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation.
