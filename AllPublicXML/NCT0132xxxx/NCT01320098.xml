  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two parenting
      programs in reducing the ADHD symptoms and behavioral problems of preschool children with
      ADHD through a controlled study. One program is a home-based parent training intervention
      that is designed to enhance the parent-child interaction, constructive parenting skills, and
      the child's tolerance for delay. The other intervention is a clinic-based parent training
      program that focuses on reducing noncompliance in preschool children and improving parenting
      skills.

      Both programs consist of private weekly parenting sessions with Clinical Psychologists - once
      a week for 8 weeks. The sessions are 1-1.5 hours in length. Both programs use behavior
      modification as a means of improving oppositional and non-compliant child behavior. Both
      interventions also involve procedures that focus on improving children's attention.

      Neither program involves medication, and all families will receive one of the two parenting
      programs being evaluated. Study evaluations, as well as participation in the parenting
      programs, are provided at no cost to families. Evaluation and parenting sessions can be
      scheduled at times convenient to families.

    <description>The Home-Based Parenting Program aims to improve impulsive and oppositional behaviors in 3 and 4 year-olds. The program involves 8 home visits with a therapist. The visits focus on the skills listed below as a means of improving your child's behavior.
Helping you set developmentally appropriate goals for your child. One way we do this is by focusing on situations that occur naturally in your home. Another way is by having you engage in activities with your child that focus on improving attention and the ability to delay.
Increasing the quality and quantity of positive interactions between you and your child
Changing the way you respond to your child's inappropriate behaviors so as to reduce the frequency of negative interactions.
Improving your parenting skills. This program also includes between-session &quot;homework tasks&quot; so that you can practice the skills you have learned throughout the week.</description>

    <description>The Clinic-Based Parenting Program aims to improve ADHD symptoms by reducing noncompliance, which is common in children with ADHD. Parents learn how to help their child attend to and comply with requests and directions so as to improve compliance and attention.
The program involves 8 clinic visits with a therapist. Parents learn various parenting skills to help improve their child's behaviors.
Parents learn techniques and skills to promote positive interactions with their child, including:
Increasing the positive attention you give to your child.
Reducing the inappropriate use of commands, questions and criticisms.
Appropriate use of praise and physical attention (e.g., hugs) as rewards.
Actively ignoring minor, inappropriate behaviors. Parents also learn how to: increase compliance via clear instruction; respond to compliant and noncompliant behaviors; and create and use clear rules about appropriate and inappropriate child behaviors.</description>

    <description>If your child is randomized to the 8-week Wait-List group, you and your child will be asked to attend 2 assessment visits -1 screening/baseline visit and one 8 weeks later. These assessment visits will take place at our clinic. After completing the second assessment, you will receive your choice of either the home-based or clinic-based parenting program.</description>
