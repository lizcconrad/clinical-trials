      Because electrochemotherapy is a quick and effective treatment for cutaneous metastases, a
      novel electrode device has been developed for treatment in soft tissue such as the brain. Up
      to 18 patients will be treated in this phase I dose-escalating study of electrochemotherapy
      for brain metastases. Primary endpoint of the clinical trial is safety and secondary endpoint
      is efficacy. One brain metastasis is treated once-only with the electrode device guided
      stereotactically through a burr hole using CT monitoring. The patient will be fully
      anesthetized during the treatment procedure. Patients are followed up for 6 months with
      regard to neurological function, Barthel Index, steroid use and adverse effects registration
      (CTCAE). Tumor response will be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI).

    <textblock>
      Electrochemotherapy is a cancer treatment modality comprising of a combination of electrical
      pulses delivered by electrodes and chemotherapy supplied either intravenously or
      intratumorally. It is a quick and effective treatment for cutaneous metastases &lt; 3 cm with a
      complete response rate of 73 % after once-only treatment. The available electrode devices
      have so far only been applicable for cutaneous tumors. An electrode has now been developed in
      collaboration with a medico-technical company. An increasing number of cancer patients suffer
      from metastases to the brain due to e.g. better control of the systemic peripheral cancer
      disease. The prognosis for patients with brain metastases remains poor and research into new
      treatments are needed in this field.

      Up to 18 patients will be treated in a dose-escalating study of electrochemotherapy for brain
      metastases. Primary endpoint of the clinical trial is safety and secondary endpoint is
      efficacy. One brain metastasis is treated once-only with the electrode device guided
      stereotactically through a burr hole using CT monitoring. The patient will be fully
      anesthetized during the treatment procedure. Patients are followed up for 6 months with
      regard to neurological function, Barthel Index, steroid use and adverse effects registration
      (CTCAE). Tumor response will be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI).

      The first 6 patients will receive an intravenous dose of bleomycin 15.000 IE/m2 before
      electric pulses. The following patients will receive an additional intratumoral injection of
      bleomycin of increasing concentration. The electrical pulses will consist of a series of high
      voltage pulses of 0.1 millisecond duration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt; 18 years.
