  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for recurrence after ventral hernia repair is often based on reoperation rates with
      short follow-up rather than recurrences identified by clinical examinations.

      The purpose of current study is find the real incidence of recurrences 3 years after ventral
      hernia repair and to compare with the reoperation rate.

      all patients in a restricted area (all patients in the part of Denmark called Zealand) who
      had a ventral hernia repair in 2007 (appr. 1200 patients). The patients will be sorted by a
      questionnaire and if the patients are suspicious for recurrence they will be offered a
      clinical examination.
