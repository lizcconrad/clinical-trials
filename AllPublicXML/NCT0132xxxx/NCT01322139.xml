    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate effects of Sativex on electrocardiogram (ECG) traces when
      administered at its therapeutic dose of 8 sprays per day and at multiples of the therapeutic
      dose (24 or 36 sprays per day), and to evaluate its safety and tolerability.

    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and
      active-controlled, four arm, parallel group study to evaluate the effect of Sativex on the
      QT/QTc interval.

      Within 30 days of screening, eligible subjects were randomized to one of four treatment
      groups. Baseline ECG measurements were recorded at specified times and the following day,
      subjects commenced five days treatment with Sativex or placebo. On Day 5, subjects then
      received either moxifloxacin 400 mg (Group 4) or moxifloxacin placebo (Groups 1, 2 and 3).
      Triplicate ECG measurements and pharmacokinetic samples were collected on Day 5. On days 1-5,
      Safety ECG measurements were also collected at pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose. Subjects
      returned to the study centre for an outpatient safety follow-up visit approximately 10-14
      days after their last dose of study medication.

             restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (as determined by the

             product would not interfere with the study procedures or data integrity or compromise
             the safety of the subject. In particular medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval
             (e.g. erythromycin, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants)were strictly avoided.

          -  Currently using cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing medicines (as shown
             by positive urine drug screen). Subjects who had used natural or synthetic cannabinoid
             based medications (including Sativex, Marinol or Acomplia [rimonabant]) within 3
             months prior to study entry and were unwilling to abstain for the duration of the
             study.

             per week).

          -  Positive urine drug screen upon presentation for screening or at admission to the
             treatment session.

          -  Positive breath alcohol test at screening or at admission to the treatment session.

             coffee, energy drinks, or any other caffeinated product) for at least nine days.

             peppermint oil, moxifloxacin or other quinolone antimicrobials, related drugs, or any
             of the drug excipients or other drug product components.

          -  Positive for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV at screening.

          -  Donation of 50 mL to 499 mL whole blood within 30 days or donation of more than 499 mL
             whole blood within 56 days of admission to the treatment session.

          -  Current or pending legal charges or currently on probation.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening.
