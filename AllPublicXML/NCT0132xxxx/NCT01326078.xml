  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of the of propofol
      nanoemulsion and lipid emulsion for sedation in non-invasive ambulatory procedures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nanoemulsion of propofol has been developed without lipid solvent in the formulation to
      minimize the adverse events such as pain of injection, redness, heat, phlebitis.
