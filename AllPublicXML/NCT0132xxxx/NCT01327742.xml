  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a continuation of the pivotal trial studying the safety and efficacy of the
      Relay thoracic stent-graft system to treat thoracic aortic aneurysms. Efficacy is being
      evaluated by the device-related adverse event rate of endovascular repair (via the Relay
      thoracic stent-graft) through 1 year. Safety is being evaluated by comparing major adverse
      events through 1 year in subjects treated with the Relay thoracic stent-graft to those who
      underwent surgical repair.
