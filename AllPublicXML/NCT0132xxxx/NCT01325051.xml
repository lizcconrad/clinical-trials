  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the way the first commercially available
      integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, a new class of antiretrovirals that is used to treat HIV,
      is distributed into the rectal mucosal tissue. This information will generate important
      information regarding the drug's penetration into lymphoid tissues that are rapidly depleted
      in HIV infection. Subsequently strategies to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and for
      treating HIV-infected individuals will be designed.

      Participants: 14 HIV-uninfected, healthy, male volunteers, ≥18 and ≤49 years of age, will be
      recruited and enrolled. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified
      by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse
      rate measurement, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. Participants of all races and
      ethnicities will be considered for enrollment. This study will be conducted at a single site
      in the United States: the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

      Procedures (methods): An outpatient screening visit will be conducted on all potential
      participants to obtain informed consent and evaluate for eligibility. Once enrolled, all
      subjects will take 400 mg oral dose of raltegravir twice daily from Day 1 to Day 7. The
      healthy men enrolled in this study will undergo single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic
      sampling. Blood will be collected via peripheral IV at pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and
      12 hours post-dose. Subjects will undergo two colonoscopies during sampling visits (Day 1 and
      Day 7) for the purpose of obtaining gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Each
      subject will have his biopsy obtained at one of the following time points post-dose: 1, 2, 3,
      4, 6, 8, and 12 hours. Seven to ten days after their last inpatient sampling visit, all
      subjects will complete a follow-up visit.
