  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study involving patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed
      appliances ('train-track braces'). A new type of train-track has recently been marketed. Over
      4 million patients worldwide are wearing on of these appliances; this system is considerably
      more expensive than a normal train-track. However, there is little evidence to support its
      use.

      The effects of three different types of train-track will be assessed with respect to the
      quality of Orthodontic tooth movement produced. Furthermore, the impact of the different
      train-tracks on daily life of orthodontic patients will also be measured. Consequently, the
      investigators will be able to inform orthodontists' decisions relating to the choice of
      train-track they recommend for their patients. In addition, should the more expensive
      appliances demonstrate objective or subjective advantage, a significant efficiency saving may
      develop.

    <description>Subjects randomized to treatment with one of three fixed orthodontic appliances: Damon Q, InOvation C and Ovation brackets. A pre-determined archwire sequence will be used involving round nickel titanium, rectangular nickel titanium progressing to 0.019 X 0.025 inch stainless steel; specific archwire sequences and appointment intervals will be based on the manufacturer's guidelines. All erupted teeth will have attachments placed from the outset.
Treated for a minimum of 8 months with the 0.019 X 0.025 inch stainless steel archwire in place for at least 8 weeks.</description>
