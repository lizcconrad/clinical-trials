  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this 3-treatment, 3-period, 6-sequence crossover study, each subject will receive all 3
      products in randomized order, 1 product at a time, with a washout period of 24 hours between
      treatment periods. Following instillation of study medication, subjects will complete a
      3-minute discomfort profile.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak discomfort score over a 3-minute period after drop instillation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular discomfort as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with 0=none to 50=severe, was assessed by subjects every 30 seconds between 0 to 180 seconds after drop instillation (at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 seconds). Peak discomfort (maximum observed VAS discomfort score over the 3-minute period) for each subject in each period was analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Ocular Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular symptoms (burning, stinging, tearing, blurring, and stickiness) assessed by the subject after instillation of drop as a single score where 0=none to 9=severe.</description>

    <measure>Product Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Product Acceptability assessed by the subject after instillation of drop as a single score where 0=very acceptable and 100=not acceptable.</description>
