    <textblock>
      This project evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention sought to reduce the physical
      effects of stress related to those issues that individuals cannot successfully communicate
      with anyone about. To do this, the investigators will be implementing a writing intervention
      over the course of the 6-week study. The investigators will be asking all participants to
      complete questionnaires over the course of the study period. The investigators are also
      asking participants to provide a small blood sample (from a fingerstick procedure) at two
      times during the study as well as saliva samples during that same time. The primary research
      question asks if this intervention procedure is effective. The investigators are evaluating
      total cholesterol, high sensitivity c-reactive protein, and cortisol.
