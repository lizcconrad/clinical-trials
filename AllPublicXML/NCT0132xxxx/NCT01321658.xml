  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial on frail elderly patients (aged 65+) with colorectal
      cancer. The patients will be randomized into two groups. The control group will receive
      standard surgical treatment. The intervention group will in addition go through a
      preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment. The assessment will include evaluation of
      co-morbidity and medication, social status, nutritional status, cognition, depression and
      physical performance. This assessment will form basis of an individualized perioperative
      intervention.

      The main aim of the study is to see if the number of postoperative complications in this
      group can be reduced by a perioperative geriatric intervention. A study of inflammation
      markers in serum will also be performed, with focus on identifying potential biological
      frailty markers.
