  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Multiple myeloma accounts for approximately 1% of all cancers and 10% of hematologic
           malignancies. Between 50 and 70% of symptomatic patients presented response to induction
           chemotherapy. The rate of complete responses (CR) achieved with standard induction of
           these treatments is less than 5% of cases and the median event-free survival between 2
           and 3 years although most of the patients died from the disease.

        -  High dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant has improved the response
           rate and survival of patient with MM. However eventually all patients relapse with a
           median EFS between 40-50 months post-transplant.

        -  To improve these results and sustain remission, various maintenance treatment have been
           proposed as is the case of Interpheron alpha2b s.c. (Intron A) that has shown benefits
           in a meta-analysis.

        -  Intron A s.c. need administration of 3 days per week and is not well tolerated

        -  Recently a new formulation of Interpheron alpha2b is available. Conjugated with
           polietilenglicol (Pegintron) that need only one dose weekly and has not been tested in
           MM.

        -  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of Pegintron as maintenance after
           autologous transplant in MM

    <description>This program is only open to patients with multiple myeloma who have achieved a complete or partial response after a myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen followed by autologous stem cell infusion of peripheral blood transplant (PBSCT) as treatment intensification. These patients will be treated with PEG-Intron as maintenance therapy, to be permitted during the same concomitant administration of corticosteroids and / or bisphosphonates.
PEG-Intron: 35 mcg per week by subcutaneous injection to progression or recurrence of the disease, or for 5 years maximum.
Patients were administered PEG-Intron to a uniform dose of 15 mg initial week for 2 weeks. If this dose is tolerated, it would be gradually increased to 25 mg and then to 35 mg every 2 weeks, assuming that there is no toxicity of grade 3 or worse.</description>
