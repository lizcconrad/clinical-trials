      This is a prospective, pilot, longitudinal study to evaluate the use of EMG guidance for
      Botox A injection for chronic pelvic pain and HTPFD. The objective of this study is to
      determine the efficacy of injecting botulinum toxin type A into pelvic floor muscles that are
      high tone. Patients who have been diagnosed with high tone pelvic floor muscle dysfunction
      and have failed other treatments will be eligible to participate in this study. Study related
      procedures will include perineometry readings. Patients will be required to complete 7
      questionnaires for this study. These include visual analog scale (scale from 0-10) for pain
      (VAS), the O'Leary-Sant urinary symptoms and problem questionnaires (ICSI/ICPI), Pelvic Floor
      Distress Inventory 20 (PFDI-20), the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), Global Response
      Assessment Scale and the SF-12 quality of life scale. The use of the EMG guidance is the
      experimental part of the study. We will perform EMG Needle testing in order to pin-point the
      best location for the patients Botox injections. This is a prospective, pilot, longitudinal
      study to evaluate the effect of Botox A injection for chronic pelvic pain and HTPFD.
