          <description>Among cytokines expressed were IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL-13, as measured by flow cytometry and multiplex assays.
Responders to a specific cytokine were defined as subjects with concentration for that respective cytokine after Bet v 1 stimulation above P95 of the concentration for that cytokine after medium only stimulation for all subjects (Total cohort), AND at least 5 times higher than their own respective concentration after medium only stimulation.</description>
          <population>The According-To-Protocol (ATP) cohort, Bet v 1 BrdU+ subjects included all subjects from the ATP cohort for which proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 was observed after 96 hours.</population>
