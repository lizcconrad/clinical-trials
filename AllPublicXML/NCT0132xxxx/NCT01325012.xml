  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the relationship between perineural catheter location along the sciatic nerve
      (popliteal versus subgluteal placement) and infusion effects for ultrasound-guided continuous
      sciatic nerve blocks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength (MVIC) of the hamstring muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>08:00-09:00 morning after surgery as a percentage of baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate hamstring strength which is innervated by the sciatic nerve with an isometric force electromechanical dynamometer to measure the force produced during a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in a seated position with the knees flexed at 90ยบ</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>08:00-09:00 morning after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate tolerance of transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Electrocardiogram pads will be placed on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot, and attached to a nerve stimulator. The current will be increased from 0 mA until subjects described a &quot;buzzing&quot; sensation (not painful), at which time the current will be recorded as the tolerated level and the nerve stimulator turned off.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>from leaving the PACU until 08:00 the morning after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical pain scores both average and worse as collected by nursing staff; and also the average and worse pain during the primary endpoint measurement</description>

    <measure>Sleep Disturbances</measure>
    <time_frame>recorded at 08:00-09:00 the morning after surgery for the previous night</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of times patient woke in the night due to surgical pain.</description>

    <measure>Total Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>recorded at 08:00-09:00 the morning following Surgery</time_frame>
