  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that: (1) gait stability will be increased when wearing an ankle-foot orthosis
      (plastic brace supporting the foot and ankle); (2) an attention demanding task will decrease
      gait stability and (3) the improvement in gait stability due to ankle-foot orthosis use will
      be greater during an attention demanding task.

      A quasi-experimental, randomized 2 x 2 factorial within subjects study with the factor of
      walking condition (2 levels, walking with and without ankle-foot orthotic device) and
      attention condition (2 levels, walking with and without attention task).
