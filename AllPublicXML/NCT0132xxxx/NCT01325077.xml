      Can a nurse-based, anesthesiologist-supervised model reduce prevalence of postoperative pain
      in pediatric patients?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of 2 treatment model in reducing prevalence of postoperative pain in pediatric
      patients:

      Conventional model(C): Nurses give fixed-dose analgesic according to surgeons' prescription
      Study model(S): Nurses give initial-dose analgesic according to surgeons' prescription. In
      case of inadequate pain relief, another half of initial dose will be given twice at 15-min
      interval and acute pain service will be consulted if there is still pain.
