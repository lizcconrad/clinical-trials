  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to
      be conducted in approximately 120 patients with hyperlipidemia in approximately 10 sites in
      US and China. Patients who satisfy the entry criteria at screening visit will have a 4-week
      Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet control period during which all lipid-lowering
      medications will be discontinued. After the 4-week diet control period, eligible patients
      will be randomized to one of three treatment groups. The treatment period will last for
      12-weeks. Patients will have blood samples collected at 5 time points (screening, baseline,
      Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12).
