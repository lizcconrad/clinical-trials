  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a clinical research trial to determine the role of
      motivational interviewing (MI) on promoting home-based walking therapy to improve walking
      ability in African Americans with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). African Americans are
      more than two times as likely as non-Hispanic whites to suffer from PAD. For patients with
      PAD, there is a significant risk for poor walking ability and limb loss. One major treatment
      for PAD is walking therapy but the traditional methods for the delivery of this treatment
      have required frequent visits to a university or hospital-based site. The investigators will
      address the role of self-managed walking program, to be conducted at or near the home, to
      improve limb function. In order to motivate the participants to walk, the investigators
      included two different intervention strategies: MI and patient-centered counseling for
      exercise (PACE). The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to the MI arm
      will have a greater increase in their walking distance, compared to those receiving
      Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE) and the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MI is an effective counseling method in individuals who are less ready to change their
      behavior (i.e., low motivation). Thus, MI is an ideal counseling method to promote home-based
      walking among AAs with PAD. In our pilot study to promote home-based walking, we used a
      counseling protocol, Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE)(Sallis et
      al), which targets known modifiable determinants of behavior change (e.g., social support).
      Using PACE, we demonstrated an improvement in stair climbing ability and lower limb blood
      flow (as measured by the ankle-brachial index). Improvements in these lower limb outcomes
      offer support for the use of PACE counseling in PAD, but PACE does not specifically address
      low motivation - a critical target for AAs with PAD. In addition, PACE is not culturally
      sensitive. In our proposed trial, we hypothesize that MI will improve walking distance and
      reduce walking impairment more than PACE in AAs with PAD.

      There is a critical need to improve lower limb outcomes in AAs with PAD. Our long-term goal
      is to reduce debilitating functional limitations and amputations in AAs with PAD. The overall
      objective of this application is to determine the most effective counseling strategy to
      improve home-based walking in AAs with PAD. We have assembled an excellent and diverse
      research team with the requisite skills and experience needed for this study. Moreover, we
      have robust pilot data to support the study hypotheses and ensure successful completion of
      the study.

      We will deliver the PACE protocol or MI for 6 months, using both face-to-face visits and
      telephone contact. Our primary outcome is walking distance (as measured by the widely used
      and well-validated 6-minute walk test) at the end of active intervention (6 months).
      Secondary outcomes are walking distance as measured beyond the active phase of intervention
      (12 months), use of home-based walking (as measured by accelerometry), and lower limb blood
      flow (as measured by the ankle brachial index - ABI). Our comparison group will receive the
      same print material as the two interventions as well as contact every three months to update
      any changes in contact information and to assess their health status. We will randomize 204
      participants to one of three arms: Control or Treatment One (Tx1); PACE or Treatment Two
      (Tx2); or MI, also referred to as Treatment Three (Tx3). In addition, we will determine the
      efficacy of PACE (Tx2) to increase walking distance in AAs with PAD, compared to Control
      (Tx1).

      Primary Hypothesis:

      1. At 6 months, AAs with PAD randomized to MI (Tx3) will have a greater increase in their
      walking distance, compared to those receiving PACE (Tx2) and the control group (Tx1).

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        1. AAs with PAD randomized to MI (Tx3) will have a greater increase in their walking
           distance at 12 months - a follow-up period beyond the six months of active intervention
           - compared to those receiving PACE (Tx2) and compared to the control group (Tx1).

        2. At 6 and 12 months, AAs with PAD randomized to MI (Tx3) will have a greater increase in
           their home-based walking and their lower limb blood flow, compared to those receiving
           PACE (Tx2) and to the control group (Tx1).

        3. At 6 and 12 months, AAs with PAD randomized to PACE (Tx2) will have a greater increase
           in their walking distance compared to those randomized to control (Tx1).

      Exploratory Aim:

      We will explore potential mediators (self-efficacy, social support, intrinsic/extrinsic
      motivation) and moderators (co-morbidities, leg symptom type, stage of change) of
      intervention effects on walking distance, home-based walking, and lower limb blood flow among
      AAs with PAD.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. African American (determined by self-report)

          2. Lived most of their life in the United States

          3. Resting ABI &lt;0.995

          4. English Speaking

          5. Has a telephone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently walking for exercise at least 5 days per week (i.e., a PACE score ranging
             from 5-8); the rationale is that a person who is currently walking for at least 5 days
             per week is already sufficiently active and therefore not a member of the target
             population for our motivational home-based walking intervention.

          2. Prior major amputation (foot or lower leg) or critical leg ischemia (tissue loss,
             gangrene, or ulcers)

          3. Rest pain with ABI &lt;0.4 and non-palpable femoral pulses without prior evaluation by a
             vascular surgeon, given the need for evaluation for the role of more invasive therapy
             prior to recommending walking therapy

          4. Leg revascularization within 3 months of enrollment or plans for revascularization
             during the study period; the rationale is that post intervention recovery and
             potential complications are likely to limit the patient's ability to adhere to the
             study protocol.

          5. Use of supplemental oxygen; the rationale for this is concern for participant safety
             and potential limited ability to participate in the study secondary to breathing
             difficulty.

          6. Myocardial infarction within the preceding 3 months; the rationale for this is
             participant safety and the potential risk for complications and/or the need for
             supervised cardiac rehabilitation following the event.

          7. Resting blood pressure &gt; 200/110 mmHg; the rationale for this is participant safety,
             as blood pressure may further increase during exercise and increase risk for a
             cerebrovascular event or myocardial infarction.

          8. Exercise-induced coronary ischemic symptoms, or exercise-induced ST depression &gt; 2.0
             mm; the rationale for this is participant safety and the need for further cardiac
             evaluation prior to involvement in walking therapy (American College of
             Cardiology/American Heart Association, 2006).

          9. Inability to walk for 2 minutes; the rationale being that people who cannot walk for 2
             minutes would not be able to complete the necessary submaximal treadmill test, which
             is used to screen for coronary ischemic symptoms. We will also exclude anyone who can
             walk for 20 minutes or more during the submaximal treadmill test. Anyone who can
             complete the submaximal test would not have significant walking impairment and would
             not get that much out of the study. Short Physical Performance Battery score of 10 or
             higher as such persons do not have a clinically significant impairment in mobility;
             therefore, we will exclude anyone who scores a 10 or higher (out of a maximum of 12
             points).
