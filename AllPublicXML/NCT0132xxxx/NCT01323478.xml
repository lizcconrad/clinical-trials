    <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The rating should be based on a clinical interview with the patient, moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones, which allow a precise rating of severity, covering the last 7 days. Total score from 0 to 60. The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

The investigator should use his/her total clinical experience with this patient population to judge how mentally ill the patient is at the time of rating.</description>

Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total score from 0 to 56. The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) comprises self-rated items designed to measure impairment. The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and (3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scales, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment. The three items may be summed into a single dimensional measure of global functional impairment that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

    <measure>ASEX Total Score After 52 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) is a 5-item, patient selfrated scale that evaluates a patient's recent sexual experience. Patients are asked to assess their own experience over the last week (for example, &quot;How strong is your sex drive?&quot;, &quot;Are your orgasms satisfying?&quot;) and respond on a 6-point scale for each item. The ASEX is used to identify individuals with sexual dysfunction. Possible total score ranges from 5 to 30, with the higher score indicating more patient sexual dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Risk of Suicidality Using C-SSRS Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was developed by researchers at Columbia University as a tool to systematically assess suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients during participation in a clinical study. The C-SSRS is composed of questions that address suicidal behaviour and questions that address suicidal ideation, with subquestions that assess severity. The tool was administered via an interview with the patient. Different versions of the C-SSRS are available. In this study, the Since Last Visit Version was used at all visits. In order to assess the potential relationship between Vortioxetine and suicidality more accurately and systematically, C-SSRS data were collected during the Entire Study Period.</description>

        <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The rating should be based on a clinical interview with the patient, moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones, which allow a precise rating of severity, covering the last 7 days. Total score from 0 to 60. The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) comprises self-rated items designed to measure impairment. The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and (3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scales, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment. The three items may be summed into a single dimensional measure of global functional impairment that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

        <description>The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) is a 5-item, patient selfrated scale that evaluates a patient's recent sexual experience. Patients are asked to assess their own experience over the last week (for example, &quot;How strong is your sex drive?&quot;, &quot;Are your orgasms satisfying?&quot;) and respond on a 6-point scale for each item. The ASEX is used to identify individuals with sexual dysfunction. Possible total score ranges from 5 to 30, with the higher score indicating more patient sexual dysfunction.</description>

          <title>ASEX Total Score After 52 Weeks of Treatment</title>
          <description>The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) is a 5-item, patient selfrated scale that evaluates a patient's recent sexual experience. Patients are asked to assess their own experience over the last week (for example, &quot;How strong is your sex drive?&quot;, &quot;Are your orgasms satisfying?&quot;) and respond on a 6-point scale for each item. The ASEX is used to identify individuals with sexual dysfunction. Possible total score ranges from 5 to 30, with the higher score indicating more patient sexual dysfunction.</description>

        <title>Risk of Suicidality Using C-SSRS Scores</title>
        <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was developed by researchers at Columbia University as a tool to systematically assess suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients during participation in a clinical study. The C-SSRS is composed of questions that address suicidal behaviour and questions that address suicidal ideation, with subquestions that assess severity. The tool was administered via an interview with the patient. Different versions of the C-SSRS are available. In this study, the Since Last Visit Version was used at all visits. In order to assess the potential relationship between Vortioxetine and suicidality more accurately and systematically, C-SSRS data were collected during the Entire Study Period.</description>
