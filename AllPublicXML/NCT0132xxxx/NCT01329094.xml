      The aim of the study was to evaluate the applicability of the Physical Activity Scale (PAS)
      in relation to patients with severe mental illness. The study hypothesised that physical
      activity levels among patients with severe mental illness was significantly lower than
      healthy controls. The physical activity level of patients with severe mental illness
      attending Aarhus University Hospital, Risskov in comparisons with healthy controls matched on
      gender and age was assessed with PAS.

      The study population of interest was psychiatric in- or outpatients from Aarhus University
      Hospital , Risskov, some of whom were referred for physiotherapeutic treatment. The patients
      were compared with healthy controls matched on gender and age, recruited from hospital staff
      including administrative employees.Patients and controls were included in the study after
      giving informed consent, according to the Declaration of Helsinki 2008. All participants
      assessed their physical activity level by completing the PAS questionnaire twice within a
      time period of 5-7 days for evaluation of the test-retest reliability of PAS. For patients,
      PAS was administered as an interview, and for controls as a self-questionnaire. Several
      physiotherapists (PTs) were involved in interviewing the patients.

      In total, 47 hospitalized patients or outpatients and 28 controls were included in the study.
      In comparison with controls, the physical activity level of daily life of the patients was
      statistically significantly lower, even though the average physical activity level of the
      healthy controls was just above 'moderate physical activity'.

      There was a satisfactory test-retest reliability of PAS when applied to both mentally ill
      patients and healthy controls. PAS was found to be an applicable method for evaluating
      physical activity levels in patients with severe mental illness, and also useful in measuring
      changes in physical activity levels.
