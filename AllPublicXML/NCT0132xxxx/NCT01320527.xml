  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on prior published pilot studies, the investigators have initiated a larger, multi-site
      placebo-controlled clinical trial with Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and individuals
      diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), with the hopes of (1) confirming (or denying)
      the above promising clinical findings, and (2) determining whether or not our formulation can
      delay MCI &quot;conversion&quot; to AD.

      Preclinical studies with mouse models of of age-related neurodegeneration led us to develop a
      Nutriceutical Formulation (&quot;NF&quot;) consisting of 6 over-the-counter vitamins and
      nutriceuticals, that buffers multiple facets of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including (1)
      reducing presenilin expression, gamma-secretase activity, Abeta generation and tau
      phosphorylation, (2) buffering homocysteine and Abeta-induced oxidative damage, (3) reducing
      aggression, (4) increasing acetylcholine production and improving/maintaining cognitive
      performance.

      A 1-year, open-label trial with NF with mild to moderate AD patients demonstrate improvement
      in cognitive performance (Dementia Rating Scale, Clock-drawing) within 3-6 months. Caregivers
      reported maintenance of daily performance and improved mood (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living
      and NeuroPsychiatric Inventory). A placebo-controlled study with moderate to late-stage AD
      indicates delayed cognitive decline and maintenance of daily activities. No adverse events
      were reported.

      A multi-site trial with &gt;90 individuals aged 45-73 without dementia indicated that NF
      statistically improved executive function (Trails B-A) vs. placebo within 3 months, which
      increased further at 6 months. The placebo group demonstrated identical improvement in a
      3-month open-label extension. Following NF withdrawal, participants returned to baseline;
      statistically-significant improvement was restored once NF was individuals resumed.

      We have initiated a larger, multi-site placebo-controlled clinical trial with AD patients and
      individuals diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), with the hopes of (1) confirming
      (or denying) the above promising clinical findings, and (2) determining whether or not our
      formulation can delay MCI &quot;conversion&quot; to AD.
