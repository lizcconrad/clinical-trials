  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythromycin is effectively used in the treatment of Gastroparesis (GP) patients. In
      susceptible patients however, it has been associated with sudden cardiac death due to
      prolongation of QT intervals and subsequent cardiac risks through its interaction some other
      drugs. Azithromycin (AZI) is a macrolide antibiotic but does not have the mentioned druf
      interactions , has fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and fewer risks of QT prolongation
      and cardiac arrhythmias. Consequently, AZI avoids drawbacks of dosing with erythromycin and
      may be preferred as a prokinetic agent in patients on other concomitant medications.

      We hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of Azithromycin (AZI) as compared to Erythromycin in
      the treatment of Gastroparesis (GP), and later, form the framework for larger
      randomized-controlled parallel studies to investigate use of AZI for treatment of GP.

      Our novel hypothesis is to determine whether AZI can be used to treat GP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis (GP) is a chronic gastrointestinal motility disorder resulting from delayed
      transit of gastric contents from the stomach into the duodenum in the absence of mechanical
      outlet obstruction. The symptoms of GP are variable but include early satiety, bloating,
      nausea, vomiting, and epigastric abdominal pain. Although the true prevalence of the disorder
      is unknown, symptoms suggestive of GP are present in 7-15% of the population with an
      estimated one-third of diabetic patients in tertiary care settings having abnormal gastric
      emptying studies. Yet, despite the significant healthcare and economic costs due to frequent
      hospitalization in these patients, treatment of GP is difficult due to the lack of available
      treatment options and the often potential side effects of available prokinetic agents,
      including cardiac side effects such as QT prolongation, sudden cardiac death, and torsade de
      pointes.

      One such medication used for treatment of GP is erythromycin. Erythromycin has its drawbacks.
      Several reports of cardiac arrhythmias associated with use of either oral or intravenous (IV)
      Erythromycin have been reported. This finding sparked our interest in another macrolide,
      Azithromycin (AZI), which does not have the drug-drug interactions as seen with erythromycin
      and is not metabolized by the CYP3A inhibitors, therefore having fewer cardiac side effects.

      In This study our primary goal is to determine whether AZI can be used to treat GP.

    <description>Patients will be given a standardized meal enriched with a labeled material and the breath samples are then collected and analyzed. The estimated time to empty 50% (t 1/2) of the accumulated contents is recorded. Because the difference is RX-B -RX A in one group and RX A -RX B in the other, the difference between these two estimates twice the effect size. Hence the Half is applied, as is standard in the two sample method for crossover studies.</description>

    <description>This is a Validated instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. This scoring is based on a Likert Scale from (0-5) with zero being no symptoms and five being very severe symptoms on 9 subscales, making the overall score range from 0-45. The higher the score, the more severe patient's symptoms.

    <measure>NDI Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 11 (end of periods)</time_frame>
    <description>Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) is a measure of symptom status and quality of life in functional dyspepsia. This scale is scored using each subscale (Tension, interference with daily activities), Eating/drinking, Knowledge/control, work/study) and adding up the items for each of the five subscale score (2-10). Total score range would be 10-50).
For the NDI, a lower number is better meaning the symptom is not effecting quality of life and a higher score closer to 50 is worse meaning it is effecting patients quality of life.

    <description>This is a Validated instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis.

    <description>The dose of Azithromycin was determined based on our dose response curve obtained on 10 healthy subjects who were given three different doses of Azithromycin, 50 mg, 100 mg and 133 mg and underwent breath testing to determine the gastric emptying half-time. These doses were determined based on a maximum safe dosage per day of Azithromycin of 400 mg given the medication would then be administered three times daily before meals. The appearance of the medication (azithromycin) and administration period was then identical to that of Erythromycin, i.e. 5ml elixir administered orally three times a day half an hour prior to meals. The total daily dosage of Azithromycin was determined after obtaining the dose- response analysis.</description>

    <description>The dose of Azithromycin given was determined based on the following study on 10 healthy subjects. In random order, each of ten healthy subjects underwent OBT studies following administration of AZI, at doses of 50mg, 100mg, and 133mg. The T½ and Tlag was then compared for the three doses by a randomized block analysis using Analysis of Variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison. Results: The T½ for each of the respective doses of AZI (50mg, 100mg, and 133mg) was 129 ± 27, 128 ± 31, and 128 ± 16 minutes (p = 0.98). This data suggested that AZI at doses of 50mg, 100mg and 133 mg have fairly similar activity in its effects on gastric emptying in healthy subjects. Based on this analysis , we decided to use a dose of 50 mg/5 ml for administered TID prior to meals.</description>

        <description>Patients will be given a standardized meal enriched with a labeled material and the breath samples are then collected and analyzed. The estimated time to empty 50% (t 1/2) of the accumulated contents is recorded. Because the difference is RX-B -RX A in one group and RX A -RX B in the other, the difference between these two estimates twice the effect size. Hence the Half is applied, as is standard in the two sample method for crossover studies.</description>

        <title>Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) Score</title>
        <description>This is a Validated instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. This scoring is based on a Likert Scale from (0-5) with zero being no symptoms and five being very severe symptoms on 9 subscales, making the overall score range from 0-45. The higher the score, the more severe patient’s symptoms.

        <title>NDI Score</title>
        <description>Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) is a measure of symptom status and quality of life in functional dyspepsia. This scale is scored using each subscale (Tension, interference with daily activities), Eating/drinking, Knowledge/control, work/study) and adding up the items for each of the five subscale score (2-10). Total score range would be 10-50).
For the NDI, a lower number is better meaning the symptom is not effecting quality of life and a higher score closer to 50 is worse meaning it is effecting patients quality of life.

Because the difference is RX-B -RX A in one group and RX A -RX B in the other, the difference between these two estimates twice the effect size. Hence the Half is applied, as is standard in the two sample method for crossover studies.</description>

        <description>This is a Validated instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. This scoring is based on a Likert Scale from (0-5) with zero being no symptom and five being very severe symptoms on 9 subscales, making the overall score range from 0-45. The higher the score, the more severe patient’s symptoms are. The scale is reported in the references. The change was calculated by measuring the end of treatment minus baseline GCSI score.
Negative value reflects this change.</description>

        <title>Does GCSI Score Improve (Lower) on Treatment, Pooling the AZ Patients Over Their Treatment Periods? Endpoint is Difference in Post-test Less Baseline</title>
        <description>This is a Validated instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. This scoring is based on a Likert Scale from (0-5) with zero being no symptom and five being very severe symptoms on 9 subscales, making the overall score range from 0-45. The higher the score, the more severe patient’s symptoms are. The scale is reported in the references.
This is a calculation taken with GCSI score at end of treatment minus baseline. Negative value reflects this change.</description>
