          -  At least 3 episodes of a SCD-related crisis or complication in the 3 years prior to
             screening OR 1 episode of acute chest syndrome in the 5 years prior to screening

          -  If receiving hydroxyurea, must be receiving a stable dose for at least 6 months prior
             to screening

          -  If hydroxyurea treatment has been discontinued, at least 3 months have elapsed since
             last dose

          -  If transfusion in the 4 months prior to screening, then HbA level &lt; 20% at screening

          -  Average of the initial two HbF levels ≥ 2.0 % within ≤ 7 days prior to the initial
             dose of HQK-1001. The two must be obtained ≥ 24 hours apart

          -  Ability to swallow tablets

          -  Able and willing to give informed consent and assent (if applicable)

             serum pregnancy test within 7 days of first dose of HQK-1001

          -  If a subject is a WCBP, she must agree to use an effective form of contraception
             within 7 days of the initial dose of HQK-1001 and for one month after HQK-1001
             discontinuation

          -  Sexually active male subjects (with WCBP partners) must agree to use latex condoms or
             ensure that their partner(s) use an effective form of contraception

          -  In the view of the Investigator, subject is able and willing to comply with necessary
             study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 4 hospitalizations for acute sickle cell related events in the previous 12
             months prior to screening

          -  Pulmonary hypertension requiring oxygen therapy

          -  Use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents within 90 days of screening

          -  ALT &gt; 3x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dL

          -  Creatine phosphokinase (CK) &gt; 20% above the ULN

          -  An acute illness (e.g., febrile, GI, respiratory) within 72 hours prior to screening

          -  History of syncope, clinically significant dysrhythmias or resuscitation from sudden
             death

          -  Chronic opiate use, which, in the view of the Investigator, could confound evaluation
             of an investigational drug

          -  Current abuse of alcohol or drugs

          -  Received another investigational agent within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer, prior to screening

          -  Currently pregnant or breast feeding a child

          -  Known infection with HIV-1
