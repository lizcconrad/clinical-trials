      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of ShuntCheck (SC) and ShuntCheck plus
      Micro-Pumper (SC+MP) to radionuclide shunt patency testing (SPS) in evaluating shunt function
      in patients with adult hydrocephalus (AH) implanted with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts
      when shunt obstruction is suspected and a diagnostic procedure such as radionuclide shunt
      patency testing (SPS) is required.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the accuracy of SC and SC+MP for determining
      whether a VP shunt is patent or obstructed is statistically no different than the accuracy of
      the accepted standard test, radionuclide shunt patency study, when performed simultaneously.

      A secondary objective is to determine SC and SC+MP results in the presence of possible
      partial obstruction, which defined as subjects with radionuclide clearance measured by T1/2
      of 8 to 10 minutes.

      A secondary objective is to compare ShuntCheck flow rate results to simultaneous radionuclide
      clearance as measured by T1/2. A secondary objective is to demonstrate that ShuntCheck flow
      rate results are statistically equivalent to simultaneous radionuclide clearance measured by
      T1/2

    <description>The primary efficacy objective is the sensitivity and specificity of the ShuntCheck test.
The performance of ShuntCheck test will be compared to the radionuclide scanning done on the day of ShuntCheck administration. Primary efficacy of the SC and SC+MP test will be determined by comparing SC and SC+MP performance to results of radionuclide scanning according to a standard 2 x 2 table, with a Positive test result defined as evidence of shunt obstruction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult men or women &gt; 35 years of age;

          2. Capable of providing valid signed informed consent, or has a legal guardian, health
             care agent, or surrogate decision maker (according to local statutes, and collectively
             referred to as &quot;surrogates&quot; in this protocol) capable of providing valid, signed
             informed consent;

          3. Possess a shunt placed for AH;

          4. A radionuclide shunt patency study has been ordered because of suspected shunt
             obstruction

          5. Subject is willing and able to return to the treating physician for evaluation of the
             outcome of the shunt patency study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of multiple shunts, or presence of more than one distal shunt catheter
             (regardless of function) crossing the clavicle ipsilateral to the shunt with suspected
             obstruction;

          2. ShuntCheck test would interfere with standard patient care, or emergency shunt surgery
             that cannot be delayed is indicated;

          3. Presence of an interfering open wound or edema over any portion of the VP shunt;

          4. Subject is unwilling or unable to return to the treating physician for the SPS and
             ShuntCheck testing.
