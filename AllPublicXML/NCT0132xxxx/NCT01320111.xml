      AIM OF STUDY

      Primary Efficacy Variable:

      The primary study objective is the proof of efficacy, measured by progression free survival
      (PFS) in the treatment of metastatic or locally inoperable recurrent breast cancer.

      Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomisation to disease
      progression or death.

      Secondary Efficacy Variables:

        -  Clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD)

        -  ORR (CR+PR)

        -  Time to progression

        -  Time to next Treatment (TTT)

        -  Overall survival

        -  Safety profile

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today breast carcinoma is the leading cancer type and the second frequent cause of cancer
      death in adult women. This tumor remains a challenge in modern oncology despite recent
      advances by introducing new classes of chemotherapy like taxanes and antibodies for the
      HER-2/neu positive tumors. Recently it was shown that the combination of conventional
      chemotherapy with a monoclonal antibody against VEGF can further increase the response and
      progression free survival by combination with an antiangiogenic therapy. It is supposed that
      this effect might result in a prolonged survival.

      Sorafenib, a new developed oral inhibitor for tyrosine kinases which are responsible for the
      signal transduction after binding to the VEGF receptor and the RAS-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway seems
      efficient in the treatment of a broad range of tumors.

      The multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib targets the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf
      kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-β, thereby affecting both, the
      tumour and the vasculature. Preclinical studies as well as phase I trials showed anti-tumour
      activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with single-agent sorafenib.

      This multicentre, phase II, open-label, randomised study is designed to assess the potential
      prolongation in progression free survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer in
      combination with standard chemotherapy paclitaxel compared with the paclitaxel monotherapy.
