      Main Hypothesis: The multifaceted intervention (preoperative counseling, pharmacotherapy by
      varenicline and follow up by quit line) in the preoperative clinic is more effective than the
      simple preoperative smoking intervention (brief advice and provision of information about the
      quit lines ) in terms of short-term and long-term quit rates

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of a multifaceted intervention
      (preoperative counseling, pharmacotherapy by varenicline and follow up by the quit line) in
      the preoperative clinic to help surgical patients quit smoking perioperatively and for the
      long-term.

    <measure>pre-surgery counseling for quit smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine the prevalence of abstinence in long-term follow up (4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks), patients will be asked the following questions:
Have you been abstinent from smoking for the past four weeks? (4-week abstinence)
Do you currently smoke cigarettes everyday? (point prevalence)
Have you been abstinent from smoking since the last time you quit smoking? (continuous abstinence)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>perioperative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures that will be studied are as follows: The changes in the number of cigarettes consumed per day or 'stage of change' at 4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after the initial assigned target quit date. The incidence of perioperative complications (until 30 days after surgery) as well as medication-related adverse events (and serious adverse events) will also be recorded (only those who in the smoking-cessation program).</description>
