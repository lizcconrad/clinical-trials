  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of seat type (straight chair
      versus &quot;ergonomic&quot; chair) on the sagittal alignment of the lumbo-pelvic complex in two
      different postures compared to standing for each individual in both a chronic-back-pain and a
      non-chronic-back-pain population.
