    <textblock>
      Background:

      The transradial approach is increasingly used in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      because of lower major access site complications, lower bleeding risk and earlier patient
      mobilization. According to this trend, in the last couple of years at the University Hospital
      of Geneva the investigators have changed their practice and currently the transradial
      approach is the most frequently used for PCI. However, the small diameter of the radial
      artery remains a major limitation of the technique, especially in women or for complex PCI
      necessitating larger bore guiding catheters. This may be overcome with sheathless guiding
      catheters (Asahi, Japan), allowing for a standard inner catheter diameter (6-7 Fr), with an
      outer diameter equivalent to a standard 5 and 6 Fr introducer sheath.

      Aim:

      This study is aimed to compare the transradial approach for PCI with a sheathless guiding
      catheter and with a standard guiding catheter in women and patients with complex lesion
      necessitating large bore guiding catheters.

      Material and methods:

      This prospective study will consecutively randomize all women and all men with
      bifurcation/ostial lesion of a major coronary vessel (i.e. ≈ 120/year) in whom a transradial
      PCI is attempted. The procedures will be performed either with a standard 6 or 7Fr guiding
      catheter or with the sheathless 6.5, 7.5 Fr catheters.

      End-points:

      Successful performance a transradial PCI in all consecutive patients which qualify according
      to the inclusion criteria (technical feasibility). Establish the proportion of procedures
      performed with no device-related complications (safety). Analyze in details the technical
      aspects of the sheathless catheter (efficacy).

      Sample size:

      The investigators have planed to include in the study ≈ 250 patients in two years. After 1
      year of enrollment the investigators will perform an interim analysis and the instigators
      will decide at that moment, according to the observed end-points, if prolonging the study
      would be of any scientific value. In this case another 100 patients will be further included
      in the study.

      Enrollment time:

      The investigators will start the study as soon the local ethical committee will give us the
      permission. The investigators plan to start the study in July 2010. The end is expected for
      July 2012.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients need to be at least 18 years old.

          -  Patients presenting with a significant coronary artery disease who qualify for PCI and
             who can be treated by a radial approach.

          -  Any women requiring PCI who can be treated by a radial approach.

          -  Any patients with a bifurcation lesion or the ostial lesion of the left anterior
             descending (LAD) and/or left circumflex artery (LCX), lesions commonly treated with a
             7 Fr guiding catheter.

          -  Bifurcation lesion = any lesion of a main epicardial vessel (i.e. LAD, LCX, right
             coronary artery) involving at least one major side branch (i.e. diagonal or marginal
             branches).

          -  Ostial lesion of the LAD or LCX = presence of a significant stenosis &lt;5mm from the
             distal part of the left main.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who refused to give their written informed consent.

          -  Male patients, in whom PCI can be easily performed with a 6 Fr standard guiding
             catheter (i.e. no bifurcation or ostial lesion).

          -  Patients in whom the radial approach is contra-indicated:

               -  Patients with a dialysis arteria-venous fistula or in whom an arteria-venous
                  fistula is planed in the future.

               -  Patients with a known radial artery occlusion.

               -  Patients in whom a radial approach was unsuccessfully already attempted in the
                  past (anamnestic notion or previous medical record) secondary to a:

          -  Challenging vessel anatomy,

          -  Vessel tortuosity,

          -  Known impossibility to cannulate the coronary ostia by the radial approach.

          -  Patients in whom the Allen test results pathological bilaterally:

          -  In case of pathological Allen test in one hand the other hand will be tested before
             choosing the femoral approach.

          -  Patients in whom the femoral approach is adopted as primary catheterization approach
             (at interventionist's discretion), including:

               -  Unstable patients (myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock).

               -  Patients necessitating femoral access for an intra-aortic balloon
                  counterpulsation

               -  Patients presenting with a double mammary coronary graft (right and left internal
                  mammary utilized for by-pass grafts).

          -  Coronary interventions where an extreme good guiding support is mandatory (i.e. PCI of
             chronic total occlusion, PCI with Rotablator).

          -  Particularly risky PCI (e.g., PCI of the left main artery), where the femoral approach
             may be more comfortable for the operator.

          -  Patients requiring a femoral approach for a right heart catheterization.
