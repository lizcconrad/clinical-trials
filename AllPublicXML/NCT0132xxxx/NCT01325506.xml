  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. Surgical removal of the entire
      prostate (prostatectomy) is one option among the various ways to treat prostate cancer. The
      use of robot assistance for prostatectomy has become common place, but its effectiveness has
      not been compared to standard open prostatectomy in trials carried out at more than one
      medical institution in which participants are identified and followed forward in time. Robot
      assisted and standard open prostatectomy health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes have
      not been compared in a prospective, multi-centered study. Prostatectomy can have side effects
      that can change with time. This research study seeks to determine how common and how
      long-lasting such side effects are; to find out what features of individual men's cancers and
      what features of the treatments affect those side effects. This study also seeks to identify
      factors that affect the quality of prostate cancer care by looking at how satisfied men are
      with their prostate cancer care. Through these findings, this study aims to allow treatment
      side effects to be anticipated more accurately for individual patients, and to provide a
      means for determining the quality of prostate care.

      The investigators will follow your prostate cancer treatment outcomes and health related
      quality of life following prostatectomy by asking you direct questions, collect information
      from medical records and phone interviews.

      Information about your prostate cancer treatment, and related health concerns, and
      information regarding the cost of care, may also be collected from your medical record, other
      medical center sources, and your primary care provider (PCP). Clinical information will be
      collected: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 6 month, 12 months, 18 months, and
      24 months after your prostatectomy; once a year thereafter for possibly up to 12 years.

      You will be asked to take part in six telephone interviews regarding quality of life,
      possible therapy side effects, and satisfaction with prostate cancer therapy. Each phone
      interview should last 15-25 minutes. All questions are voluntary. The phone interviews will
      be conducted: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18
      months, and 24 months after prostatectomy; 10 additional phone interviews may be conducted
      (once a year thereafter, for possibly up to 12 years).
