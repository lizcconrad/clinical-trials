  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will estimate the effect of lapatinib on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval
      duration) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study treatment period will occur over
      five days and an End of Study visit will be conducted on Day 8 (or no later than 3 days
      beyond Day 8). Subjects will receive placebo that mimics lapatinib for 2 days as three
      separate doses given 12 hours apart (8 tablets/dose) and lapatinib (2000mg) for 2 days as
      three separate doses given 12 hours apart (8 tablets/dose). Subjects will not know when they
      are receiving placebo vs. lapatinib. Digital 12-lead ECG recordings will be extracted from
      continuous ECG recordings obtained via a Holter monitor to measure QTc interval duration.
      Triplicate ECG measurements of QTc interval will be taken at pre-specified times at Day 1
      (Baseline) and pre-dose and up to 24 hours after the third dose of placebo or lapatinib on
      Study Days 2 and 4. Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur immediately following each
      pre-specified QTc measurement in subjects dosed with placebo or lapatinib. Subjects who
      complete participation in this study, if they are eligible, will be offered the option to
      continue treatment with lapatinib, either alone or in combination with other oncology drugs
      in pre-selected anticancer regimens, in a continuation protocol, EGF111767.

    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) (Day1) and pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24-hours (hr) post-dose on Day 2 for placebo (PBO). Baseline (Day 3) and pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24-hours post-dose on Day 4 for lapatinib (LAP).</time_frame>
    <description>A Holter monitor is an ambulatory portable device used for continuously monitoring the cardiovascular system. Three replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior to the administration of study treatment (trt) on Days 1 and 3 and pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hr post-dose on Days 2 and 4. The 3 readings at each time point (TP) were averaged prior to any analysis. BL is the average of the pre-dose QTcF values (triplicate) taken on Day 1 for PBO and on Day 3 for LAP. Mean change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from individual QTcF for each TP. BL adjusted mean difference in absolute QTcF between LAB and PBO (trt difference) with the corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI) was estimated for each TP (pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24-hr post-dose). Trt difference analysis was performed by a repeated measures analysis of variance adjusted for trt group, TP, and trt group*TP interaction.</description>

    <description>For each participant, the time at which Cmax was observed (tmax) was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. For each participant, the time prior to the first quantifiable (non-zero) concentration (tlag) was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. Since all participants received 2 doses of study medication prior to the collection of the first (pre-dose) blood sample on Day 4, tlag was expected to be zero. For PK analysis, one blood sample was collected on Day 1 for placebo Baseline. The 24 hour blood sample on Day 2 also served for lapatinib Baseline. Pre-dose blood samples were collected 30 minutes prior to the administration of study medication on Day 2 (placebo) and Day 4 (lapatinib). Serial blood samples were collected on Day 2 (for placebo) and on Day 4 (for lapatinib) at the following post-last-dose time points 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours.</description>

        <title>Treatment Difference in Duration of Cardiac Ventricular Depolarization and Repolarization Interval (QT) in Fridericia-corrected QT Interval (QTcF) Values Between Placebo and Lapatinib 2000mg</title>
        <description>A Holter monitor is an ambulatory portable device used for continuously monitoring the cardiovascular system. Three replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior to the administration of study treatment (trt) on Days 1 and 3 and pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hr post-dose on Days 2 and 4. The 3 readings at each time point (TP) were averaged prior to any analysis. BL is the average of the pre-dose QTcF values (triplicate) taken on Day 1 for PBO and on Day 3 for LAP. Mean change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from individual QTcF for each TP. BL adjusted mean difference in absolute QTcF between LAB and PBO (trt difference) with the corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI) was estimated for each TP (pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24-hr post-dose). Trt difference analysis was performed by a repeated measures analysis of variance adjusted for trt group, TP, and trt group*TP interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Holter ECG Parameters of QT Interval, Corrected QT Interval (QTc), Bazett Corrected QTc Interval (QTcB), Individual-corrected QT Interval (QTcI), RR Interval, PR Interval, and QRS Duration at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>A Holter monitor is an ambulatory portable device for continuously monitoring the cardiovascular system. Change from Baseline in QT interval, QTc interval, QTcB interval, QTcI interval, RR interval, PR interval, and QRS duration at each time point for lapatinib was assessed in comparison with time-matched placebo. Three replicate ECGs were collected at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior to the administration of study treatment on Days 1 and 3 and pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours post dose on Days 2 and 4. The three readings at each time point were averaged prior to any analysis. Baseline is the average of the pre-dose ECGs (triplicate) taken on Day 1 for placebo and Day 3 for lapatinib. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from individual post-Baseline values for each time point.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With 12-lead Holter ECG Findings at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>The number of participants with 12-lead Holter ECG findings of normal (NL), abnormal not clinically significant (Abn NCS), and abnormal clinically significant (Abn CS) are reported. Abnormal ECG findings or change in ECG morphological patterns were based on the ECG interpretations provided by the ECG core lab. Three replicate 12-lead Holter ECGs were collected at -30, -15, and 0 minutes prior to the administration of study treatment on Days 1 (Baseline for placebo) and 3 (Baseline for lapatinib) and pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10,12, and 24 hours post dose on Days 2 and 4. The three readings at each time point were averaged prior to any analysis. Baseline is the pre-dose ECGs (triplicate) taken on Day 1 for placebo and on Day 3 for lapatinib.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Worst-case Post-Baseline 12-lead Holter ECG Findings With Significant ST, T Wave, and U Wave Abnormalities</title>
        <description>Abnormal ECG findings or change in ECG morphological patterns were based on the ECG interpretations provided by the ECG core lab. Three replicate Holter ECGs were collected at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior to the administration of study treatment on Days 1 (Baseline for placebo) and 3 (Baseline for lapatinib) and pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours post dose on Days 2 and 4. The three readings at each time point were averaged prior to any analysis. Baseline is the pre-dose ECGs (triplicate) taken on Day 1 for placebo and Day 3 for lapatinib. The number of participants with the worst-case post-Baseline 12-lead Holter ECG findings with significant ST, T wave, and U wave abnormalities were analyzed.</description>

        <description>The number of participants with the 12-lead ECG findings normal (NL), abnormal not clinically significant (Abn NCS), and abnormal clinically significant (Abn CS) are reported. Clinical significance was based on the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator or qualified designee. A single safety 12-lead ECG was performed using a standard 12-lead ECG machine at Baseline; on Day 1 (at pre-dose); on Day 2 (at pre-dose, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-last- dose); on Day 4 (at pre-dose, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-last-dose); at the End of Study visit (Day 8-11); and at the post-treatment Follow-up visit (if applicable).</description>

        <description>AUC is defined as the area under the lapatinib concentration-time curve as a measure of drug exposure. AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-24) were determined from the plasma concentration-time data using the linear trapezoidal rule for increased concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreased concentrations. For PK analysis, one blood sample was collected on Day 1 for placebo Baseline. The 24 hour blood sample on Day 2 also served for lapatinib Baseline. Pre-dose blood samples were collected 30 minutes prior to the administration of study medication on Day 2 (placebo) and Day 4 (lapatinib). Serial blood samples were collected on Day 2 (for placebo) and on Day 4 (for lapatinib) at the following post-last-dose time points 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours.</description>

        <description>For each participant, the time at which Cmax was observed (tmax) was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. For each participant, the time prior to the first quantifiable (non-zero) concentration (tlag) was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. Since all participants received 2 doses of study medication prior to the collection of the first (pre-dose) blood sample on Day 4, tlag was expected to be zero. For PK analysis, one blood sample was collected on Day 1 for placebo Baseline. The 24 hour blood sample on Day 2 also served for lapatinib Baseline. Pre-dose blood samples were collected 30 minutes prior to the administration of study medication on Day 2 (placebo) and Day 4 (lapatinib). Serial blood samples were collected on Day 2 (for placebo) and on Day 4 (for lapatinib) at the following post-last-dose time points 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours.</description>
