      OBJECTIVE: to determine whether preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is able to
      attenuate the impact of surgical trauma on the respiratory muscle strength, in the lung
      volumes and diaphragmatic excursion in obese women undergoing open bariatric surgery.

      Therefore, the hypothesis of the present study was that preoperative IMT is able to attenuate
      the negative effects of surgical trauma on the respiratory muscle strength, in the lung
      volumes and diaphragmatic excursion, thus reducing the risk of PPC, in obese patients
      undergoing open bariatric surgery.

      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Meridional Hospital, Cariacica/ES, Brazil.
      SUBJECTS: Thirty-two obese women undergoing elective open bariatric surgery were randomly
      assigned to receive preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT group) or usual care
      (control group).

      MAIN MEASURES: Respiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory pressure - MIP and maximal
      expiratory pressure - MEP), lung volumes and diaphragmatic excursion.
