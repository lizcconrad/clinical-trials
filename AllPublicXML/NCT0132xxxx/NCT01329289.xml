  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adding SOM230 LAR to bortezomib and
      dexamethasone is better than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and if it should be
      investigated further.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed symptomatic MM,
             Salmon-Durie Stage II or III, International Staging System II or III, or fulfill the
             CRAB criteria (see Appendix A, B). Patients should have previously been treated with
             at least one cycle of bortezomib, after which the patient has shown progressive or
             refractory disease. Finally, patients must meet at least one of the following
             parameters of measurable disease:

               -  Bone marrow plasmacytosis with&gt; 10% plasma cells, or sheets of plasma cells, or
                  biopsy proven plasmacytoma which must be obtained within 6 weeks prior to
                  registration.

               -  Measurable levels of monoclonal protein (M-protein): ≥ 1 g/dL on serum protein
                  electrophoresis (SPEP) or ≥ 200 mg of monoclonal light chain on a 24 hour urine
                  protein electrophoresis (UPEP) or involved FLC ≥ mg/dL (≥ 100 mg/L) which must be
                  obtained within 4 weeks prior to registration.

               -  Serum and urine M-protein levels should be determined by electrophoresis rather
                  than by quantitative immunoglobulin (Ig) measurement. Exceptions are made in
                  cases in which the M-spike value may be deemed to be unreliable ( e.g.
                  co-migrating M-spike). In these cases, quantitative Ig should be used. To assess
                  response and progression, however, SPEP values should only be compared to SPEP
                  values and quantitative Ig values only to quantitative Ig values.

          -  Patients must have received at least two prior anti-MM treatments. The prior
             treatments must include at least one IMiD (thalidomide or lenalidomide) and
             bortezomib. If patients are unable to tolerate thalidomide or lenalidomide they can be
             included without prior IMiD treatment. Patients may be included if they did not
             experience grade III neuropathy while on bortezomib. Patients may have previously
             received autologous or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

          -  Minimum of four weeks since any major surgery, completion of radiation, or completion
             of all prior systemic anticancer therapy. Exception: e.g. kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty,
             local radiation therapy for symptomatic bone lesions (e.g., uncontrolled pain or high
             risk of pathologic fracture).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%; see
             Appendix B).

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below, obtained
             within 4 weeks prior to registration:

               -  Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL (which may be supported by transfusion or growth factors)

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000 x 10-9/L

               -  Platelets ≥ 50,000 x 10-9/L

               -  PT/PTT &lt; 1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN)

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x (ULN)

               -  Hepatic:

        Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN

        Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase

          -  3 × ULN without liver metastases

          -  5 × ULN if documented liver infiltration

               -  Renal:

        Calculated creatinine clearance ≥40 ml/min according to the formula in Appendix D

          -  Cholesterol* ≤ 300 mg/dL

          -  Triglycerides (fasting)* ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          -  Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)** &lt; 1.5X ULN for FPG or HbA1c ≤ 8% *In case one or both
             of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of
             appropriate lipid lowering medication.

        At the principle investigator's discretion, non-eligible patients can be re-screened after
        adequate medical therapy has been instituted.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy
             test within 14 days of the administration of the first study treatment. Further, all
             women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use a
             medically effective contraception method throughout the treatment period and avoid
             conception while participating in this study. Women must not be lactating. Post
             menopausal patients and patients who had a bilateral oophorectomy need not take a
             pregnancy test.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Patient must be informed of the investigational nature of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or major surgery within 4 weeks
             prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from AEs due to
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or major surgery completed more than 4 weeks prior to
             registration. Exception: local radiation therapy for symptomatic bone lesions (e.g.,
             uncontrolled pain or high risk of pathologic fracture).

          -  Patients with any of the following cardiac abnormalities:

               -  QTcF at screening &gt; 450 msec

                  by diabetes, or Parkinson's disease), HIV, cirrhosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism
                  or cardiac failure

             within 5 half lives of the agent.

          -  Patients who require therapeutic (full) anticoagulation such as full dose low
             molecular weight heparin or Coumadin with a goal INR of 2-3.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases (treated or not) will be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other AEs.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to SOM230 LAR and/or bortezomib or other agents used
