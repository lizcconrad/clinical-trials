  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people suffering from alcohol dependence have a history of exposure to stressful life
      situations, such as childhood physical or emotional misuse. Often, there's a functional
      relationship between drinking and emotional problems related to past traumatic experiences,
      i.e. drinking to forget. However, alcohol treatment often does not include interventions to
      support patients to cope better with past life experiences. On the other hand, most
      alcoholics are poorly motivated to participate in long-term rehabilitative treatments after
      detoxification. In the proposed study, the investigators will study the effects of a brief
      psycho-educational group intervention during detoxification treatment on motivation to change
      and the willingness to accept further treatment.

      The investigators will use a group comparison design (intervention versus &quot;TAS&quot; control
      group). In month 1, patients take part in Treatment as Usual (TAS), including a unspecific
      information group. In month 2, the information group is replaced by the psychoeducational
      group (intervention). Ward staff selects patients for the groups, irrespective of
      intervention or TAS. Selection criteria are: absence of severe withdrawal and cognitive
      impairment. Absence of severe co-morbid psychiatric disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or suicidal
      crisis). The group sessions will take place in groups of up to 15 patients and will include 4
      structured sessions (45 min each). Main content if the intervention group is to highlight and
      discuss the association between stress, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and drinking. Patients
      will also be informed about the different treatment options available in the region.

      At entry, patients are asked to fill in the German versions of the University of Rhode Island
      Change Assessment (URICA; McConnaughy, Prochaska, &amp; Velicer, 1983; German: Heidenreich, Hoyer
      &amp; Fecht; 2001) and the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ; Green, 1996; German: Maercker,
      2002). At discharge, patients are asked to fill in the URICA.

      The investigators expect that specific information on the association between stress and
      drinking will increase the patients' motivation to participate in further treatment.

    <time_frame>Pre and Post (day 1, day 15 (average))</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-assessment is at entry in in-patient alcohol detoxification treatment, post-assessment is at day of discharge. On average, the two measurements are 15 days apart.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Detoxification treatment completion</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days (average treatment duration)</time_frame>
    <description>It was evaluated how many subjects in both treatment arms and among traumatized and non-traumatized in each arm ended the detoxification treatment prematurely, i.e. discharge against medical advice or disciplinary discharge.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>number of days in detoxification treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days (average treatment duration)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days in detoxification treatment is a simple count of days of treatment between day of detoxification treatment entry and day of discharge</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>between admission and discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were assessed during the detoxification treatment for patients taking part in the information group (TAU) or TARGET group (intervention), i.e. suicide attempts, psychiatric decompensation, aggressive behaviors, relapse of alcohol use. These events were recorded by the social worker who participated routinely in the three daily team meetings during which the situation of each patient was briefly discussed.</description>
