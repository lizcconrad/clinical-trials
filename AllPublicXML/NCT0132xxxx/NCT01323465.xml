    <textblock>
      Study to assess the effect of rifampicin, ketoconazole and omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics
      of a single dose of Sativex and to evaluate the safety of Sativex when given in combination
      with these other drugs.

    <textblock>
      An open-label, randomised, crossover, drug interaction study. Subjects were divided into
      three groups and within each group, subjects were randomised to one of two treatment
      sequences. Subjects received 4 sprays of Sativex alongside either doses of rifampicin,
      ketoconazole or omeprazole.
