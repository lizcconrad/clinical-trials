  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of the ultrasound to locate the
      epidural space and assist with performing neuraxial anesthesia will decrease numbers of the
      attempts required for successful placement of epidural catheter.

    <textblock>
      It is known that ultrasound can be useful to assist placement of epidural analgesia among
      pregnant women.extenseve research on the usefulness of ultrasound imaging to facilitate the
      placement of neuraxial anesthesia in pregnant have been done.The potential advantages of
      successful placement among non-pregnant patients include increases the safety and comfort.

      In our study all patients schedueld to receive an nueraxial anesthesia for non-obstetric
      surgery will be included.The investigator will request permission from the Helsinki committee
      of hadassah university hospital.Patients will be requesting for surgery and will be
      randomized to one of two study groups.One group will be passed neuraxial anesthesia on the
      standart technique and the secound group will be passed neuraxial anesthesia with the help of
      ultrasound.
