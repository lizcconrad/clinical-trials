      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ischia thermal waters nasal
      irrigation on allergic rhinitis and airway inflammation during the period of natural exposure
      to parietaria pollen in children with allergic rhinitis and intermittent asthma.

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted on the island of Ischia - Naples from April to June 2009, during the
      natural exposure period to parietaria pollen. The treatment started just before the pollen
      season, when all the children were asymptomatic, not treated with any drug and not affected
      by respiratory tract and systemic diseases. All the children were randomly divided into two
      homogeneous groups by sex and age. The first group has practiced crenotherapy with
      &quot;hyper-mineral chloride sodium water&quot; aerosol by nasal adapter for 15 days per month, for
      three consecutive months, at thermal spa services of Lacco Ameno, while the control group was
      treated, in the same period, daily, by a micronized nasal douche with 0.9% NaCl (isotonic)
      solution. Before the treatment (T0), at the end of the treatment (T1) and again 2 weeks after
      the end of the treatment (T2), all the children have performed spirometry (Pony FX Cosmed),
      and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (NIOX MINO analyzer COSMED), to assess their airway
      inflammation. At the time of recruitment, the parents of the children were instructed to fill
      a specific diary-card (TSS) at home, to assess rhinitis symptoms and possible drug use during
      all 3 months of treatment. The parameters considered in the TSS were: nasal obstruction,
      sneezing, nasal discharge and itching. These symptoms were scored: 0 = symptom absent, 1 =
      mild (symptoms present but not annoying), 2 = moderate (frequent and offensive symptoms but
      do not interfere with sleep or normal activities) 3 = severe (symptoms that interfere with
      sleep or normal activities).

      Every two weeks, at the end of each cycle of therapy the children underwent a general
      clinical control with nasal endoscopy, spirometry and monitoring the completion of diary
      cards and the possible use of drugs.

    <description>It's well known that allergic rhinitis is often associated with asthma. Allergic rhinitis and asthma are expressions of respiratory mucosal eosinophilic inflammation. Before the treatment (T0), at the end of the treatment (T1) and again 2 weeks after the end of the treatment (T2), all the children have performed spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (NIOX MINO analyzer COSMED), to assess their airway inflammation.</description>
