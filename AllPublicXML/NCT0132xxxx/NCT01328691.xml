  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has its propensity to invade the venous system, with extension
      into the renal vein and the inferior vena cava (IVC) in 23% and 7%, respectively. Despite
      advances in radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy the reference standard for RCC with
      tumor thrombus remains surgical resection. However, the 5-year survival rate for patients who
      have RCC with venous tumor thrombus treated with radical nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy
      is only 35% - 45%, despite the developments in surgical technique and perioperative care.
      Furthermore, even the 5-year survival rate for the patients without the evidence of nodal or
      distant metastasis at presentation is just 45% - 65%.

      The outcome prediction for RCC remains controversial, and although many parameters have been
      tested for prognostic significance, only a few have achieved widespread acceptance in
      clinical practice. Currently, pathologic stage (T stage), lymph node status (N stage) and
      histologic grade represent the main prognostic variables in the patients with RCC and venous
      tumor thrombus. Accordingly, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification
      is regularly revised and, recently, a new 2009 AJCC TNM stage classification system has been
      proposed.

      RCC is more prevalent in developed countries, such as Europe and North America. It is
      relatively less common in Asia; however, the incidence in these regions appears to have risen
      over the past decade. Recently, a few series have suggested that racial or ethnic differences
      in survival persist after controlling for age and stage in some cancers. In the case of renal
      cell carcinoma, it has been demonstrated that the malignancy diagnosed in various ethnic
      groups had different clinical characteristics: the presenting symptoms, the course of
      disease, and the outcome after standard treatment varied significantly between patients of
      Caucasian, Hispanic, African-American, and Asian backgrounds. A recent study has reported
      that race as well as established factors has an impact on survival in patients with RCC and
      Asian Pacific Islander ethnicity was predictive of improved overall or cancer specific
      survival.

      Up to date, there was sparse data on surgical outcome and prognostic factors of survival
      after radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy in an Asian population with RCC and venous tumor
      thrombus, while most studies have been performed in Western countries. The aim of the present
      study was to address the surgical outcome after radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy and to
      evaluate the prognostic factors influencing on survival in Korean patients with RCC and tumor
      thrombus extension into renal vein or IVC, labeled as T3a and T3b-c by the newly revised 2009
      AJCC TNM staging system, respectively.
