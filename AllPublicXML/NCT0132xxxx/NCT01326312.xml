      The purpose of this study is to determine whether GTx 758 is effective in achieving and
      maintaining castrate testosterone levels in men with advanced prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancers among men in the
      US and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths. Patients with advanced prostate
      cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), by either LHRH agonists, LHRH antagonists,
      DES and other nonselective estrogens, or by bilateral orchiectomy. ADT by LHRH agonists, LHRH
      antagonists, or bilateral orchiectomy not only reduces testosterone, but also substantially
      lowers estrogen levels as estrogen is derived from the aromatization of testosterone.
      ADT-induced estrogen deficiency causes significant side effects which include hot flushes,
      gynecomastia, bone loss, decreases in bone quality and strength, osteoporosis and
      life-threatening fractures, adverse lipid changes, increase in body fat composition, and
      higher cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction, and depression and other mood
      changes.

      GTx-758 is a nonsteroidal selective ER agonist that suppresses LH secretion by the pituitary
      by feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis to induce castrate levels
      of testosterone. However, because it is a selective ER agonist, GTx-758 may maintain bone,
      does not induce hot flushes, avoids adverse lipid changes and body fat composition changes,
      and does not have the acute testosterone surge that are associated with other forms of ADT.
