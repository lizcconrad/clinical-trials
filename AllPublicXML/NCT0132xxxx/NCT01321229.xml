  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sleep respiratory troubles (central apnea or CHEYNES-Stokes dyspnea) are frequent after
      stroke. The association of the sleep respiratory troubles with a reserved functional
      prognosis is debated. The purpose is to find out the frequency of the sleep respiratory
      troubles after stroke in a PRM department and to study their relationship with functional and
      neurological recovery.

      The sleep respiratory troubles (central apnea or CHEYNES-Stokes dyspnea) are frequent after
      stroke. The association of the sleep respiratory troubles with a reserved functional
      prognosis is debated. The purpose is to find out the frequency of the sleep respiratory
      troubles after stroke in a PRM department and to study their relationship with functional and
      neurological recovery.

      Forty-five patients with the average of 58,2 years had been included in this prospective
      MONOCENTRICAL study. The detection of the sleep respiratory troubles was realised using a
      nocturnal oxymetry device and measuring the inspiratory flow, gathering the index of
      apnea-hypopnea.

      The NIHSS, the FIM and the FUGL-MEYER scales were used at the moment of inclusion and two
      months AFTERWORDS.
