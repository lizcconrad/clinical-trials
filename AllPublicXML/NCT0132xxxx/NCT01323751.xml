        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM with measurable disease parameters
             according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria

               -  Refractory is defined as experiencing less than minimal response (MR) to or
                  progressive disease (PD) within 60 days after completion of the most recent
                  anti-MM regimen

               -  Relapsed is defined as experiencing PD that requires therapy but which is not
                  refractory following the achievement of stable disease (SD) or better to the most
                  recent anti-MM regimen.

          -  Patient received prior treatment for MM with a proteasome inhibitor and an
             immunomodulatory drug, unless not a candidate for a proteasome inhibitor or an
             immunomodulatory drug.

          -  Patient either is not a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), has
             declined the option of ASCT, or has relapsed after prior ASCT.
