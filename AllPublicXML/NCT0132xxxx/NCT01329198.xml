      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether a particular type of Deep Brain Stimulation
      (DBS), scheduled Deep Brain stimulation (SBS), is an effective and safe treatment for
      Tourettte syndrome (TS).

      The trial will also examine the brain activity associated with TS and tics and explore the
      possibility of responsive brain stimulation (RBS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DBS is a surgical procedure that seeks to change the brain's electrical signalling by means
      of applied electrical current. To this end, a wire with tiny stimulating electrodes is
      implanted into one or both sides of the brain. An electrode is a small piece of metal used to
      take an electric current to or from a power source. These electrodes are connected under the
      skin on the scalp to a small electrical unit called an INS (implantable neurostimulator),
      which is similar to a heart pacemaker. The device sends out electrical impulses that appear
      to change the normal flow of electricity in the brain.

      The wires which house the electrodes will be implanted on both sides of the brain oriented
      towards the centromedian thalamus-parafascicular complex. This region of the brain has to
      date the greats number of documented cases revealing significant improvements in motor tics.

      This region of the brain will also provide a target where physiological changes related to
      motor tics are likely to be discovered.

      The device we propose for this study has several features that make it more suitable for use
      in the TS population than other devices. It is self-contained in the skull and brain, and
      contains no tunneled neck connector wire and no chest pacemaker deice. This will help to
      lessen infection, and will assist in limiting device-related fractures due to tics involving
      neck region. Also, the system can record electro-encephalograph data from the area of the
      electrodes, which will assist us in gathering information about what specific physiological
      changes are correlated with tics.

    <measure>Mean Change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Scores From Baseline to 6 Months Across All Study Participants Presented</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) is a semistructured clinician-rated instrument that assesses the severity and frequency of motor and phonic tics over the previous week. Five index scores are obtained during the assessment, where higher scores indicate greater frequency or severity. These indices are:
Total Motor Tic Score (0-25)
Total Phonic Tic Score (0-25
Total Tic Score (0-50)
Overall Impairment Rating (0-50)
Global Severity Score (0-7)
The YGTSS Total Score is obtained by adding the Total Tic Score to the Overall Impairment Rating. The efficacy of the intervention will be assessed by comparing each subject's 6-month YGTSS Total Score to the pre-operative value for the same patient. Efficacy is considered 50% or greater reduction in this score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of Tics and Neural Physiology</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Electrical recordings of electroencephalography activity were taken from each subject's implanted leads at each visit from baseline to 6 months. At baseline, the recordings were taken with the device in the off state (not stimulating), while at the 6 month visits the recordings were taken with the subject's device set to optimal parameters for tic control. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient, the variations in frequency and power which were observed were correlated with the Yale Global Tic Severity (YGTSS) scores obtained during primary outcome testing.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Scores From Baseline to 6 Months Across All Study Participants Presented</title>
        <description>The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) is a semistructured clinician-rated instrument that assesses the severity and frequency of motor and phonic tics over the previous week. Five index scores are obtained during the assessment, where higher scores indicate greater frequency or severity. These indices are:
Total Motor Tic Score (0-25)
Total Phonic Tic Score (0-25
Total Tic Score (0-50)
Overall Impairment Rating (0-50)
Global Severity Score (0-7)
The YGTSS Total Score is obtained by adding the Total Tic Score to the Overall Impairment Rating. The efficacy of the intervention will be assessed by comparing each subject's 6-month YGTSS Total Score to the pre-operative value for the same patient. Efficacy is considered 50% or greater reduction in this score.</description>

At baseline, the recordings were taken with the device in the off state (not stimulating), while at the 6 month visits the recordings were taken with the subject's device set to optimal parameters for tic control. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient, the variations in frequency and power which were observed were correlated with the Yale Global Tic Severity (YGTSS) scores obtained during primary outcome testing.</description>
