    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of CO2 insufflations during ERCP

        1. Primary objective:

           To assess the patient's symptoms, abdominal pain and abdominal distension post procedure
           (ERCP) in the study group.

        2. Secondary objective:

      Endoscopist:

        -  To assess the adequacy of bowel distension for adequate luminal visualization

        -  To assess the peristaltic movement during the ERCP

      Anesthetist:

        -  To measure the PCO2 level in patient post procedure.

        -  To assess the amount of sedation required during the procedure.

        -  To assess saturation and vital signs through out the procedure.

        -  To assess requirement of buscopan.
