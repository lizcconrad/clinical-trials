  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) occurs when a tissue (ex. heart) becomes less
      vulnerable to an ischemic insult if a remote tissue (ex. arm) has had previous exposure to a
      period of ischemia and reperfusion. A beneficial effect of RIPC has been demonstrated in
      several randomized studies in patients undergoing cardiac and vascular surgery, as well as
      interventional cardiac procedures such as angioplasty. They have shown improvements in
      cardiac, renal, neurologic and respiratory function. Most have focused on surrogate outcomes,
      such as biochemical markers of cardiac and renal function in low-risk patients. No trials
      have investigated only high-risk patients or been designed to detect clinical outcomes.

      This study is a randomized-controlled trial powered to detect clinical events in a high-risk
      cohort undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Patients will be randomized to RIPC (exposed to
      cycles of inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm prior to undergoing surgery) or
      control (no ischemic stimulus).

      The investigators hypothesize this population will demonstrate lower rates of adverse
      ischemic events. The investigators also intend to sample biochemical markers to better
      elucidate the mechanism of RIPC and generate hypotheses for future studies and interventions.
      Post-operatively the investigators will monitor for adverse clinical outcomes including
      cardiac, renal, pulmonary and neurologic injury.

      RIPC is simple, inexpensive and easily reproducible and there have been no reports of adverse
      consequences. Post-operative ischemic events such as stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac,
      renal and respiratory failure affect patient survival and quality of life, and represent a
      sizeable financial burden to health care. If beneficial effects of RIPC are demonstrated, it
      will be widely applicable to the entire population of cardiac and vascular patients resulting
      in a widely-implemented change in practice.

    <description>The intervention will consist of 3 cycles of 5 minutes of upper limb ischemia. The RIPC stimulus will be performed using a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm inflated above systemic pressure to 200 mmHg for 5 minutes, then deflated for 5 minutes. Ischemia will be assured with the use of a saturation probe on the digit of the involved arm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Undergoing either cardiac or vascular surgical procedures and are deemed to be at
             increased risk of suffering adverse ischemia-related events (judged by pre-operative
             evidence of clinical ischemic conditions, pre-operative screening indicating
             cardiovascular disease or undergoing higher-risk surgery).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Will not include emergency cases, patients with known vascular disease (ex. arterial
             occlusive disease, arterio-venous shunts) or neurologic disease affecting the upper
             limb and patients unable to give informed consent.
