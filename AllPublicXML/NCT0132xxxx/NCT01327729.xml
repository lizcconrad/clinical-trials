      The objective is to assess the efficacy, dosing, safety and tolerance of Y- shaped pegylated
      interferon (YPEG-IFNα-2a) plus ribavirin in Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C and
      with no prior treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV).

      Methods: Randomized, Open-label trial, in 3 parallel groups (each of 100 patients)

      Methods: Randomized, Open-label trial, in parallel groups (each of 100 patients). Treatment
      will be given for 48 weeks (positive HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) patients at 24
      weeks will be considered non responders) and follow-up for 24 weeks. Total treatment and
      follow-up duration: 72 weeks. Enrollment duration: 18 months. Total trial duration: 2 years
      and 9 month, including trial analysis (carried out in the 6 months following the follow-up
      completion of the last patient). Total number of patients: 300. Precision around the expected
      efficacy rate (45% in intention-to-treat analysis) will be 9.6% (α = 0.05).

      Primary objective: to assess the efficacy, dosing, safety and tolerability of Y- shaped
      pegylated interferon (YPEG-IFNα-2a) plus ribavirin in Egyptian patients with chronic
      hepatitis C and with no prior treatment for HCV.

      Secondary objective: To assess the plasma level of the YPEG-IFNα-2a in the first 30 patients
      in each group, to ensure therapeutic plasma level of the drug at 2 hours, 6 hours, 10 hours,
      24 hours, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days and 28 days.

      Treatment strategy:

      Three groups in which each group will include 100 patients.

      The first group will be treated with:

      YPEG-IFN α-2a 180mcg/week for 48 weeks. Ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day for 48 weeks.

      The second group will be treated with:

      YPEG-IFN α-2a 180mcg/10 days for 48 weeks. Ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day for 48 weeks.

      The third group will be treated with:

      YPEG-IFN α-2a 180mcg/ 2 weeks for 48 weeks. Ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day for 48 weeks. HCV RNA by
      PCR will be done at 24 weeks and negative PCR patients will continue treatment for another 24
      weeks and PCR positive patients will be considered non responders and will be followed up.

      Evaluation of the dose efficacy and side effects will be obtained at 4 weeks and 12 weeks of
      treatment, and any serious side effects or significant dose difference in early virological
      response in a group will lead to shift of this group to the dose 180 mcg/week.

      Main outcome:

      Viral clearance by qualitative HCV RNA based on PCR 24 weeks after the end of treatment.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Evaluation of HCV RNA at 12 and 24 weeks; changes in HCV RNA load during treatment;
      normalization of ALT during treatment and 24 weeks after the end of treatment; study of side
      effects; histological changes 24 weeks after the end of treatment: decrease by at least 1
      point of the Metavir score.
