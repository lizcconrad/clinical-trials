      The purpose of this study is to provide safety information and to define the optimal
      induction and short term maintenance regimen for GSK2315698 to deplete circulating SAP in
      healthy volunteers prior to assessing in patients

      This single centre, open label, dose escalation study is designed to assess safety (including
      adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests), and pharmacokinetic
      /pharmacodynamic parameters in healthy volunteers. Subjects will attend for 3 sessions:
      session 1 is a single intravenous (IV) infusion over a short time period to confirm the
      safety of a single dose of GSK2315698 over a wide dose range, sessions 2 and 3 will
      investigate IV infusion regimens over 24 hours (induction phase followed by maintenance
      phase). The dosing regimen will be adjusted adaptively to optimise the induction and
      maintenance phases of the dosing regimen. amyloidosis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and
             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. (As a precaution a pregnancy test
             will be conducted prior to dosing; a positive test will lead to exclusion).

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

        An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is
        equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125 ml) of wine or 1
        (25 ml) measure of spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 3 months, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Previous surgical procedures on the upper digestive tract including cholecystectomy
             (gallbladder removal), and/or cholelithotomy (gallstone removal).

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
