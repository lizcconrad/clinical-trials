      The purpose of this open-label, postmarket study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) performed with EsophyX in a broad range of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients treated at high volume centers across the
      United States.

      This open-label, postmarket study evaluates the safety and efficacy of transoral incisionless
      fundoplication (TIF) performed with EsophyX in a broad range of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) patients treated at high volume centers across the United States, in clinical
      routine practice, as standard of care.

    <description>Esophageal acid exposure will be measured objectively by 48-hour Bravo pH or 24-hour impedance/pH testing at the follow-up (where pH testing is available). Normalization of esophageal acid exposure will be defined by total time with pH &lt; 4 for ≤ 6% of 24-hour or for ≤ 5.3% of 48-hour monitoring period. The number of reflux episodes of ≤ 44 per each 24-hour period will be considered normal.</description>

    <description>Intervention:
Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication:
With patient in general anesthesia. The EsophyX device is introduced through the mouth, over a standard endoscope, into the stomach. Multiple gastro -esophageal plications are performed, apposing the fundus to the distal part of the esophagus and repositioning the GEJ below the diaphragm, into the abdomen. multiple prolene fasteners are used to sescure and keep in place the plications.</description>
