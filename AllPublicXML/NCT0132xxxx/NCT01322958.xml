    <textblock>
      Emergency Physicians who have undergone training according to the American College of
      Emergency Physicians Guidelines will be evaluated in the accuracy of performing pelvic
      ultrasounds among patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy.

    <description>To measure the outcome of the study, we will base our results on Sensitivity and Specificity.
Sensitivity which relates to the number of positive results defined as no intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic pregnancy compared to the Radiologic Gold standard ultrasound which provides us 100% sensitivity. The goal is to reach a sensitivity of (&gt;95%) by our ED physicians.
Specificity which will be defined as the number of negative studies identified as intrauterine pregnancies compared to the results of the Gold standard radiology ultrasound and by telephone follow up.</description>
