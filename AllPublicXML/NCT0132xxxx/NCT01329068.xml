  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carriers of a BRCA mutation have a significantly increased risk to develop breast cancer in
      the course of their lives . They face a difficult choice: either a preventive removal of the
      breast(s) or an intensive inspection process.

      After primary treatment of breast cancer, patients will be followed for 5-10 years to
      diagnose recurrence or a new primary tumor in an early stage; to support the patient during
      hormonal treatment; to educate the patient about risk factors and healthy life style; and to
      provide psychosocial support.

      Currently, follow-up of breast cancer patients and surveillance of BRCA mutation carriers is
      offered in regular, one-to-one medical visits. Experience shows that in an individual visit
      it is often not possible to give all aspects that are important, enough attention. The group
      medical consultation (GMC) is a new form of medical visits where the physician or nurse
      practitioner performs a series of one-to-one consultations in the presence of 8 to10 other
      patients. A social worker accompanies this process. Patients in group consultations may
      gather more information because they learn from each other and there is relatively more time
      compared to a regular consultation. Research shows that both patients and caregivers are more
      satisfied with care after a group consultation compared to individual visits. After a GMC the
      participants from the breast cancer GMCs will be provided with a dedicated iPad for 3 months.
      Using this iPad, patients can contact the women they have met during the GMC as well as
      health care professionals by several communication channels, including virtual group
      meetings. This approach provides a unique combination of both social support and professional
      education concerning survivorship in an e-health environment.However, it is also known that
      group sessions may be counterproductive for some patients, for example because they are
      frightened by the stories of others. The goal of this study is to examine whether group
      visits (in combination with dedicated iPads) are beneficial to women with a BRCA mutation and
      for patients in follow-up after breast cancer.
