    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence of immune response against diphtheria, tetanus,
      pertussis and poliomyelitis in healthy adults, 10 years after a booster dose, and also assess
      the immunogenicity and safety of another booster dose of BoostrixTM Polio.

          -  Male or female subjects who have received vaccine in study NCT01277705.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study and receive the
             booster vaccine, if the subject:

               -  practices/has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination,
                  and

               -  fever ≥ 40°C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable
                  cause,

               -  collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination,

               -  convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the booster dose or planned administration during the study period.
