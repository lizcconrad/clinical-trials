      Purpose and objective: To identify in the early post-operative period following laparoscopic
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients likely to fail to progressively lose weight in expected
      fashion, and to institute intervention and assess for its efficacy.

      Study activities and population group: Patients identified to have &quot;poor weight loss&quot; (â‰¤ 11%
      of excess weight loss) at 1 month will be randomized into a control versus study group.
      Intervention for subjects randomized to the IV arm will be by enrollment in the Back on Track
      program. This is a seven-week group education, counseling, nutrition, exercise, and
      journaling program of the Duke Weight Loss Surgery Center designed to help postoperative
      bariatric surgery patients who are failing to progressively lose weight resume an expected
      pattern of weight loss and improved overall outcome.

      Data analysis and risk/safety: Data will be collected and analyzed by the identified
      investigators. The goal of data analysis is to uncover any difference in the EWL of subjects
      who underwent intervention for falling in the lowest EWL quartile when compared with those
      who did not undergo intervention, and determine the statistical significance of any such
      difference. There are no physical risks associated with this study. There is, however, the
      potential risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep your information
      confidential.

    <description>Weeks 1 and 2 consist primarily of a review of current dietary habits with initiation of a food journal; a basic review of macronutrients and metabolism; and the beginning of a weekly exercise regimen. Weeks 3, 4, &amp; 5 introduces counseling, with specific emphasis on emotional aspects of eating and behavioral modification strategies. Week 6 focuses on the metabolic impact of exercise, and includes an exercise session with a personal trainer. Week 7 incorporates a question and answer session with a sharing of discoveries, as well as an option for additional individual follow-up as needed. During this period, patients will also be given access to an interactive web-based tool providing additional emphasis on the aforementioned components and clinician follow-up.</description>
