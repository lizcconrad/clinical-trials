    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective single-arm trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the
      Axium MicroFX coil system in 99 patients at 13 study centers. The primary endpoint of the
      trial was the anatomic occlusion of the aneurysm in the immediate post-procedure angiogram
      basedon the Raymond classification. Secondary endpoints included safety during the procedure,
      safety after the procedure, detachment system performance, stability of the embolization, and
      packing efficacy.

        All patients presenting with an intracranial aneurysm will be evaluated by the neuro
        interventional team, in accordance with institutional practice, to establish an appropriate
        treatment plan based on the patient's medical condition and available diagnostic screening
        prior to recruitment
