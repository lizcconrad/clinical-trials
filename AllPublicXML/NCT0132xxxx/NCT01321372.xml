  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematology patients are at high risk for invasive fungal infection (IFI) and are being
      treated with voriconazole (VOR) at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH). It is critical that
      patients' serum drug levels are within therapeutic ranges when undergoing treatment. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine whether clinical responses
      (complete/partial/failure) directly correlate with patients' blood VOR drug levels.

      In patients whose disease progression is associated with inadequate voriconazole (VOR) drug
      levels, serum drug level determination can allow for dose adjustment, thereby preventing
      disease progression. Patients who are extensive metabolizers may have subtherapeutic VOR
      levels leading to treatment failure whereas, poor metabolizers may have high drug levels that
      cause toxicity. Isoenzyme such as CYP2C19 exhibits genetic polymorphism. Genotyping tests can
      also be helpful in determining patient risk subjecting to extreme spectrum of drug levels.
