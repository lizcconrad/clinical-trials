    <description>Patients will receive BBI608 orally continuously at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. A treatment cycle will be 4 weeks (28 days). BBI608 will be administered twice daily. On days 3, 10, and 17 of each 28 day cycle, patients will receive a 1 hour infusion of paclitaxel. Cycles will be repeated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, adjustment is permitted.</description>

             chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease; c. EGFR-positive or
             ALK-positive patients must have received at least one line of EGFR-directed or
             ALK-directed therapy, respectively; d. Must have received prior taxane therapy.

          7. Patients with adenocarcinoma arising from the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or
             stomach must also meet the following criteria: a. Must have received prior treatment
             with a platinum/fluoropyrimidine-based therapy with or without an anthracycline in the
             metastatic setting; or, in the adjuvant setting if recurrence occurred within 6 months
             of completing systemic adjuvant treatment; b. Patients with HER2 positive tumors must
             have had prior treatment with a Her2 inhibitor (e.g. trastuzumab or lapatinib); c.
