    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn how to make homes more supportive of healthy eating and
      physical activity. As part of the study, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. One group will receive materials with information on healthy eating and physical
      activity. The materials will be mailed 3 times over a 5 month period. The other group will
      work with a coach to make their homes more supportive of healthy eating and physical
      activity. Working with a coach involves 3 home visits and 4 coaching telephone calls over a 5
      month period. This group will also receive materials by mail 4 different times. All
      participants will be asked to complete 7 telephone interviews over a 1 year period.
      Participants will also be asked to wear an accelerometer, a small portable device that tracks
      movement from physical activity, for 7 days at 2 different points in the study.

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will work with coaches to make their homes more supportive of healthy eating and physical activity. Each intervention participant will receive a tailored home environment profile, and will select from a &quot;menu&quot; of healthy actions to make changes in their home. The intervention will be delivered over the course of 5 months, with 3 home visits, 4 coaching calls, and 4 support mailings.</description>
