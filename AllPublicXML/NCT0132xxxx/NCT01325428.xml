  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib alone and
      in combination with weekly vinorelbine (in patients who progress on afatinib monotherapy
      within this trial) as treatment in patients with HER2-overexpressing, locally advanced or
      metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. The study will include patients who have and have not
      failed prior trastuzumab treatment.
