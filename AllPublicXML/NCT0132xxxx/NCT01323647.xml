  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the persistence of anti-poliovirus antibodies in toddlers aged 18
      months who were primed with oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in
      the primary study. The study will also assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a
      booster dose of IPV in subjects primed with three doses of IPV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will also receive a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' DTPa/Hib vaccine
      (Infanrix+Hib) at Day 0. This vaccine will be provided as part of the local standard of care
      and will not be associated with any study endpoint.

    <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 pain = Cry when limb was moved/spontaneously painful. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 30 millimeters (mm) of injection site.

    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any was defined as an adverse event (AE) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms was reported as an unsolicited adverse event.

        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed include drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever (defined as axillary temperature ≥37.0°C). Any was defined as incidence of the specified symptoms regardless of intensity or relationship to study vaccine. Grade 3 drowsiness was defined as drowsiness that prevents normal activities. Grade 3 fever was defined as fever (axillary temperature) &gt;39.0°C. Grade 3 irritability was defined as crying more than usual/ interferes with normal activities. Grade 3 loss of appetite was defined as not eating at all. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.
