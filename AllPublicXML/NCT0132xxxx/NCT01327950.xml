  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy and integrity of the EPICTM Nitinol Vascular Stent System in Superficial Femoral
      Artery (SFA) lesions. A total of 100 patients will be included in approximately 10 sites. The
      study is designed to demonstrate the EPIC Nitinol Vascular Stent System is non- inferior to
      the published patency rates found in the literature. This non-inferiority will be established
      by proving that the true rate for the EPICTM Nitinol Vascular Stent System is higher than 82%
      minus a 10% delta.

             non-target lesion before or after the study procedure

          -  If the patient has an ipsilateral iliac lesion,the lesion can be treated as a non
