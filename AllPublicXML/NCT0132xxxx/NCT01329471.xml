      The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of RUNX1 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),
      in particular, the transcriptional regulation of genes by mutated forms of this protein. This
      research will study the effect of mutations found in AML patients

    <textblock>
      The RUNX1 gene, located at chromosomal band 21q22, is a transcription factor, crucial for
      hematopoiesis and the generation of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo. RUNX1 is the most
      frequent target for chromosomal translocation in leukemia. In addition, point mutations in
      the RUNX1 gene have been found to constitute an important mode of genetic alteration in
      development of leukemia. Recent publications stressing the clinical need for implementing
      RUNX1 point mutations as both a diagnostic and unfavorable prognostic marker of AML, have
      aroused particular interest in the functional role of RUNX1 in this disease.

      In order to pinpoint specific RUNX1 target genes involved in pre-leukemic transformation or
      exacerbation of existing leukemia, the investigators plan to compare expression profiles from
      human hematopoietic progenitors overexpressing a mutated form of RUNX1with controls (RUNX1
      wild-type and knocked-down). In this study the investigators intend to collect blood, after
      receiving informed consent, from umbilical cords of neonates born vaginally, in order to
      isolate CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. Human umbilical cord blood contains relatively high
      numbers of CD34+ cells, which may be frozen directly after collection and used as a source of
      progenitor cells for further culture or direct analysis.
