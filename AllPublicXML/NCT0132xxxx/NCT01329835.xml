  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prepregnancy obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30kg/mÂ² or more, shows a strong
      association with pregnancy and birth complications for both the mother and her child. Most
      consequently reported maternal risks include an increased risk for gestational diabetes,
      hypertension and pre-eclampsia, increased incidence of induction of labour, operative
      delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, anaesthetic risks as well as risk for infections and
      thromboembolic complications. Fetal risks include miscarriage, neural-tube defects, heart
      defects, macrosomia and stillbirth. Initiation and continuation of breastfeeding is more
      complicated in obese women than in normal weight women. Also in later life chronic diseases
      can put the mother and her baby's health at risk. The Institute Of Medicine (IOM) guidelines
      suggest a gestational weight gain (GWG) to be limited to 5 - 9 kg (11-19,8 lb) in obese women
      in order to minimize the synergetic negative health consequences of excessive weight gain for
      both the obese mother and her child. Preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy and
      postpartum weight retention is also important in the prevention of overweight and obesity
      among women of reproductive age. Obese women in general have a poor diet quality and are more
      exposed to psychosocial factors like anxiety and feelings of depression than normal weight
      women.

      The aim of this project is to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in order to
      evaluate the effects of life-style intervention (psycho-education by a midwife during 4
      prenatal sessions) on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Main dependent variables are gestational
      weight gain and anxiety and depression. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor and optimizing an
      adequate gestational weight gain with attention to psycho-social factors, can reduce the need
      for adverse perinatal outcomes.
