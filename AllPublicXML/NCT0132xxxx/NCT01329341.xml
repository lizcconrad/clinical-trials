      The purpose of this study is to evaluate use of service dogs for individuals who have been
      diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Objectives include: (1) assess the
      impact service dogs have on the mental health and quality of life of Veterans; (2) to provide
      recommendations to the VA to serve as guidance in providing service dogs to Veterans; and (3)
      To determine cost associated with total health care utilization and mental health care
      utilization among Veterans with PTSD.
