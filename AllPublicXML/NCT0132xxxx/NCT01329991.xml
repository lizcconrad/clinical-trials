    <description>Subjects will take oral doses of PLX5622 once a day for 14 days. Physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), adverse events, hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be used to assess safety throughout Day 1-14 of the study, Day 17 and the follow up study visit on day 22. Adverse events will be monitored and reviewed for safety issues/abnormal changes in the above mentioned tests.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years old with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis by ACR
             criteria for ≥ 3 months.

          -  Prior to Day 1, patients must be on oral or subcutaneous methotrexate (≥10 mg/week and
             ≤ 25 mg/week) for at least 12 weeks (with a stable dose for at least 4 weeks) and
             folate (≥ 5 mg/week) for at least 6 weeks, and willing to continue on this regimen for
             the duration of the study.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 X
             109/L, Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 100 X 109/L, AST/ALT WNL, albumin ≥ 3 g/dL,
             calculated CrCl&gt;60 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault formula).

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days

             first dose of study drug through 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug, or use of
             a condom with instructions to the female partner of child-bearing potential to also be
             protected as above.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study-related
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of biologic response modifiers within the following periods prior to Day 1: 4
             weeks for Kineret (anakinra) and Enbrel (etanercept); 12 weeks for Remicade
             (infliximab), Humira (adalimumab), Simponi (golimumab), Orencia (abatacept), Actemra
             (tocilizumab), or Cimzia (certolizumab); 12 months for Rituxan (rituximab).

          -  Use of Arava (leflunomide) within 12 weeks prior to Day 1 or any immunosuppressive
             agents, including hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine, within 4 weeks of Day 1.

          -  Investigational drug use within 4 weeks of Day 1.

          -  Positive urine drug screen for drugs of abuse (except for opiates if being used for
             RA).

          -  Concomitant use of DMARDs (other than methotrexate), biological response modifiers, or
             known strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see Appendix 2).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant
             bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption.

          -  QTc ≥ 450 msec at Screening.

          -  The presence of a medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, makes the patient inappropriate for inclusion in this study.
