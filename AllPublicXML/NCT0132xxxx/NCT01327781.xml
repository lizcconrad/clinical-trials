      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of Z-endoxifen hydrochloride in
      treating patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that has spread to
      other places in the body (metastatic) or has come back at or near the same place as the
      original tumor (locally recurrent). Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells.
      Hormone therapy using Z-endoxifen hydrochloride may fight breast cancer by blocking the use
      of estrogen by tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To determine either the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Z-endoxifen hydrochloride or the
      dose level associated with endoxifen steady state concentration (Css) of at least 2 uM in
      women with metastatic estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. (Dose Escalation
      Cohort) II. To describe the safety profile of Z-endoxifen (Z-endoxifen hydrochloride) at each
      of the doses examined. (Dose Escalation Cohort) III. To evaluate changes in vision after 2
      cycles of treatment. (Dose Escalation Cohort) IV. To gather preliminary data on the clinical
      benefit in terms of tumor response rate and progression-free survival. (Dose Escalation
      Cohort) V. To evaluate the changes in the frequency and severity of hot flashes after 2
      cycles of treatment. (Expansion Cohort) VI. Evaluate changes in irritability scale using a
      validated irritability questionnaire. (Expansion Cohort) VII. To evaluate changes in markers
      of bone formation and absorption after 2 cycles of treatment. (Expansion Cohort) XIII. To
      evaluate changes in vision after 2 cycles of treatment. (Expansion Cohort).

      IX. To further characterize the safety profile of Z-endoxifen. (Expansion Cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of Z-endoxifen at each
      of the doses examined.

      II. For patients beginning in dose level 7 as well as the expansion cohorts, we will describe
      any changes in tumor expression of ER (both full length and truncated forms), progesterone
      receptor (PR), steroid receptor co-activator (SRC)1, SRC3, as well as the insulin-like growth
      factor receptor (IGF)1R/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral
      Oncogene Homolog 1 (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and
      proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki67) after 1 cycle of treatment (approximately 28
      days).

      III. To determine the frequency of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations and the presence of
      antitumor activity (response rate and progression free survival [PFS]) in all patients whose
      tumors harbor ESR1 alterations.

      IV. To determine whether the ESR1 mutations identified in pre-treatment tumor biopsies can be
      detected in matched plasma cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the same patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by an expansion cohort study.

      Patients receive Z-endoxifen hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then at 3
      months.
