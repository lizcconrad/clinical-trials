        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be included in the study:

        Dose-escalation cohorts (Phase 1b):

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer that is advanced and/or metastatic

          2. Resistant/refractory to approved therapies (defined as progressive disease during or
             within 6 months after the last anti-cancer therapy) or for whom single agent
             capecitabine at this dose level and schedule would be a reasonable treatment option in
             the opinion of the investigator

          3. For subjects that previously received capecitabine, all capecitabine related
             toxicities must have completely resolved

          4. Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater
             than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL (this may
             have been corrected by growth factor or transfusion), and platelet count greater than
             or equal to 100 x 10^9/L

          5. Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 x ULN (in the case
             of liver metastases less than or equal to 5 x ULN). In case AP is greater than 3 x ULN
             (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver
             metastases) AND subject also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific AP
             must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the
             total AP.

          6. Adequate renal function as evidenced by calculated creatinine clearance greater than
             or equal to 50 mL/min as per the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Appendix 1) or radioisotope
             measurement.

          7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum beta hCG at
             Visit 1 (Screening) and prior to starting study drugs on Day 1. Female subjects of
             childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use highly effective methods
             of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide,
             intrauterine device (IUD), or have a vasectomized partner) having starting for at
             least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire
             study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study
             drug. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional
             approved method of contraception (as described previously). Perimenopausal women must
             be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential.

          8. Male subjects who are not abstinent or have not undergone a successful vasectomy, who
             are partners of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use,
             a highly affective method of contraception (e.g. condom + spermicide, condom +
             diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to
             starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer
             if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Those with partners using hormonal
             contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as
             described previously)

          9. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

         10. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol

         11. Provide written informed consent

             to 2

         13. Males and females, age greater than or equal to18 years

        Dose-confirmation cohorts (Phase 2):

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast that is advanced
             and/or metastatic

          2. Received up to three prior chemotherapy regimens in any setting (sequential
             neoadjuvant/ adjuvant treatment counting as one regimen)

          3. Chemotherapy regimens must have included an anthracycline (unless anthracycline
             containing chemotherapy is inappropriate) and a taxane, either in combination or in
             separate regimens

          4. No prior treatment with capecitabine in any setting

          5. At least one lesion of greater than or equal to 1.5cm in longest diameter for
             non-lymph nodes and greater than or equal to 1.5cm in shortest diameter for lymph
             nodes which is serially measurable according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 7

          6. Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater
             than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL (this may
             have been corrected by growth factor or transfusion), and platelet count greater than
             or equal to 100 x 10^9/L

          7. Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the
             upper limits of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal 3 x ULN (in the case of
             liver metastases less than or equal to 5 x ULN). In case AP is greater than 3 x ULN
             (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver
             metastases) AND subject also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific AP
             must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the
             total AP.

          8. Adequate renal function as evidenced by calculated creatinine clearance greater than
             or equal to 50 mL/min as per the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Appendix 1) or radioisotope
             measurement.

          9. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum beta hCG at
             Visit 1 (Screening) and prior to starting study drugs on Day 1. Female subjects of

             to starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days
             (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Those women using hormonal
             contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as
             described previously). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months
             to be considered of non-childbearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the
        study:

             antiandrogens and/or gonadorelin analogues for treatment of prostate cancer permitted)

          4. Prior participation in an eribulin clinical study, even if not assigned to eribulin
             treatment

          5. Subject with hypersensitivity to halochondrin B and /or halochondrin B chemical
             derivates or capecitabine or any of the excipients

             Hepatitis B or C

         16. Subjects with other significant disease or disorder that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, would exclude the subject from the study

         17. Major surgery within 4 weeks before starting study treatment or scheduled for surgery
             during the projected course of the study

         18. Unable to swallow tablets
