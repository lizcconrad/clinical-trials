  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study of the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MK-6325 in
      HCV-infected participants. Part I of the study will be for Genotype (GT) 1 HCV-infected
      participants who will be randomized to receive either MK-6325 or placebo. If the drug is
      shown to be safe and efficacious in Part I, Part II will enroll GT 3 HCV-infected
      participants who will be randomized to receive either MK-6325 or placebo.
