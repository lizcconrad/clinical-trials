  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on health status and risk behaviors, as well as basic
      demographic and biomedical information for a group of HIV positive adolescents receiving care
      at sites newly participating in ATN III.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a cross sectional study intended to be conducted at each of the
      Adolescent Medicine Trials Units (AMTUs) newly participating in ATN III and to enroll all
      participating patients followed at each site. This approach will allow for the examination of
      the broad spectrum of youth participating in the ATN, including those newly entered into
      care.

      Psychosocial and risk-taking behavioral data will be collected using Audio Computer-Assisted
      Self-Interview (ACASI) for English-speaking participants, or a paper-and-pencil
      Spanish-language survey with identical measures to the ACASI for Spanish-speaking
      participants; biomedical information will be collected through medical chart abstraction.
