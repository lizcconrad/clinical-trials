  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a major clinical problem that is increasing in magnitude and the cost of
      management of heart failure is escalating. A significant part of this cost is related to
      unplanned acute presentation to emergency departments and hospitalisation with worsening
      shortness of breath due to increased fluid content in the lungs.

      Many heart failure patients are already fitted with defibrillators to protect them from the
      risk of fast heart rhythms and sudden death and are followed up in both the heart failure
      clinics and defibrillator clinics. Recently some of the defibrillators fitted have been
      equipped with an extra function that can detect and warn of changes in the fluid content of
      the lungs very early even before the patient starts to complain of any shortness of breath
      and before any signs of fluid overload are seen clinically. However, it is not known how to
      deal with these warnings if they occur very early and it is not known whether a medical
      intervention at his stage is beneficial to prevent progression and eventual hospital
      admission. In the majority of cases, early warnings of this kind are ignored or this function
      is disabled at implantation of the device.

      The current study will involve patients who have already been fitted with a device with the
      above capability. The investigators will use the new function to guide management of these
      patients and compare their outcome with similar patients who are fitted with devices without
      it. The investigators will attempt to manage early warnings by a predetermined increase in
      medications in a group of patients and compare their clinical course to a similar group in
      whom no action is taken.

    <description>All patients in Group 1 will have the Optivol function and alerts switched on. Optivol levels will be downloaded monthly via the Medtronic Carelink Network (for those patients who have it) or during pacemaker follow up appointments.
If the Optivol alarm goes off, all patients will be requested to contact a member of the research team by phone and those with rising Optivol (irrespective of the presence or absence of heart failure symptoms) will be requested to increase the dose of diuretic that they are on by 50% for 1 week then revert to their usual dose after 7 days. A routine renal function check will be performed at the end of the week.</description>

    <description>The Optivol data for these patients will be downloaded periodically (at each scheduled device check) and recorded but will not be available at follow up in the heart failure clinic.. These patients will act as controls for group 1 patients. They will undergo baseline investigations and then will undergo routine heart failure treatment and follow-up in the heart failure clinic. These will include a routine clinical evaluation, body weight and blood analysis as per the heart failure clinic protocol. Medications will be reviewed and changed according to clinical needs.</description>
