  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to reduce impaired driving, risky driving and alcohol-related
      negative consequences among injured emergency department (ED) patients through a telephone
      brief intervention. This study will allow researchers to test a novel method of brief
      intervention that has the potential to be convenient and efficient mechanism to deliver an
      intervention to an at-risk population. Eligible patients will be consented in the ED, will
      receive an assessment and then will be randomized into one of two conditions: 1) telephone
      brief intervention or 2) a comparison control group with a home safety educational program.
      The participant will also receive an appointment for an initial telephone call. Both
      conditions will be provided over three telephone sessions: the initial call (immediately
      following randomization) and two booster calls at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after randomization.
      Participants will provide information about their alcohol use, alcohol-related injuries,
      impaired driving, and other driving related negative consequences at 4, 8, and 12 months
      post-randomization.
