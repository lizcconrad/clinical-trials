    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the leading cancer among women in Saudi Arabia representing almost the third
      of cancer diagnosed in Saudi women. Breast cancer in Saudi women is more frequently observed
      at young age. The data on this observation is either lacking or scares. Furthermore, the
      pathological and molecular features of breast cancer in young women are not clear. The study
      will provide important information to the national health care planner about this disease in
      young women including shedding light on possible genetic risk factors

      The study is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of young women with breast cancer. Over
      a 3-year period, we aim to identify a total of 600 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer,
      of those 300 women age 40 and younger and 300 older women from academic and community health
      care institutions across the Riyadh area. It is anticipated at least 400 of these women will
      agree to participate in the study. The comparable control group of older patients with breast
      cancer will be used for study comparison. Patient surveys, medical record review, and blood
      and tissue collection will be utilized. Women will be surveyed every 6 months after
      diagnosis. The study will investigate short and long-term disease and treatment issues, and
      psychosocial concerns. We will also collect tumor and blood samples to characterize the
      pathological and molecular aspects of tumors, and establish tumor bank for future studies.
