    <textblock>
      The correction of the pelvic organ protrusion is aimed at restoring the pelvic floor
      functional status and ultimately improving the patient's quality of life. There are a few
      studies that have explored the effect of pelvic reconstructive surgery on female sexual
      function (1,2) but no studies have evaluated the male partner's sexual experience. The
      investigators intend to use a newly psychometrically validated questionnaire to capture this
      aspect. The sexual experience questionnaire (SEX-Q) is the first questionnaire to solely and
      exclusively combine functional and quality of life concepts (erection, individual
      satisfaction, and couple satisfaction domains) in a brief questionnaire, which allows a more
      focused and less burdensome evaluation of the sexual experience in men (3). Another issue is
      the density of the mesh material and if it can be felt vaginally even if it is not eroded and
      to what degree this might bother the male partner during intercourse.
