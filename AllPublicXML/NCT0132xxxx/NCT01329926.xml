    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop and optimize methods to isolate, propagate and
      differentiate adult human neural stem cells from patients with degenerative neurological
      disorders like Parkinson's disease.

      In this project the investigators propose to analyze tissue samples from different nervous
      system regions obtained during neurosurgical procedures in order investigate the presence of
      neural stem cells in different cerebral areas. The investigators will also evaluate
      techniques for neural stem cell cryopreservation, for possible future therapeutic uses.
      Patients with degenerative neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease undergoing
      neurosurgical procedures meeting our selection criteria will be candidate for this study.
