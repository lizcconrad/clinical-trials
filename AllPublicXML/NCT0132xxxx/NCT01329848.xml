      This project will develop clinically useful, objective measurements of accommodative
      insufficiency and fatigue using continuous autorefraction recordings. The development of
      these procedures will help vision care professionals diagnose and treat accommodative
      anomalies.

      This project studies accommodative function, the ability to focus while doing near work.
      Visual discomfort symptoms, such as headaches, sore eyes, and blurred vision are commonly
      associated with prolonged reading or other near work. Researchers have long suspected
      accommodative dysfunction was involved but most clinical studies have failed to establish a
      relationship between weak accommodation and symptoms or reading impairments. Recent research,
      however, has found that clinical measure overestimate accommodative function and encourage
      the use of objective, autorefraction methods to measure and study accommodative weakness.
      This project will accomplish three goals. First, using autorefraction objective reliable
      procedures will be developed for measuring accommodative lag, the difference between the
      target location and where the eye is focused. Second, experiments will measure in real-time
      the impact of accommodative lag on reading fluency and visual discomfort systems. Third,
      studies will explore the role of the slow adaptive component in accommodative weakness. This
      work will lead to better methods for diagnosing and treating accommodative disorders.

    <description>Lag will be measured at different viewing distances and durations using autorefraction. Accommodation error refers to the difference between the distance where the target is located and where the eyes focus. Lag refers error that is under focussed; lead is error that is over focussed. This distance is measured in diopters, or 1/meter.</description>
