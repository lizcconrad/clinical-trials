  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epigenomics has identified methylated gene regions that are specific for colorectal cancer
      (CRC). Through Epigenomics' marker discovery and validation process Septin 9 was identified
      as a particularly robust methylation marker for detection of CRC. Epigenomics is currently
      developing a blood based CRC screening test based on Septin 9 and is performing a large
      prospective clinical trial showing its clinical utility in a population at average risk for
      CRC. Parallel to this trial further activities are needed to evaluate, optimize, and develop
      pre-analytical and analytical workflows as well as molecular assays making possible the use
      of Septin 9 methylation in the clinical routine.

    <description>The primary objective of the investigation is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Epi proColon test in precision and reproducibility studies and varying conditions including interfering substances and co-morbidities associated with the testing population. The specimens collected as described in this protocol will be used in the experiments needed to achieve this objective. Validate the Stability of the Septin 9 Biomarker.</description>
