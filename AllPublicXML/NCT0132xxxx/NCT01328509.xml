      The purpose of the proposed project is to investigate measures of zinc status in relation to
      oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with sepsis. We hypothesise that zinc depletion
      can modulate inflammatory responses, leading to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial
      dysfunction.

      Sepsis is a severe infection is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients [1].
      Zinc deficiency impairs overall immune function and resistance to infection [2]. In vitro
      exposure of monocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to decreased cellular zinc content
      [3] and zinc redistribution has been shown in human volunteers in response to LPS [4]. Zinc
      depletion occurs in hospitalized patients including those with infections, the elderly,
      alcoholics, trauma or burns [5-8], conditions which are common among critically ill patients
      with sepsis. In a mouse model of sepsis, zinc depletion prior to sepsis resulted in more
      inflammation and more severe organ injury and increased mortality [9]. In patients with
      sepsis, early feeding with zinc resulted in faster recovery of organ function compared with
      control [10]. Zinc status is likely to be compromised in the critically ill and that zinc
      depletion may affect inflammatory responses and recovery.

      Although zinc is not an antioxidant itself, it binds to metallothionein [11] and zinc
      supplementation decreases oxidative stress [12]. Oxidative stress has been consistently
      reported in patients with sepsis [13-15]. We have recently shown that protection of
      mitochondrial function with antioxidants can reduce organ damage in rats [16]. Pentraxin-3 is
      an inflammatory marker which is regulated in part by antioxidants and plays a key role in
      innate immunity [17].

      The consequences of zinc deficiency may relate, in part, to its effects on nuclear factor
      NFκB, a transcription factor crucial to the signalling networks involved in sepsis [18].
      Higher NFκB activity is associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis [19,20].
      It is likely that compromised antioxidant defences and inflammation occurs as a consequence
      of zinc deficiency.

      We propose to measure plasma zinc and metallothionein mRNA status in relation to inflammatory
      markers including key cytokines, pentraxin-3, markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant
      status in patients with sepsis.

      Following ethical approval consent will be sought from either the patient, or assent from a
      near relative. Successive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Aberdeen Royal
      Infirmary who fulfil the following criteria for sepsis, given below, within a 24h time
      window, will be included.

        -  Clinical suspicion or evidence of acute infection

        -  SIRS defined by two or more of the following:

             1. Core temperature &lt;36 degrees C or &gt;38 degrees C

             2. Tachycardia; heart rate &gt; 90 beats/min.

             3. Tachypnoea; respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/min or mechanical ventilation

             4. White blood count &gt;12 x 109/l or &lt;4 x 109/l

      In this pilot study we will recruit 20 patients with sepsis and 20 critically ill patients
      with no clinical suspicion of sepsis. Patients will be excluded if they are &lt;16 years,
      pregnant or lactating, HIV positive, receiving corticosteroids or other known
      immuno-modulatory drugs (including statins), have cancer or autoimmune disorders or if
      consent/assent is refused.

      Blood samples will be obtained on Days 1,2, 5, 10 and 14 of the ICU stay. Peripheral whole
      blood will be sampled from an indwelling arterial line and plasma will be separated for
      analysis of plasma zinc using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      pentraxin-3 (PTX3) will be measured using enzyme immunoassay and total antioxidant capacity
      and lipid hydroperoxides will be measured colourimetrically [17]. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (MNC) will be separated using single density gradient centrifugation, RNA
      extracted and metallothionein mRNA measured using qPCR [21]. Nuclear extracts of MNC will be
      prepared and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)activation measured using an enzyme immunoassay
      [17].
