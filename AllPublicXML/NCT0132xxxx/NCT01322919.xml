  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using a new software two consecutive laser treatments have been combined to correct the
      distance vision and to provide a near vision component in addition to the first treatment.

      This study will help us to answer 2 questions:

        1. How accurately this combined technique corrects distance and near vision

        2. Whether the correction is adequate to remove the complete need for supplementary near
           spectacles

      LASIK is a surgical technique where the cornea is reshaped using a laser to provide visual
      correction. Typically, this procedure will only correct your long distance vision requiring
      the use of supplementary spectacles for reading and near vision.

      The Technolas 217z Excimer Laser used to deliver the treatment is approved for use in the
      European Community for both treatment versions to correct separately the near vision and the
      distance vision for cases which need one or the other correction.

      By using a new software two consecutive treatments have been combined to correct the distance
      vision and to provide a near vision component in addition to the first treatment.

      This study will help us to answer 2 questions:

        1. How accurately this combined technique corrects distance and near vision

        2. Whether the correction is adequate to remove the complete need for supplementary near
           spectacles

    <description>All patients will undergo LASIK treatment on their non-dominant eye with a new laser software algorithm designed to treat both the distance and near vision components.
The developed software algorithm uses the subjective refraction of the eye to create a treatment for the distance vision correction. This part of the treatment does not show any difference to a regular LASIK treatment for ametropic cases.
In addition to the treatment for the distance vision a central ablation component will be added to address the near vision.</description>

             through 6 months after surgery.

          -  Subjects must be willing to have both eyes treated with the laser during the same
             visit.

          -  Subjects for study arm-I must have up to +4 diopters (D) of absolute spherical
             hyperopia (not spherical equivalent), with up to +2.5 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT
             corneal astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction in both eyes. The spherical
             equivalent must be no more than +5.25 D. Subjects for study arm-II must have up to -7

             D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal astigmatism) by manifest subjective
             refraction in both eyes. The spherical equivalent must be no more than -9.00 D.

          -  Subjects must have presbyopia as determined by an age-related need for optical aid (&gt;
             +1.50 D) for reading with their best distance correction.

          -  Subjects who have been screened successfully for acceptance of the PresbyLasik
             simulation

          -  Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have gas permeable (GP) lenses discontinued
             for at least 3 weeks and soft lenses discontinued for at least 1 week prior to the
             preoperative evaluation in the eye to be treated. Contact lens wearers who wear their
             contact lenses for any amount of time between the preoperative baseline examination
             and the operative visit must not be treated.

          -  Corneal topography should be normal.

          -  Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have 2 central keratometry readings and 2
             manifest subjective refractions taken preoperatively at least one week apart. The
             refraction values must not differ by more than 0.50D as defined by manifest refraction
             spherical equivalent (MRSE). The keratometry values must not differ from the previous
             values by more than 0.50D in either meridian.

          -  High contrast, manifest, best spectacle-corrected logMAR distance visual acuity (VA)
             must be correctable to at least 0.1 (20/25 or 6/7.5) in both eyes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.

          -  Eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a difference of
             greater than 0.75D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than 0.50D in cylinder
             power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees compared to the
             baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of less than 0.75D,
             the difference in cylinder axis will not be taken into consideration.

          -  Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography indicates that
             one or both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the suggested
             computer-simulated treatment plan.

          -  Any subject who is going to be co-managed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is
             not approved as a Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH Excimer laser Investigator.

          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts
             which in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with best spectacle-corrected VA

          -  Subjects with any residual, recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal
             abnormality that in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with BSCVA or a
             successful treatment.

          -  Subjects with signs of keratoconus.

          -  Subjects with unstable central keratometry readings with irregular mires.
