  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of tailored computer-delivered and therapist-delivered brief
      motivations prevention/interventions both for adolescents who have not initiated marijuana
      use (prevention), and those who use marijuana (intervention). Key moderators of
      prevention/intervention effectiveness will be examined, including behavioral intentions,
      self-efficacy, stage of change, school involvement, susceptibility to peer pressure, and
      potential health consequences such as STD/HIV risk behaviors. This project will provide the
      critical first step toward the development and implementation of marijuana use
      prevention/intervention programs that have the potential to be delivered to a large segment
      of youth who seek care in our nation's primary care settings.

      The primary care setting represents an underutilized venue for prevention interventions
      addressing drug use/abuse among youth. The purpose of the study is to: (1) develop and refine
      promising, empirically-derived, BMI prevention/intervention modules delivered by a clinician
      or a computer to target marijuana use, and (2) test the effectiveness of BMI in preventing
      initiation/escalation of marijuana use among youth in community health clinics. This
      randomized controlled trial screened adolescents in primary care clinics in Flint, MI. A
      random sample of those who screened negative for past year marijuana use were selected to
      participate in the study and all subjects who screened positive for past year use were
      enrolled in the study. These subjects were stratified by gender, age, and past year marijuana
      use and randomized to one of three conditions: 1) computer-delivered brief motivational
      approach (BMI-C); 2) therapist-delivered brief motivational approach (BMI-T); or 3) a NIDA
      drug education booklet. Primary outcomes are evaluated at 3-, 6- and 12-months and include
      marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and other drug use. Key moderators of effectiveness will be
      examined, including behavioral intentions, self-efficacy, stage of change, school
      involvement, susceptibility to peer pressure, and potential health consequences (e.g.,
      STD/HIV risk behaviors). This project will provide the critical first step toward the
      implementation of tailored marijuana prevention and intervention in primary care clinics.
