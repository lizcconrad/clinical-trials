      Study hypothesis: Subcutaneous enoxaparin is more effective than subcutaneous heparin in
      preventing the development of DVT in the general surgical intensive care unit population.

      Hospitalized patients are at increased risk for the development of blood clots in the legs,
      known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Surgical patients are in a higher risk category than
      the general hospital population due to a number of factors including undergoing surgery and
      increased risk of immobility. The highest risk patients are in the surgical intensive care
      unit, where their surgical risks for blood clots are combined with issues such as sepsis,
      acquired blood clotting disorders, and increasing age, each of which are factors that
      contribute to the risk of blood clot development. 1. Patients who develop these blood clots
      (DVTs) are at risk for chronic leg swelling, pain, and in some cases, chronic ulcer
      development on the leg. In the worst case scenario, these blood clots can break away and
      migrate to the lungs where they cause a pulmonary embolism (PE), a clot in the lungs that can
      cause significant breathing difficulty requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, and
      in some cases, death.

      According to recent research, DVTs account for over 200,000 patient deaths each year
      nationwide. 2. A large amount of data has supported the use of medication called heparin or
      enoxaparin in low doses to prevent these blood clots from forming while in the hospital. Both
      of these medications are considered standard of care for use patients considered moderate and
      high risk for the development of DVT. 3. While both of these medications have been shown to
      significantly reduce the occurrence of DVT in appropriate doses, 4. there has never been a
      direct comparison of the two medications in the highest-risk population of the surgical
      intensive care unit. Our own preliminary data suggests patients may have a lower incidence of
      DVTs with the use of enoxaparin versus heparin. Part of the reason for this may be the
      requirement for three times daily dosing of the heparin compared to once daily dosing for
      enoxaparin. There may also be some inherent differences in the efficacy of the medications
      themselves.
