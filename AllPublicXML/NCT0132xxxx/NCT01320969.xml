  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well-established that the practice of mindfulness meditation leads to improvements in
      mental health and well-being and the cultivation of positive emotions. However, the neural
      mechanisms of these improvements are largely unknown. A few recent studies suggest that
      mindfulness meditation impacts the structure and function of the ventromedial prefrontal
      cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that
      these regions are part of a brain circuit that is critical for the extinction of conditioned
      fear responses, and for the retention of fear extinction memory. Building on the overlap of
      these regions and on conceptual considerations, the project investigates whether mindfulness
      meditation could influence one's capacity to retain the memory of fear extinction.
      Meditation-na√Øve participants will be randomized to either a mindfulness-meditation based
      training or an active control training that controls for all mindfulness-unspecific
      components. Participants will undergo a fear conditioning, extinction and extinction recall
      protocol in an MRI scanner before and after the trainings. We hypothesize that participants
      who have practiced mindfulness meditation will show greater improvements in fear extinction
      memory after the course, and that these improvements will be correlated with anatomical and
      functional changes in the brain regions of interest. Improvements in fear extinction memory
      will also be related to improvements in self-reported psychological well-being. Merging the
      fields of an ancient spiritual tradition and a fundamental learning mechanism, the project
      investigates the underlying neural mechanisms of a practice for the enhancement of mental
      health and well-being.
