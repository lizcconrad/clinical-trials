  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone is a medication that has been shown to have clear anti-nausea,
      anti-inflammatory, and painkilling properties. Dexamethasone is currently used to manage
      postoperative symptoms of a variety of surgical procedures. However, its effect has not been
      validated for scleral buckling surgery, which is used to treat retinal detachment, a medical
      emergency that can lead to permanent blindness. In this study, the investigators will
      randomly administer dexamethasone to half of scleral buckling surgery patients, and a placebo
      to the other half. The investigators will then compare the postoperative symptoms of the two
      groups in order to determine whether dexamethasone should be used for scleral buckling
      surgeries.
