  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Common Mental Disorders (CMD) refer to health states involving non-psychotic psychiatric
      symptoms. Part of this broad diagnostic category, symptoms such as difficulty concentrating,
      forgetfulness, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, feelings of worthlessness, somatic
      complaints, etc. The CMD has a big social impact, and its prevalence in the general
      population is 25% and graduate students in health care reaches 40%. The Bach´s Flower
      Remedies are considered a complementary therapy approved and recommended by World Health
      Organization and by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and in his theory it has great spiritual
      nature. In addition, international scientific research have suggested that the strengthening
      of spiritual well-being can help significantly and positively promoting mental health. This
      project aims to assess the relationship between treatment with Bach´s Flower Remedies and
      Spiritual well-being of people with Common Mental Disorders in undergraduate health students
      of a university located in São José dos Campos, state of São Paulo, Brazil. This research
      presents a quantitative and qualitative methodology, experimental clinical trial, triple
      blind. The treatment will take place with two groups of forty people, the group of treatment
      and the placebo´s. The trial will happen in six sessions at intervals of 30 days, totaling
      eight months of treatment. Statistical analysis will be used chi-square or Fisher exact test
      to study the association between the scale of spiritual well-being and the use of Bach
      Flowers for each time point (3 times). To compare the evolution of the results (scales)
      during the study will set a model for ordinal data with repeated measurements over time. For
      these statistical tests is assumed a significance level of 5% (p &lt; 0.005).

    <description>The Self-Reporting Questionnaire was developed by Harding et al. (1980), from four other instruments used for screening for possible mental disorders. The development of this instrument was coordinated by World Health Organization (WHO) and aimed to reach a possible instrument to identify cases in primary care services and community, especially in developing countries with lack of services and professionals. The intention of the WHO was to identify cases from the instrument and to encourage planners to provide services and mental health care to the needy population (WHO, 1994).</description>
