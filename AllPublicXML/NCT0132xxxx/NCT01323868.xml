  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of endogenous endophthalmitis in patients
      admitted to Stanford Hospital with a systemic infection and positive blood cultures, as this
      may improve the clinical care of this population of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients admitted to the hospital have blood-borne infections. Occasionally, these blood
      infections can end up inside the eye and cause an infection inside the eye (called endogenous
      endophthalmitis).

      Prior to modern and rapid treatment of systemic infections, the rate of endogenous
      endophthalmitis was reported to be 37% in 1982. By 1997, the rate was reported to be 2.8%.
      This study aims to determine the rate of endogenous endophthalmitis at Stanford Hospital in
      the modern medical era in that our rates may be different as those reported in the
      literature. This potential difference may be a reflection of treatment protocols and
      antibiotics currently in use at Stanford Hospital.
