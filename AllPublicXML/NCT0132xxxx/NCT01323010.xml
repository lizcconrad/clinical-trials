  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metered dose inhalers with spacers are devices capable of providing higher rates of lung
      deposition of drugs such as beta agonists when compared to conventional nebulizers, but there
      is no consensus about the optimal dose when this is the device of choice and there is
      evidence that younger children need proportionally higher doses of albuterol (in μg/kg) when
      compared to older children. Other factors that may interfere with response to albuterol
      treatment include the genetics of the beta adrenergic receptor (ADRβ2) and infectious
      etiology of the wheezing attack. This study will assess the effectiveness of a dose regimen
      that prioritizes higher doses of albuterol, with doses in μg/kg higher for younger children.
      Security of this new dosing regimen will be assessed by monitoring clinical side effects and
      serum levels of albuterol, but the investigators will also examine the presence of 12
      different respiratory viruses in these patients and evaluate the influence of ADRβ2 receptor
      genetics in the response to albuterol. The primary outcome measure will be the need for
      hospitalization. Secondary outcomes will include a change in clinical score, respiratory rate
      and forced expiratory volume in the first second, the need for additional treatments and
      length of stay in the emergency room for those not hospitalized.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, controlled study. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups (experimental or control groups).

      The patients will be assessed 1 hour later and every 30 minutes thereafter until discharge.
      Following 4 hours in the emergency room, any patient who do not meet the discharge criteria
      (PRAM score ≤ 3 and SpO2 ≥ 92%) will be admitted to the hospital. Each patient's attending
      physician will determine the need for additional therapies following the first hour.

      Identification of respiratory viruses in the nasal lavage samples wil be performed using the
      CLART PneumoVir® kit.

      Albuterol plasmatic levels will be analyzed via HPLC (High Performance Liquid
      Chromatography).

      To genotype the ADBR2 receptor (blood samples), the gene regions encompassing the Arg16Gly,
      Gln27Glu, and Arg19Cys Thr164Ile polymorphisms will be amplified via PCR. The resultant
      amplimers were then sequenced.

      A sample of 124 patients (62 in each group) was calculated to provide an 80% power with which
      to detect a significant difference of at least 30 minutes in the lengths of stay between the
      groups. The chi-square test will be used to compare hospital admission rates and tremor
      rates. For all other outcomes, t-tests for mean comparisons (variables with a normal
      distribution), a Mann Whitney test (nonparametric data) and ANOVA with repeated measures will
      be used.

    <description>Change in the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) score one hour post-treatment in comparison with baseline.
The PRAM score is used to assess the severity of asthma attacks, it ranges from 0 to 15, and the higher the score, the greater the severity of the attack.
We calculated the difference between the PRAM score measured one hour post treatment and the PRAM score at baseline (PRAM score 1 hour - PRAM score baseline).
The larger the absolute value of the difference, the better the outcome (e.g., a difference of -4 indicates a better outcome that a difference of -2).

        <title>Change in PRAM Score After One Hour</title>
        <description>Change in the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) score one hour post-treatment in comparison with baseline.
The PRAM score is used to assess the severity of asthma attacks, it ranges from 0 to 15, and the higher the score, the greater the severity of the attack.
We calculated the difference between the PRAM score measured one hour post treatment and the PRAM score at baseline (PRAM score 1 hour - PRAM score baseline).
The larger the absolute value of the difference, the better the outcome (e.g., a difference of -4 indicates a better outcome that a difference of -2).

        <description>Change in the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) score at discharge or hospital admission (up to 4 hours post treatment) in comparison with baseline.
The PRAM score is used to assess the severity of asthma attacks, it ranges from 0 to 15, and the higher the score, the greater the severity of the attack.
We calculated the difference between the PRAM score measured at discharge or admission and the PRAM score at baseline (PRAM score discharge or admission - PRAM score baseline).
The larger the absolute value of the difference, the better the outcome (e.g., a difference of -4 indicates a better outcome that a difference of -2).
minimum value of the difference (Albuterol - Higher Dose, experimental group): -9 maximum value of the difference (Albuterol - Higher Dose, experimental group): 0
