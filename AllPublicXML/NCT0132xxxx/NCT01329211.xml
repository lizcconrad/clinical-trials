    <textblock>
      The project will involve conducting a Needs Assessment for Gastroparesis patients and their
      caregivers with the goal of identifying quality of life issues associated with this disease.
      Identifying these issues will ameliorate management and support systems for gastroparesis
      currently existent in the community and, hopefully, provide information for the establishment
      of more resources to assist the patients and their families.

      This project will involve: a) distributing questionnaires to up to 200 participants (100
      patients and 100 caregivers) at the Shands Gastrointestinal clinic and b) focus groups
      including patients, medical provider, and the clinic case manager. The questionnaires will
      provide information on the relative effect of gastroparesis on the quality of life of the
      patients and their caregivers. Assessment of this needs assessment will then help identify
      areas of potential resource improvement and mobilization to provide support for the patients
      and their family members.

        The research plan involves reviewing patient records to identify potential subjects.
        Questionnaires will be distributed to gastroparesis patients and their caregivers during
        their visit to the GI clinic at the day of enrollment and at six-month intervals for a
        two-year follow-up period, after informed consent has been obtained. Patients and
        caregivers will also be recruited by telephone. Gastroparesis patients, who have an
        established patient-physician relationship with Dr. Sultan, will be contacted by telephone
        in order to inquire about their interest in participating in the study. The details of the
        study, including the questionnaires, risks, and potential benefits will be discussed over
        the phone. Then, if patients and/or their caregivers are willing to participate in the
        study, the informed consent forms and the questionnaires will be mailed to them with a
        posted envelope to be returned to Dr. Sultan by mail.
