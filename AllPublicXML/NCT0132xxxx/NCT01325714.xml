    <textblock>
      This study tests whether education about memory and pain might help to prevent aggression in
      persons with dementia who have pain. The overall goal of this intervention is to reduce the
      risk of aggressive behavior by improving several areas of patient life that are known causes
      of aggression: pain, depression, lack of pleasurable activities, caregiver stress and
      difficulty in caregiver-patient communication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is known primarily for its effects on memory, however, eighty percent of persons
      with dementia also have behavioral disturbances. This is often not addressed, leading to
      increased use of nursing homes, higher incidence of injury (both patient and caregiver) and
      the use of tranquilizing medications. Pain is one of the strongest predictors of aggression.
      The prevalence of pain in persons with dementia is known to be about 50%. Untreated pain is
      associated with significant negative outcomes, including increased health care use,
      inactivity and isolation. The investigators aim to determine whether outcome differences
      exist between active intervention and control conditions in relation to the occurrence of
      aggressive behavior, pain and depression, and its impact on pleasant activities, caregiver
      burden, quality of caregiver-patient relationship, antipsychotic use, health-service use,
      injuries to patient and caregiver, and nursing home placement. The active intervention,
      Preventing Aggression in Veterans with Dementia (PAVeD), is a family caregiver-focused,
      home-based intervention that uses psychoeducational and behavioral approaches to help reduce
      the risk of aggressive behavior in persons with dementia. The objective of PAVeD is to
      improve several areas of patient life that are known causes of aggression: pain and distress
      (including mood problems), lack of pleasurable activities, and difficulty in
      patient-caregiver communication that may negatively affect relationship quality and
      caregivers' recognition of pain.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Aggression as Determined by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Aggression Subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months, Six Months, Twelve Months Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI lists 13 behaviors (2 verbal and 11 nonverbal) and for each behavior the participant indicates how frequently the behavior occurs (1-5, higher values = greater frequency) and how disruptive the behavior is (1-5, higher values = greater disruptiveness). For any given behavior, if a participant scored a 2 or higher on BOTH frequency (i.e., it occurred &quot;less than once a week&quot; or more often) and disruptiveness (i.e., it was &quot;a little&quot; disruptive or more), he/she was considered aggressive.
Overall aggression takes into account all 13 behaviors, whereas verbal aggression only pertains to two behaviors and non-verbal aggression pertains to 11 behaviors.
One is considered verbally aggressive if he/she responds with a 2 or higher on both frequency and disruptiveness for either of the two verbal behaviors.
One is considered non-verbally aggressive if he/she responds with a 2 or higher on both frequency and disruptiveness for any of the 11 non-verbal behaviors.</description>

    <description>The frequency of engagement in pleasant events, according to the Pleasant Events Schedule - Alzheimer's Disease.
For each of 20 events, participants answered the frequency (0 = not at all, 1 = 1-6 times, 2 = 7+ times) they engaged in the event and whether they enjoyed the event (1 = yes, 0 = no).
For each item, frequency x enjoyment were multiplied. Then scores for each of the 20 items were added together.
The possible range of scores on the PES frequency of engagement in pleasant events is from 0 - 40, with higher scores indicating more frequent engagement in pleasant events.</description>

Scores are then summed so that the total range is from 0 to 88. Higher scores indicate greater caregiver burden.</description>

Fifteen items about the caregivers' relationship with the patient with dementia were responded to on a 0-4 scale, where 0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = some, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = a great deal.
responses to all 15 items were averaged, so total scores range from 0-4, with higher values indicating greater mutuality.</description>

Dyads assigned to PAVeD received 6 to 8 weekly sessions of 45-minute home visits. PAVeD consists of 4 weekly 45- minute “core” sessions (“Recognizing Pain”; “Recognizing and Responding to Pain and Distress”; “Enhancing Communication”; “Making Daily Activities More Pleasant and Enjoyable”) and 2 of 4 elective sessions (“Medical Treatments and Talking to Your Doctor,” “Rest and Relaxation Strategies,” “Communication Problems and Challenges,” and “Increasing Pleasant Activities”), chosen with the patient and/or caregiver through collaborative goal setting during the first session.

Stage 1 is normal adult with no functional decline, Stage 2 is normal older adult with some functional decline, Stage 3 is mild cognitive impairment, Stage 4 is mild dementia, Stage 5 is moderate dementia, Stage 6 is moderately severe dementia, and Stage 7 is severe dementia. Those with FAST scores between 2-6 were eligible for participation.

        <title>Number of Participants With Aggression as Determined by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Aggression Subscale)</title>
        <description>The CMAI lists 13 behaviors (2 verbal and 11 nonverbal) and for each behavior the participant indicates how frequently the behavior occurs (1-5, higher values = greater frequency) and how disruptive the behavior is (1-5, higher values = greater disruptiveness). For any given behavior, if a participant scored a 2 or higher on BOTH frequency (i.e., it occurred &quot;less than once a week&quot; or more often) and disruptiveness (i.e., it was &quot;a little&quot; disruptive or more), he/she was considered aggressive.
Overall aggression takes into account all 13 behaviors, whereas verbal aggression only pertains to two behaviors and non-verbal aggression pertains to 11 behaviors.
One is considered verbally aggressive if he/she responds with a 2 or higher on both frequency and disruptiveness for either of the two verbal behaviors.
One is considered non-verbally aggressive if he/she responds with a 2 or higher on both frequency and disruptiveness for any of the 11 non-verbal behaviors.</description>

Enhanced Usual Care: In Enhanced Usual Care, the caregiver will receive information in the mail about memory problems and pain; and the caregiver will receive eight short telephone calls to check on how the person with dementia is doing.
Primary Care providers will be notified through electronic medical records about any significant behavioral problems or pain.

          <title>Number of Participants With Aggression as Determined by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Aggression Subscale)</title>
          <description>The CMAI lists 13 behaviors (2 verbal and 11 nonverbal) and for each behavior the participant indicates how frequently the behavior occurs (1-5, higher values = greater frequency) and how disruptive the behavior is (1-5, higher values = greater disruptiveness). For any given behavior, if a participant scored a 2 or higher on BOTH frequency (i.e., it occurred &quot;less than once a week&quot; or more often) and disruptiveness (i.e., it was &quot;a little&quot; disruptive or more), he/she was considered aggressive.
Overall aggression takes into account all 13 behaviors, whereas verbal aggression only pertains to two behaviors and non-verbal aggression pertains to 11 behaviors.
One is considered verbally aggressive if he/she responds with a 2 or higher on both frequency and disruptiveness for either of the two verbal behaviors.
One is considered non-verbally aggressive if he/she responds with a 2 or higher on both frequency and disruptiveness for any of the 11 non-verbal behaviors.</description>

          <title>Caregiver-perceived Mutuality</title>
          <description>Caregiver-Perceived Total Mutuality (with patient), based on the Mutuality Scale.
Fifteen items about the caregivers' relationship with the patient with dementia were responded to on a 0-4 scale, where 0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = some, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = a great deal.
responses to all 15 items were averaged, so total scores range from 0-4, with higher values indicating greater mutuality.</description>
          <population>Growth curve models were conducted (n = 203) to examine whether there were treatment group differences in change over time in caregiver-reported mutuality.</population>
