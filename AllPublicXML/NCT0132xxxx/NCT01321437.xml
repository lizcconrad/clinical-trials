      The purpose of this research study is to determine the efficacy of Axitinib in treating
      individuals with Stage III melanoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 68,720 new cases of melanoma
      (29,900 in men and 25,200 in women) annually in the United States, and about 8,650 people
      will die from this cancer. The systemic therapy of advanced disease remains palliative until
      new agents are found that might improve the survival of patients with stage III melanoma.

      Melanomas are often vascular, and a decrease in the number of blood vessels that supply the
      tumor may starve it of needed nutrients. An approach to blocking the growth of blood vessels
      that supply the tumor is to inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine
      kinase (VEGFR TK) signaling pathway. Axitinib (AG 013736) is a VEGFR TK inhibitor.

      Because of the poor prognosis of patients with stage III melanoma and indications that
      anti-angiogenesis compounds might have clinically meaningful activity in this disease, a
      Phase 2 trial of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (VEGFR TK)
      inhibitor Axitinib (AG 013736) is warranted.
