  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The kidney plays a crucial role in maintaining salt balance by two opposing physiological
      mechanisms: the renal dopaminergic system which enhances salt excretion and the
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which causes salt retention. Salt-sensitive hypertension
      occurs when this balance is altered or abnormal. We hypothesized that this balance is
      influenced by salt intake: therefore dietary salt affects the natriuretic response to the
      renal dopaminergic agonist Fenoldopam, and the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor,
      Enalapril.

      In this trial we study normal salt balance mechanisms in salt resistant adults with normal
      blood pressure.

      Eight adults of both genders and all races were studied in this double blind placebo
      controlled cross over study with randomization of the order of interventions. After 5 days
      each on low salt (about 1 gram/day) and high salt (about 6 grams/day)diet, with a washout
      period of at least four weeks in between, every subject was treated with Enalapril and
      Placebo on two consecutive days, followed by a Fenoldopam infusion for three hours, during
      which natriuresis and renal function testing were performed.

    <description>All subjects received placebo/enalapril in a randomized counterbalanced fashion in both phases. Phase 1 was on low salt, while Phase 2 was on high salt. All subjects received a 3 hour fenoldopam infusion, during which time urinary sodium excretion was measured as the primary outcome bvariable.</description>

    <description>In order to explain physiologically the effects of fenoldopam on urinary sodium excretion on high and low salt diet, with and wothout enalapril, renal plasma flow was measured during the infusion using PAH clearance</description>
