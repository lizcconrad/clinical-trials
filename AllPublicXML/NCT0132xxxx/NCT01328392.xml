  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although laryno-pharyngeal reflux (LPR) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) differ in
      symptoms and treatment, they are diagnosed by the same standard 24-hour pH monitoring system
      which measures liquid reflux in the esophagus. The investigators are evaluating a new 24-hour
      pharyngeal pH monitoring system by Restech which can measure acid exposure in the airway and
      can be used specifically for LPR diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      the Restech device is more effective than standard pH monitoring in predicting the response
      to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) acid suppression therapy using Dexlansoprazole in patients
      with symptoms and/or manifestations of LPR.
