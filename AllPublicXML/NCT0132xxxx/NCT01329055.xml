  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies of the patients treated in RRI clinics suggest that hemodialysis patients
      undergo a certain consistent predictable pattern at the initiation of dialysis and before
      death. This pattern can be described as a group of patterns of patients' biological markers
      over a few months after starting dialysis and several months prior to death. Additional
      patterns can be observed that occur with changes in seasons or time of day. The aim of this
      study is to compare these patterns in patients treated in FMC-Asia, FMC-Europe, FMC-South
      America, and RRI-US populations. Noting that patterns in patient parameters are similar
      across continents, climates, and geographic variations only further accentuates the
      importance in the models that can predict patients' survival and provide an opportunity for
      timely intervention.
