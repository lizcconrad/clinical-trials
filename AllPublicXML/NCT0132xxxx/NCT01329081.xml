      BACKGROUND In 2008 approximately 7,700 total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed in
      Denmark. The results after TKA is in general very good, the investigators have, however,
      discovered that patients following fast-track TKA still have a deficit 12 months
      postoperatively of 5-10% in health-related quality-of-life and 15-20% in activity and
      participation when compared to age- and gender matched population. A postoperative
      rehabilitation intervention has the potential to reduce or remove this observed deficit. The
      current evidence of postoperative rehabilitation after TKA is, however, scares and
      conflicting, and no studies have shown a lasting effect beyond 3 months postoperatively.

      PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to investigate if a 6-weeks postoperative rehabilitation
      intervention is more effective than supervised home training, and furthermore to investigate
      the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in a societal perspective.

      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS The study is performed as a randomized clinical trial. In total 140
      patients are included in the study. Inclusion criteria are age above 18 years, patients
      diagnosed as having knee arthrosis, patients receiving primary elective TKA, and patients who
      are able to and willing transport themselves to the rehabilitation center, which demands
      ability to walk 50 meter, and climb 10 stair steps. Exclusion criteria are unicompartmental
      or revision arthroplasty, any neurological disease, knee infection, and substantial pain or
      functional limitation hindering rehabilitation tested by physiotherapist prior to
      rehabilitation start. Primary endpoint is 6 months postoperatively and primary outcome
      measure is change in total score by using the knee specific questionnaire Oxford Knee Score.
