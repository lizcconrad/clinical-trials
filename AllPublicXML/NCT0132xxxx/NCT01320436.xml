  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting in increased morbidity in
      patients. The current standard treatment for mild to moderate UC (MTMUC) includes
      5-aminosalicylic compounds (5ASA) such as olsalazine and mesalamine, yet some patients
      continue to experience disease symptoms and flare-ups. These patients require higher dosages
      of 5ASA medications and in many cases escalate to steroid and/or immunosuppressant therapy
      which comprises higher risk of hazardous side effects.

      Curcumin, an active ingredient of the Indian herb Rhizoma Curcuma Longa, has been extensively
      studied in the context of inflammatory diseases. In humans, a controlled study using curcumin
      as an adjusted therapy to 5ASA medication has shown it to be superior to placebo in
      maintaining remission in MTMUC patients . A small, preliminary open label study has also
      shown efficacy in reducing disease symptoms and inflammatory markers in this group of
      patients .

      This data provides bases for investigating an integrative approach to optimize the current
      standard treatment in MTMUC patients. We speculate that using a combined therapy of 5ASA
      medication and curcumin could benefit this subgroup of patients and reduce morbidity and
      perhaps need for escalating pharmacological intervention.
