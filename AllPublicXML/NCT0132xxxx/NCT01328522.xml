      Primary Objective:

      Assess the comparative safety and tolerability of two SAR153191 (REGN88) drug products after
      a single dose administration in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

      Secondary Objective:

      Assess the comparative pharmacokinetic profiles of the two SAR153191 (REGN88) drug products
      after a single dose administration in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

      The duration of the study period per subject is 5-7 weeks broken down as follows:

        -  Screening: 1 to 14 days,

        -  Treatment: 1 day (2 overnight stays at the study site),

        -  Follow-up: up to 5 weeks after dosing (an additional outpatient follow-up may be
           scheduled depending on the last results).
