      Expiratory airflow limitation is the most obvious physiological change associated with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A consequence of airflow limitation is gas
      trapping as expiration becomes flow limited. This may occur at rest with more severe airway
      obstruction and is most evident during exercise as lung emptying is reduced and increased
      ventilation does not allow full expiration. This increased gas trapping or hyperinflation is
      the cause of much of the increased work of breathing, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance in
      subjects with COPD (O'Donnell 1997; O'Donnell, 1993). Spirometric measurement of airflow
      limitation, particularly as assessed by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), is
      commonly used for the diagnosis of and assessment of response to pharmacotherapeutic
      intervention in COPD. However, changes in FEV1 may not fully predict symptomatic responses
      and alternative measures of lung hyperinflation such as exercise tolerance and exertional
      dyspnea may be more sensitive to therapeutic intervention and/or more clinically relevant
      than FEV1 [O'Donnell1999; Bauerle, 1998; O'Donnell, 1998; Officer, 1998]. GSK573719/GW642444
      Inhalation Powder, a combination of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)
      bronchodilator GSK573719 and the long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) bronchodilator GW642444, is
      in development for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction associated with COPD.
      Development of this product is supported by studies showing improvement in lung function with
      similar safety when use of combinations of long-acting bronchodilators with different
      mechanisms of action are compared with single bronchodilator therapy [van Noord 2005; van
      Noord van Noord 2006; Tashkin 2008]. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment with
      short- and long-acting bronchodilators including ipratropium, tiotropium, and salmeterol
      reduces resting lung hyperinflation as measured by functional residual capacity (FRC),
      residual volume (RV), and inspiratory capacity (IC), with associated improvements in exercise
      endurance time and exertional dyspnoea in subjects with COPD [Ayers, 2001; O'Donnell 1998;
      O'Donnell 2004; Pepin 2005; Pepin 2007; Ramirez-Venegas 1997]. However, the effect of
      combined LAMA/LABA therapy on these measures is not well characterized.

      This is a phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, combination
      and component, two-period, incomplete block design cross-over study using GSK573719/GW642444.
      The primary objective is to evaluate lung function and exercise endurance time after 12 weeks
      of once-daily administration of GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder (125/25mcg and
      62.5/25mcg), GSK573719 Inhalation Powder (125mcg and 62.5mcg), GW642444 Inhalation Powder 25
      mcg and placebo delivered by a Novel dry powder inhaler (Novel DPI) Approximately 312
      subjects with moderate/severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be randomised
      in order to achieve 208 subjects completing both treatment periods of 3 months.. There will
      be a total of 12 study clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will complete a 12 to 21 day run-in period
      followed by two 12-week treatment periods that are separated by a 14 day wash-out. Clinic
      visits will be conducted at Screening (Visit 1), twice during the run-in period (Visits 2 and
      3), at randomization (Visit 4) and three times during the first treatment period, on
      Treatment Day 2 (Visit 5) and at 6 and 12 weeks (Visits 6 and 7 respectively). During the
      washout period of 14 days there will be 2 clinic visits (Visits 8 and 9). During the second
      treatment period there will be 3 clinic visits, on Treatment Day 2 (Visit 10) and at 6 and 12
      weeks (Visits 11 and 12 respectively). A Safety Follow-Up assessment (Visit 13) to record
      adverse events will be conducted by telephone 7 days after the end of the second treatment
      period or early withdrawal. Efficacy measurements will include pre and post dose FEV1, lung
      volume measurements and exercise endurance time measured using the endurance shuttle walking
      test (ESWT). Oxycon mobile measurements will be conducted in a subgroup of approximately 104
      patients to investigate cardio respiratory measures during exercise. Safety and tolerability
      will be assessed by collection of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, 12-lead
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests and incidence of COPD exacerbations.
      Dyspnea will be assessed using the Exercise Dyspnea Scale (EDS), a patient-reported outcome.
      Blood samples will also be collected for potential pharmacogenetics analysis

    <time_frame>Week 12 of each treatment period (up to Study Week 29)</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise endurance time (EET) post-dose at Week 12 is defined as the EET obtained 3 hours after dosing at Week 12. EET was measured using the externally paced field walking test called the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT). Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period walking speed, mean walking speed, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, center group, visit by period walking speed, visit by mean walking speed and visit by treatment interactions. The model used all available 3-hour post-dose change from baseline EET values recorded on Day 2, Week 6 and Week 12. Baseline was the EET assessment obtained prior to dosing on Day 1 of each period. The mean walking speed for each participant is the mean of the levels used for the ESWT in each of the two treatment periods. The period walking speed for each participant and treatment period is the difference between the level for that participant and period and the mean walking speed for that participant.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Exercise Endurance Time Post-dose at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Exercise endurance time (EET) post-dose at Week 12 is defined as the EET obtained 3 hours after dosing at Week 12. EET was measured using the externally paced field walking test called the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT). Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period walking speed, mean walking speed, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, center group, visit by period walking speed, visit by mean walking speed and visit by treatment interactions. The model used all available 3-hour post-dose change from baseline EET values recorded on Day 2, Week 6 and Week 12. Baseline was the EET assessment obtained prior to dosing on Day 1 of each period. The mean walking speed for each participant is the mean of the levels used for the ESWT in each of the two treatment periods. The period walking speed for each participant and treatment period is the difference between the level for that participant and period and the mean walking speed for that participant.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Day 2, Week 6 and Week 12. Baseline is the FEV1 value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant, and period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each participant. Clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at Week 12 (Treatment Day 85) is defined as the FEV1 value obtained 24 hours after dosing on Treatment Day 84. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, center group, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions.</description>

          <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Day 2, Week 6 and Week 12. Baseline is the FEV1 value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant, and period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each participant. Clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at Week 12 (Treatment Day 85) is defined as the FEV1 value obtained 24 hours after dosing on Treatment Day 84. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, center group, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Inspiratory Capacity (Trough and 3-hours Post-dose) at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Inspiratory capacity (IC) is defined as the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled into the lungs from the normal resting position after breathing out normally. Baseline is the IC value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant, and period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each participant. Trough IC is measured pre-dose on Treatment Week 12 of each treatment period. IC 3-hours post-dose is measured from the value obtained 3 hours after dosing on Treatment Week 12 of each treatment period. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, center group, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions. IC measurements were taken electronically by plethysmography on Day 2, Week 6 and Week 12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Residual Capacity (Trough and 3-hours Post-dose) at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) is defined as the amount of air still left in the lungs after breathing out normally. Baseline is the FRC value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant, and period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each participant. Trough FRC is measured pre-dose on Treatment Week 12. FRC 3-hours post-dose is measured from the value obtained 3 hours after dosing on Treatment Week 12. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, center group, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions. FRC measurements were taken electronically by plethysmography on Day 2, Week 6 and Week 12.</description>
