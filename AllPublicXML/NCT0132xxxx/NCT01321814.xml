  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
      can be useful for people suffering from Hyperacusis.

      Also, the investigators are interested in investigating this group of patients on psychiatric
      and somatic comorbidity, personality traits, and startle response to sounds.

      The investigators will also study the audiological measures commonly used in Sweden to
      measure hyperacusis, and investigate their validity.

      The investigators hypothesize that CBT might be helpful for patients suffering from
      Hyperacusis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperacusis, defined as unusual intolerance to ordinary environmental sounds, is a common
      problem for which there are no controlled trials on psychological treatment. Given the
      avoidance strategies present in hyperacusis, and similarities with problems such as tinnitus
      and chronic pain, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is hypothesized to be helpful for
      patients with hyperacusis. In this randomized controlled study of 60 patients with
      hyperacusis, CBT was compared with a waiting list control group using the Loudness Discomfort
      Level test (LDL), the Hyperacusis Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales,
      the Quality of Life Inventory and an adapted version of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.
      There were significant between-group effects in favour of the CBT group on all measures
      except for the HADS anxiety scale. Between-group effect sizes were moderate to high, with
      Cohen's d = 0.67 and 0.69 per ear, respectively, for the primary measure LDL, and ranging
      from d = 0.32 to 1.36 for the secondary measures. The differences between groups ceased to
      exist when the waiting list group was treated later with CBT, and the treatment results were
      largely maintained after 12 months. In conclusion, CBT is a promising treatment for
      hyperacusis, although more research is necessary.

    <description>M.I.N.I is a short structured diagnostic interview (Sheehan et al, 1998), developed to detect DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders and was performed to investigate psychiatric comorbidity in this study. The Swedish version, 5.0.0. was used.</description>

    <description>SSP aims to measure personality correlates as well as biological correlates of some psychiatric disorders in order to define vulnerability factors (Gustavsson et al, 2000). The test consists of 13 scales, for instance somatic trait anxiety, psychic trait anxiety and stress susceptibility.</description>
