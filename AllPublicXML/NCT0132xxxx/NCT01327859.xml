      Patients who complete all 24 weeks of the double-blind study E2020-E044-316 (NCT00165815)
      will be eligible for the open label extension study. Patients and caregiver/study partner
      will need to provide additional written informed consent to participate in the open label
      extension study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed after 4, 8 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks.
      Cognition, Global Clinical Function, Activities of Daily Living, and Behaviour will be
      assessed after 24, and 52 weeks.

          -  PD according to UK Brain Bank criteria 40 with good response to levodopa as judged by
             investigator opinion.

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have demonstrated a negative serum beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (B-HCG) at the screening visit for the double-blind study
             (E2020-E044-316)(NCT00165815) and a negative urine test result at the screening visit
             for the open label extension study, (E2020-E044-318)

          -  Completed all 24 treatment weeks of the double-blind study E2020-E044-316

                  method plus hormonal method). These patients must be willing to remain on current
                  form of contraception for the duration of the study, (post menopausal women must
                  be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-child bearing
                  potential).

          -  Patients with evidence of other psychiatric/neurological disorders, i.e., stroke,

             Patients with controlled hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) &lt; 95
             mmHg), right bundle branch block (complete or partial) and pacemakers may be included
             in the study.

          -  Patients previously treated with centrally active acetylchlinesterase (AChE)
             inhibitors (e.g., physostigmine, tacrine, metrifonate, galantamine, rivastigmine,

          -  Any condition which would make the patient or the caregiver/study partner, in the
