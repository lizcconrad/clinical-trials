  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of submental fat graded by the investigator as 2, 3, or 4 using the CR-SMFRS
             (Appendix B).

          2. Sufficient and symmetrical submental fat such that the protocol-specified number of
             injections can be safely administered on both the right and left side.

          3. No difference in perception or sensitivity (pain or otherwise) between left and right
             sides of the submental area.

          4. Abstinence from alcohol for at least 6 hours prior to both the Baseline and 24-hour
             visits.

          5. Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females who are aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, on
             Baseline date.

          6. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) test result from a sample obtained during the screening period.
             Females of childbearing potential must agree to practice adequate contraception, in
             the judgment of the investigator, during the course of the trial (including
             post-screening).

          7. The subject is expected to comply with and understand the visit schedule and all of
             the protocol-specified tests and procedures.

          8. The subject is medically able to undergo the administration of study material as
             determined by clinical and laboratory evaluations obtained within 14 days before
             dosing with study material for which the investigator identifies no clinically
             significant abnormality.

          9. Signed informed consent obtained before any study-specific procedure is conducted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any intervention (e.g., liposuction) or trauma associated with the chin or
             neck areas, which in the judgment of the investigator, may affect subject safety or
             other evaluations of treatment.

          2. Evidence of any cause of enlargement in the submental area (e.g., thyroid enlargement,
             cervical adenopathy) other than localized submental fat.

          3. Any medical condition (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological
             disease, uncontrolled hypertension, thyroid dysfunction), that would interfere with
             the assessment of safety in this trial or would compromise the ability of the subject
             to undergo study procedures or to give informed consent.

          4. Any cognitive impairment that, in the Investigator's opinion, would preclude study
             participation or compliance with protocol-specified procedures.

          5. Treatment with analgesics or other agents that could affect the pain response,
             including but not limited to acetaminophen or ibuprofen taken within 1 day prior to
             Baseline; additionally, narcotic analgesics, tranquilizers, hypnotics, sedatives, or
             opiates within 7 days prior to Baseline.

          6. Treatment of the chin or SMF with injectable steroids within 90 days prior to
             Baseline.

          7. Participation in a pain study within 6 months prior to Baseline.

          8. History of chronic pain and/or a history of chronic analgesic or tranquilizer use
             within 90 days prior to Baseline.

          9. Any anticipated need for agents with anticoagulative effects (e.g., aspirin,
             ibuprofen, warfarin, heparin) during the course of the trial.

         10. Treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g., aspirin, warfarin) within 10 days prior to
             Baseline.

         11. Treatment with topical agents to the submental or neck area, including but not limited
             to creams or ointments used to treat dermatologic conditions (e.g., steroids,
             capsaicin, retinoids, fluorouracil) within 7 days prior to Baseline.

         12. Treatment with radio frequency, laser procedures, chemical peel, or dermal fillers in
             the neck or chin area within 12 months before dosing or botulinum toxin injections
             within 6 months prior to Baseline.

         13. Previous enrollment into this trial or treatment with ATX-101 or agents containing
             deoxycholate.

         14. Treatment with an investigational agent within 28 days prior to Baseline.
