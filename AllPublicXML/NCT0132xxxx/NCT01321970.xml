  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary goal is to validate a new diagnostic tool for functional coronary artery stenosis
      that uses multimodal imaging (combining stress echocardiography and stress scintigraphy) in
      patients with known coronary chest pain.

    <description>Qualitative interpretation of the left ventricular wall motion abnormalities is performed in real time in the resting phase and during pharmacological stress. The translation of quantitative data is then performed for each of the 17 segments on a bulls-eye pattern identical to that of scintigraphy.</description>

    <description>Image acquisition is synchronized to the electrocardiogram. The tomographic sections are represented in the 3 directions of space, the analysis is also done on the classical representation in 17 segments. (Typically used in ultrasound perfusion scintigraphy or PET).</description>

    <intervention_name>Coronary angiography</intervention_name>
    <description>Performed in interventional cardiology setting using a guide introduced through the radial or femoral artery. The injection of iodine allows opacification of coronary arteries and their visualization by fluoroscopy. The qualitative interpretation of the data is translated in terms of percentage of stenosis of the coronary artery. It is thus considered that the stenosis is significant at over 70% obstruction of the lumenal diameter. This interpretation is made for each of the three main coronary arteries and their tributaries:
Right coronary (proximal, middle and distal) and collateral (inter ventricular posterior ventricular posterior retro)
Inter ventricular anterior (proximal, middle and distal) and its tributaries (diagonal and septal)
Circumflex (proximal, middle and distal) and collateral (first and second marginal)</description>
