  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a home care medication management program
      which includes nurse coordination and use of the MD.2 medication-dispensing machine will
      affect older adults' health outcomes, satisfaction, use of health care services, and health
      care costs over a one year period. The investigators propose a longitudinal three group
      repeated measures design, enrolling, and randomly assigning, clients who are discharged from
      a home health care agency with documented problems in medication management. One group will
      receive the MD.2 medication dispensing device and nurse coordination, the second group will
      receive a Medplanner: a simple box that has separate compartments for individual medication
      times over the course of a week plus nurse coordination, and the final group will receive
      Usual Care.

      The study hypotheses are the following:

      H1: With respect to health status outcomes, the MD.2 group will exhibit a more positive
      trajectory in physical and mental health status, functional status, cognitive status and
      depressive symptoms over the course of a year than will the Medplanner Group.

      H2: With respect to health status outcomes, the Medplanner Group will exhibit a more positive
      trajectory in physical and mental health status, functional status, cognitive status and
      depressive symptoms over the course of a year than will the Usual Care Group.

      H3: The rate of hospitalization, hospital days and emergency department visits will be
      significantly lower for the MD.2 Group as compared to the Medplanner Group.

      H4: The rate of hospitalization, hospital days and emergency department visits will be
      significantly lower for the Medplanner Group as compared to the Usual Care Group.

      H5: The nursing home admission rate will be significantly lower for the MD.2 Group as
      compared to the Medplanner Group.

      H6: The nursing home admission rate will be significantly lower for the Medplanner Group as
      compared to the Usual Care Group.

      H7: The total cost of care will be significantly lower for the MD.2 Group as compared to the
      Medplanner Group.

      H8: The total cost of care will be significantly lower for the Medplanner Group as compared
      to The Usual Care Group.

      H9: There will be incremental savings in terms of costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY)
      gained in the MD.2 group compared with the Medplanner Group.

      H10: There will be incremental savings in terms of costs per QALY gained in the Medplanner
      group compared with the Usual Care Group.

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was developed to identify depression in older adults. The original GDS was 30 questions, however, fifteen- and five-question versions also exist. When tested on the oldest old in the community, the 15-item scale was demonstrated to have favorable reliability and validity results. Impaired cognitive function (MMSE &lt; 28) reduced the tool's specificity, but sensitivity was not affected by lower MMSE scores. The tool is scored into depression categories of &quot;none/mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;major&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Physical Performance Test (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This functional status test has demonstrated reliability and validity, is easy to administer, can be performed in a reasonable period of time, and imposes little burden on the individual being tested. Even men and women with mild to moderate dementia are capable of understanding the test and performing activities reliably. There are 7 items on the test that range in difficulty from very easy to perform (writing a sentence) to challenging (picking up a penny), thus encompassing a spectrum of physical capabilities.</description>

    <measure>SF-36 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This tool is a widely used generic health status questionnaire measuring eight dimensions of health status: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, social functioning, general mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perceptions. In addition, the SF-36 can be transformed into a Health State Utility Index that allows for health improvements to be stated in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Mental Status Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 11-item measure screens for cognitive abilities in the domains of orientation, memory, attention, recall, language and visual/spatial orientation. The MMSE may be a categorical or continuous-level variable. When used as a categorical variable, the MMSE is broken down into 4 levels: (a) score range 24-30 is considered within normal limits (WNL), (b) score range of 18-23 is considered mild cognitive impairment, (c) score range of 12-17 is considered moderate cognitive impairment, and (d) a score range of 11 or less is considered to be severe cognitive impairment.</description>
