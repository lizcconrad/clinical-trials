  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis is a key process in the formation of exudative pleural effusions. Fluid
      loculation is common in parapneumonic effusion and is associated with depressed pleural
      fibrinolytic activity and poor clinical outcome. However, the relationship between angiogenic
      cytokines and fibrinolytic activity in the pleural space remains unclear. The researchers's
      hypothesis is that the levels of angiogenic cytokines were increased and associated with
      decreased fibrinolytic activity in parapneumonic effusions which may contribute to fibrin
      deposition and fluid loculation in the pleural space.

    <textblock>
      Formation of parapneumonic effusions (PPE) involves increased pleural vascular permeability
      induced by the contiguous pneumonia. It has been demonstrated that exposure of pleural
      mesothelial cells to bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to increased release of
      angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin
      (IL)-8, which induce vascular hyperpermeability, fluid exudation, and neutrophil influx into
      the pleural space, and may play a pivotal role in development of PPE. With persistent
      inflammation and angiogenesis, amplified vascular and mesothelial permeability leads to
      increased plasma extravasation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and repression of
      fibrinolytic activity within the pleural cavity, which contribute to the development of a
      ''complicated'' PPE, manifested with fibrin deposition and pleural fluid loculation. Fibrin
      turnover in the pleural cavity is greatly affected by fibrinolytic activity mediated by
      plasmin, which is regulated mainly by the equilibrium between plasminogen activators (PAs)
      and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs).VEGF induces vascular hyperpermeability and may
      facilitate the genesis of fibrin gel in PPE. Previous studies reported that VEGF plays a role
      in the modulation of tPA and PAI-1, and that anti-VEGF antibody attenuates pleurodesis
      induced by transforming growth factor-β2. These findings suggest that VEGF may be involved in
      the regulation of fibrin turnover, fluid loculation and tissue fibrosis in the pleural space.
      Enhanced procoagulant and depressed fibrinolytic activities have been observed in PPE.
      However, the relationship between angiogenic cytokines and fibrinolytic activity in PPE
      remains unclear.

    <description>With the guidance of chest US, 50 ml of pleural fluid was collected using a standard thoracentesis technique immediately or within 24 hr after hospitalization. When pleural effusion was multi-loculated, the fluid was aspirated from the largest loculus. Routine analyses of pleural fluid for total leukocytes, cell differentials of leukocytes, pH value, and levels of protein, glucose and LDH were performed in addition to cytological and microbiologic examination of pleural fluid.The rest of pleural fluid samples were mixed with 3.8 % sodium citrate in a 9:1 ratio of pleural fluid to citrate. The sodium citrate-mixed pleural fluid specimens were immersed in ice immediately and then centrifuged at 2,500 g for 10 minutes. The cell-free supernatants of pleural fluid were frozen at -70℃ immediately after centrifuge for later measurements. The commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to measure the effusion levels of VEGF, IL-8 , tPA and PAI-1.</description>
