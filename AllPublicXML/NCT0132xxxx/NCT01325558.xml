  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation study
      of ALT-836 in combination with standard of care gemcitabine in participants who have locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), and to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of ALT-836 given
      with gemcitabine. The clinical benefit, progression-free survival and overall survival of
      study participants will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissue Factor (TF) is over-expressed in most cancer types. Results from many recent studies
      have suggested a key role for TF in the development of cancer-associated thrombosis, tumor
      growth, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. ALT-836, a recombinant human-chimeric
      monoclonal antibody, is designed as a direct TF antagonist to block TF displayed by cancers
      and to inhibit cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis and
      tumor metastasis. In numerous pre-clinical studies in laboratory animals, including non-human
      primates, ALT-836 exhibits potent anti-tumor, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory
      activities with a remarkable safety profile. In humans, ALT-836, administered as a single
      bolus and monotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute lung
      injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), is safe and exhibits anti-coagulant
      and anti-inflammatory effects. A Phase II study using a multi-dose regimen of ALT-836 is
      being conducted in patients with ALI/ARDS. In the dose-escalation study described in this
      protocol, the investigators will assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of ALT-836 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced malignancies known
      to overexpress TF and in which venous thromboembolism is a major complication.

    <description>Study participants will receive up to four courses of a 28-day biochemotherapy with the study drug (ALT-836) and gemcitabine. Each treatment course consists of five doses of ALT-836 (on Day 1, 4, 8, 15 and 22) and three doses of gemcitabine (Day 1, 8 and 15). Participants with persistent responses will receive additional two cycles, three doses each, of standard of care gemcitabine therapy.</description>
