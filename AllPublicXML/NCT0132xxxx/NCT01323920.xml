  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common problem after stem cell transplant is graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). GVHD is a
      complication of transplantation where the donor graft attacks and damages some of your
      tissues. After stem cell transplant, all patients receive prophylactic medications against
      GVHD.

      In this research study, we are studying the safety and effectiveness of a bortezomib based
      GVHD prophylaxic drug combination in participants after myeloablative allogeneic stem call
      transplantation from a matched unrelated donor, mismatched related or unrelated donor.

      Before your transplant you will receive conditioning therapy with fludarabine and busulfan
      given 7, 6, 5, and 4 days before your transplant. On day 0, you will receive selected blood
      cells taken from your sibling or unrelated donor.

      You will receive 3 drugs for your GVHD prophylaxis:

      Tacrolimus will be started 3 days before your transplant. It will be given intravenously and
      later by mouth. You will continue to take tacrolimus for 3 to 6 months after transplant.

      Methotrexate will be given intravenously 1, 3, 6 and 11 days after your transplant.

      Bortezomib will be given intravenously 1, 4, and 7 days after your transplant. On days 1, 4,
      7, 30 and 3, 6 and 12 months after your transplant you will have a physical exam, blood work,
      and be asked to complete a questionnaire.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD up to Day 100 after stem cell infusion. Acute GHVD is graded according to the modified Glucksberg criteria (adapted from Thomas et al., NEJM ,1975, pp. 895-90), which is based on criteria by which the provider classifies acute GVHD per its objective organ staging. Acute GVHD is assessed in weekly standard of care visits post stem cell infusion and is captured in the protocol EDC upon evaluation of clinical notes up to Day 100. Data for acute GVHD organ staging and etiologies are collected in an acute GVHD separate case report form and do not include system organ class, expectedness or attribution.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>

    <measure>The Non-relapse Mortality, Progression-free and Overall Survival up to 1 Year After Stem Cell Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free and overall survival by 1 year after stem cell infusion will be assessed using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from stem cell infusion to the time of disease progression or death from any cause. Overall survival will be defined as the time from stem cell infusion to the time to death from any cause. Patients will be censored at the time last documented alive. Cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meier curves will be constructed as appropriate. Progression is defined per clinical presentation, not protocol specified, and vary per disease, e.g. blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood for AML/MDS; lymphoma + on PET/CT re-staging etc.</description>

        <title>The Non-relapse Mortality, Progression-free and Overall Survival up to 1 Year After Stem Cell Infusion</title>
        <description>Progression free and overall survival by 1 year after stem cell infusion will be assessed using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from stem cell infusion to the time of disease progression or death from any cause. Overall survival will be defined as the time from stem cell infusion to the time to death from any cause. Patients will be censored at the time last documented alive. Cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meier curves will be constructed as appropriate. Progression is defined per clinical presentation, not protocol specified, and vary per disease, e.g. blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood for AML/MDS; lymphoma + on PET/CT re-staging etc.</description>

Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contacted for additional assessments until the toxicity has resolved or is deemed irreversible.Participants will be followed for 1 year after transplantation or until death, whichever occurs first.</time_frame>
      <desc>AEs grade 3-5 &amp; SAEs whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, directly observed, or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study-specific case report forms.
