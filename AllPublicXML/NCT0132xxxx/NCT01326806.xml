  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a parent-based intervention designed to
      prevent adolescent sexual risk behavior in Latino and African American inner city youth. The
      intervention will be administered in the context of mothers waiting for their children to
      complete an annual physical exam required for school admission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, racial and ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from preventable
      diseases and conditions. Many of these problems result from health-related behaviors that are
      established during childhood and adolescence. Latino and African-American adolescents are at
      considerable risk for the negative consequences of early, risky sexual activity. This study
      will focus on inner-city Latino and African-American early adolescents ages 11 to 14. The
      primary aim will be to test and refine an intervention developed for parents to address the
      issue of sexual risk behavior with their children.

      The intervention will take place in a primary health care clinic when mothers accompany their
      children for annual physical exams. Mothers will meet with a social work interventionist for
      approximately 30 minutes while their children are being examined by a physician. During this
      time, mothers will receive information about the problem of premature adolescent sexual
      activity, support in preventing or reducing their children's sexual risk behavior,
      instruction about how to talk with their children about sexual risk behavior, and targeted
      homework activities. All parents will also receive three follow-up phone calls to increase
      the probability that the homework tasks will be completed.

      Participants in this study will also be assigned to one of the following three groups: an
      experimental group; an active control group; or a passive control group. Participants in all
      groups will complete three questionnaires over the course of the study to assess outcomes.
      Participants in the experimental and active control groups will partake in an additional
      meeting with a social work interventionist. Parents in the experimental group will meet with
      the social work interventionist to discuss effective parent-adolescent communication
      strategies. They will also receive take-home materials to help them communicate with and
      parent their adolescents to reduce sexual risk behavior. Parents in the active control group
      will meet with the social work interventionist to discuss adolescent nutrition and receive
      informational brochures.

      Three booster sessions will take place via telephone for parents in the experimental and
      active control groups. The first booster call will occur approximately 1 month after study
      entry, the second will occur 5 months after the intervention ends, and the third will occur 9
      months post intervention. No such booster calls will be provided to parents in the passive
      control condition.

    <description>The intervention will take place in a primary health care clinic and will be coordinated through allied health professionals when physicians see youth for their annual physical examination. A mother of the adolescent will meet with an interventionist for approximately 30 minutes while her child is being examined by a physician. During this time, the intervention will be delivered to the mother. At the conclusion of the session, the mother will be given reference materials to take home and tasks to perform to facilitate discussions about sex with her adolescent. There will be three follow-up booster sessions administered through phone calls to increase completion probabilities of the tasks. The target behavior is sexual activity in adolescents.</description>
