  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifetime prevalence rates of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in Canada are between 10-12%
      with approximately 1.5 million Canadians reporting depression in any given year. Alarmingly,
      the burden of ill health associated with MDD is projected to increase worldwide such that by
      the year 2020, depression will move from its current position of fourth to become the second
      greatest burden of ill health, closely following ischaemic heart disease (Murray &amp; Lopez,
      1998). As depressed patients are often in frequent contact with their primary care physicians
      for other health problems, effective depression treatment and management currently relies
      heavily on the primary care sector. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an empirically
      supported psychotherapy that is recommended by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety
      Treatments Clinical Guidelines as a first-line treatment for depression. However, across
      Canada, CBT is not readily accessible by primary care physicians for their patients,
      particularly in rural areas.

      To help address this nationwide need for CBT, British Columbia (BC) is the first and only
      province in Canada to develop and implement a high capacity mental health service, Bounce
      Back: Reclaim your Health (BB), for primary care patients with mild to moderate depression.
      In BB, the patients' use of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) self-help materials is
      supported via trained telephone coaches.

      The primary objective of our proposed research is to provide direct evidence of the
      effectiveness of the BB program, and, in particular, the telephone coaching component. The
      investigators will test: (1) whether the BB program is more effective than general
      practitioner (GP) treatment-as-usual (TAU); and (2) whether BB's positive results can be
      attributed to the telephone coaching component, as this component is associated with the most
      significant costs of the program. A secondary objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness
      of such telephone support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed project is designed to evaluate and provide direct evidence for the clinical
      effectiveness of the Bounce Back: Reclaim your Health (BB) project currently implemented in
      17 communities in British Columbia (BC). BB is an innovative mental health service in the
      health care system designed to help patients participate in their own care by teaching them
      the sufficient and necessary skills to manage their moods. This BB program, led by the
      Canadian Mental Health Association's BC Division, offers mental health support to primary
      care patients suffering from mild to moderate depression. BB is a low intensity, high
      capacity program, based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) self-help materials Overcoming
      Depression, Low Mood and Anxiety: A five areas approach (OD - comprising psycho-educational
      DVD and self-help mood improvement workbook). The content of these self-help materials was
      adapted to a BC context for the BB program. In addition, in order to best meet the needs of
      BC primary care patients, this new mental health service is delivered to patients in their
      own homes and patients' use of the OD self-help materials is supported via trained telephone
      coaches. Telephone coaches are non-specialists trained and monitored by a registered
      psychologist. Coaching enables patients to engage with and get the most out of the materials.
      The advantages of telephone coaching include privacy, accessibility, and convenience,
      especially for those patients living in rural areas and can not access treatment due to
      geographic barriers; those who do not seek treatment due to stigma; or those who are coping
      with chronic physical illness and multiple medical appointments. There is only indirect
      support for the effectiveness of the BB program. Thus, this proposed project is designed to
      evaluate and provide direct evidence of the effectiveness of the BB program.
