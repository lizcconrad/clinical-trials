  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity has been associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes in
      women of reproductive age, including infertility and early pregnancy loss. Recent data
      suggests that overweight and obese patients are also at increased risk of recurrent pregnancy
      loss (RPL), a devastating condition that affects 1% of the fertile population.

      The investigators propose a prospective, randomized controlled trial in which overweight and
      obese patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss are enrolled in a structured, 6
      month, weight loss program or provided routine counseling regarding the importance of weight
      loss. Pregnancy outcomes will then be followed to assess miscarriage rates. Metabolic
      outcomes, such as lipid and glucose profiles, will also be evaluated.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a structured weight loss program
      versus traditional weight-loss counseling on pregnancy outcomes in women with recurrent
      pregnancy loss. The study protocol is as follows:

        1. Patients will be notified of study via flyer inserted into patient chart at initial
           clinic visit, physician referral or Stanford website. Patients expressing interest will
           have their charts reviewed to confirm that they meet all enrollment criteria. Potential
           subjects will then be contacted via phone and verbal consent to participate obtained.

        2. The participant will then have an office visit for consent signing and randomization. A
           formal weight will be obtained, the Beck Depression Inventory will be administered by
           Penny Donnelly, a self-administered questionnaire will be completed, and a basic
           laboratory evaluation, including a fasting lipid panel, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
           fasting glucose and insulin levels, 2-hour glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1c and
           CRP will be preformed.

        3. The patients will then be randomized to traditional weight loss counseling (control
           group) or to the structured weight loss program (study group). Patients will be
           instructed to discontinue attempts at conception.

        4. Those patients randomized to the control group will receive the ACOG Patient Education
           pamphlets on obesity.

        5. Those patients randomized to the study group will have a formal evaluation and
           counseling by Dr. Sun Kim, a medical endocrinologist specializing in weight management.
           They will then be enrolled in a structured weight loss program.

        6. For all patients, a 3-month follow-up office visit will be scheduled. At this visit, a
           formal weight will be obtained, the Beck Depression Inventory will be re-administered by
           Penny Donnelly, a self-administered questionnaire will be completed, and a follow-up
           laboratory evaluation, including a fasting lipid panel, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
           fasting glucose and insulin levels, 2-hour glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1c and
           CRP will be preformed. Patients will be informed that they may now being attempts to
           conceive.

        7. Patients randomized to the study group will continue in the structured weight loss
           program for 6 months.

        8. Six months after enrollment, all patients will have a telephone interview in which a
           close-out questionnaire will be administered and a final, self-reported weight will be
           obtained.

        9. Primary and secondary outcomes will be followed for 2.5 years after date of enrollment
           for all patients.

    <description>Those patients randomized to the structured weight loss group will have a formal evaluation and counseling a medical endocrinologist specializing in weight management. The structured weight loss program will consist of meeting with a dietician who will guide them on following a hypocaloric diet with a calorie deficit of 750kcal/day. The weight loss goal will be to lose 1-1.5 pounds/week. The participants will receive teaching utilizing the American Diabetes Association Exchange Lists and will receive sample meal plans. In addition, participants will be seen by the dietitian once a week for a month, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, then once per month for 3 months. Patients randomized to the study group will continue in the structured weight loss program for 6 months.</description>
