      The primary goal of the study is to assess the safety and performance of the Treovance device
      in subjects with infrarenal aortic aneurysms, specifically to evaluate if the diseased
      pathology can be treated with an acceptable adverse event rate and that the device performs
      as expected. The results of this study will permit the establishment of endpoints and
      clinical design for a subsequent U.S. trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             without iliac artery involvement

          -  Subjects with an infrarenal AAA that is &gt;/= 4.5 cm in diameter for males, or &gt;/= 4.0
             cm in diameter for females, or has increased in diameter by 0.5 cm in the last 6
             months

          -  Subjects who consent to participate

          -  Subjects who agree to comply with the follow-up schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with dissections, ruptured aneurysms, or symptomatic aneurysms

          -  Subjects with prior AAA repair

          -  Subjects with medical conditions that would complicate the endovascular procedure or
             confound results (e.g., Marfan's syndrome, morbid obesity, severe coronary artery
             disease)

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects participating in other investigational studies
