    <textblock>
      Malignant biliary obstruction is a common clinical condition caused by various malignancies.
      Currently,biliary stent implantation guided either by fluoroscopy or endoscopy has become the
      most important methods for relieving malignant biliary obstruction. However, the benefit for
      the survival of the patients with palliation of the stent treatment is limited because no
      therapeutic effects on process of the tumor itself by a stent implantation. Encouraged by the
      success of 125I esophageal stent in esophageal carcinoma, a novel biliary stent loaded with
      125I radioactive seeds has been developed in our institute. After ex vivo and in vivo
      evaluations for the delivery system, the investigators prospectively compare the responses to
      treatment with this radiation biliary stent, versus the conventional biliary SEMS in patient
      with malignant biliary obstruction.
