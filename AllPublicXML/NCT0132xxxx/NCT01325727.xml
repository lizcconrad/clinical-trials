      The purpose of this research study is to find out more about smokers in recovery from
      addiction to alcohol/other drugs, and to evaluate a brief computerized smoking behavior
      feedback session. The hypothesis is that a brief computerized smoking behavior feedback
      session will motivate more smokers to quit smoking than a control condition.
