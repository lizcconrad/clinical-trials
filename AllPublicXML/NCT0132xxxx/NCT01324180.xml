    <textblock>
      H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute will be the Sunshine Project Coordinator,
      but will not be recruiting locally.

      The purpose of the trial is to study the clinical and biological effects of metformin in
      combination with standard systemic chemotherapy in a disease (relapsed ALL) that has a dismal
      outcome, as well as to do a dose escalation study to find the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of
      metformin in conjunction with ALL therapy. There have also been analysis of patients enrolled
      on trials who were diabetics on metformin and their outcome was better than patients on the
      same trial that were not on metformin as their antihyperglycemic.

      This will be a phase I protocol of Vincristine, Dexamethasone, Doxorubicin, and
      PEG-asparaginase (VPLD) and metformin conducted in the Sunshine Project sites for children
      with recurrent ALL. All sites will be eligible to open this study, provided they agree to
      adhere to all study procedures and make a good faith effort to obtain all pharmacodynamic and
      pharmacokinetic evaluations requested.

    <description>Induction will consist of vincristine, dexamethasone, doxorubicin and PEG asparaginase (so called VPLD - dexamethasone is substituted for prednisone and PEG asparaginase is substituted for L-asparaginase) in combination with metformin. Eligible patients will receive 24 hours of metformin followed by induction. Intrathecal chemotherapy with standard dose cytarabine will be administered at the start of each cycle, with central nervous system (CNS) therapy afterwards determined by findings on staging lumbar puncture.</description>

Metformin will be continued throughout the cycle until Day 28 or until the patient is removed from study (e.g. to pursue new lines of therapy such as transplant), whichever occurs sooner.</description>
