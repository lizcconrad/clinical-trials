    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide use of Omegaven in children with life threatening
      Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) associated cholestasis when all other medical and surgical
      treatments/therapies have been either ineffective or not feasible in the treatment of this
      serious condition. This is a compassionate use protocol.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months from the completion of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>For effectiveness endpoint, the allowable minimum time interval between serial direct bilirubin measurements that will determine reversal of cholestasis is 2 consecutive measurements of direct bilirubin &lt; or = to 2mg/dL obtained at least 2 weeks apart.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Essential fatty acid profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days from therapy completion</time_frame>
    <description>Previous studies have found no association between Omegaven administration and essential fatty acid deficiency. Due to theoretical concern for developing fatty acid deficiency with low dose Omegaven administration, these levels will be followed during Omegaven therapy.</description>

    <description>For infants meeting inclusion criteria and whose guardians consent to participation, Omegaven will be initiated at the dose of 0.5gram/kg/day and is infused over 24 hours for 1-2 days and then advanced to 1 gram/kg/day. Omegaven will be infused intravenously through a central or peripheral catheter alone or in conjunction with parenteral nutrition.</description>

             laboratory monitoring

          -  must not be enrolled in another clinical trial involving an investigational agent
             (unless approved by the designated physicians).
