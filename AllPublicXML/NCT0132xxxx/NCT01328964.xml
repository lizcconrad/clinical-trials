  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare asthma-related exacerbations (emergency department
      (ED) or inpatient (IP) visit) and related cost in pediatric patients aged 4-11 years that
      received either fluticasone propionate 44 mcg (FP44) or budesonide (BUD) or montelukast
      (MON). This retrospective observational cohort analysis utilizes a large managed care
      database with linked pharmacy and medical claims. Patients with ≥ 1 pharmacy claim FP44 or
      BUD or MON between January 1, 2000 through June 30, 2008 (4-11 years old at time of index)
      with ≥ 1 diagnosis for asthma (ICD-9 493.xx) in the pre-index period and continuously
      eligible to receive healthcare services for 1-year pre-index and at least 30 days post-index.
      Dose of each inhaled corticosteroid was not known in the database. Follow-up was defined for
      each patient as the period beginning with the index date and ending with the last date of
      continuous claims history, switch to another asthma controller medication, or claim for an
      asthma related event (ED/IP visit or OCS use) post-index, whichever occurred first.

    <description>The number of participants with an asthma-related event was computed during the follow-up period and was standardized by dividing by the total days of follow-up in each cohort since participants had different lengths of follow-up.

    <time_frame>12 months prior to January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2008</time_frame>
    <description>The mean total asthma costs are a sum of pharmacy and medical costs. Costs were determined monthly from the pharmacy and medical encounters recorded in the managed care insurance database. All costs were summed for each participant over the 3-12 month follow-up period (post-index period), and a mean monthly cost was calculated by dividing by the follow-up for each participant.</description>

        <description>The mean total asthma costs are a sum of pharmacy and medical costs. Costs were determined monthly from the pharmacy and medical encounters recorded in the managed care insurance database. All costs were summed for each participant over the 3-12 month follow-up period (post-index period), and a mean monthly cost was calculated by dividing by the follow-up for each participant.</description>
