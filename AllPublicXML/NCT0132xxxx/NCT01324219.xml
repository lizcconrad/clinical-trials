  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in reducing problem behaviors of nursing home residents with
      dementia that make providing care difficult. The investigators call these behaviors
      resistiveness to care. Previous research has found that resistiveness to care occurs more
      frequently when staff use certain types of communication. An inservice program will be
      provided to all nursing staff in your nursing home to teach staff about communication
      practices to reduce resistiveness to care. The research study will see whether changing
      communication will reduce resident resistiveness to care. If effective, the communication
      training may then be used to improve care in other facilities.

      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn if changing communication practices will
      reduce resistiveness to care in nursing home residents with dementia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Staff:Inclusion criteria for CNAs are:

          -  age 18 years old or greater (age of legal consent in Kansas and Missouri), signed
             informed consent,

          -  permanent employment in the NH,

          -  primary assignment to a specified unit,

          -  and English speaking

          -  Staff must have been assigned to care for the resident at least twice weekly in the
             past month (documented in NH staffing records). This will assure that staff-resident
             dyads have established relationships and will control effects of variability in
             contact between dyads during days when data are not being collected.

        Resident inclusion criteria are:

          -  a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or related dementia documented in their medical
             records,

          -  documentation of daily RTC over the past week,

          -  and ability to hear staff communication (from the most recent MDS).

        Exclusion criteria for CNAs include:

          -  non-English speaking,

          -  temporary employment, -and age under 18 years.

          -  If more than one CNA volunteers as a partner for a participating resident, a random
             selection will be made to determine which CNA will participate. Small variations in
             contact between staff and residents in dyads are anticipated due to PMMA policies for
             consistent CNA assignment to neighborhoods. Therefore dyads will have repeated
             contacts.

        Exclusion criteria for residents include:

          -  diagnosis with Huntington's disease,

          -  alcohol-related dementias,

          -  schizophrenia,

          -  manic-depressive disorder,

          -  deafness,

          -  and mental retardation.
