    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of clarithromycin in eradication of Ureaplasma urealyticum from premature nasopharynges</measure>
    <time_frame>12 days after treatment by clarithromycin</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of clarithromycin in eradication of Ureaplasma and incidence of CLD were the major outcomes of the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs for Ureaplasma were taken in postnatal first 3 days and on the 12th day only in culture positive infants, transported to the laboratory and cultured for Uu immediately.</description>
