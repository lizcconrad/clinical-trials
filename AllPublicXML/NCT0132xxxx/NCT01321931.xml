      Multiple-dose nicotine pharmacokinetics with three oral nicotine replacement products. A
      study in healthy smokers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty (50) healthy male or female subjects between the ages of 19 and 50 years, inclusive,
      smoking at least 20 cigarettes daily during at least one year preceding inclusion. Multiple
      doses of all study treatments are given either every 60 minutes or every 90 minutes,
      respectively. All products will be administered in accordance with labeling, on five separate
      treatment visits. The subjects will abstain from smoking from 8 pm in the evening before and
      until the end of each visit.
