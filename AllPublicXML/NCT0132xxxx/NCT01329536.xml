  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine if a specific genetic allele is
      involved with the development of agitation in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD). The study will compare the results of genetic testing between two groups: individuals
      with late-onset AD who show signs of agitation and individuals with late-onset AD who do not
      show signs of agitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Agitation and other behavioral disturbances are a main cause in the need for increasing
      levels of care for the patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD). And while the pathology of
      dementia has been studied in great detail, the etiology is considered multi-factorial. The
      hypothesis behind this clinical study is that the presence of the apo lipoprotein E4 (APO E4)
      allele will serve to predict which patients with late on-set AD are at greater risk to
      develop agitation.

    <description>This study consists of a single clinic visit. After subject has completed the informed consent process and meets eligibility criteria, a blood sample and a saliva sample will be collected. Genetic results from this one-time specimen collection will be evaluated and compared with results from participants in the other study group of age- and gender-matched patients. Outcomes will be measured comparatively.</description>
