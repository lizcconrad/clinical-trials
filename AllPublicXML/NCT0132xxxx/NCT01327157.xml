      -  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Neuro Occlusal Rehabilitation
           (RNO) in patients with peripheral facial palsy (PFP) disease, noting the decrease in
           symptoms of masticatory dysfunction.

        -  According to Carvalho (2009) patients with PFP have chronic unilateral masticatory
           preference. Santos et al. (2009) in the same year noted that these conditions can lead
           to problems with temporomandibular disorder.

        -  Hypothesis- known that performing occlusal adjustment in these patients with chronic
           PFP, ensuring a maximum of dental contacts and a final stop of the masticatory cycle
           stable, providing a balanced occlusion.

        -  dental cleaning was performed in two groups for the blind study

        -  visual analog scale -To assess the quality of the oral functions of these patients, the
           investigators applied the visual analog scale(VAS) and statistically evaluated the
           degree of satisfaction regarding the functions of oro facial in relation to mastication
           and temporomandibular dysfunction.

        -  gnathostats models were made in the treatment group in the first and last query

        -  occlusal adjustment in treatment group.In the group treated occlusal adjustment was made
           in the teeth and applied a new (VAS) before and after treatment.

      The RNO, is defined as a part of medicine that operates in stomatology occlusal plane as a
      guide to a harmonious development of the face, chewing facilitating bilateral and
      alternating. (Planas, 1997). It works through selective grinding on the occlusal platform,
      providing an increased number of dental contacts.

      Purpose: To evaluate the effects of the Neuro-Rehabilitation occlusion in patients with
      chronic facial palsy by observing the decrease of the symptoms of masticatory dysfunction.

      Methods: a selection of sixty-five patients with facial palsy (PFP 65) and idiopathic chronic
      trauma of the Otorhinolaryngology sector facial nerve disorders at UNIFESP.

      Patients were of both genders, aged between 18 and 60. They were analyzed according to the
      criteria of inclusion and exclusion, resulting in forty-three patients.

      However, due to problems inherent in research, a group of fourteen patients were randomized
      (sub-divided) into two groups: control and treatment.

      The visual analog scale was used at the first consultation to patients in the control and
      treatment All patients underwent a dental cleaning in order to blind the study. Seven
      patients belonged to the control group for three months, the VAS was performed in both
      groups. The control group was later reunited with the treatment group after three months of
      control period, increasing the number of patients who were examined in extracts, with similar
      features in a prognostic factor.

        -  Control group

        -  First visit-visual analogue scale and tooth cleaning

        -  Second consultation, after a month, a new visual analog scale.

        -  Third-query-one months after a new visual analogue scale patient was a three visits with
           an interval of one month, performing a repeat procedure.

        -  Treatment group, The researchers applied the technique of Rehabilitation and Neuro
           Occlusal gnatostaticos models that were made before and after treatment to count the
           dental contacts.

        -  First-query-visual analogue scale and tooth cleaning, intervention and preparation of
           initial models gnatostaticos

        -  Second-query-after a month, a new visual analogue and intervention.

        -  Last-query - visual analogue scale and making models gnatostaticos finals. The treatment
           group had one month to see changes in oral functions.

      Upon completion of the study patients continued to receive care in the ambulatory clinic of
      the university, but the attendance for this research was terminated.

    <description>It is a scale-shaped ruler, which is associated with faces used to grade the degree of pain for patients, before and after treatments, or just graduating pain and its severity for the patient (Souza, 2002).
Patients were asked to fill the VAS with the following questions.
Do you chew well?
How would you classify your chewing at the moment?
If you have trouble chewing, the rating is zero.
If you have any discomfort when you chew, your reference level is five.
If the discomfort is intense, its reference level is ten. The greater the discomfort, the greater the scale.</description>

    <description>The models were placed occluding brought with carbon, using the willis compass to keep occluding the posterior base of the model which are aligned with the rear.
The dental contacts were evaluated in models and gnathostats demarcated after the points were counted in the models before and after treatment If an increase in the number of dental contacts after occlusal adjustment was detected, in relation of the models.
The models are made in the first and last query, after three visits with one month interval between them by adding three queries.</description>
