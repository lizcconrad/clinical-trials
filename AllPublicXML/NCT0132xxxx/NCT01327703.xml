      This study by Aptalis (formerly Axcan) assesses the efficacy and safety of Panzytrat® 25,000
      compared to Kreon® 25,000 in the control of steatorrhea in participants with cystic fibrosis
      (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, two-period cross-over study to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Panzytrat® 25,000 to Kreon® 25,000 in participants aged 7
      years and older suffering from CF and EPI. The study consists of a qualification phase (5 to
      15 days); two treatment periods of 14 days each (plus a 3-day window if needed) and a 3-day
      stool collection will be performed from Days 12 to 15.

      A safety follow-up phone call will be arranged 7-10 days after completion of the treatment
      phase or after an early discontinuation.

    <measure>Percent Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12 up to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Percent CFA was calculated as ([fat intake - fat excretion]/fat intake)*100, determined in the stools which were collected over a 3-day period (Day 12 to morning of Day 15) during each treatment period. Least squares mean percent (%) CFA was calculated for Day 12 to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods. Percent CFA was based on log transformed data.</description>

    <measure>Mean Daily Number of Stools</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12 up to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daily number of stools of each participant was calculated from frequency of stools by the participant per day.

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Stools With Normal Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12 up to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Normal consistency of stool was defined as formed hard, normal or soft stool and abnormal consistency was defined as loose and unformed, liquid stool and diarrhea. Percentage of stools with normal consistency of each participant was calculated as the number of stools with normal consistency relative to the total number of stools during the collection period. Mean percentage of stool with normal consistency during the collection period (Day 12 to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods) for total participants was summarized.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Weight Per Stool Sample</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12 up to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Mean weight per stool sample was calculated for Day 12 to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Frequency of Days With Abdominal Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal symptoms included abdominal pain and flatulence. Symptoms were classified by severity as mild (no impairment of daily activities), moderate (slight impairment of daily activities), or severe (unable to perform daily activities). For each type of abdominal symptom, the relative frequency of days with the symptom for each participant in a treatment period was calculated as the number of days in which the symptom was reported divided by the total number of days in which the abdominal symptom case report form (CRF) was completed. Mean relative frequency of days with abdominal symptoms was calculated during each treatment period (Day 1 to Day 15).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Abdominal Distension</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal distension is a sense of increased abdominal pressure by the participant that involves an actual measurable change in the circumference of a participant's abdomen on physical examination. Percentage of participants with abdominal distension was calculated for each treatment period (Day 1 to Day 15).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA) Based on Concomitant Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12 up to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Percent CFA was calculated as ([fat intake - fat excretion]/fat intake)*100, determined in the stools which were collected over a 3-day period (Day 12 to morning of Day 15) during each treatment period. Least squares mean percent (%) CFA was calculated for Day 12 to Day 15 in first and second treatment periods. Percent CFA was based on log transformed data. Percent CFA was calculated separately for participants who used and did not use acid suppressing therapy (PPIs) during the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence regardless of its causal relationship to study drug. A TEAE was defined as any event not present prior to exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to test drug. A SAE was defined as any event that results in death, is immediately life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is assessed as medically important.</description>

Stabilized dose for a participant was the optimal dose determined during a qualification phase that preceded the first treatment period and was based upon the participant's usual lipase and lipid intake and total dose was not to exceed 10,000 Ph.Eur. units lipase/kg body weight/day.</description>

        <description>Abdominal symptoms included abdominal pain and flatulence. Symptoms were classified by severity as mild (no impairment of daily activities), moderate (slight impairment of daily activities), or severe (unable to perform daily activities).
