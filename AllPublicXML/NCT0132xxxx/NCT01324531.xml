  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled trial is to compare subjective
      patient-reported outcomes and objective clinical results between arthroscopic Bankart repair
      with and without arthroscopic infraspinatus remplissage in patients with anterior shoulder
      instability with a Hill-Sachs Defect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant osseous defects of the glenohumeral joint can often lead to failure of
      arthroscopic shoulder stabilization procedures. The best treatment in the setting of shoulder
      instability with significant glenoid and/or humeral defects remains controversial. Several
      open procedures have been suggested, but arthroscopic methods have started to garner some
      attention in the literature. In patients with an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion without
      significant glenoid bone loss, arthroscopic remplissage consisting of arthroscopic posterior
      capsulodesis and infraspinatus tenodesis to fill the Hill-Sachs lesion has been proposed as a
      novel treatment method.

      The authors believe it is scientifically necessary to investigate the role of addition of
      arthroscopic infraspinatus remplissage to the conventional arthroscopic Bankart repair. As
      more surgeons are trained in the technique, it will be performed more frequently. Increased
      patient awareness continues to lead to increasing demand for minimally invasive approaches.
      Arthroscopic remplissage brings with it an increase in operative time, with a theorized risk
      of reduction in dislocation risk. For these reasons, the authors believe that it is
      scientifically and fiscally necessary to determine the difference in outcome between
      arthroscopic Bankart repair with and without arthroscopic infraspinatus remplissage for
      patients with anterior shoulder instability and a Hill-Sachs defect in the framework of a
      prospective, randomized controlled study.

    <description>Bankart repair may be completed before or after remplissage. While maintaining camera in anterior-superior portal drill guide and anchor cannula is placed through the posterior portal into remplissage site. Anchor cannula with obturator is passed through infraspinatus tendon and posterior capsule via pre-existing portal, and first anchor is placed in inferior aspect of Hill-Sachs lesion.Once anchor is inserted, penetrating grasper is passed through tendon and posterior capsule, 1 cm inferior to the initial portal entry site, to grasp and pull 1 suture limb.Second anchor is placed in superior aspect of Hill-Sachs lesion and grasper penetrator is used in same fashion to pass 1 suture limb 1 cm superior to initial portal entry site. The inferior suture is tied first with knots remaining extraarticular in the subdeltoid space. The superior suture is tied to complete remplissage.</description>
