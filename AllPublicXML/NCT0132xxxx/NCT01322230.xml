    <textblock>
      This study involved medical students from seven US medical schools participating in a trial
      of two WISE-MD computer-based learning modules. Students were randomized to 1 of 4 study
      arms. The 4 content-equivalent conditions were: screen shots with voiceover and no
      interactivity; learner control of pacing through multi-media content; social networking
      features; and social networking features plus user interface enhancements.

    <description>An 8 week-long Surgery Clerkship (Jefferson University is 12 weeks) occurs 6 times (JU 4 times) per year. Students enroll on day 1, complete the baseline surveys in week 1, access the intervention modules by week 2. Learning outcomes (knowledge test) are measured immediately after the modules, at week 4 they complete online multiple-choice tests and a clinical reasoning measure, week 8, week 12 at JU, students complete a clinical reasoning measure.</description>
