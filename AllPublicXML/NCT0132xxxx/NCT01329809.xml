    <textblock>
      This is a neoadjuvant Phase 2a, open-label trial in patients with metastatic colorectal
      carcinoma who are undergoing a complete resection of the metastatic colorectal tumors in
      their liver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive either an intravenous infusion or an intratumoral injection of JX-594
      (Pexa-Vec) directly into one liver lesions at Day 1. Patients will undergo a complete
      resection of all liver tumors at Day 15. Patients will then be monitored throughout their
      life for disease recurrence and/or general overall survival.
