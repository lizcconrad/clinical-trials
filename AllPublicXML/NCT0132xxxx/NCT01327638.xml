  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to provide additional post-marketing safety data regarding the use of
      etoricoxib for the indication of ankylosing spondylitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific project objectives are to:

      1) Describe the characteristics of Swedish patients with inflammatory SpA/AS ; 2) Describe
      the use of etoricoxib and other cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2 inhibitors)/non-selective
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) in Swedish patients with SpA/AS; and 3)
      Estimate and compare the rates of clinical outcomes of special interest (gastrointestinal,
      renovascular, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular) with use of etoricoxib and other COX-2
      inhibitors/nsNSAIDs in Swedish patients with SpA/AS. Comparisons of clinical outcomes among
      the drugs of interest will be made by descriptive comparison of the point estimates for the
      incidence rates and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using both clinical and
      epidemiological judgment and in light of the limitations of this observational study. No
      formal statistical significance testing will be performed for purposes of such comparisons.
