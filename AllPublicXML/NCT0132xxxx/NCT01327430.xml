  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate parameters of the lipid metabolism in plasma and feces
      of healthy subjects after a dietary supplementation of different dosages of milk
      phospholipids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date the mechanisms for the intestinal absorption of glycerophosphates and sphingolipids
      are not completely investigated. It is assumed, that sphingolipids and sterols compete for
      intestinal absorption. In addition it is unclear, if a dietary phospholipid supplementation
      may influence the phospholipid concentration in plasma.

      To evaluate the effect of a dietary phospholipid supplementation 15 healthy female subjects
      received over 10 days daily 3 g of milk phospholipids stirred in a dairy product. During the
      following 10 days the subjects were supplemented with daily 6 g milk phospholipid. Finally,
      the subjects received over 10 days 6 g of the milk phospholipid in a dairy product and 2 g of
      plant sterols serving a commercial product.
