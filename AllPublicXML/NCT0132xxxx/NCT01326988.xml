  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The traditional landmarks to locate the injection site and orientation of the spinal needle
      for spinal anesthesia are based on palpation of surface bony landmarks. However the actual
      injection target into the CSF is located at an unknown depth inside the patients 3
      dimensional spinal anatomy which can itself vary in its orientation relative to these surface
      markers.Also bony surface markers may not be palpable in some patients or the patient may
      have altered spinal alignment. Thus an already blind procedure can become even more misguided
      involving multiple trial and error needle insertions. On the other hand ultrasound allows
      visualisation of deep target structures which are impalpable, it allows assessment of spinal
      alignment and thus directs the orientation of the seeking needle more accurately. Performing
      US in real-time during needle insertion gives continuous feedback about the correct needle
      approach path which should reduce the number of blind needle passes.

    <description>Patients of at least 18 years of age undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective lower limb surgery will be recruited. Therefore inclusion and exclusion criteria are the same as for traditionally administered spinal anesthesia as below. Additionally we will exclude those patients who are incapable of providing fully informed consent, patients who are currently enrolled in other studies and patients with communication difficulties</description>

    <description>The neuraxial US scan will be performed with the patient in the sitting or lateral position with the hip and knees slightly flexed using full aseptic technique. The spinal needle will be inserted in real-time under direct ultrasound guidance to administer the spinal anesthetic.</description>
