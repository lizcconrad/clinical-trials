        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests)

          -  The BMI - Body Mass Index of the volunteers should be within the range of 18,5 to 24,9
             (Dietary Guidelines for Americans) and it may vary up to 15% due to the upper limit
             (18,5 to 28,63) and total body weight &gt;50kg

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable
             representative. If the subject and/or legally acceptable representative cannot read,
             then the informed consent document may be signed by an impartial witness

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy)

          -  A history of suicidal thoughts, behavior or suicide attempts

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or any components of the product

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

          -  A positive bHCG exam for women

          -  Subjects with myasthenia gravis or acute narrow angle glaucoma
