      This study is designed to evaluate if a test formulation of cetirizine 10 mg orodispersible
      tablet (ODT) taken with and without water is bioequivalent to a marketed reference
      formulation of cetirizine 10 mg tablet (Benadryl One A Day, McNeil Products Ltd, UK) taken
      with water. This study will also evaluate the tolerability of test and reference
      formulations.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), which is the maximum (peak) concentration (amount of drug) measurable in blood plasma after a dose is administered, measured in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bioavailability [AUC(0-t)]</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Bioavailability [AUC(0-t)] is a measure of how much of the drug reaches the person's bloodstream within a given period of time for the body to use. The extent of product bioavailability is estimated by the area under the blood concentration vs time curve. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated by plotting the drug's blood levels on a graph at different times during the set period. The area under this curve reflects the amount of drug exposure in the set time period, calculated as hour * nanograms (ng) per milliliter (mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bioavailability Extrapolated to Infinity [AUC (0-∞)]</measure>
    <time_frame>32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Bioavailability Extrapolated to Infinity [AUC (0-∞)] is a calculated measure of how much of the drug will ever reach the person's bloodstream for the body to use. AUC (0-∞) stands for the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (forever). It is obtained from calculating AUC (0-t) plus AUC (t-∞).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of Maximum Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The time at which maximum concentration is reached (Tmax)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Terminal Elimination Rate Constant</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Terminal Elimination Rate Constant (Lamda z) is the time required to eliminate half the administered dose</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Terminal Phase Plasma Half-Life</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Terminal phase plasma half-life (t ½) is the time required to divide the plasma concentration by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium, rather than the time required to eliminate half the administered dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the Curve to the Tmax of the Reference Products</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to the time of the maximum concentration of the reference products (AUCReftmax)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative percentage of AUCT with respect to AUC∞ (AUCT/∞)</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUCT is the area under the plasma concentration verses time curve from start of drug administration until the time of the last measurable plasma concentration.
AUC∞ is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from start of drug administration until extrapolated infinite time.
AUCT/ AUC∞ is an inversed measure of how large the extrapolated area under the curve is.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Residence Time</measure>
    <time_frame>During 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
