    <textblock>
      Women with metastatic breast cancer, receiving first line treatment of any kind
      (chemotherapy, endocrine treatment or treatment with antibodies) will be included in this
      trial. In connection to treatment, blood samples for determination and enumeration of
      circulating tumour cells will be collected at different time points. Serum and plasma will be
      collected and stored for future analysis of RNA and DNA.
