  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is a specific approach to treating cancer that has shown promise in adult
      patients for the treatment of melanoma, malignant brain tumors, and other cancers. The study
      investigators will use the experience they have gained from these studies to try to improve
      the outcome for children affected by a recurrent brain tumor.

      This study will have two phases.

      During Phase I, approximately 9 patients will be treated with increasing doses of
      tumor-specific immune cells to determine the safety of this treatment. Phase I patients will
      also receive dendritic cell vaccines to help boost the function of these immune cells and
      maintain their growth.

      During Phase II, approximately 35 patients will be treated with tumor-specific immune cells
      and dendritic cell vaccines to see what impact they have on the tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant brain tumors now represent the most frequent cause of cancer death in children.
      Despite aggressive and highly toxic multi-modality therapy including surgery, craniospinal
      radiation, and high-dose chemotherapy coupled with peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation, almost half the children diagnosed with the most common malignant brain
      tumors, medulloblastoma (MB) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), will still die from
      recurrent disease. Furthermore, survivors are often left with severe and lifelong
      treatment-associated cognitive and motor deficits. The development of more effective and
      tumor-specific therapies that will not add further toxicity to existing treatments is
      paramount in improving clinical outcomes for children affected by MB/PNETs. Immunotherapy
      targeting tumor-specific antigens expressed within brain tumors is a modality potentially
      capable of meeting this clear and urgent need.

      Despite considerable advancements and promising clinical results observed in immunotherapy
      trials directed against adult malignant brain tumors, efforts in the immunologic treatment of
      pediatric brain tumors have been limited to relatively few notable studies. This is due, at
      least in part, to the often limited viable tumor tissue available for tumor cell-based
      vaccine preparations, and the lack of identification of consistently expressed tumor-specific
      antigens within these cancers.

      The use of total tumor RNA (TTRNA)-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) was pioneered at Duke
      University, as a novel platform for inducing potent immunologic responses against the variety
      of uncharacterized and patient-specific antigens present within malignant tumor cells. Duke
      demonstrated that sufficient RNA for clinical vaccine preparations can be amplified with high
      fidelity using existing molecular technologies from as few as 500 isolated pediatric and
      adult brain tumor cells, thus allowing vaccine preparation from surgical biopsies and even
      microdissected archival tumor specimens. In this study, the investigators will treat
      recurrent MB/PNETs during hematopoietic recovery from chemotherapy.

      Immunotherapy administered during recovery from chemotherapy may have tremendous advantages,
      as adoptive cellular therapy following lymphodepletive conditioning regimens has emerged as
      the most effective treatment strategy for advanced and refractory melanoma. Our hypothesis is
      that DC + ex vivo expanded Autologous Lymphocyte Transfer (xALT) therapy targeting recurrent
      MB/PNETs during recovery from myeloablative chemotherapy will be safe and will prolong
      survival in children and young adults with recurrent MB/PNETs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Screening:

          -  Age ≤ 30 years of age.

          -  Suspected first recurrence/progression of MB/PNET since completion of definitive focal
             +/- craniospinal irradiation. Disease progression prior to receiving definitive focal
             +/- craniospinal irradiation will not disqualify patients from enrollment if they have
             subsequently failed definitive radiotherapy and are at first recurrence/progression at
             time of enrollment. Patients who are unable to receive radiation therapy due to
             genetic disorders that put them at significant risk for radiation-induced secondary
             malignancies (i.e. Gorlin's syndrome or NF1 mutation) are eligible for enrollment at
             first disease recurrence/progression.

        Re-MATCH Protocol:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed recurrent MB/PNET that is a first
             relapse/progression after completion of definitive radiotherapy +/- craniospinal
             irradiation. Patients with a first relapse/progression who are unable to receive
             radiation therapy due to genetic disorders that put them at significant risk for
             radiation-induced secondary malignancies (ie. Gorlin's syndrome or NF1 mutation) are
             eligible for enrollment.

             of 1 week prior to registration.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥ 50% or Lansky Performance Score of ≥ 50.

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/µl (unsupported).

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL (may be supported).

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ upper limit of institutional normal

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal for age.

          -  Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 times institutional upper limit of
             normal for age.

             medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while being
             treated on this study.

          -  Patient or patient guardian consent to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) and/or bone
             marrow harvest following registration if PBSC or bone marrow (CD34 count of at least
             2x10^6/kg) has not been previously stored and available for use.

          -  Signed informed consent according to institutional guidelines must be obtained prior
             to registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:
