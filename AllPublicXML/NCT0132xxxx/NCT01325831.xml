  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to explore the effect of repetitive TMS, which has shown to be effective in
      intractable depression, we will examine resting-state, default-mode network functional
      connectivity in patients with major depression. We will use a double-blind, sham-controlled
      design. Our target sample size is 60(30 patients will be treated by active rTMS, the other 30
      will be treated by sham rTMS). We will apply 10-day course of 10 Hz rTMS on left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex of the subjects.

      Up to now, 24 patients with major depression and 6 normal controls are enrolled. Twenty-three
      patients and 4 normal participants have taken 10 days rTMS. One patients and one control
      withdrew their consent without any reason and one control withdrew the consent because of
      headache.

      We scanned fMRIs(to examine functional connectivity)twice for each participant, which were
      taken 3 days before the first and 3 days after the last rTMS.

      All of participants have not reported side effects except mild headahe. There's been no
      seizure event up to now.
