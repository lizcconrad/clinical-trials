  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine the role health literacy plays in the care continuum for Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and the effect of a self-management intervention on
      inhaler technique use, time spent on self-management, and knowledge for COPD patients with
      low literacy.

      Participants: The investigators will recruit patients from the University of North Carolina
      at Chapel Hill Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) who have a diagnosis of COPD.

      Procedures (methods): Potential subjects with COPD will be identified through pharmacy claims
      data, clinic billing data and the electronic medical record. Eligibility will be prescreened
      by a research assistant (RA) using the electronic medical record prior to approaching
      potential subjects for consent. For the first part of the study, consenting subjects will
      complete a baseline health literacy assessment, a questionnaire, an inhaler technique
      assessment, and a diary of time spent in self-management activities. Pulmonary function tests
      (PFT) will be performed on all participants for whom PFTs have not been conducted within the
      previous 12 months. The questionnaire will include measures of COPD-related knowledge,
      self-management techniques, quality of care, access, quality of life, costs, healthcare
      utilization, exacerbations, and basic demographic information. The inhaler technique
      assessment will be administered by the research assistant using a pre-established protocol.
      The research assistant will abstract additional data from the medical record to assess the
      quality of care based on adherence to recommended COPD care guidelines. For the second part
      of the study, participants will be randomized to control and intervention arms. The
      self-management intervention will be an interactive experience, delivered by a trained
      research assistant, targeting self-management skills (inhaler use, using an action plan,
      etc), smoking cessation, and exercise/pulmonary rehabilitation. Those randomized to the
      control group will receive usual care. All participants will return 2-4 weeks after the
      intervention for a follow-up assessment of inhaler technique, COPD-related knowledge, and
      time spent in self-management.

    <description>The inhaler technique assessment will be conducted by using a pre-established protocol developed to cover the major types of inhalers used by the COPD population. General principles included in the assessment include correct preparation, administration, and if appropriate re-administration of a dose. The assessment will be scored as number of steps completed correctly out of total number of steps assessed.</description>
