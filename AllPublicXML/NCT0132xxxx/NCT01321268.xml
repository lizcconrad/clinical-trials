    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel group study with healthy female volunteers, aged 18-45 years of age, with skin
      phototypes I to VI and a clinical diagnosis of cellulite on buttocks (at least score 6 at
      Cellulite Severity Scale (CSS)).

      The study will take 24 weeks (6 months) per subject. There will be one previsit during the
      screening phase and 8 visits per subject during the treatment phase.

      Safety and efficacy variables will be performed monthly.
