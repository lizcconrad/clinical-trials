  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation of the trochanteric bursa is a common cause of hip pain. A bursa is a closed
      fluid filled sac or sac-like cavity found between tissues that function as a gliding surface
      to reduce friction. Bursitis is the inflammation of the bursa. Inflammation between the
      trochanteric process of the femur and gluteus medius tendon/ iliotibial tract is the cause of
      trochanteric bursitis. Several treatments exist for trochanteric bursitis, including a local
      steroid injection. The injection consists of a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid
      medications. The steroid is routinely mixed with a local anesthetic. The anesthetic acts to
      diluent the steroid as well as act as a pain reliever. Various steroid preparations have been
      used, at varying doses, for trochanteric bursitis. The steroid preparation, triamcinolone is
      commonly used for various reasons. Besides the procedure associated and injection site risks,
      risks associated with the use of steroids, though rare, exist. Short term, the steroid can
      raise blood sugar levels and should be used with caution and be appropriately monitored in
      diabetics. Additionally, the steroid can suppress the immune system. Long-term risks are
      related to the dose and frequency of use. These risks include thinning of the skin, easy
      bruising, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, cataract formation, thinning of bones and
      joints. Studies have shown the effectiveness of local steroid injections for trochanteric
      bursitis. Unfortunately, there is limited data on the ideal dose of the steroid preparation.
      Triamcinolone of 40mg/ mL is commonly used, but, studies have shown effectiveness at various
      doses, ranging 20 to 160 mg/mL. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the
      effectiveness of local steroid injections of various steroid dosages for the treatment of
      trochanteric bursitis.
