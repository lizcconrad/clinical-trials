  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate cleavage products of the urokinase
      plasminogenactivator receptor (uPAR) in plasma from patients with castration resistant
      prostate cancer as a predictive marker of response to abiraterone.

             immunotherapy; diethylstilbestrol; PC-SPES; spironolactone (ie, ALDACTONE, SPIRONOL);
             and other preparations such as saw palmetto thought to have endocrine effects on
             prostate cancer, within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Prior systemic treatment with an azole drug (eg, fluconazole, itraconazole,
             ketoconazole) within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Current enrolment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such
             a study within 30 days of Day 1

          -  Condition or situation which, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subjects at
             significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with
