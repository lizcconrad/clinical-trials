  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aldosterone and its target the mineralocorticoid receptor are implied in development of
      cardiovascular disease such as arterial high blood pressure or cardiac failure. Serum
      aldosterone level is insufficient to know if the mineralocorticoid receptor is activated or
      not. The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers of mineralocorticoid receptor activity.
      The first &quot;candidate biomarker&quot; is Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) or
      &quot;lipocalin&quot; which being measured in blood or in the urine. According to scientific
      knowledge's evolution, others biomarkers could be tested later thanks to the blood or urinary
      samples taken during study.

      This study is broken up into 5 groups:

      The first is a pre-analytical study to determinate optimum conditions for lipocalin samples.

      The second focuses on intra-individual variations of lipocalin levels in blood and urine.

      The third determinate the normal values of lipocalin in blood and urine. Fourthly, we study
      the role of renal function on serum and urines lipocalin levels.

      Fifthly, we study the role of anti-aldosterone treatment on patients who suffer of primary
      hyperaldosteronism.
