      The primary objective of this study is to assess the suitability of the autoinjector for
      self-administration of belimumab by subjects with SLE in real-life conditions. The study will
      assess the use of the autoinjector inside the clinic setting and outside the clinic setting.
      The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of belimumab administered
      subcutaneously (SC) via the autoinjector. Subjects will self-administer belimumab SC into the
      thigh or abdomen using the autoinjector device for 8 weekly doses. Subjects will return for a
      follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last SC dose of belimumab. All injections will be assessed
      by the investigators for success based on direct observation and/or the subject diary. A
      total of 118 subjects (treated with at least one dose of study drug) are planned to be
      enrolled in this study.

    <description>The primary objective was to assess the suitability of the auto injector for self-administration of belimumab. An overall assessment of usability and reliability for the device was determined by assessing the rate of successfully complete self-administered injections relative to attempted ones. The assessment for the parameter, drug successfully injected was elicited by a Yes/No response. The participants who were able to administer injections inside and outside of the clinic without assistance were included.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged at least 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology
             (ACR) criteria.

          -  Active, autoantibody positive SLE, defined as the presence of anti nuclear antibody
             (ANA) or anti-double strand deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies (at screening or
             historically).

          -  Are on a SLE treatment regimen including intravenous (IV) belimumab every 28 days for
             at least three 28-day cycles. Day 0 (i.e., day of first dose of study agent) should be
             scheduled about 2 weeks after the last dose IV dose of belimumab but may be scheduled
             1 week and up to 4 weeks after the last IV dose.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy
             (for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records); or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
             &gt;40 milli international unit/milliliter [MIU/mL] and estradiol &lt;40 picogram/mL [&lt;147
             picomoles/Liter] is confirmatory). (Females on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.); Child-bearing potential

             test at screening and urine hCG test prior to dosing; Agrees to use one of the
             contraception methods for 2 weeks prior to the day of dosing to sufficiently minimize

        <title>Number of Participants Who Reported They Were Successfully Able to Self-administer Their Doses Outside the Clinic Setting in Weeks 3, 5, 6, and 7 (Outside Clinic)</title>
        <description>Assessment was performed for suitability of the auto injector for self-administration of belimumab by participant with SLE outside the clinic setting. An overall assessment of usability and reliability for the device was determined by assessing the rate of successfully complete self-administered injections relative to attempted ones. The assessment for the parameter, drug successfully injected was elicited by a Yes/No response. The participants who were able to administer injections outside of the clinic without assistance were included.</description>
