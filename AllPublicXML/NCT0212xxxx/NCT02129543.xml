  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are collecting blood samples to learn more about how the body's immune
      system recovers after stem cell transplant (SCT). Participants are either previous recipients
      of a stem cell transplant, or a donor of stem cells for transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to systematically collect specimens of blood and plasma from donors
      and recipients of SCT. For recipients, samples may be collected at the following time points
      or transplant milestones. If the recipient is not able to be present at SCCC/UMHC during the
      window of one of these milestone visits, the specified collection may be missed due to
      unavailability. The recipient may then resume sample collection at the subsequent collection
      period. Collections may be received within 30 days prior to transplantation, at approximately
      30 days (+/- 7 business days), 60 days (+/- 14 business days), 100 days (+/- 21 business
      days), six months (+/- 21 business days), one year(+/- 21 business days), and annually(+/- 21
      business days) thereafter following SCT. Up to three additional samples, collected no more
      frequently than weekly, may be collected if recipients experience complications (e.g., viral
      reactivation) associated with abnormal T cell immune recovery after SCT. A sample may also be
      removed that is equal to or less than 1% of the total product volume of the donor collection,
      prior to recipient infusion. For donors, one sample will be collected prior to stem cell
      mobilization with G-CSF.

      Assays to be performed may include the following: 1) Functional studies of antigen-specific T
      cell responses to pathogens (e.g., cytomegalovirus) and to other antigens (e.g., to defined
      epitopes that have been identified as potential malignancy-specific targets)(8,15); 2) T cell
      immunophenotyping (to define the recovery of T cell subsets associated with a &quot;naive&quot; or
      &quot;memory&quot; T cell phenotype)(16,17); 3) Studies examining the molecular diversity of the T cell
      repertoire(18,19); 4) Studies to identify recent thymic emigrants in the peripheral blood to
      determine the extent of thymic function occurring at steady state or following BMT(11,20);
      and 5) Assays of plasma levels of cytokines (e.g., interleukin-7) that may be important in T
      cell reconstitution(21,22). Some or all of these studies may be performed at the time of
      collection. In most cases, cryopreserved PBMC or plasma samples will be used for these
      assays. Cryopreserved cells in excess of requirements for studies of immune reconstitution
      will be banked to allow access by other investigators to these specimens.

      By increasing our understanding of immune recovery post-stem cell transplantation, the
      investigators will be able to develop strategies to improve immune recovery and reduce
      graft-versus-host disease to be tested in future clinical trials. It is the investigators'
      goal to develop graft engineering strategies to improve both of those important clinical
      problems in SCT patients.

      The purpose of this protocol is to study immune reconstitution and graft-versus- host disease
      in stem cell transplant recipients, and to study the role of donor cells and the clinical
      regimen on those processes.

        The study population will include subjects selected from all patients presenting to the
        clinical services of the Adult Cell Transplant Program as donors or recipients for SCT. As
        a result, this group will consist of a diverse assortment including subjects ranging in age
        from late adolescence to approximately age 75; individuals of both sexes; and a wide
        variety of ethnic backgrounds. All donors will have been cleared for clinical marrow or
        peripheral blood stem cell donation, and will be expected to be generally healthy.
