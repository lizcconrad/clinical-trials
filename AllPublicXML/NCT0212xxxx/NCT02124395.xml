      Assessment of Health-related Quality of Life in Rare Kidney Stone Formers in the Rare Kidney
      Stone Consortium
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about Health-related Quality Of Life (HRQoL) in
      patients enrolled in the Rare Kidney Stone Consortium (RKSC) registries. Quality of life
      studies look at different aspects of both physical and mental components of people's lives.
      HRQoL data for people affected by kidney stones are not currently available for people
      followed over time.
