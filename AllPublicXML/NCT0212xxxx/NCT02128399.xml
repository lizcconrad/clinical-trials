  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial exposure is known to reduce the selection for various drug-resistant organisms.
      Numerous studies have demonstrated the association between antimicrobial use and MDR bacteria
      detection. However, to the investigators knowledge, there is few data to support the concept
      that reducing antibiotic use actually leads to improvements in antibiotic susceptibilities.
      Moreover, antimicrobial stewardship was demonstrated to reduce MDRO and was strongly
      recommended in clinics. As the investigators know, antimicrobial overuse, which occurs
      commonly in China, induces a severe antibacterial resistance. China's Ministry of Health
      (MOH) has established a policy about the antimicrobial stewardship. To date, the
      investigators do not have published documentation the effects of this policy on
      multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) in critically ill patients.
