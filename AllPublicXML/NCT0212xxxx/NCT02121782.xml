      The purpose of this study is to determine whether GC3110A (a QIV) is effective compared to GC
      Flu Pre-filled Syringe Inj. (a marketed TIV) after single intramuscular administration in
      Korean healthy adults.

      The comparator, GC Flu pre-filled syringe inj. is a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV)
      including viruses representing 3 influenza strains (one A/HIN1, one A/H3N2, and one B).
      However, two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B (Victoria and Yamagata)
      co-circulate annually in the United States. Predicting which lineage of influenza B will
      predominate during a season is challenging, and cross-protection by immunization against the
      other lineage is expected to be low. One proposed alternative is to produce a quadrivalent
      influenza vaccine (QIV) including an influenza B virus from each of the two circulating
      lineages. GC3110A is a new quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), which contains all of 4
      vaccine components WHO recommends for use in the 2013-14 influenza season (northern
      hemisphere winter) and includes two influenza B viruses. GC3110A is expected to show the
      additional public health benefit compared with traditional TIV.

      This study is the first in human trial of GC3110A and is designed as an adaptive Phase I/IIa
      to ensure participants protection. Part A is an open-label and single arm study in 9 healthy
      volunteers. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the solicited/unsolicited
      adverse events conditionally if any toxicity of Grade 3 or 4 has been reported during 7 days
      after vaccination. Part B is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, active controlled study and a
      total of 75 volunteers will participate in this part. Adverse events assessment will be done
      according to the 'Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled
      in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials'.
