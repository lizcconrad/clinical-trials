  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the investigators research program is to determine whether a combined
      exercise program (aerobic and resistance) improves abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes
      control in CF patients. This program of exercises to increase strength and muscle endurance,
      exercise tolerance, will be assessed in a group of 12 CF patients with impaired glucose
      tolerance. The effect of exercise will be compared with a control group of 12 patients also
      glucose intolerant but do not participate in structured physical activity program. The
      duration of the exercise program will be 12 weeks and several measures (glucose tolerance,
      inflammatory profile, lung function, exercise capacity, muscle strength and endurance) will
      be conducted pre and post program to assess the program's impact .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 subjects with CF with impaired glucose tolerance or with diabetes related to CF
      (CFRD) unmedicated will be recruited. Participants will be recruited through a research nurse
      in CF , which will analyze the available data to medical records and seek the participation
      of subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Patients receive during their
      visit to the outpatient clinic of FK at Hotel -Dieu du CHUM hospital , a inform consent form
      (ICF) for the study. Their intention to participate and the main inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be confirmed in a telephone interview conducted by a member of the team at the
      IRCM. Finally, during the visit at the IRCM , the subject will get answer to his question for
      ICF and ICF will be signed before any procedure.

      All participants who agree to participate in the research project must undergo a short
      telephone interview (20 minutes) and 4 assessment visits ( approximately 1-5 hours) Pre (2
      visits ) and post (2 visits ) study . The control patients with delayed exercises conduct a
      further assessment visit at the end of the training.

      GROUP 1 EXERCISES : Patients in exercises group will be required to take part of two
      supervised training sessions and 8 follow up phone call . The exercise program will be
      performed three times per week for about one hour .

      GROUP 2 CONTROL: Participants in the control group will be contacted by phone once a month
      following entry into the study. On this occasion a reminder to complete the physical activity
      log will be realized. Following the visit #6 , patients in the control group will be invited
      to participate in a second study phase to participate in supervised exercise program . This
      participation will involve an additional 12 weeks of follow-up, which included the same visit
      as Group 1 with exercises. In this case, to simplify participation and reduce the volume of
      blood collected , the final visit (#5) of the project will also be the first visit of
      exercises phase. This part of study, involves 2 supervised training sessions and 8 follow up
      phone call . The exercises program will be performed three times per week for about one hour
      .
