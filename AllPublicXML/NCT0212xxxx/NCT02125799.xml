  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has shown safety and
      efficacy for treatment-resistant depression, but requires daily treatment for 4-6 weeks.
      Accelerated HF-TMS (aHF-rTMS), in which all treatments are delivered in less time, would have
      significant advantages in terms of access, patient acceptance and costs. In the present open
      label trial the investigators intend to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a novel
      aHF-rTMS protocol (i.e., 2 daily sessions over 2 consecutive weeks; 6,000 pulses per day).
      For this, depressed outpatients will receive the aHF-rTMS protocol and will be assessed at
      baseline and at weeks 3 and 9 with several clinician- and patient- reported measures as well
      as with computerized neurocognitive tests.
