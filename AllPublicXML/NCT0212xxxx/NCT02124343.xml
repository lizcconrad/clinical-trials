  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation in the treatment of Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Although researchers have shown numerous benefits with exercise in
      COPD patients, most studies have only looked at exercise tolerance and psychological outcomes
      following training. COPD is characterised by persistent inflammation that can cause
      progressive decline in lung function and multisystemic complications. This inflammation can
      be amplified in patients when they suffer acute exacerbations. There is a wellknown
      relationship between exercise, immune function and risk of infection. Exercise has also been
      shown to have an antiinflammatory effect when performed regularly. There is a lack of
      research looking into the inflammatory or immune response to exercise in patients with COPD.
      The exercise within this study will be individually tailored to patients with COPD based on
      their validated 6 minute walk test (6MWT) but the protocol will involve interval exercise
      that has been used previously. This type of exercise is considered most appropriate for
      research into mechanisms of benefit because it maintains the exercise training effects of
      other modalities (e.g. continuous low intensity aerobic exercise) while avoiding the
      occurrence of limitations to exercise in people with lung problems (e.g. dynamic
      hyperinflation). It also closely mirrors daily activity of someone with COPD.

      The investigators want to explore the effects of exercise specifically on immune function in
      15 people COPD and compare any changes to 15 Controls. By better understanding the mechanisms
      of how exercise affects inflammation, the investigators could eventually design better
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation interventions, especially for those most at risk.

    <description>Subjects will undertake an interval exercise session (on a harnessed treadmill) (HP Cosmos Mercury 4.0, HP Cosmos Sports and Medical Gmbh, Nussdorf-Traustein,Germany) based on the average speed calculated from the 6 minute walk test (6MWT).
Intervals are based on the work previously done by Mador et al., 2009 who used intervals of 150% (for 1 minute) followed by intervals of 75% (for 2 minutes) based on 80% average speed from the 6 minute walk test.
This study repeated these intervals 7 times with a duration of 23 minutes in total for the exercise intervention with the 75% intervals at the start and at the end of the exercise session. No warm up was undertaken for this method as it was a walking exercise test and the risk of injury was minimised with use of the harnessed treadmill.</description>
