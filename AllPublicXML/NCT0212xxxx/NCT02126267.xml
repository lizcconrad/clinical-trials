    <textblock>
      Seventy -seven systemically healthy subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly
      included in 6 different predefined groups. The following periodontal parameters were
      evaluated: probing depth , clinical attachment level , plaque index, gingival index and
      percentage of areas affected by periodontal disease. Microbiologically were evaluated the
      bacterial load and specific load of five bacterias: The quantification of the bacteria was
      performed by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction . The clinical and microbial baseline
      evaluations were performed ( periodontal pre- therapy) , 90 and 180 days after treatment.
