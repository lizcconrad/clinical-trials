      The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of patients with &quot;true&quot; resistance
      among patients referred to the Medical Outpatient Department of the Charité -
      Universitätsmedizin Berlin with the diagnosis &quot;resistant hypertension&quot;. Moreover, data on
      medication adherence will be collected based on therapeutic drug monitoring and on the
      answers to validated questionnaires. Finally, efficacy, safety and costs of renal sympathetic
      denervation will be compared to an intensified drug treatment in an exploratory way.
