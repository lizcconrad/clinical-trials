      The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of a generic Azelaic
      Acid Gel, 15% to the reference listed Finacea® (azelaic acid) Gel, 15% in the treatment of
      moderate facial rosacea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FINACEA® (azelaic acid) GEL, 15% contains azelaic acid, a naturally occurring saturated
      dicarboxylic acid that has proven anti-inflammatory effects, as well as anti-keratinizing and
      antimicrobial action, although its mechanism of action in rosacea is not well understood.
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP)
      and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Marketed by Intendis, Finacea® (azelaic acid)
      Gel, 15% is a safe and effective topical therapy used for the treatment of moderate facial
      rosacea. Watson Laboratories, Inc. has developed a generic formulation of azelaic acid 15%
      gel and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this
      formulation.
