  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective case series aiming to evaluate a new VPIA remifentanil algorithm
      which would benefit labouring mothers who are unable or unwilling to receive epidural
      analgesia.

      This study proposes a novel Vital signs-controlled, patient-assisted intravenous analgesia
      (VPIA) regimen that will enhance the efficacy, safety and personalization of remifentanil
      therapy for labouring women. This system will study the parturient's pattern of analgesic use
      in 15 min epochs and titrate the demand doses and basal infusion rate to maintain a plasma
      level of remifentanil that is appropriate for the degree of pain felt.

      The system incorporates vital signs (pulse oximetry and heart rate values) into the algorithm
      which would temporarily stop the pumps and step down doses accordingly when predefined
      critical values are reached.
