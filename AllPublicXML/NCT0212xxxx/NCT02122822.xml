      RATIONALE: heat shock protein gp96-peptide complex made from a person's tumor cells may help
      the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This trial is studying the safety and effectiveness of autologous gp96 treatment of
      glioblastoma and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed
      supratentoria glioma.
