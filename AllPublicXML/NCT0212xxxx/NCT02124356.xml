  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency abdominal surgery is associated with high mortality rates, multiple postoperative
      complications and prolonged duration of hospital admission. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the postoperative functional performance in patients undergoing Emergency High-risk
      Abdominal Surgery. The hypothesis is that the study can describe the patient population in
      relation to postoperative functioning, degree of inactivity and the factors that limit
      mobility.
