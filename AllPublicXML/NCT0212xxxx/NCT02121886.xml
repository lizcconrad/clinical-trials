      To evaluate the safety and outcome of the parietal peritoneum for venous reconstruction HPB
      surgery. Although the parietal peritoneum had already been used and published for the
      reconstruction of the vena cava, however this one was never described or described in HPB
      surgery

    <textblock>
      Improvements in surgical techniques, perioperative management and effective chemotherapy
      regimens, have increased the resectability of malignant hepatobiliary and pancreatic tumors
      when associated with vascular invasion. Therefore, simultaneous vascular resection is
      increasingly required to obtain an adequate resection margin and improve patient definite
      survival. Although most vascular resection associated with pancreatectomy can be
      reconstructed by simple venorraphy or end-to-end anastomosis, a segmental or lateral vacular
      graft (VG) can be necessary in 8-12 % of cases. Vascular reconstruction can be planned
      preoperatively if the vascular invasion is evident and an appropriate VG can be prepared.
      Differents sources of VG are available including autogenous veins , synthetic such as
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) , cryopreserved and veins from the resected liver. However the
      decision to perform vascular resection may be made during dissection due to vascular invasion
      or injury and even occasionnally taken while the mesentericoportal vein (MPV) or vena cava
      (VC) are occluded. In this emergency situation, an urgent and easily available graft is
      necessary to prevent prolonged ischemia. The difficulty of anticipating the need for these
      vascular resections during HPB surgery, has lead certain authors including those in our group
      to use either the veins from the resected liver, the umbilical vein or the parietal
      peritoneum (PP) for vena cava reconstruction. The aim of our study is to evaluate the safety
      and outcome of the parietal peritoneum as a substitute patch for venous reconstruction during
      HPB surgery in emergency and elective situations.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be the safety and venous patency. Safety means &quot;to see if the parietal peritoneum is rigid and there is no tearing of bleeding in the reconstructed area, related to venous pressure&quot;, this safety will be assessed clinically (exteriorized bleeding from the reconstructed zone and on CT scan to search for local hematoma). Patency will be assessed by regular CT scan performed on postoperative day 8,30,90 and 120. On CT scan, this evaluation will include the degree on venous stenosis (0%, &lt;25%, 25%-75%, &gt;75%, thrombosis) compared to non reconstructed vein, the presence of thrombosis with collateral venous circulation or venous enlargement in the reconstructed area</description>

    <description>The venous latency will be assessed at 6 months of the surgical resection and the assessment with be done by CT scan in order to study the degree of venous stenosis, the presence or not of thrombosis or collateral venous circulation and venous enlargement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients admitted to HPB unit and schudeled for major liver or pancreatic
             resections with suspected venous invasion. Venous invasion is suspected on CT scan
             (vein narrowing or disappearance of the fat plane between the vein and the tumor)
             performed within 1 month of surgical resection. Informed consent will be obtained and
             the parietal peritoneum will be used as a substitute graft for
             resection-reconstruction in these patients if intra-operative exploration confirmed
             this venous invasion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who refuse to participate and patients with suspected peritoneal
             carcinomatosis or if intra-operative exploration confirmed the presence of peritoneal
             carcinomatosis
