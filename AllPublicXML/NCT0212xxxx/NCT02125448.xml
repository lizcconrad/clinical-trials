      Rationale: For resectable esophageal cancer the standard therapy is 5 weeks of neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery 6-8 weeks afterwards. Surgery is performed
      independent of the response to nCRT and is associated with substantial morbidity. A
      pathological complete response (pCR) after nCRT is seen in 28-34% of patients. Pathological
      non-responders (pNR) most probably do not benefit from nCRT but are exposed to its toxicity
      and delay from surgical therapy inevitably occurs in this group. Early identification of
      non-responders during nCRT would allow individualized decision making in continuation or
      discontinuation of nCRT. Furthermore, a tool is desirable to accurately assess the treatment
      response after nCRT to identify patients with a complete response. Studies in rectal cancer
      reported that tumor resection could be omitted in patients with persisting clinical complete
      response after 12 months. Also, in some esophageal cancer studies, complete responders in
      surgical and non-surgical treatment groups had comparable overall survival. These findings
      indicate the possibility to perform nCRT as sole treatment in patients with a complete
      response. Conversely, if residual tumor is demonstrated, this will support the decision to
      move to surgery.

      Objective: Diagnostic study to assess the distinct and combined value of anatomical and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
      emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) in the evaluation of treatment response
      to nCRT for patients with esophageal cancer.

      Study design: Multi-center diagnostic study investigating the value of MRI and PET-CT in the
      imaging before, during and after nCRT for assessment of response to nCRT for resectable
      esophageal cancer. Imaging response measurements will be compared with the histopathological
      tumor regression grade (TRG) of the resection specimen as gold standard.

      Study population: 50 patients (&gt;18 years) presenting at the UMC Utrecht or M.D. Anderson
      Cancer Center with resectable esophageal cancer, as determined by endoscopy and biopsy,
      computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), receiving nCRT prior to
      surgery.

      Procedure: In addition to the conventional diagnostic work-up for esophageal cancer including
      a standard PET-CT before nCRT, two PET-CT scans will be performed during and after nCRT as
      well as three MRI scans before, during and after nCRT at the same time points. The first MRI
      (and standard-of-care PET-CT) scan session will be within the 6 weeks prior to the start of
      nCRT. The second scan session will take place after 10-14 days after the start of nCRT. The
      third and final scan session will be planned 1-2 weeks before surgery.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Determination of the distinct and combined diagnostic value
      of anatomical and functional MRI and PET-CT in the evaluation of treatment response to nCRT
      for patients with esophageal cancer. Important imaging parameters include apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) values, standardized uptake values (SUV) and volume measurements for the
      different time points. The differences of these values between time points are of particular
      interest (delta-ADC, delta-SUV, delta-volume). The sensitivity (%), specificity (%), negative
      predictive value (%), positive predictive value (%), and accuracy (%) of the different
      imaging parameters for correctly identifying histopathological complete response will be
      calculated.

      Multi-center diagnostic study investigating the distinct and combined value of MRI and PET-CT
      for response prediction before and response assessment during and after nCRT for esophageal
      cancer.

      The patients will be enrolled in two hospitals (UMC Utrecht and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center)
      during their first outpatient visit at the Department of Surgery or Radiation Oncology. At
      the UMC Utrecht, for study purposes three anatomical and functional MRI scans are made and
      two PET-CT scans, in addition to a pre-nCRT PET-CT scan which is standard care. At M.D.
      Anderson Cancer Center, for study purposes three anatomical and functional MRI scans are made
      and one PET-CT scans, in addition to a pre-nCRT and a post-nCRT PET-CT scan which are
      standard care. The MRI scan protocol will consist of anatomical and functional MRI scans. For
      the dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans, a contrast agent will be administered to
      the patient. All MRI scans will be performed on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner. For the PET-CT
      scans, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the tracer that will be used for the assessment of
      abnormal glucose metabolism in the tumor.

      Before the start of nCRT, we schedule an MRIpre to have baseline MRI and PET-CT images in all
      enrolled patients. This scanning day is matched to the irradiation treatment planning PET-CT
      scan, which is routinely made for treatment planning purposes. Next, the patients receive
      standard nCRT treatment with weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve
      an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square
      meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks at UMC Utrecht and 6 weeks at M.D. Anderson Cancer
      Center with concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions in Utrecht or 50.4 Gy in 28
      fractions at M.D. Anderson, delivered 5 days per week on workdays). As mentioned in the
      introduction, earlier studies reveal that both PET and DWI-MRI after 2 weeks of treatment
      showed the best distinction between responders and non-responders. Therefore, we decided to
      perform a PET-CTper and an MRIper scan two weeks after the start of the nCRT. Surgery will
      follow 6-8 weeks after finishing nCRT and all patients will undergo a preoperative MRIpost
      and PET-CTpost scan 1-2 weeks before surgery, combined with a standard preoperative
      outpatient follow-up appointment. Overall, no extra hospital visits are asked from
      participants as we try to schedule all study activities at days corresponding with
      appointments for standard care. If in individual cases an extra visit to the hospital is
      needed, travel expenses of this extra visit will be reimbursed.

      Important imaging parameters include apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values,
      standardized uptake values (SUV) and volume measurements for the different time points. The
      differences of these values between time points are of particular interest (delta-ADC,
      delta-SUV, delta-volume). The sensitivity (%), specificity (%), negative predictive value
      (%), positive predictive value (%), and accuracy (%) of the different imaging parameters for
      correctly identifying histopathological complete response will be calculated. The resection
      specimen will be evaluated meticulously according to standard protocol (tumor type and
      extension, lymph nodes, resection margins), and additionally, findings of effects of nCRT
      will be reported.

      The research population consists of patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma, scheduled
      to receive preoperative chemoradiation according to the CROSS-regimen. The participants will
      be recruited from the surgical outpatient clinic or radiation oncology department of the UMC
      Utrecht or M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. In total 50 participants with available
      histopathologic data of the resection specimen are required for this study.
