  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, non-randomized, absorption, metabolism, and excretion study
      to evaluate the mass balance, metabolite profiles, and rates and routes of elimination of
      [14C]-AZD3293 and derived metabolites following administration as a single 100-mg (containing
      approximately 150 µCi) oral dose (as an oral solution)

      This study will be an open-label, non-randomized,absorption, metabolism, and excretion study
      to evaluate the mass balance, metabolite profiles, and rates and routes of elimination of
      [14C]-AZD3293 and derived metabolites following administration as a single 100-mg (containing
      approximately 150 µCi) oral dose (as an oral solution) following at least an 8-hour fast from
      food (not including water). Seven healthy male subjects will be enrolled in the study at a
      single study site to complete a minimum of 6 subjects. The study will consist of 2 visits.

        Inclusion Criteria: Healthy male subjects between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive, at the
        time of consent with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture; 2) Body
        weight between 50 to 100 kg, inclusive; 3) Within BMI range 19 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive; 4)
        In good health, as determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,
        physical examination with neurological examination, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs as judged
        by the Investigator;

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participation in any prior study of AZD3293 or previous enrollment in the present study; 2)
        Significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic, dermatological,
        hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, GI, neurological, or psychiatric
        disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject
        at risk because of participation in the study, interfere with absorption, distribution,
        metabolism or excretion of drugs, or influence the results or the subject's ability to
        participate in the study; 3) History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or
        allergy to any drug compound, food, or other substance, unless approved by the
        Investigator;
