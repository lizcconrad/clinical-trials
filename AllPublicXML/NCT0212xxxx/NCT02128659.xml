  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if a cervical health literacy program is a practical
      and helpful way of improving women's cervical health knowledge and improving cancer screening
      behaviors, and ultimately preventing cervical cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women in the criminal just system are 4-5 times more likely to have cervical cancer than
      non-incarcerated women. Little is known about how to close this gap. The few investigators
      that have studied cervical cancer risk and disease among women in jails and prisons have
      found that while many women get screened for cervical cancer, less than half get follow-up
      care.

      The investigator's pilot research suggests the most important contributor to cervical cancer
      risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about both
      cervical cancer and broader reproductive health issues. This study is testing a sexual health
      empowerment intervention (SHE Project) to see if it improves incarcerated women's
      reproductive health literacy.
