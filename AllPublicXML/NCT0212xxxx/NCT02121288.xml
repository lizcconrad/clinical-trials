      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of blood flow to the heart when subjects are
      treated with ticagrelor (Brilinta) or clopidogrel (antiplatelet drugs that stop the blood
      from clumping together) in patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on adenosine-induced myocardial blood flow (MBF)
      will be evaluated by cardiac 13N- ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) at rest
      (baseline), acute dosing on Day 1, and at short term dosing on Day 7.

      Subjects receiving ticagrelor will have additional pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples
      collected at specific time points to measure ticagrelor concentration in the blood. Subjects'
      participation will be approximatetly 6 weeks.

    <measure>Assessment of ticagrelor when compared to clopidogrel on adenosine-induced myocardial blood flow (MBF) by cardiac 13N ammonia Positron EmissionTomography (PET) at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Day 1): 1 day treament visit</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the acute treatment effects on the 13N-ammonia PET measure and evaulate if they can be correlated with plasma exposure of ticagrelor and or its active metabolite. Subjects will recieve 180mg ticagrelor loading dose or no loading dose for clopidogrel arm, since those subjects are already on chronic dosing. Subjects will undergo additional adenosine-PET at 2 hours following ticagrelor or 4 hours following clopidogrel administration to ascertain MBF.</description>

    <description>Assess the short-term treatment effects on the 13N-ammonia PET measure and evaulate if they can be correlated with plasma exposure of ticagrelor and or its active metabolite. The same sequence described at Visit 2 will be repeated during Visit 3.</description>
