  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a preliminary study in healthy subjects, the investigators determined the pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic of enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (Adiro 100 mg, Bayer), and
      the variability (coefficient of variation), accuracy and precision of a novel biomarker of
      ASA action, i.e., quantification of the extent of COX-1 acetylation at serine-529, using a
      stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS) technique.

      Now, the investigators will perform a clinical study in individuals undergoing Colorectal
      cancer (CRC) to validate the hypothesis that that low-dose ASA given once daily is acting
      primarily by selectively acetylating platelet COX-1 and suppressing its activity throughout
      the 24-hour dosing interval. In contrast, it is expected that the inhibitory effect on
      extra-platelet sources of COX-1 will be short-lasting, if any, affecting only partially
      COX-1, and this effect will be completely reversed at 24 hours after dosing. This is an
      important point which will strengthen the platelet hypothesis underpinning the apparent
      adequacy of a 24-hour dosing interval of ASA administration for the anticancer effect
      detected in cardiovascular trials.

      These patients will be stratified into individuals with adenomas/carcinomas (20 to 30%) and
      patients without clinically detected adenomas/carcinomas (about 70 to 80%).
