    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of azacitidine and sonidegib or
      decitabine and so see how well they work in treating patients with myeloid malignancies. The
      hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation
      and repair. Inappropriate activation of Hh pathway signaling and uncontrolled cellular
      proliferation may be associated with mutations in the Hh-ligand cell surface receptor Smo.
      Sonidegib binds to the Hh cell surface receptor Smo, which may result in the suppression of
      the Hh signaling pathway and the inhibition of cancer cells. Azacitidine and decitabine may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving azacitidine together with sonidegib or decitabine may be a safe and successful
      treatment for patients with myeloid malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of LDE225 (sonidegib) (days 1-28) in
      combination with azacitidine (overall); LDE225 (days 1-7) in combination with azacitidine
      (overall); and LDE225 (days 1-28) in combination with decitabine (overall). (Phase I) II. To
      estimate the efficacy of LDE225 (days 1-28) in combination with azacitidine in the following
      subgroups: untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
      (CMML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap;
      relapsed/refractory AML/CMML/MDS/MPN overlap; and myelofibrosis (MF) only. (Phase Ib)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the duration of response, time to progression, overall survival, and time to
      AML or death (for MDS subjects) of LDE225 (days 1-28) in combination with azacitidine
      (overall and by cohort). (Phase I/1b)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct correlative studies to measure HH pathway activation and inhibition and explore
      biomarkers of response.

      II. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) and European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core (C)30 in
      subjects treated with LDE225 in combination with azacitidine or decitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of erismodegib.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-7, sonidegib
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 or 1-7* or decitabine IV on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      *NOTE: Sonidegib PO QD is given on days 1-7 if in combination with azacitidine or on days
      1-28 is given if in combination with decitabine.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until
      progressive disease and then every 6 months for 2 years.

             metabolized by cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6 (CYP2B6) or
             cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) that have narrow
             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             LDE225; medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A4/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with LDE225; NOTE: patients who are already on or require initiation of
             azoles other than fluconazole will be excluded from the phase I dose escalation
             portion of the study

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one
             of the following:

               -  Angina pectoris within 3 months

               -  Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months

               -  Corrected Fridericia's QT (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females
                  on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG)

               -  A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family
                  history of prolonged QT-interval syndrome

               -  New York Heart Association classification IV cardiovascular disease or
                  symptomatic class III disease

               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure,
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor
                  compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)

          -  Any of the following:

               -  Pregnant women

               -  Nursing women

               -  Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate
                  contraception during the study and through 20 months after the final dose of
                  study treatment if female, and for 6 months after final dose of study treatment
                  if male

               -  NOTE: adequate contraception is defined as either:

                    -  Total abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                       lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception

                    -  Sterilization: patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study
                       patients, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                       patient)

                    -  Use a combination of the following:

                         -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal
                            intrauterine system (IUS)

                         -  Barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository

                              -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected,
                                 implanted) are not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the
                                 study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception

                              -  Note: women are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing
                                 potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)
                                 amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
                                 appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of
                                 spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone
                                 (FSH) levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had
                                 surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at
                                 least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when
                                 the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow
                                 up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
                                 potential

                              -  Note: male patient must use highly effective (double barrier)
                                 methods of contraception (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for
                                 the entire duration of the study, and continuing using
                                 contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
                                 following the study drug; a condom is required to be used also by
                                 vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner
                                 in order to prevent delivery of the study treatment via seminal
