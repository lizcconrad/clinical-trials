      Two regimen are currently considered to have highest efficacy for patients with high-risk
      early stage breast cancer: sequential treatment of high dose epirubicin, taxane, and
      cyclophosphamide concomitantly with a dual HER2-blockade, and weekly treatment with
      paclitaxel/non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin with dual HER2-blockade or carboplatin. The
      aim of the GeparOcto study is to compare those two regimen/strategies.

      Both regimens are myelosuppressive with a significant incidence of chemotherapy induced
      anaemia.

      The second aim of the GeparOcto study is therefore to compare the use of parental ferric
      carboxymaltose versus physician's choice for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in
      patients with iron deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several recent strategies have improved efficacy of systemic treatment for patients with
      high-risk early stage breast cancer: the addition of a dual HER2-blockade for HER2-positive;
      the implementation of carboplatin for TNBC and the use of dose-dense or dose-dense, dose
      escalated chemotherapy in all high-risk subtypes of breast cancer. Two regimen are currently
      considered to have highest efficacy: sequential treatment of high dose epirubicin, taxane,
      and cyclophosphamide (ETC) concomitantly with a dual HER2-blockade mainly based on the AGO
      ETC adjuvant study, and weekly treatment with paclitaxel/non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      with dual HER2-blockade or carboplatin (PM(Cb)) based on the GeparSixto study. The aim of the
      GeparOcto study is to compare those two regimen/strategies.

      Both regimens are myelosuppressive with a significant incidence of chemotherapy induced
      anaemia. Anemia is often associated with impaired physical and cognitive function and
      consequently the patients suffer from a reduced quality of life. Surgical complications are
      higher in anemic patients. The second aim of the GeparOcto study is therefore to compare the
      use of parental ferric carboxymaltose versus physician's choice for the treatment of
      chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with iron deficiency.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible for study participation only if they comply with the following
        criteria:

          -  Written informed consent according to local regulatory requirements prior to beginning
             specific protocol procedures.

          -  Complete baseline documentation must be submitted via MedCODES to GBG Forschungs GmbH.

          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration from the breast lesion alone is not sufficient.
             Incisional biopsy or axillary clearance is not allowed.

        In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will
        be evaluated for the primary endpoint.

          -  Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of 2 cm or a sonographical size of 1
             cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions, preferably
             by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation can be used
             as measurable lesion.

          -  Patients must have stage cT1c - cT4a-d disease. Patients with HER2- positive or TNBC
             are eligible irrespective of nodal status (cN0-cN3). Patients with luminal B-like
             tumors (defined here as ER and/or PgR &gt;1% stained cells, HER2 negative, Ki-67 &gt;20%)
             only with histologically (sentinel-node biopsy, core- or fine-needle biopsy) involved
             lymph nodes (pN1-3).

          -  In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should
             be measured.

          -  Centrally confirmed ER, PR and HER2 status. Central pathology includes also assessment
             of Ki-67 and LPBC status on core biopsy. ER/PR negative is defined as &lt;=1% stained
             cells and HER2-positive is defined as IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH) and
             according to ASCO-CAP guidelines as of 2013). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
             breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the GBG central pathology
             laboratory prior to randomization.

          -  Age &gt;=18 years.

          -  Karnofsky Performance status index 90%.

          -  Confirmed normal cardiac function by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or shortening
             fraction) within 4 weeks prior to randomization. LVEF must be above 55%.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all
             women of childbearing potential.

          -  Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must
             have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (21 days), breast MRI (optional). Chest
             X-ray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan in case
             of high risk for primary metastasis. In case of a positive bone scan, bone X-ray or CT
             scan is mandatory. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated.

          -  Patients must agree with central pathology testing of core biopsy specimen and final
             pathology specimen and be available and compliant for treatment and follow-up.

          -  In addition for patients to be randomized to the two supportive anemia treatment arms:

          -  Hemoglobin level &lt;10g/dl.

          -  Body weight ≥ 40 kg.

          -  No need for immediate red blood cell transfusion.

          -  Transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤20% and serum ferritin &lt;300ng/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and Ki- 67 &lt;= 20%
             (any luminal A-like subtype) or luminal B-like (Ki67&gt;20%) subtype without nodal
             involvement.

          -  Patients with stages cT1a, cT1b, or any M1.

          -  Patients with pure lobular invasive breast cancer.

          -  Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy.

          -  Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer.

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients. Patients of childbearing potential must implement
             adequate non-hormonal contraceptive measures (barrier methods, intrauterine
             contraceptive devices, sterilization) during study treatment.

          -  Inadequate general condition (not fit for dose-dense, dose-intensified
             anthracycline-taxane-targeted agents-based chemotherapy).

          -  Previous malignant disease being disease-free for less than 5 years (except CIS of the
             cervix and non-melanomatous skin cancer).

          -  Known or suspected congestive heart failure (&gt;NYHA I) and / or coronary heart disease,
             angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of myocardial
             infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, uncontrolled or poorly

             antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment,
             clinically significant valvular heart disease.

          -  History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic
             disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of
             informed consent.

          -  Pre-existing motor or sensory neuropathy of a severity grade 2 by NCI-CTC criteria v
             4.0.

          -  Currently active infection.

          -  Incomplete wound healing.

          -  Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids.

          -  Known hypersensitivity reaction to one of the compounds or incorporated substances
             used in this protocol.

          -  chronic corticosteroids unless initiated &gt; 6 months prior to study entry and at low
             dose (10 mg or less methylprednisolone or equivalent).

          -  sex hormones. Prior treatment must be stopped before study entry.

          -  other experimental drugs or any other anti-cancer therapy.
