  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the safety and immunogenicity of the current formulation of aTIV will be
      compared to aTIV-modified formulations in which the dosage of the MF59 adjuvant will be
      doubled or tripled and/or the dosage of the 3 influenza virus strains will be doubled, in
      independently-living elderly subjects ≥ 65 years of age.
