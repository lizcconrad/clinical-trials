    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients with B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back after treatment or has not responded to other
      treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as measured by objective response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the global safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      B-ALL.

      II. To assess response duration. III. To assess Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) target
      inhibition, biomarkers, and gene expression profiles in B-ALL patient samples before and
      during treatment with ibrutinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete or partial response. Response definitions of Complete Response (CR): disappearance of leukemia as indicated by &lt;5% marrow blasts &amp; absence of peripheral blood leukemic blasts, with recovery of hematopoiesis defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1000/μL &amp; platelets &gt;100,000/μL. C1 extramedullary disease status required. CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi): CR except with ANC &lt;1000/μL and/or platelets &lt;100,000/μL. Partial response (PR): improved or no worsening of ALL as indicated by no peripheral blood blasts, neutrophils &gt;1000/μL, platelets &gt;100,000μL, and either or both of the following: &gt;50% decrease in marrow blast percentage, compared to pretreatment value, &amp; marrow blast percentage ≥ 5% and ≤ 25%. C2 extramedullary disease status. Treatment failures are defined as participants who fail to achieve CR, CRi or PR.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to thirty days after after completion of study treatment anticipated to be 12 weeks for total of 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time measurement from beginning treatment to recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Overall survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The two-sided log-rank test will be used to assess the differences of time to events between groups such as age groups, or Philadelphia chromosome-positive versus Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. Progressive disease is defined as a doubling of the peripheral blasts and an absolute increase of &gt; 5 x 10^9/L.</description>

Overall survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
