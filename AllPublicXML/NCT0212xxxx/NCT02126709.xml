      Importance This will be a proof of concept study - whereby we hypothesize that Repigel may
      represent a paradigm shift in global acne treatment.

      Historically, there has been a dearth of clinical evidence in this use of povidone-iodine for
      inflammatory acne. This is likely due to staining related to iodine use, which is not
      acceptable to consumers.

      The trial drug, Povidone Iodine, however, becomes colourless and odourless in a matter of
      seconds after application on the skin.

      This represents an ideal product for which we may perform testing to look at its efficacy in
      the management of acne.

      A mainstay in the pathogenesis of acne involves the overgrowth and proliferation of skin
      micro-organisms, primarily proprionibacterium Acnes. Long term antibiotic therapy is usually
      prescribed for a period of 3 to 6 months or more.

      Previous studies have revealed this form of antibiotic therapy is ineffective, patients are
      usually poorly compliant, and also results in the formation of antibiotic resistant
      micro-organisms,which in turn reduces treatment efficacy.

      Potential Benefits

      As such, Povidone Iodine with its antiseptic property represents a promising avenue for the
      elimination of Proprionibacterium Acnes without the associated problems of long term
      antibiotic use, and the development of antibiotic-resistance. It is cosmetically acceptable,
      affordable, and easy to use.

      Aim This is a proof of concept study - to determine the efficacy and safety of Povidone
      Iodine in the treatment of acne.

      Methodology This will be a single centre, double blind, randomized controlled trial. There
      will be 2 arms of 15 patients with a 2 month study period.

      Follow up at Week 0, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8

      3. Capture baseline demographics

      a. Age b. Sex c. Race d. Lesion counts - total, inflammatory, non-inflammatory e. FDA score

      4. Efficacy evaluation

      a. 5 point IGA score b. Total lesional count c. No. of inflammatory lesions d. No. of
      non-inflammatory lesions e. Photography (+-) f. Scoring of the Cardiff Acne Disability Index.

      5. Safety Evaluation

      a. Score of itchiness b. Score of scaling c. Score of erythema d. Score of pain

      6. Primary end points -

      a. percentage reduction in lesion counts from week 0 to week 8 i. total lesion counts ii.
      total inflammatory counts iii. total non-inflammatory counts b. Proportion of subjects who
      had a IGA score of 0 or 1 by week 8 c. Time to 50% reduction of total lesion counts

      7. Secondary end point

      a. Improvement of the Cardiff Acne Disability Index

      Povidone Iodine will be applied on the face by the patient using his own finger tips - onto
      his acne affected areas on the face.
