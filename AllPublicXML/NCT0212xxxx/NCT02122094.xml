  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to implement a sexual health promotion intervention for male sex workers in
      Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The study hypothesis is that this intervention will
      increase testing, treatment and vaccination for sexually transmitted infections, including
      intentions of participants to engage in these services beyond the conclusion of the
      intervention. At the community level, the study hypothesis is that male sex workers will be
      more aware of sexual health care and more likely to access these services in the future.

      The intervention is administered in community and clinic settings. The full intervention
      consists of seven core modules: Sexual Health, Sexual Diversity, HIV/STI Transmission,
      Behavioral Risk and Risk Reduction, Alcohol and Drugs, Stigma, and HIV/STI and Health Seeking
      Practices. In the community, outreach is conducted by Health Educators to deliver the
      intervention modules that young men express and interest in, as well as to provide risk
      reduction materials including condoms and lubricant. Study interviewers conduct a
      cross-sectional interview of young male sex workers in community venues (the interviewers and
      health educators are never present in a venue at the same time), and a random sample of
      interviewees are invited to a local clinic, where they receive a more detailed interview, the
      full intervention (delivered one on one by a Health Educator and including all seven
      modules), a clinical exam, testing for HIV and other STIs (HBV, HCV, gonorrhea, syphilis,
      chlamydia), onsite treatment, vaccination and referral, and a post-intevention assessment.
