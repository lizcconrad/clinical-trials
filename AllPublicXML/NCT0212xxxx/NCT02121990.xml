    <description>All treatments will be given in the outpatient setting. A cycle is 21 days. The sequence of infusions on Day 1 will be IV paclitaxel (135 mg/m2), then IV bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, beginning Cycle 2). On Day 2 patients will receive IP cisplatin (75 mg/m2). Patients will be given twice-daily treatment with oral olaparib in cycles 1-6 for 7 consecutive days, starting on Day 2 (Days 2-8). IP paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) will be given on Day 8. Sequential cohorts of 3 patients will receive escalating doses of olaparib (50mg BID, 100mg BID, 200mg BID).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary peritoneal
             carcinoma, or fallopian tube carcinoma, following initial surgery. All subjects must
             have had appropriate surgery for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube
             carcinoma with appropriate tissue available for histologic evaluation to confirm
             diagnosis and stage. Pathology must be verified at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
             Center. Patients with initial cytoreduction surgery performed at outside hospitals
             will be eligible for this protocol.

          -  Patients with the following histologic cell types are eligible:

               -  High grade serous adenocarcinoma

               -  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma

               -  Undifferentiated carcinoma

               -  Clear cell adenocarcinoma

               -  Mixed epithelial adenocarcinoma

               -  Adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.)

               -  Carcinosarcoma

          -  Subjects must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥ 70%.

          -  Subjects must be entered no more than 12 weeks postoperatively.

          -  Subjects must agree to undergo genetic counseling and BRCA testing. Patients in the
             expansion cohort must have a germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutation.

          -  Physical and Laboratory Test Findings

          -  PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is ≤1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually
             between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a PTT ≤
             1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Bone marrow function:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL

          -  Renal function:

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl

          -  Hepatic function:

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN

          -  Neurologic function:

          -  Neuropathy (sensory) ≤ CTC Grade 1

          -  Urine Protein Creatinine:

          -  Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio must be &lt; 1.0 gm.

          -  If UPC ratio ≥1, collection of 24-hour urine measurement of urine protein is
             recommended *

          -  UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC
             ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm. UPC ratio is
             calculated using one of the following formulas:

               1. [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported
                  in mg/dL

               2. [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in
                  mmol/L *The UPCR has been found to correlate directly with the amount of protein
                  excreted in a 24 hour urine collection. Specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent
                  to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine collection. Obtain at least 4 ml of a
                  random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a 24 hour urine).
                  Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine levels [separate
                  requests]. The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and creatinine
                  concentration (mg/dL). The UPCR is derived as follows: protein concentration
                  (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL). Patients must have a UPCR &lt; 1.0 to allow
                  participation in the study.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception during the study and
             for at least 6 months after receiving the final treatment of bevacizumab.

          -  Patients must have an Intraperitoneal (IP) port in place. If a patient does not have
             an IP port, she must be willing to undergo surgical placement of one.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant
             potential (borderline carcinomas) are not eligible.

          -  Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer or a past history of endometrial

          -  Subjects who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity
             or pelvis are excluded. Prior intravaginal brachytherapy is permitted. Prior radiation
             for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that
             it was completed more than 3 years prior to enrollment, and the subject remains free
             of recurrent or metastatic disease.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor are
             excluded. Patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to their initial
             debulking are excluded. Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for
             localized breast cancer.

          -  With the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies as
             noted above, subjects with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence
             of the other cancer present within the last 3 years or whose previous cancer treatment
             contraindicates this protocol therapy are excluded.
