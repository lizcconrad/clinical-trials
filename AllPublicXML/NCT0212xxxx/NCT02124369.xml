    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat, and even in a situation where an operation can be
      performed to remove the cancer, the disease can unfortunately come back soon afterwards. When
      pancreatic cancer is more advanced, the outcomes are even less positive. Recently, a large
      international study showed that combining a chemotherapy drug that is standard for treating
      pancreatic cancer, called gemcitabine with a new chemotherapy drug called Abraxane was more
      effective than gemcitabine alone for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether this combination of gemcitabine and
      Abraxane can shrink a pancreatic cancer that is not thought to be operable enough to enable
      it to be removed by surgery. It is hoped that in this way, the treatment may improve the
      outcome. In addition, in this study we would like to analyse the appearances of the tumour
      using imaging, and collect blood and tumour samples to try to confirm laboratory research
      that has been carried out with this treatment.

      This is a single-centre, non-randomised, phase 2a, single arm, Simon two-stage design trial
      of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (ABX/GEM) in patients with histological documentation of
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are determined by central radiological review to
      have &quot;category 2&quot; borderline unresectable LAPC. We will investigate the feasibility of
      administering ABX/GEM in terms of safety and efficacy, and will study activity both in terms
      of radiological response and the feasibility of downstaging patients to &quot;category 1&quot; status,
      in order to attempt resection after up to 6 cycles of combination treatment. In addition to
      adding to data on the safety and tolerability of this combination, peri- and post-operative
      morbidity following this treatment will be evaluated. As part of the trial, detailed
      correlative studies will be undertaken to evaluate the mechanism of action of the
      combination, at a tissue level, a circulating biomarker level and a radiological level.

      We propose that the tumour shrinkage (response) seen in Stage IV pancreatic cancer patients
      as a result of ABX/GEM may translate to a realistic prospect of downstaging borderline
      unresectable LAPC tumours sufficiently to enable resection. Notionally, even in the absence
      of a classical partial response by RECIST criteria (≥30% reduction in sum of longest
      diameters) a beneficial outcome may arise from any tumour shrinkage sufficient to permit the
      tumour to be separated from major vessels thus rendering it resectable. Such an outcome may
      significantly alter the poor survival outcomes in this group of patients. The PRICKLE
      clinical study paradigm is useful for evaluating novel agents and combinations that show
      impressive activity in the pre-clinical or advanced setting and offers an opportunity for
      detailed correlative translational studies to evaluate activities of therapy.

             long as there is no evidence of active bleeding).

          -  Platelets ≥100x 109/L

          -  Adequate renal function defined by serum creatinine≤1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine
             clearance by Cockcroft-Gault of ≥50 ml/min.

          -  Adequate hepatic function defined by:

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN

          -  Patients may have endoscopic or radiologic stenting to treat biliary obstruction. If
             so, bilirubin must return to ≤1.5 x ULN prior to enrolment.

          -  Received no prior therapy for their disease.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Tumour assessments and measurements must be
             done within 28 days before the patient receives the first dose of ABX/GEM.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic PDAC, or disease which is amenable to resection with curative
             intent. These include tumours which are defined as Category 1 or 3 by central
             radiological review.

          -  Other invasive malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years, with the exceptions of
             adequately treated localized cured prostate cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix
             uteri and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have
             undergone potentially curative therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of
             that disease for three years or more and are deemed at negligible risk for recurrence,
             are eligible for the trial.

          -  Routine use of oral anti-oxidant supplements: beta-carotene, selenium, lutein,
             zeaxanthin, lycopene, pycnogenol, fernblock, omega-3S, vitamin C, vitamin E,
             astaxanthin. If recent use, a washout period of 5 half-lives is required.

          -  Patients with pre-existent ischemic heart disease particularly those under active
             treatment for coronary disease, will be excluded from Sonuvue dynamic contrast
             enhanced ultrasound investigation due to sporadic reports of cardiac ischemia in this
             population. They will be eligible for the rest of the study, as long as their cardiac
             status does not preclude surgery.

          -  Significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, disease or laboratory
             abnormality which in the judgment of the Investigator would place the patient at undue
             risk or interfere with the study. Examples include, but are not limited to:

          -  Patients who have had a venous thromboembolic event (e.g., pulmonary embolism or deep
             vein thrombosis) requiring anticoagulation who are not appropriately anti-coagulated
             or have had a NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 2 or greater bleeding episode in the 4
             weeks before Day 1.

          -  Patients taking warfarin, unless it is possible for the patient to be switched to a
             low molecular weight heparin for the duration of the study
