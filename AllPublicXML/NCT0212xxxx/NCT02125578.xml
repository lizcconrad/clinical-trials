  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to identify the highest safe and well-tolerated dose and frequency
      of BIIB017 (PEGylated Interferon Beta-1a) subcutaneous (SC), within the range of 63 to 188
      mcg, when given every other week or every 4 weeks to healthy volunteers (HV).
