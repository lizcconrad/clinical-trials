  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for infants with mild to moderate dry and itchy skin. This study will involve
      going to the doctor for 6 visits over 2 weeks. All participants' skin will be examined by a
      dermatologist to determine if they have atopic dermatitis and have an active mild to moderate
      eczema wound. Participant's parents/guardians will be asked a few questions to determine if
      their child qualifies for the study.

      Then all participants' caregivers will complete a questionnaire at the beginning of the
      study. The child's skin will be examined to rate the level of their eczema and a trained
      examiner will grade the looks and symptoms of their eczema. All parents or guardians will be
      instructed how to apply the test product and how to record usage on a diary card and then
      apply the test product. The test product will be applied at least 2 times per day or more as
      needed on all body areas, including the face affected throughout the study.

      One digital picture will be taken of one eczema wound. Another digital picture will be taken
      of the area around this wound. These pictures will be taken on Day 0 (Baseline), Day 3, and
      Day 14.

      Once product is applied the skin will be examined for any adverse events and all
      participants' caregivers will complete a questionnaire on study day 1, 3, 7 and 14.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, two-arm clinical trial in participants aged 2 - 35 months with mild
      to moderate Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as determined by the study physician. A sufficient number
      of participants will be enrolled in this study to yield 40 participants who complete the
      trial, 30 in the investigational product group and 10 in the active control group.

      The investigational and control (EpiCeramÂ®) products will be used topically. Participant
      caregivers will be instructed to gently massage the assigned product into the participant's
      skin. The treatments will be applied at least 2 times per day on all body areas, including
      areas of the body and face affected by AD. No product should be applied within 4 hours of a
      site visit. These treatments will be used in place of the participant's current moisturizers
      and/or emollients.

      Diaries will be completed by the participants' caregivers each day, beginning upon initiation
      of therapy and continuing until trial completion/discontinuation, and will include
      information on product application and use of rescue medication.

      All participants will visit the clinical site for assessments at baseline (Day 0) and on Days
      1, 2, 3, 7 and 14. Clinical assessments include the Eczema Area and Severity index (EASI) and
      Investigator's Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA). Instrumental assessment of
      hydration will be done using a Corneometer (Courage &amp; Khazaka, Germany). Caregivers will also
      complete a questionnaire to assess product experience. The final visit will occur on Day 14
      or on the day of participant withdrawal from the trial.

        <description>The signs and symptoms of eczema are measured using the Investigatorâs Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA). An assessment of atopic dermatitis based on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0 (none) and 3 (severe), is used to describe signs and symptoms in 4 designated body regions. Based on the presence or absence of the total number of signs and symptoms, the final rating is categorized as clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe.</description>

        <description>The signs and symptoms of eczema are measured using the Investigatorâs Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA). An assessment of atopic dermatitis based on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0 (none) and 3 (severe), is used to describe signs and symptoms in 4 designated body regions. Based on the presence or absence of the total number of signs and symptoms, the final rating is categorized as clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe.</description>

        <title>Investigatorâs Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA) on Day 14 - Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>The signs and symptoms of eczema are measured using the Investigatorâs Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA). An assessment of atopic dermatitis based on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0 (none) and 3 (severe), is used to describe signs and symptoms in 4 designated body regions. Based on the presence or absence of the total number of signs and symptoms, the final rating is categorized as clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe.</description>

        <title>Corneometer Measurement on Day 0 â Post-Treatment - Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>Corneometer is a non-invasive instrument that measures hydration on the skin surface. During assessment, the corneometer was placed at a site adjacent to eczema-affected skin areas. Corneometer readings are directly related to the skin's electrical capacitance and increase as the skin becomes more hydrated. Pre-treatment readings ranged from 2.0 to 68.0. Post-treatment on Day 0, corneometer readings ranged from 10.3 to 86.3.</description>

        <title>Corneometer Measurement on Day 3 - Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>Corneometer is a non-invasive instrument that measures hydration on the skin surface. During assessment, the corneometer was placed at a site adjacent to eczema-affected skin areas. Corneometer readings are directly related to the skin's electrical capacitance and increase as the skin becomes more hydrated. Pre-treatment readings ranged from 2.0 to 68.0. On Day 3, corneometer readings ranged from 8.0 to 65.3.</description>
