  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for almost 30 years to treat many intractable
      back pain conditions. It has demonstrated efficacy in the co-called Failed Back Surgery
      Syndrome (FBSS) and a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant superiority
      of SCS over conventional medical therapy to treat patients with FBSS. Another trial has
      demonstrated superiority of SCS over repeat surgery in the same patient population. However,
      the ability to reliably capture the low back with paresthesia coverage has remained
      challenging and elusive despite numerous strategies designed to overcome this limitation.
      Strategies that have been introduced but so far with limited success include transverse
      multiple lead stimulation, high frequency stimulation, peripheral field stimulation, and
      dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation. To date, none of these strategies have been able to
      reliably overcome the long-term problems of paresthesia capture and pain relief of the low
      back.

      This proposal describes a new spinal stimulation technique designed to improve the likelihood
      of low back stimulation by targeting the nerve supply to the two most commonly affected pain
      producing structures in the back, the facet joints and the intervertebral disks. The
      technique has proven to be feasible in a cadaver model with ease of lead placement at the
      desired targets
