    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of single ascending intravenous (IV) doses of ASP2408 in non-elderly, healthy male and female
      subjects and to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ASP2408.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is single-dose escalation study composed of 8 sequential cohorts of healthy subjects
      receiving increasing doses of intravenously administered ASP2408 or matching placebo.
      Subjects will be confined in the clinic for 8 days.
