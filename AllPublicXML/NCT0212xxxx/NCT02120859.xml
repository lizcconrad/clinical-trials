  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to evaluate feasibility and the 6-month angiographic and OCT results of FFR - guided
      use of paclitaxel-eluting balloons (Sequent Please™, B Braun) with provisional bare metal
      stenting for elective PCI of de novo coronary lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restenosis rates after plain-old balloon angioplasty (POBA) are with 30-50 % very high.
      Therefore, this interventional concept is of limited use today. However, dual antiplatelet
      therapy (DAPT) is not necessary after POBA. Contrary, 3rd generation drug-eluting stents
      (DES) proved to be very effective showing delayed restenosis only in 5-15%, but require DAPT
      for at least 6 months. Drug-eluting balloons (DEB) might be a promising trade-off between
      POBA and DES, since they effectively inhibit neointimal proliferation despite minimal
      duration of DAPT. However, there is still very limited data on this interventional strategy.
      Thus, we aimed to investigate feasibility of fractional flow reserve (FFR) - guided use of
      paclitaxel-eluting balloons (Sequent Please™, B Braun) with provisional bare metal stenting
      for elective PCI of de novo coronary lesions, evaluating the 6-month outcomes by angiography
      and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

    <description>DEB-only angioplasty is attempted in all patients. At baseline, quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) using an intracoronary standard bolus of adenosine are performed. If FFR at baseline is greater than 0.8, PCI is deferred, otherwise predilation with a non-coated balloon is performed. In case of severe recoil (&gt; 50% residual stenosis) or flow-limiting dissection the procedure is deemed not suitable for DEB-only angioplasty and stent implantation is performed at the discretion of the operator. In all other cases, the lesion is treated using a Sequent Please® paclitaxel-eluting balloon (DEB). QCA and FFR measurements are repeated and the result is considered satisfactory if there is no flow-limiting dissection, residual stenosis &lt; 40% and FFR &gt; 0.8.</description>
