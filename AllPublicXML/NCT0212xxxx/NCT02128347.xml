  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home dialysis has many potential benefits compared to in-center hemodialysis including
      improved quality of life, reduced hospital admission and reduced cost. However, some patients
      perceive that home modalities are associated with increased isolation from the healthcare
      system, substandard care or higher risk of catastrophic events. Providing better support for
      home dialysis patients may enhance their ability to maintain at home, improve their health
      outcomes, increase quality of life and improve satisfaction with care. In other chronic
      disease populations a secure, online communication portal between physicians and patients has
      proven useful in enhancing care for patients. Thus far, the utility of an online portal
      communication system has not been tested in a cohort of home dialysis patients. The
      investigators hypothesize that this novel form of communication will improve care and
      outcomes for home dialysis patients. Therefore, in a cohort of home dialysis patients, the
      purposes of this study are as follows: 1) Does an online patient-portal improve patient
      satisfaction with home dialysis care? 2) Does an online patient-portal improve quality of
      life? 3) Does an online patient-portal reduce hospitalization and health service utilization?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home dialysis (including peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis) has a number of potential
      benefits over in-center hemodialysis (including lower healthcare costs and improved quality
      of life for patients). However, overall quality of life remains low compared to the general
      population. Furthermore, home dialysis patients (primarily those on peritoneal dialysis)
      continue to experience a high rate of hospitalization. Finally, there can be improvement in
      patient satisfaction with home dialysis, particularly in the areas of shared decision making
      and handling of patient requests.

      Regarding satisfaction with care, peritoneal dialysis patients have identified that
      &quot;attentiveness to concerns&quot;, and clarity of recommendations is important. Improved
      satisfaction in turn, may be associated with improvements in quality of life. Therefore,
      identifying novel communication systems for home dialysis patients is crucial. The use of
      eHealth online portals that support online communication between patients and healthcare
      workers is increasing. An interface that allows patients to discuss treatment plans and
      address clinical problems while obviating the need for telephone communication has been shown
      to be beneficial in some studies. Such a system may improve patient satisfaction, reduce
      health service utilization, and potentially improve health outcomes.

      Thus far, the feasibility and potential benefit of an eHealth online portal to facilitate
      communication has not been evaluated in home dialysis. Therefore, in a cohort of home
      dialysis patients, the purpose of this study is to identify the following: 1) Does an online
      portal improve patient satisfaction with home dialysis care? 2) Does an online portal improve
      quality of life? 3) Does an online portal reduce hospitalization and health service
      utilization? Overall, we hope that this study will inform the need to pursue a larger,
      multicenter trial to more rigorously evaluate the utility of this novel form of communication
      for home dialysis patients.

      We will conduct a prospective pilot study of prevalent (receiving home dialysis for at least
      three months) home dialysis patients (including both peritoneal dialysis and home
      hemodialysis) at Capital Health. Consecutive patients that are evaluated in the home dialysis
      clinic over a 4-month period will be enrolled in the study if they provide consent.

    <description>Healthcare service utilization will consist of number and duration of hospitalizations, number of emergency room visits (for both dialysis and non-dialysis related complaints), number of non-advised drop-in visits to the home dialysis unit and number/duration and type of telephone contacts with the home dialysis unit. All utilization measures will be retrospectively assessed over the preceding three to twelve months (depending on available data) to get a baseline rate.</description>

    <intervention_name>Electronic Patient Portal</intervention_name>
    <description>RelayHealth is a web-based application that allows patients and clinicians to communicate through a secure, password protected online electronic portal with data transfer capabilities. The system allows physicians and nurses to view patient questions, patient data and transmit messages to patients in response to questions or after clinic visits in an electronic message. In addition, patients can be made aware of upcoming investigations or clinic visits. Patients can also use the interface to identify any proposed changes (which would minimize recall mistakes after clinic visits) and submit queries pertaining to dialysis. Both patients and clinicians are made aware of new messages through email prompt, which moderates the asynchronous nature of electronic communication. Telephone communication can be maintained, but reserved for more urgent issues that require immediate assistance.</description>
