  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common treatments today for enhancing the shape and size of the buttocks are
      transplantation of the patient's own body fat after liposuction and insertion of permanent
      implants. Macrolane VRF30 is a gel product based on hyaluronic acid which is a transparent
      slow-flowing gel. A similar hyaluronic-acid gel from the same manufacturer, Q-Med AB, has
      been used for many years for the treatment of facial wrinkles. By injecting Macrolane gel
      into the skin, the shape of the buttocks can be altered and their volume increased.

      Aesthetic dermatologists have reported promising results on the use of Macrolane VRF30 for
      buttocks reshaping and contouring. Although treatment with Macrolane VRF is well documented
      in breast enhancement, there is limited documentation on the use in buttocks reshaping. Based
      on these clinical impressions, this study aims at acquiring information on the efficacy and
      safety of Macrolane VRF30 in this particular indication. As a result of the reshaping of the
      buttocks, it is expected that improvement of skin laxity will result in contouring and
      reduction of cellulite. By using standardised evaluation tools, the results of buttock
      reshaping reported anecdotally can be confirmed by accurate measurements.

          -  1. Female subjects older than 30 years. 2. Subjects presenting with loss of contour of

             3. Treatment-naïve subjects for fillers in the areas to be treated. 4. Subjects with
             signed informed consent. 5. Medical history and physical examination which, based on
             the investigator's opinion, do not prevent the subject from taking part in the study
             and use the product under investigation.

             6. Subjects should maintain their habits regarding physical activity. 7. Availability
             of the subject throughout the duration of the study.
