  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive alcohol use is associated with a range of serious and costly health, social, and
      economic consequences at the individual and societal level. This program of research serves
      as a venue by which to produce and test an innovative, science-based, and cost-effective
      means to intervene in a private, convenient, and individualized way with employed adults who
      report non-dependent levels of risky drinking. Responsible Drinking offers computer-tailored
      intervention sessions directed at increasing readiness to limit drinking to national
      guidelines for low-risk drinking and a complementary dynamic web portal providing additional
      information, activities, and strategies designed to activate and reinforce the change
      process. The primary objective is to complete and enhance the development of Responsible
      Drinking and test it in an effectiveness trial. In Phase II the program capabilities and
      innovation will expand to integrate the e-Health components (CTI and e-Workbook) with
      m-Health (mobile health) technologies. The e-Health components will be enhanced to offer a
      more interactive and engaging user experience. In addition, m-Health technologies (text
      messaging and mobile device browsing optimization) will be integrated to support engagement
      in the program and flexible delivery options. 996 employed adults will be recruited to
      participate in the randomized trial. The treatment group will receive three intervention
      sessions during the course of six months and group differences on a number of outcomes will
      be evaluated at 12 and 18 month follow-up assessments.

    <description>Responsible Drinking intervention sessions include an internet-based, computer-tailored intervention (CTI) grounded in the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM). The intervention includes stage-matched and tailored feedback on alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and theoretically identified behavior change strategies, as well as access to a web-based portal with stage-matched interactive activities to reinforce and promote stage progression. Finally, the intervention will include 7 months of stage-matched behavior change SMS messages.</description>
