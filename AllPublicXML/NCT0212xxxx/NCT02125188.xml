  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a challenge for both surgeons
      and anesthesiologists despite several measures available for improving the surgical field.
      This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of desmopressin on blood loss and the quality
      of the surgical field in FESS.

    <textblock>
      Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, has been employed as a non-transfusional
      treatment for hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease. Hemostatic effects of desmopressin
      include: 1) an increase in plasma factors through endogenous release of coagulation factor
      VIII, von Willebrand factor and tissue plasminogen activator; 2) an increase in platelet
      adhesiveness; and 3) a reduction in bleeding time. Randomized, double-blind studies have been
      performed on patients undergoing various types of surgical procedures. A study in patients
      undergoing orthognathic surgery showed a significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss
      and a study in patients undergoing lumbar fusion concluded that desmopressin was effective in
      reducing intraoperative blood loss. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect
      of administration of desmopressin on intraoperative blood loss in patients undergoing FESS.

    <description>The overall quality of the surgical field was assessed on a scoring scale adapted from Boezaart et al. The following are the scoring scale:
0-1: No bleeding; excellent to outstanding surgical conditions; 2-3: Slight bleeding; surgery fairly easy. No stops for hemostasis and/or suctioning are required; 4-5: Slight bleeding; surgery mildly difficult. One stop for hemostasis and/or suctioning is required; 6-7: Moderate bleeding; surgery moderately difficult. Occasional stops for hemostasis and/or suctioning are required; 8-9: Moderate to severe bleeding; surgery very difficult. Multiple stops for hemostasis and/or suctioning are required; 10: Surgery terminated due to severe bleeding in the surgical field.</description>
