  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating one way to improve health and healthy habits after traumatic
      brain injury (TBI). The primary goal of this study is to determine if a brief intervention
      accommodated for persons with moderate or severe TBI is effective in reducing alcohol misuse
      during the year following injury. It is hypothesized that an adapted Screening, Education and
      Brief Intervention (adapted SBI) will reduce the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week
      over the year following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, in comparison to a Screening
      and Education Attention Control condition (SEA control).
