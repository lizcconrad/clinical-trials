      Exacerbation in cystic fibrosis play an important role in terms of mortality and morbidity.
      Exacerbation frequencies is relatedto FEV1 decline and mortality. There is a relationship
      between exacerbation frequency and QoLdeterioration. Moreover exacerbation treatments present
      health costs burden leading to important physical psychological and social impact. Preventing
      exacerbation and early detection of these exacerbations may decrease intensity and freqauency
      of exacerbation leading to increase clinical status and QoLwith a decreased health cost.

      Patients actually follow in CRCM track exacerbations when visits out patient clinic and
      during phone call. If patients did not call or did not present regularly to out patient
      clinic, exacerbation detection came later and so increasde the burden and therapeutic
      pressure.

      The objective of our study is to identify earlier the potential exacerbations and so
      decreased the health costs and increased the patient's QoL. Forthis purpose we propose to use
      modern technologiessuch as smartphone in order to create alert when patients report weekly
      health satatus. We will compra patients randomize in control group with standart follow-up to
      patients randomize in the smartphone group.Moreover we will study the compliance and
      satisfactory degree of the use of this device in the interventional arm.
