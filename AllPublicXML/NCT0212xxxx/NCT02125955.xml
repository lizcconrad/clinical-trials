  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, over one third of Canadian children and youth aged five to seventeen are
      overweight or obese. Childhood obesity leads to increased risks of co-morbidities such as
      type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers.
      Changes in the food supply have been linked to obesity and include a decrease in the intake
      of dietary fiber. Prebiotic fibers are a group of non-digestible carbohydrates that modulate
      the composition and actions of the gut microbiota and have been shown to reduce body fat and
      energy intake in overweight and obese adults. The investigators hypothesis is that prebiotic
      fiber intake in overweight and obese children will similarly result in improvements in body
      composition and reduced energy intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in the pediatric population is a primary public health concern given that overweight
      and obesity in childhood continues into adulthood. Consumption of high-fat, calorie-dense
      diets do not provide individuals with the suggested daily intake of many important nutrients.
      This is especially true for dietary fiber which has positive health benefits such as roles in
      weight management. A form of dietary fiber with links to obesity treatment/prevention is
      prebiotic fiber. In the gut, there are many bacteria which have been shown to affect a
      person's health depending on the type and number of each type of bacteria. The role of
      prebiotic fiber is to increase the number of beneficial bacteria which in turn promotes
      health. Studies in humans have shown that prebiotic fiber is effective at reducing body fat
      and food intake in overweight and obese adults. The aim of this study is to see if prebiotic
      fiber can provide the same benefits to overweight and obese children. Since weight management
      becomes increasingly difficult as a person ages, treatments that promote weight maintenance
      at an early age are critically needed.
