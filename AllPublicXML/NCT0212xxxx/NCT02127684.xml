  <brief_summary>

      The investigators would like to investigate the efficacy of more frequent treatment with
      Lucentis for subjects with persistent diabetic macular edema despite standard dosing regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, subject masked, phase II study of intravitreally administered
      ranibizumab in subjects with persistent diabetic macular edema. Persistent diabetic macular
      edema is defined as subjects who still have central subfield thickness on SD-OCT of greater
      than 320 microns after having received at least 3 previous doses of AntiVEGF therapy in the
      past 5 months. Consented, enrolled subjects will be randomized into two subgroups: (1)
      standard dosing of monthly 0.3mg ranibizumab or (2) 0.3mg ranibizumab given 2 weeks apart for
      5 doses followed by monthly dosing.

             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes

          -  BCVA score using the ETDRS method of &gt;24 and &lt;78 in the study eye at the screening
             visit

          -  3 or more intravitreal injections of AntiVEGF over the 5 months prior to screening

          -  Presence of diabetic macular edema defined as SD-OCT CST &gt;320 microns on spectral
             domain machine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

               -  Anti-VEGF treatment in the study eye within 3 weeks prior to screening

               -  Intravitreal Ozurdex treatment in the study eye within 12 weeks prior to
                  screening

               -  Intravitreal steroid treatment in the study eye within 8 weeks prior to screening

               -  Any condition or reason (including inability to read ETDRS chart or language
                  barrier) that precludes the patient's ability to comply with study requirements
                  including completion of the study.

               -  Known allergy, hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study medications, its
