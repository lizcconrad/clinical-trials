  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recessions are often successfully treated by coronally advanced flap technique (CAF)
      associated with subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG). Currently the xenogeneic
      collagen matrix (CM) has been used as a substitute for SCTG associated with CAF technique for
      root coverage. CAF technique was not developed for use with CM and has shown limited results
      when applied to the CM. The aim of this study was to compare and show the benefits of the
      extended flap technique (EFT) compared to CAF technique using CM for root coverage.
