  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is an essential biological process for life and great value to functions such as
      learning, memory processing , cell and brain repair. Recently, new evidence points to the
      relationship between lack of sleep and carbohydrate metabolism , establishing a framework for
      insulin resistance observed in studies with restriction and sleep deprivation on several
      nights and in a single night . To reverse this process , one of the most effective strategies
      is physical exercise and part listed in the literature as a non-pharmacological tool for
      prevention and health promotion , as well as in the treatment of some diseases . However ,
      the pace of modern society causes people to practice less physical exercise , lack of time
      being the main reason . In this scenario, the High Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT )
      emerges as a powerful strategy that induces major changes optimizing the time spent on such
      activity. Considering the benefits of this mode , the purpose of this study is to investigate
      the effects of high-intensity interval training in the context of insulin resistance observed
      during sleep deprivation. Will be recruited 20 male volunteers, aged between 18 and 35 years
      old, healthy, with normal sleep duration equivalent to 7-8 hours / night, not smoking and
      regular eating habits. They will be submitted to a protocol of 6 sessions of high-intensity
      interval training for two weeks, and since the end period, sleep normally, or be deprived of
      sleep for 24 hours. Biochemical (thyroid hormones, cortisol, glucagon, free fatty acid,
      cholesterol, glucose and insulin) will be undertaken as well as evaluation of body
      composition by plethysmography, basal metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry and insulin
      sensitivity through Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) before and after the training period.

    <description>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is performed after at least 8 hours of fasting overnight, by oral administration of standard dose of 75g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water (dextrose). The plasma glucose levels are fasting measured (before administration of glucose state) and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after administration. Volunteers will be advised to follow the same eating patterns before testing.</description>

    <description>6 sessions in 2 weeks (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). Each training session will consist of repeated high-intensity efforts in a workload that matches the peak oxygen uptake for 60 seconds. These sprints are interspersed with active recovery for 75 seconds on low intensity (30W). The training sessions will have three minutes of heating in 30W. There will be 8 shots in the first and second session, 10 shots in the third and fourth session and 12 shots in the fifth and sixth session.</description>
