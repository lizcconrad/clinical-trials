  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Technology has been created to help older adults age well in their homes, but adoption and
      acceptance have been slow. The researchers are developing a low-cost web-based technology,
      called Elder Tree, for older adults and caregivers to address key challenges older adults
      face, such as loneliness and isolation, falls, loss of driving privileges, relapsing from
      proven falls prevention strategies, and unreliable home services. Elder Tree is being
      developed and tested with older adults and caregivers to identify, 1) usability issues such
      as font size, navigation and interface (audio, video,text) and 2) content and tailoring
      issues such as identifying local resources and events. This study will employ a randomized
      longitudinal design comparing a control group to an intervention group over a 12-month
      period. Investigators hypothesize that older adults using Elder Tree will experience greater
      independence and quality of life when compared to the control group. Investigators will use
      quantitative measures to determine how much our intervention improves: quality of life and
      health system use. These measures will help us to determine the cost effectiveness of Elder
      Tree. Investigators will recruit and test Elder Tree in 3 Regional Aging and Disability
      Resource Centers; one urban, one suburban and one rural setting, so to account for
      environmental and community differences. The older adult and their caregiver will be
      randomized to the same treatment group. Investigators will measure the effect over the 12
      month intervention period and a 6 month follow-up period at 18 months.
