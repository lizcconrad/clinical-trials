  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) are at high risk for
      intentionally hurting themselves. Although there are therapies in existence for these youths
      with BD, they do not address suicide prevention specifically. Mentalization-based therapy for
      adolescents (MBT-A) has been shown to be helpful in reducing self-harm in the adolescent and
      adult population with borderline personality disorder. The investigators will modify the
      MBT-A treatment procedures for persons with BD who have had a recent period of suicidal
      ideation or behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth with early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) are at an elevated risk for intentional
      self-harm compared to healthy adolescents or adolescents with other psychiatric disorders.
      Adolescents vulnerable to emotion dysregulation and self-harm often have deficits in the
      ability to mentalize: to understand, acknowledge, and predict thoughts and feelings in
      oneself and others. Mentalization-based therapy for adolescents (MBT-A) has been shown to be
      more effective than 'usual care' in reducing self-harm for adolescents and adults with
      borderline personality disorder. MBT-A includes psychoeducational and coping strategies that
      may prove quite effective for bipolar adolescents who are at elevated risk for self-harm.

      Participation in this study will last 9 months. All participants will receive a thorough
      medical-psychiatric evaluation. All youth will be able to receive pharmacotherapy with a
      study psychiatrist in the CHAMP clinic. The MBT-A will consist of up to 21 weekly, biweekly
      and monthly individual sessions interspersed with 9 monthly family sessions (30 therapy hours
      total). Participants will also complete follow-up assessments every 3 months for 9 months.
      These assessments will include research interviews and questionnaires.

    <description>Up to 21 individual MBT-A sessions plus 9 monthly family sessions. MBT-A sessions will focus on the adolescent's recent social experiences and the resulting mental states and managing interpersonal challenges, particularly those involving separation or loss. The goal of this intervention is to improve the adolescent's ability to mentalize: to understand, acknowledge, and predict thoughts and feelings in oneself and others.</description>
