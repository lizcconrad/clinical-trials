  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to investigate if resveratrol supplementation can improve
      overall and muscle-specific insulin sensitivity in first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic
      patients.

      As a secondary objective the investigators want to investigate whether the improved insulin
      sensitivity can be attributed to improved muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and a
      reduced intrahepatic and cardiac lipid content. Furthermore, in a subset of the participants
      the investigators want to investigate the effect of resveratrol on glucose uptake in brown
      adipose tissue.
