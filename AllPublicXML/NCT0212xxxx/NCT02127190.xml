    <textblock>
      This will be the first-in-human (FIH) study with CXA-10. The main purpose of this trial is to
      demonstrate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10 at various
      incremental doses, and to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the rate of the emulsion
      vehicle infusion in healthy volunteers. In addition, associated pharmacodynamic (PD) effects
      of CXA-10 will be investigated.

             aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be avoided within 7
             days prior to the first dose and during this study as it will interfere with the
             pharmacology of CXA-10. Use of high energy supplements or drinks (especially, those

             unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to expected study medication non-compliance,
