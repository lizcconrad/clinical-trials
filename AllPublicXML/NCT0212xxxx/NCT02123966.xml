  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effectiveness of topical sirolimus combined with
      topical steroid therapy, as a possible treatment for oral cGVHD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical steroid therapy can be effective in managing oral cGVHD symptoms. However, a certain
      proportion of participants will not experience an adequate response to topical steroids and
      continue to have some degree of discomfort. Sirolimus is a non-steroidal immunosuppressive
      medication that has demonstrated efficacy in the management of cGVHD. Based on this, it is
      believed that a topical formulation applied inside the mouth may also demonstrate efficacy on
      a localized basis.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of topical sirolimus as a
      swish and spit solution for the treatment of oral cGVHD in participants that have not had an
      adequate clinical response to topical steroid therapy alone.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this phase II trial is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of topical sirolimus for the treatment of refractory oral cGVHD. The primary endpoint will be the pre-to-post treatment improvement in each subject's subjective sensitivity score (0-10) evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks post treatment for each arm. Improvement in the subjective sensitivity score is defined as 3 points or further reduction in score from pre-treatment to post-treatment assessment. For example if a patient has a 10 for pre-treatment sensitivity score and a 7 post-treatment, this would be considered a response.</description>

    <description>A four week supply of topical sirolimus will be dispensed. The treatment instructions will be to rinse and spit (NOT swallow) with one teaspoon (5 mL) of sirolimus solution 0.1mg/mL, combined with one teaspoon (5 mL) of steroid solution (dexamethasone 0.1%, clobetasol 0.05%, or budesonide 0.03%, based on the ongoing topical steroid prescription at the time of study enrollment) four times a day for 5 minutes at a time, and not to eat or drink for 15 minutes afterwards. Subjects will maintain a diary and record each dose, the length of time rinsing, and any adverse effects (e.g. transient burning).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  While there will be no restrictions on concurrent systemic medications, all subjects
             must be on a stable immunomodulatory medication regimen for 7 days prior to beginning
             the study without plans to adjust doses during the following four-week study period.
             Dose modifications to maintain therapeutic drug levels of immunosuppressants (i.e.
             tacrolimus and sirolimus) during the study intervention period are allowed and do not
             constitute a trial violation. Changes in medications for non-cGVHD medical conditions
             will not affect eligibility.

          -  Age 4 years and older.

          -  Patients with symptomatic oral chronic graft-versus-host disease (sensitivity score ≥
             4).

          -  Stable topical steroid therapy with dexamethasone, clobetasol, or budesonide oral
             solutions (5 min, four times a day) for seven days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Stable systemic cGVHD medication regimen for seven days prior to study enrollment.
             Dose modifications to maintain therapeutic drug levels of immunosuppressants (i.e.
             tacrolimus and sirolimus) for the month prior and during the study intervention period
             are allowed and do not constitute a trial violation.

          -  The effects of sirolimus on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because immunosuppressants agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this
             trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
             completion of topical sirolimus administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients already using topical sirolimus therapy.

          -  Patients who have an allergy/intolerance to sirolimus.

          -  Sensitivity score ≤ 3.

          -  Inability to comply with study instructions.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded due to the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with sirolimus.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with sirolimus. In addition, these
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
