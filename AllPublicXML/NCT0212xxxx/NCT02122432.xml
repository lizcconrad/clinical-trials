  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, there is usually a long delay (approximately 6 weeks) before a general
      practitioner can obtain a specialized advice by dermatologists for diagnosis of &quot;unusual&quot;
      dermatologic conditions of their patients.

      Previous studies have shown that teledermatology is a reliable way for diagnosis in
      dermatology.

      We hypothesize that a teledermatology advice could reduce delay before diagnosis and
      therefore treatment for patients.

    <measure>Delay before expertise by a dermatologist</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Delay, in days, between a patient's consultation with his general practitioner and expertise by a dermatologist (teledermatology or classic consultation) that allows either diagnostic and/or initiation of treatment.
For example: in the teledermatology group, if the specialist needs to see the patient because the photographs cannot be analyzed correctly, date of expertise is the date of the consultation with the dermatologist.
Data is censured after 3 months.</description>

    <description>An investigator will call patients by telephone and assess their satisfaction with their care for the dermatologic condition using a simple rating scale with 4 items ranging from &quot;Not satisfied&quot; (1) to &quot;very satisfied&quot; (4).</description>

    <description>Usual care for dermatologic conditions requiring an expertise from a dermatologist involves the general practitioner 1) giving the patient a paper letter containing at least the following information: date of symptoms, symptomatology, topography of lesions, description of lesions, extension, recent drug intakes) and 2) telling him to see the dermatologist of his choice (patient manages his appointments alone).</description>

    <description>General practitioner takes 3 photographs per dermatologic lesion using either a telephone with a 3Mega Pixel minimum camera or a standard camera following recommendations of the practice guidelines for teledermatology (2007) of the American Telemedicine Association.
Photographs are sent by email using a secured mail server with at least the following information=date of symptoms, symptomatology, topography of lesions, description of lesions, extension, recent drug intakes)
Photographs are read and analyzed by a single dermatologist who gives an expert answer (diagnosis and/or treatment). Answer is sent back to the general practitioner by email (using a secured mail server). Answer contains at least the following information= are photographs usable? What is the diagnosis? If necessary, which treatment should the general practitioner begin ? If necessary, does the patient need a consultation with a dermatologist ?</description>
