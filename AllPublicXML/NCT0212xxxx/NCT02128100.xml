  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study wants to find out how safe and effective the use of Folfirinox combined with
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy )(SBRT) is for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

      The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single center, trial to assess the effects
      of FOLIRINOX chemotherapy with SBRT on locally advanced, non-resectable pancreatic cancer.
      Patients will either undergo a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis or have strong clinical
      suspicion of a new cancer or recurrence based on the recommendations of a multi-disciplinary
      GI oncology team. FOLFIRINOX with be delivered prior to SBRT for 4 cycles. Restaging imaging
      will occur prior to SBRT delivery. SBRT will be delivered using standard stereotactic
      techniques to a dose of 3200cGy at 650cGy per fraction delivered over 2 weeks. Additional
      adjuvant chemotherapy with be delivered at the physician's discretion. Patients will be
      reassessed both clinically and radiographically at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months
      post-treatment. Quality of life analysis will occur at 3 month intervals after treatment.
      Blood will be drawn for exploratory biomarker analysis at strategic timepoints during
      treatment and followup. Following the initial imaging time points, standard surveillance will
      be employed with clinical assessment and imaging at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years
      post-treatment.
