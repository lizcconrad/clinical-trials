    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well psychoeducational and behavioral strategies work
      in reducing distress and anxiety in patients with multiple myeloma and their family
      caregivers. Education and walking programs, may be able to reduce distress and anxiety and
      improve the well-being and quality of life of patients with multiple myeloma and their family
      caregivers. Understanding how different forms of education and support can promote emotional
      wellness may help nurse researchers find ways to improve services provided to patients and
      family members during cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the intervention, as compared to the control group, on emotional
      distress, the primary outcome, measured as anxiety in patients with multiple myeloma and
      their caregivers at the transition.

      II. Evaluate the effect, including the effect size, of the intervention, as compared to the
      control group, on activation for self-management, fatigue, depression, and health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) in both patients and caregivers.

      III. Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and content integrity of the intervention in
      patients with multiple myeloma and their family caregivers.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants meet with a nurse in-person for approximately 30 minutes to receive
      information about strategies for cognitive self-management of distress and an individualized
      walking prescription to gradually increase their walking to 30 minutes per day, 5 times per
      week. Participants wear a pedometer for at least 3 consecutive days during weeks 1, 6, and
      12. Participants are also contacted by the nurse via telephone at 1 and 3 weeks for
      supplemental counseling support.

      ARM II: Participants meet with a nurse in-person for approximately 20 minutes to receive
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) educational booklets and a link to the American Cancer
      Society (ACS) website. Participants are also contacted by the nurse via telephone at 1 and 3
      weeks but the calls are primarily social in nature and do not include counseling support.
