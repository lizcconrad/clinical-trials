  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals of hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy/radiotherapy on treatment
      failure solid tumors are tumor response rate, while secondary goals are rates of acute and
      late adverse effects, local control rate, distant metastasis rate, progression-free rate and
      overall survival rate.

      The goal of this study is to conduct a phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of combination of low temperature (40-43℃ range) hyperthermia and concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in treatment failure solid tumors. There are 3 reasons of conducting
      this clinical trial. Firstly, it has been demonstrated that hyperthermia can enhance the
      efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in various cancers, with
      acceptable safety profiles. Secondly, the salvage outcomes for treatment failure solid tumors
      were frustrated. Thermal enhancement ratio (TER) was observed when using hyperthermia
      combining radiotherapy or chemotherapy. This strategy should be investigated in its efficacy
      in treating those failing from previous standard treatment and maybe several times of salvage
      therapy. Thirdly, biologically reciprocal complementation between hyperthermia, chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy was observed. The reason may be complicated, including theories involving
      hypoxia, immunomodulation and reperfusion … etc. If the immunity microenvironment could be
      improved by addition of hyperthermia, an unexpected survival benefit as compared with the
      literature may be potentially demonstrated from this study.
