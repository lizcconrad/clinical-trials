  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the United States, and
      treatment by AF ablation is quickly becoming the favored definitive therapy. Nonetheless, AF
      ablation comes with some risk, including bleeds related to vascular access and myocardial
      damage, as well as the rare incidence of clinical stroke from blood clots that travel from
      the heart to the brain, termed &quot;cerebrothromboemboli.&quot; In fact, cerebrothromboemboli without
      any symptoms have been detected by special imaging procedures called brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) in as many as 22% of cases.(1-6) There remains clinical equipoise amongst
      experts regarding balancing the risks and benefits of continued versus interrupted blood
      thinning, or &quot;anticoagulation&quot; during AF ablation as they pertain to risk of bleed and
      cerebrothromboemboli prevention, respectively, and the potentially more subtle sequelae of
      these apparently silent cerebrothromboemboli remain unknown. In fact, both interruption and
      continuation of anticoagulation during AF ablation are the standard of care. The
      investigators will perform the first randomized trial of uninterrupted versus interrupted
      anticoagulation in patients undergoing AF ablation to determine if it mitigates neurologic
      injury. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of continued
      anticoagulation for AF ablation on cerebrothromboemboli, and the neurocognitive sequelae of
      embolic lesions, which to this point are considered subclinical. The investigators
      hypothesize that continued anticoagulation will both reduce cerebrothromboemboli and mitigate
      any potential decline in neurocognitive function post-procedurally. The investigators also
      hypothesize that the incidence of cerebrothromboemboli (CTE) by MRI will mediate that
      difference.
