  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to evaluate a new test for determining presence of infection/sepsis as
      compared to non-infection/systemic inflammatory response syndrome among critically ill
      patients within the first 24 hours of their being hospitalized in an intensive care unit
      (ICU) within the first 7 days of hospitalization. The primary purpose of the study is to
      validate SeptiCyte® Lab in this population as compared to: 1) the doctor's impression and 2)
      existing clinical parameters. The investigators also hope to assess how well a related, new
      blood test, SeptID® identifies different types of infection, as compared to cultures and
      other lab tests.
