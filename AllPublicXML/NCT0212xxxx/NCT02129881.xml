  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to assess cell therapy as a treatment to prevent kidney transplant rejection. The
      trial will involve purification of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nTregs) from
      living-donor renal transplant recipients. The cells will then be grown in the laboratory and
      re‐infused into the patient five days after the kidney transplant. This trial is part of an
      international European Union funded consortium aimed at evaluating cellular immunotherapy in
      solid organ transplantation (The ONE Study). It is anticipated that immune regulation induced
      by nTreg therapy can eventually be used to recude the need for conventional immunosuppression
      in transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decades of immunosuppressive drug development has produced an array of powerful
      pharmacological agents, but the various drawbacks with these treatments leaves considerable
      room for improvement. By harnessing the power of suppressive mechanisms in the human immune
      system, regulatory cell therapy may be able to support peripheral tolerance and induce a
      level of donor-specific unresponsiveness that allows for a reduction in the use of
      conventional immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Several alternative regulatory
      cell types have been identified as potential adjunct immunotherapies for solid organ
      transplantation and are now approaching a stage of development that would allow clinical
      testing in an early-stage trial. The EU-funded international ONE study consortium aims to
      answer the question as to whether Treg treatment, or other immunoregulatory cell-based
      therapies, can be advanced in the clinical management of solid organ transplant recipients.
      This particular Treg trial aims to explored the potential of Treg therapy as an adjunct
      immunosuppressive treatment in living-donor renal transplant recipients through a clinical
      protocol design shared by other investigators in the ONE study group testing additional
      regulatory cell therapies in seperate trials.
