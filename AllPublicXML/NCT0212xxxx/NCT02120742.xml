  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of a text-message (SMS) program delivered to
      motorcycle drivers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The SMS program, delivered by nonprofit Amend,
      sends daily reminders to motorcycle drivers to remind them to wear their helmets. In this
      study, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to see if this program
      leads to increased helmet use over time. The investigators will recruit between 350-400
      motorcycle drivers to receive the text program. The investigators will obtain each of their
      cell phone numbers, and the participants will be split into three groups. The first group
      will receive reminders framed as social norming (ie &quot;Most of your peers wear helmets&quot;). The
      second group will receive reminders framed as fear appeals (ie &quot;Not wearing your helmet
      increases your chance of dying in an accident&quot;). The third group will act as the control and
      receive texts that relate to general road safety, but not helmet use. All groups will receive
      the same general road safety information being delivered to the control arm. The purpose of
      sending different types of reminders is to assess which type of messages are more likely to
      cause a motorcycle driver to regularly wear their helmet. The investigators will survey the
      participants at the initiation of the study and after weeks 3 and 6 during the study, asking
      about their helmet use. This will be a short survey, and any personal information gathered
      during the study (ie, phone numbers), will be securely stored so as to protect their privacy.
