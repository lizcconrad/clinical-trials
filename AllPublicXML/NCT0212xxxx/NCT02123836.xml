  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel method has been developed to expand natural (NK) cells and enhance their cytotoxicity
      against cancer cells while maintaining low killing capacity against non-transformed cells. In
      this method, donor NK cells are expanded by co-culture with the irradiated K562 cell line
      modified to express membrane bound IL-15 and 41BB ligand (K562-mb15-41BBL). Expression of
      these proteins in conjunction with unknown stimuli provided by K562 cells promotes selective
      growth of NK cells. Then, the expanded NK cell population is depleted of T cells to prevent
      graft versus host disease (GVHD). Expanded and activated NK cells showed powerful
      anti-leukemic activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vitro and in animal
      models of leukemia.Unpublished laboratory results also demonstrated that T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is extremely sensitive to the cytotoxicity exerted by the
      expanded and activated NK cells.

      The present study represents the translation of the laboratory findings into clinical
      application. The study proposes to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of infusing
      expanded NK cells into patients who have AML or T-lineage ALL which is resistant to standard
      therapy as demonstrated by persistent minimal residual disease (MRD). Patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), who are at high risk to develop AML will also be eligible for
      the study. In this patient cohort, the study will also investigate the in vivo lifespan and
      phenotype of the expanded NK cells.

      The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that infusion of expanded activated NK
      cells can produce measurable clinical responses in patients with AML or T-ALL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 20 eligible subjects who will receive NK cell infusion to test whether
      infusion of expanded activated NK cells can produce measurable clinical responses in patients
      with AML/MDS or T-ALL.The study aims to infuse a target dose of 10 x 107 CD56+ cells/kg,
      however, as the actual cell dose obtained will vary depending on the donor harvest, the
      accepted range for cell infusion will be 0.5-20 x 107 CD56+ cells/kg. On day -10, eligible
      donors (adult family member of recipient) will undergo apheresis once. A second apheresis
      procedure may be needed to obtain the required cell count from the donor. NK cells will be
      expanded in co-culture with irradiated (100 Gy) K562-mb15-41BBL cells in closed culture
      containers for 10 days. Prior to NK cell infusion on Day 0, recipients will undergo screening
      evaluations and will receive cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine, IL-2, and supportive medications
      (e.g. mesna). Cytokine regimen of IL-2 will be initiated on the evening of day -1 (dose 1 of
      6). IL-2 will be continued at a dose of 1 million units/m2 subcutaneously 3 times per week
      for 2 weeks (6 doses total). Post-infusion follow-up procedures for up to 1 year from the day
      of NK cell infusion include physical examination, Complete Blood Count, and
      metabolic/chemistry studies. The effects of NK cell infusion will also be determined by
      comparing MRD levels before and after treatment. MRD blood and bone marrow levels will be
      collected at baseline and at specified time points (until 1 year from the day of NK cell
      infusion). NK cell donors will be recruited from the family members of the patient recipient.
      Potential donors aged 21 years old will be consented and will undergo the required screening
      tests and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. Since 20 eligible subjects will be enrolled
      as NK cell recipients, 20 donors will also be recruited for this study. Ineligible NK cell
      donors will have to be replaced.

    <description>Peripheral blood cell will be collected by apheresis from donors. Peripheral blood mononucleated cells will be cultured with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL cells and low dose (10 IU/mL) IL-2 for 10 days. After T-cell depletion, expanded activated NK cells will be infused. Before infusion, patients will receive immunosuppressive therapy to promote temporary engraftment of NK cells. After infusion, they will receive IL-2 to support NK cell viability and expansion in vivo. The effects of NK cell infusion will be determine by comparing MRD levels before and after treatment.</description>

    <description>7 days of preparatory treatment are given before the NK cell infusion. Chemotherapy will be given over 6 days. This chemotherapy will promote donor NK cells engraftment. After which, a drug called Interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be given as an injection just under the skin three times per week for at least 2 weeks (total of 6 doses). This treatment is used to help keep the donor NK cells alive.
Blood cells will be collected from an eligible and suitable family donor 10 days before infusion. The collection sample will be processed to remove red blood cells and as many T-cells as possible. T-cells from the donor might cause these donor cells to attack the body, usually the skin, liver, and intestines.
NK cells will be activated in the National University Hospital lab and ready for infusion on Day 0.
The NK cells will then be infused into the vein, through a peripheral catheter.</description>
