  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention consisted of training non-paid informal healthcare providers (such as
      store-keepers) in TB and HIV disease recognition, sputum specimen collection, referral to the
      public health system, and raising community awareness. Front line public health personnel and
      community leaders were sensitised to support the intervention.

      A phased, matched, parallel cluster design was used to randomise three clusters (average
      population size per cluster = 200,714) to the Early intervention arm (received the
      intervention early in the first 12 months) and an equal number to the Delayed intervention
      arm (average population size per cluster = 209,564) which received the intervention after one
      year. Data for impact evaluation were obtained from routine patient registers in all the
      health facilities and patients were blindly allocated to the respective clusters based on
      residential address. Treatment initiation rates (expressed as incidence rate ratios) for TB
      and Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) over the 12 months period were the primary outcome measures
      for each of the studied conditions. Poisson regression models with robust standard errors
      were used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
