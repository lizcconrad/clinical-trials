      1. Moderate exercise training decrease cytokine response and rhinitis symptoms in patients
           with allergic rhinitis

        2. Moderate exercise training combined with vitamin C supplementation decrease cytokine
           response and rhinitis symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis

        3. Moderate exercise training combined with vitamin C supplementation has more beneficial
           effects than moderate exercise training alone for decreasing cytokine response and
           rhinitis symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis

    <measure>Changes from baseline in rhinitis symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal symptoms will be assessed using a rhinitis symptom score questionnaire. The subjects will be asked to score symptoms of persistent allergic rhinitis; nasal congestion, itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea before and after each exercise protocol. The score ranged from 0 to 3 points (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in cytokine</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13 in blood and nasal secretion will be determined by using the flow cytometry technique (Scavuzzo MC. et al., 2003). Data will be acquired using a flow cytometer (BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer, USA) and analyzed by FlowcytomixTM Pro software (eBioscience, USA.).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in pulmonary function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function (FVC and FEV1) will be conducted on all subjects using a calibrated computerized pneumotachograph spirometer (Spirotouch; Burdick, Inc., Deerfield, Wisconsin USA.) according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommendations (Laszlo G., 2006).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>VO2max will be performed using bruce treadmill protocol. Subjects will be asked to run on a treadmill (Landice, USA) in which the grade and intensity will be increased every 3 minutes until exhaustion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in nasal blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal mucosa blood flow will be measured by laser doppler flowmetry (DRT4 moor instrument, UK.). A side delivery endoscopic probe with flexible nylon sleeve with a diameter of 1.34 mm was placed on the anterior surface of the nose. The nasal blood flow values before and after exercise in each protocol will be then measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in peak nasal inspiratory flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) will be measured using a peak nasal inspiratory flow meter (Clement Clark International model IN-CHECK ORAL, UK.) attached to an anesthesia mask. During the procedure, the subjects placed a mask over the nose and mouth and inspired forcefully through the nose, with lips tightly closed. PNIF will be measured before and after exercise.</description>
