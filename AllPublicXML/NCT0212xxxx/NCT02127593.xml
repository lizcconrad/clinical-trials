    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the bioequivalence of the hormones norgestimate,
      norelgestromin, and ethinyl estradiol in norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol (NGM/EE) tablets,
      formulated by wet process compared with the same hormones in NGM/EE tablets, formulated by
      dry process, in healthy women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-dose, open-label (a medical research study in which participants
      and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving, &quot;unblinded&quot;),
      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), single-center and a 2-way crossover
      (method used to switch participants from one study group to another in a clinical trial)
      study in healthy women. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening phase, Treatment phase and
      end-of-study or withdrawal. Treatment periods will be separated by a wash out period of at
      least 10 days. The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will
      be approximately 7 weeks. All participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2
      possible treatment sequences and receive both of the following treatments: 1 oral tablet
      formulated by wet process or dry process, whereas each tablet contains norgestimate 250
      microgram (mcg) and ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. The primary endpoint of the study will be
      assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
