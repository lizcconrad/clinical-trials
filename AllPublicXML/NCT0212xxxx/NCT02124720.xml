  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly all children with autism spectrum disorders engage in non-functional repetitive vocal
      and motor behaviours commonly referred to as stereotypy. These repetitive behaviours may
      considerably interfere with the child's daily functioning, learning, and social inclusion. As
      such, stereotypy generally has a negative impact on the child and family's health and quality
      of life. Several behavioural interventions have been developed to reduce engagement in
      stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders, but the limited number of specialists
      available, the long waiting lists associated with public health services in Canada, and the
      high costs of private services have considerably restricted accessibility. One potential
      solution to the limited availability and high costs of services is using a mobile application
      to recommend, teach, and monitor interventions designed to reduce engagement in stereotypy.
      To this end, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of the iSTIM (i.e.,
      individualized Stereotypy Treatment Integrated Modules), a mobile application designed to
      assist parents in reducing stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders.
      Specifically, we will assess whether the iSTIM correctly estimates the frequency or duration
      of stereotypy, offers suggestions consistent with recommended clinical practices, effectively
      reduces engagement in stereotypy, and is socially acceptable, safe, and easy to use for
      parents of children with autism spectrum disorders. The results of the study will allow us to
      determine whether the mobile application may be used to treat this core symptom in children
      with autism spectrum disorders, which could potentially reduce waiting times and costs of
      providing health services to this population. By reducing engagement in stereotypy, the iSTIM
      may also promote and facilitate the social participation as well as improve the quality of
      life and health of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders

          -  Must engage in at least one form of stereotypy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stereotypy occurs less than 12 times per hour (or less than 20% of time)

          -  The form of stereotypy is potentially dangerous for the person (e.g., head banging,
             self-biting)

          -  The form of stereotypy is maintained by social consequences (e.g., attention, task
             avoidance)
