  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of autologous Platelet rich
      fibrin (PRF) or PRF and Simvastatin (SMV) with open flap debridement (OFD) in the treatment
      of three wall intrabony defects in comparison to OFD alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 systemically healthy subjects were divided randomly into three groups (30 subjects in each
      group, per subject one site). Control group consisted of the sites treated with OFD and test
      groups sites were treated with OFD with autologous PRF or PRF with SMV. Site-specific plaque
      index (PI), sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL)
      and intrabony defect (IBD) depth reduction was measured at baseline and 9 month after
      surgery.
