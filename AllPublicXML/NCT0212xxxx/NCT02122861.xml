  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 multi-center study to evaluate the clinical safety and immune response of
      ID-LV305 when injected intradermally in patients with advanced cancer. ID-LV305 is a novel
      immunotherapy agent designed to target dendritic cells and stimulate the body's immune system
      to fight the spread and growth of cancer for patients whose tumors express the NY-ESO-1
      protein. Patients with melanoma, sarcoma, ovarian cancer, or small cell lung cancer that
      express NY-ESO-1 may be considered for the trial. Selected sites will be evaluating ID-LV305
      with pembrolizumab for patients with melanoma who have inadequately responded to anti-PD-1
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ID-LV305 is an agent designed to specifically target dendritic cells within the patient and
      induce them to stimulate and generate cytotoxic T cell responses against the NY-ESO-1
      protein, a molecule which is often expressed in certain types of cancer cells. This is a
      first in human study of ID-LV305. The primary purpose of the study is to determine what dose
      ID-LV305 can be given safely to patients with advanced cancers that express NY-ESO-1 protein.
      ID-LV305 will be administered by intradermal injection every three weeks times four doses.
      The study will have two phases. In Part 1, Dose Escalation, which has been completed, three
      sequentially enrolled cohorts of patients were treated at one of four dose levels of ID-LV305
      using a standard escalation design. Followed by Part 2 expansion where an additional 27
      subjects were enrolled. In Part 2SA, Site-specific Amendment, patients with unresectable
      and/or metastatic melanoma with an inadequate response to anti-PD-1 MAb therapy, defined as
      SD or PD using RECIST criteria following at least 2 months of therapy. Patients with PD have
      a tumor measurement increase of &lt;2-fold from the time of starting anti-PD-1 therapy, must not
      be symptomatic or have worsening of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
      status due to their disease progression, and cannot have new CNS lesion. Patients must also
      meet the lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), ECOG status, and no tumor size criteria are used in
      Part 2SA.
