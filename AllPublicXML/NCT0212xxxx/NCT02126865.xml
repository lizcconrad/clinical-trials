  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1060469 in healthy male and female subjects after oral administration of repeated rising
      doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg and 250 mg qd. of 1 day followed by 14 days and in
      asthmatic male and female patients after oral administration of repeated rising doses of 25
      mg and 150 mg qd of 1 day followed by 28 days.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose
      proportionality, dose linearity after single and multiple dose segments, pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of BI 1060469 and to describe the PK/PD relationship.
