  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in our understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its diagnosis,
      the prognosis for patients with HCC remains disheartening, due to a high recurrence rate and
      frequent intrahepatic metastasis. Various therapies for use after hepatic resection have been
      reported, but they are associated with adverse side effects or they fail to improve overall
      survival. Nowadays, adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended as the
      most effective therapy for postoperative HCC. And the indication is patients with risk
      factors of recurrence. While more and more prospective studies revealed that radiotherapy is
      effective for advanced HCC. And the side effects of radiotherapy are controlled. Until now,
      no prospective or retrospective study compared the efficacy of adjuvant TACE and radiotherapy
      for postoperative HCC.

             all patients

          -  Patients have Child-Pugh A liver function and undergo potentially curative hepatic
             resection

          -  Patients with risk factors for recurrence (tumor size &gt;5 cm, multiple nodules,
             vascular invasion, absence of tumor capsule, poorly differentiated tumor, and narrow
             resection margin)

          -  No previous treatment of HCC except liver resection

          -  No evidence of metastasis to the lymph nodes and/or distant metastases on the basis of
             preoperative imaging results and perioperative findings

          -  No malignancy other than HCC for 5 years prior to the initial HCC treatment

          -  No imaging evidence of invasion into the major portal/hepatic vein branches

          -  No history of encephalopathy, ascites refractory to diuretics or variceal bleeding
