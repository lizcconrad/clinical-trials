  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early identification of acute HCV infection is essential to prevent chronic infections and
      the long-term liver disease complications that may occur. Early identification and treatment
      of HCV during the acute phase can result in significantly higher response rates with shorter
      durations of therapy.

      Pegylated-interferon alfa (PEG-IFN) was the typical treatment for HCV infection. Participants
      subcutaneously inject PEG-IFN where the average duration of treatment was approximately 20
      weeks. With the advancement of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), it was possible to see if a
      new DAA might be non-inferior compared to (PEG-IFN).

      The study was designed to see if a fixed-dose combination tablet can replace the old HCV
      treatments by being more effective, safer and better tolerated in HIV-infected participants
      with new HCV infection. The study was a Phase I, open-label, two cohort clinical trial, in
      which 44 acutely HCV-infected HIV-1 positive participants were enrolled. Participants in each
      cohort were evaluated in two steps: on treatment (Step 1) and follow-up after discontinuing
      study treatment (Step 2). The cohorts were enrolled sequentially. Participants in Cohort 1
      were enrolled and administered oral Sofosbuvir (SOF) in combination with weight-based
      ribavirin (RBV). Participants in Cohort 2 were enrolled and administered an oral fixed dose
      combination of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first cohort opened with SOF/RBV treatment for 12 weeks and accrued 17 participants. All
      participants under Cohort 1 were to visit the clinical site at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12
      when on treatment (Step 1), then visit the clinical site again at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks
      during follow-up after discontinuing study treatment (Step 2).

      The second cohort opened for an 8-week treatment of LDV/SOF and included at least 27
      subjects. All participants under Cohort 2 were to visit the clinical site at weeks 0, 1, 2,
      4, and 8 when on treatment (Step 1), then visit the clinical site again at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24
      weeks during follow-up after discontinuing study treatment (Step 2).

      Both cohorts were monitored for safety and HCV viral load response while the participants
      were on treatment.

      The primary objective did not compare the cohorts together; instead, each study cohort was
      formally assessed for efficacy with sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment
      based on non-inferiority criteria compared to a historical SVR rate of 60% separately.

    <time_frame>At 12 weeks after date of last dose of study treatment. The duration of study treatment for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 were 12 and 8 weeks, respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA undetectable less than the lower limit of quantification, Target Not Detected (&lt;LLOQ TND) of the assay at 12 weeks after date of last dose of study treatment.
For both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, the 12 week measurement used for determining SVR12 was the measurement obtained closest to 84 days (i.e. 12*7 days), within the window 79 to 112 days inclusive. If a participant did not have an HCV RNA measurement within this window, then the participant was considered as having detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks unless the preceding and subsequent HCV RNA measurements were both undetectable (&lt;LLOQ TND).
A two-sided 90% confidence interval was calculated for this percentage using the Blyth-Still-Casella method.</description>

    <description>Any adverse event occurring after initiation of study treatment through to 28 days after the date of last dose of study treatment was included (except that an event that was ongoing at the same grade from before start of study treatment was excluded). Adverse events consisted of Grade ≥ 2 primary diagnosis, primary sign/symptoms, and primary laboratory abnormality. It also included any serious adverse event according to ICH criteria and any treatment-limiting AE (ie, an AE reported as the reason for permanent discontinuation of study treatment).

        A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

        Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load. [NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is required for
             all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
             use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
             initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an
             E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle
             (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load.

          -  A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry
             or HCV reinfection as described below:

               1. Acute HCV infection was defined as meeting one of the following criteria and
                  exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis:

                    -  New (&lt;24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper
                       limit of normal (ULN) OR &gt;250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in
                       the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR &gt;500 U/L in patients with abnormal or
                       no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA
                       excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR

                    -  Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA
                       within the preceding 6 months.

               2. Acute HCV reinfection was defined by documentation of clearance of prior
                  infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after
                  treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one
                  of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute
                  hepatitis:

                    -  New (&lt;24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR
                       &gt;250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months
                       or ≥10X ULN OR &gt;500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT
                       baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR

                    -  Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months.

          -  HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable &gt;12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute
             HCV and still within the &lt;24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV
             infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection was defined as date of first
             elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion
             and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurred less
             than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant
             was required a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks
             from the first laboratory evidence of infection had passed. It was optimal for this
             pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory
             evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who entered screening but
             who had an undetectable HCV RNA (&lt;LLOQ TND) at the pre-entry visit (when required)
             exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the entry
             criteria.]

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m^2

          -  Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant abnormalities as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Men and women age ≥ 18 years.

          -  All participants agreed not to participate in a conception process (eg, active attempt
             to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). [NOTE:
             Female candidates who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not eligible. A male
             candidate who had a pregnant female partner was not eligible for the study.]

          -  When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants
             must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while
             receiving protocol-specified medications, and for 6 months after stopping the
             medications. Such methods included:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Tubal ligation

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive (except those containing drospirenone)

        [NOTE: Providers and participants were advised that not all contraceptive choices listed
        above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of HIV
        acquisition. Study participants who were sexually active with HIV-1 negative or unknown
        HIV-1 serostatus partners were advised that they needed to consider effective strategies
        for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective
        contraception during their participation in the study. Study participants discussed
        contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care provider.]

          -  Participants who were not of reproductive potential (women who had been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or had undergone hysterectomy
             and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who had documented azoospermia
             or undergone vasectomy) were eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.
             Acceptable documentation of sterilization and menopause was specified below.

               -  Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff of
                  one of the following:

               -  Physician report/letter

               -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a
                  laboratory report of azoospermia was required to document successful vasectomy)

               -  Discharge summary

               -  Follicle stimulating hormone-release factor (FSH) measurement elevated into the
                  menopausal range as established by the reporting laboratory.

          -  Intention to comply with the dosing instructions for study drug administration and
             able to complete the study schedule of assessments.

        Step 1 inclusion criteria for Cohort 1 only

          -  HIV-1 ARV therapy fell into one of the following criteria:

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 12 (SVR12)</title>
        <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA undetectable less than the lower limit of quantification, Target Not Detected (&lt;LLOQ TND) of the assay at 12 weeks after date of last dose of study treatment.
For both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, the 12 week measurement used for determining SVR12 was the measurement obtained closest to 84 days (i.e. 12*7 days), within the window 79 to 112 days inclusive. If a participant did not have an HCV RNA measurement within this window, then the participant was considered as having detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks unless the preceding and subsequent HCV RNA measurements were both undetectable (&lt;LLOQ TND).
A two-sided 90% confidence interval was calculated for this percentage using the Blyth-Still-Casella method.</description>
