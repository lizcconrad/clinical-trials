  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation develops an online, patient self-assessment system, called &quot;CarePrep&quot; to
      support the care and clinical research of patients with chronic pancreatic disease and
      chronic pancreatic pain. This web-based assessment presents patients with questions that
      address medical, psychological, social, behavioral, and quality-of-life issues that are
      relevant to pancreatic disease. Patients will be given the opportunity to enter and track
      their symptoms over the Internet from home or clinic. The system is also designed to gather
      clues to identify neuropathic pain, which occurs when the nervous system fails to properly
      regulate pain signals. Any of these factors can contribute to chronic pain and may point the
      way to more effective treatment. The broad objective of this study is to extend CarePrep to
      cover a full range of topics that are relevant to chronic pancreatic disease. The study team
      will refine this content based on the system's accuracy in real clinical settings and direct
      efforts to maximize its feasibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following aims will be addressed:

      Aim 1: Refine and extend CarePrep content for targeted disorders.

      Working with experts at our sites, the study team will review CarePrep content in association
      with current literature and established instruments. Applying this data, a comprehensive pain
      assessment will be developed and content to target chronic pancreatic pain (CPP) will be
      prioritized. During Phase 1 of the study, the system will be deployed, patient testing begun,
      and feedback gathered to guide refinement. Patients will be asked to complete their online
      CarePrep assessment before their scheduled clinic visit; the report will be delivered to
      their attending physician prior to the clinic encounter. Patients who are unable to complete
      their assessment at home will have access to electronic tablets which will be provided in
      clinic.

      Aim 2: Test with patients, gather feedback, and conduct cognitive and structured interviews
      to assess validity.

      Research staff will conduct individual patient interviews to assess CarePrep validity, via
      the following ways: Cognitive interviews probing for CarePrep comprehension and ease of use,
      as well as measuring patients' rationale for selecting their online responses; structured
      interviews that will include a block of standardized questions that mirror the online
      CarePrep assessment (patients' interview responses will be compared to data from their online
      session to assess the sensitivity of CarePrep screening questions); and patients' ratings of
      CarePrep's accuracy will be collected to improve and validate system design.

      Aim 3: Assess feasibility.

      In Phase II of the study, physician and patient self-reports will be used to assess
      feasibility and utility. The objective of this phase is to deliver a system that supports a
      comprehensive health assessment and facilitates physician-patient communication so that
      physicians will adopt the system for routine care.

    <description>Feedback via cognitive and structured interviews will assess validity: Cognitive interviews will probe for CarePrep comprehension and ease of use and will measure patients' rationale for selecting their online responses; structured interviews will include a block of standardized questions mirroring the online CarePrep assessment; patients' interview responses will be compared to data from their online session to assess the sensitivity of CarePrep screening questions; patients' ratings of CarePrep's accuracy will be collected to improve and validate system design; and experts and clinicians will review relevant sections of the CarePrep report for accuracy in order to address the utility and accuracy of reported data..
Physician and patient self-reports will assess feasibility and utility: After the refinement and validation phases have been completed, patients and clinicians will score the usefulness of Careprep in routine clinic use via brief self-reports.</description>
