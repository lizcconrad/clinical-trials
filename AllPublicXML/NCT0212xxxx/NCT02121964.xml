  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized study, investigators will look at the outcome of total hip
      arthroplasty through the anterior approach in regard to the surgical treatment of the
      anterior hip capsule. At this time, there are 2 different techniques: one is excising this
      capsule and the second one is cutting the capsule and repairing it at the end of the
      procedure. The investigators set out to determine whether incising or repairing the capsule
      will benefit the patients in terms of postoperative pain level, range of motion of the hip
      joint, joint stability, surgical time and blood loss. Both preserving and excising the joint
      capsule are accepted techniques in performing total hip arthroplasty. The Investigators
      hypothesize that capsulectomy may allow for reduction in operative time, provide superior
      surgical exposure, and increased range of motion after surgery. The influence on post
      operative pain and dislocation rate is unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Utilization of the direct anterior approach for total hip arthroplasty (THA) has increased
      over the last ten years. The approach, as described by Keggi et al, superficially utilizes
      the internervous muscle plane between the tensor fascia lata and the sartorius and deeply
      between the rectus and gluteus medius (1). Performing this muscle sparing rather than muscle
      splitting approach has several purported benefits. The clinical reports of this surgical
      approach have documented low dislocation rates (2, 3), excellent cup position (4) improved
      outcome scores (5), less muscle damage (6, 7) and improved gait mechanics (8). The
      preservation and repair of the anterior hip capsule (iliofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments)
      has been recommended by some authors, while anterior capsulectomy has been described by other
      authors without a reported increase in dislocation rate. In contrast, the higher risk of
      posterior dislocation using the posterior approach improved significantly after repair of the
      capsule (9, 10). There are no studies to date that have investigated outcome scores based on
      capsular repair versus capsulectomy for the THA direct anterior approach. The effects of
      anterior capsular repair versus capsulectomy are unknown with regards to anterior hip pain,
      range of motion, and surgical recovery. We hypothesize that capsulectomy may allow for
      reduction in operative time, provide superior surgical exposure, and increased range of
      motion after surgery. The influence on post operative pain and dislocation rate is unknown.

      In this prospective, randomized clinical study investigators will compare operative time,
      blood loss, postoperative pain, range of motion, strength, and adverse events using two
      different surgical techniques (anterior capsular repair versus anterior capsulectomy) during
      direct anterior total hip arthroplasty. Patients will be randomized at their screening visit
      to one of two groups (anterior capsule repair or anterior capsulectomy), and they will be
      blinded for the group assignment. The surgical procedures will be performed according to the
      surgeon's routine standard of care.

    <measure>Range of Motion- Resisted Hip Flexion Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow Up Visit (Up to six months)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement will be recorded taken with patient in the seated position with the hip flexed to 90 degrees. Strength will be measured when resistance is applied to the knee as the patient brings the leg up. The following scale will be used (each may be +/-, i.e. 5+):
5 = NORMAL - the patient is able to actively move through the full available range of motion (ROM) against gravity and against maximal resistance
4 = GOOD - the patient is able to actively move through the full available ROM against gravity and against moderate resistance
3 = MODERATE - the patient is able to actively move through greater than one half the available ROM against gravity and against moderate resistance
2 = POOR - the patient is unable to actively flex hip against gravity
1 = BAD - the patient is unable to flex muscle properly</description>
