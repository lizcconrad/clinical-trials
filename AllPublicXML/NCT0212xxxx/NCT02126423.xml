  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of short courses of topical antibiotic drops before and/or after
      intravitreal injections is a common practice, but increasing evidence suggests this may not
      lower the risk of infectious endophthalmitis and could increase rates of antimicrobial
      resistance. The purpose of the present study is to determine the antimicrobial resistance
      profiles in patients who have received numerous (≥ 20) courses of antibiotics for
      intravitreal injection compared with untreated controls.

      This study compares 20 control patients without prior intravitreal injection to 20 patients
      who have undergone ≥ 20 prior intravitreal injections accompanied by a course of topical
      antibiotics for two days before and/or after the injection procedure. The lower, inner eyelid
      and nasal cavity were cultured and evaluated via disk diffusion method for antimicrobial
      sensitivity.

      Before administration of anti-VEGF therapy (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) or topical
      antibiotics, conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs are procured with the Bacti-Swab transport
      system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For conjunctival samples, a sterile swab is
      moistened with ophthalmic balanced salt solution and gently swept along the lower fornix from
      the medial to the lateral canthi, with all attempts to avoid the eyelashes and eyelids. For
      nasopharyngeal cultures, the sterile swab is inserted 2 cm into the naris and rotated against
      the anterior nasal mucosa for 3 seconds.

      Culture swabs are then plated onto 5% sheep blood plates and incubated at 37°C for 3 days.
      Colonies are isolated and identified with API (Analytical Profile Index) Microbial
      Identification Kits (bioMérieux Inc., Hazelwood, MO). Antibiotic susceptibility is determined
      using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Additional data collected includes age, ocular
      and systemic medical conditions, and the number of intravitreal injections along with
      anti-VEGF agents used.

      Statistical calculations for antibiotic resistance comprises of t-test and and multivariate
      analysis.

    <description>One set of conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patient shortly after recruitment. Antibiotic susceptibility is determined using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method for the following antibiotics: amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, cefoxitin, erythromycin, moxifloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, clindamycin, and doxycycline.</description>
