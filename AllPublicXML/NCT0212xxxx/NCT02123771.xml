      The investigators hypothesis:

      Presence of anti-GGT (antibody against GGT) indicates H. pylori infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be requested to provide 1-5g of their solid/semi-solid stool sample, to be
      collected within 24 hours prior to their scheduled visit for urea breath test. Patients
      should not have been treated for H. pylori prior to stool collection. Stool samples will be
      tested using ELISA for the presence of the H. pylori GGT antigen using monoclonal antibodies
      against GGT. Stool samples will also be tested for the presence of H. pylori DNA using PCR
      and Western blot analysis respectively.

      Presence of the GGT antigen in stool will be compared between H. pylori-positive and H.
      pylori-negative patients. Rapid urease test results will be used as the gold standard of H.
      pylori diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the stool antigen test will be
      established.

    <description>Comparison on the presence/absence of GGT antigen in the stool will be compared between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative subjects. Rapid urease test result from the respective patients will be used as the golden standard. Should the GGT antigen in stool samples show promise in distinguishing between H. pylori-infected and uninfected individuals, sensitivity and specificity of the stool antigen test can then be established.</description>
