  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complaints about memory and thinking are common in women as they go through menopause and
      estrogen levels fall. The ovarian hormone estrogen is important for supporting normal
      cognitive function, and changes in brain activity and function occur when estrogen levels are
      decreased. Estrogen is also important for maintaining healthy blood vessels which also
      support normal cognitive function. In Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, there
      is significant damage to the blood vessels in the brain. This study will test whether changes
      in brain activity and function with the loss of estrogen are related to changes in vascular
      function. The investigators will measure vascular function using ultrasound, and brain
      activity using MRI scans in women who are enrolled in the Females, Aging, Metabolism and
      Exercise (FAME) study (NCT01712230). In the FAME study, healthy premenopausal women either
      take a medication to decrease their estrogen levels, or a placebo. This sub-study may provide
      new information about how estrogen affects vascular function and cognitive function, and lead
      to new ways to prevent or delay cognitive impairment or dementia.
