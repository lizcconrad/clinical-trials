    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel combination of
      agents, enzalutamide and everolimus, for the treatment of patients with metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have never received prior chemotherapy, or who have
      previously received docetaxel chemotherapy and have progressive disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I study with an expansion cohort, in patients with
      metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) who are chemotherapy-naive or have
      previously received docetaxel chemotherapy and have progressive disease at the time of study
      entry. The dose escalation phase of this study will establish the optimum daily dose of
      everolimus that can be delivered along with a standard daily dose of enzalutamide to patients
      with metastatic CRPC. Eligible patients must have evaluable (elevated PSA) or measurable
      disease (per RECIST v1.1). Following completion of the dose escalation phase, an additional
      cohort of patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to give preliminary
      information regarding the efficacy of this combination.

             hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] antagonist). Castrate levels of serum testosterone
             must be documented at progression in patients who have not had an orchiectomy.

          4. Chemotherapy-naive or previously treated with docetaxel for metastatic prostate
             cancer.

          5. ECOG of 0 to 2.

          6. Patients must have progressive metastatic prostate cancer by at least 1 of the
             following criteria:

               -  Progression of measurable lesions defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
                  Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

               -  Bone progression defined by 2 or more new lesions on bone scan.

               -  PSA progression is determined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an
                  interval of 1 week or greater between each determination. The screening PSA
                  measurement (documenting progression) must be greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL.

          7. Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens.

          2. Previous treatment with enzalutamide or other investigational androgen receptor
             inhibitors.

          3. Previous treatment with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.

          4. Known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or
             its excipients.

          5. Use of an investigational drug within 21 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter)
             prior to the first dose of study drug. For investigational drugs for which 5
             half-lives is less than 21 days, a minimum of 10 days between termination of the
             investigational drug and administration of study drug is required.

          6. Most recent chemotherapy ≤21 days from first dose of study treatment and/or patient
             did not recover from most recent chemotherapy side effects prior to study entry.

          7. CNS metastases.
