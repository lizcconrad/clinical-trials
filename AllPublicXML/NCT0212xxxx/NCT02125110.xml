  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims at evaluating the consequences of prenatal exposure to neurotoxicants
      (solvents, organophosphate pesticides) on the developing brain, in children aged from 10 to
      12 years.

    <description>Measurement of the fractional anisotropy of the regions of interest on MRI :
- with DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) : DTI can be used to generate quantitative maps of the scalar (anisotropy, based on measurements of FA and mean diffusivity (MD)) or tensor (diffusivity expressed in the form of a 3x3 matrix) type. An intergroup analysis will be carried out to identify regions with FA and MD values different between exposed and non-exposed subjects. Tractography of the fibre bundles in the white matter could also be carried out, based on regions of interest extracted, for example, from high resolution morphometry or functional activation maps. The connectivity between these different regions may also be studied.</description>

    <description>Measurement of the cerebral blood flow and the activation of the regions of interest on MRI with :
BOLD-fMRI (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) : detection of the voxels activated, for each child, during the tasks (motor inhibition (Go / No-Go), attention (Posner's task) and working memory (N-back)) and comparison of levels of brain activation between exposure groups
ASL (Arterial Spin Labeling) : quantitative value for cerebral blood flow</description>
