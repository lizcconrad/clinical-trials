    <textblock>
      This trial addresses a serious and all-too-frequent public health problem, namely early-onset
      disruptive behavior problems in young children. The focus is on testing an online treatment
      program which empowers parents to help their children to improve their mental health and
      behavioral functioning. At the conclusion of the study, the investigators will know whether
      the online-delivered program works as well as an established staff-delivered program, with
      respect to child disruptive behavior problems, parenting, parent/family stress, consumer
      satisfaction, and value analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-prevalence mental health problems require innovative strategies to broaden reach of
      evidence-based services. Disruptive behavior problems (DBPs), or conduct problems, in young
      children represent a major public health challenge that is not only highly prevalent but
      also, left untreated, heighten risk for adverse mental health and developmental outcomes in
      adolescence and adulthood. Internet and online technology has considerable potential to help
      achieve such a goal. Building on parenting interventions that have demonstrated impact on
      childhood DBPs, this clinical trial compares an online-delivered intervention to a
      well-validated staff-delivered intervention, holding program content constant. Both
      interventions are based on the Triple Pâ€”Positive Parenting Program. The sample includes
      families with a 3-7 year old child who has a pronounced level of DBPs. The study makes use of
      a non-inferiority trial design to determine whether the online-delivered intervention yields
      as good outcomes as the well-established staff-delivered intervention with respect to
      childhood DBPs, parenting, and parent/family stress. The study also includes a value analysis
      comparing the two interventions, accounting for provider and participant expenses as well as
      pre-implementation and implementation phases. This study is intended to shed light on the
      impact and potential benefits of a viable online parenting intervention for childhood
      disruptive behavior problems, but the results from this study are also intended to help the
      mental health field to better understand more broadly the potential advantages and
      disadvantages of online interventions over traditionally delivered interventions,
      particularly in light of expense minimization/effectiveness analysis.

    <description>The Online-Delivered Parenting Intervention, which is based on the Triple P--Positive Parenting Program system of interventions, is an interactive website designed to engage and activate the participant through sequenced, personalized, interactive, and video-based content. The intervention emphasizes a self-regulatory process, parent specification of goals, practical and straightforward parenting strategies, modeling, and action activation.</description>

    <description>The Triple P--Positive Parenting Program (Triple P), which has an extensive evidence base, is grounded in a common set of core principles of positive parenting and draws on a broad menu of parenting strategies. A key provision of Triple P is that parents are the decision-makers about program goals and selection/implementation of specific parenting strategies consistent with their preferences and values.</description>
