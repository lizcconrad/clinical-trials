    <textblock>
      The miRNA plays an important regulation role in gene expression, and also closely related to
      bone metabolism. Previous research found that postmenopausal osteoporosis with kidney Yin
      deficiency syndrome (POP) is associated with CLCF1 gene. This project proposed by
      bioinformatics prediction CLCF1 targeted regulation of miRNAs, and use the 3 'UTR dual
      luciferase report system for target validation, aimed at the miRNA levels to explore
      postmenopausal osteoporosis molecular mechanism with kidney Yin deficiency syndrome.
