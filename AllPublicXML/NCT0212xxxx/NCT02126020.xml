  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Boston Keratoprosthesis type I (KPro) is a prosthetic cornea used to treat several causes
      of corneal blindness. Some categories of patients, including those with auto-immune diseases
      such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome and mucous membrane
      pemphigoid, have a higher risk of failure for the KPro. Because of chronic inflammation, the
      cornea supporting the KPro may melt, leading to a higher risk of infection, loss of the KPro
      and loss of the eye.

      Infliximab is an antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha and is used intravenously to
      control inflammation in several diseases. It has been used in some cases of corneal melting
      with significant success.

      This study's hypothesis is that infliximab can be successfully used as an eye drop (instead
      of the usual administration through veins) and that its regular use may prevent melt in eyes
      with a Boston Keratoprosthesis type I and underlying auto-immune disease.

      This is an unmasked, prospective, multicenter clinical trial of four patients that are
      candidates for a Boston Keratoprosthesis or have had prior KPro surgery and have a diagnosis
      of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome (TENS) or mucous
      membrane pemphigoid (MMP). Only one eye per patient will be considered for inclusion.

      This is a phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and tolerance of topical infliximab 10
      mg/mL eye drops. Research subjects will be required to administer infliximab eye drops four
      times per day for three months followed by twice daily administration for nine months. The
      subjects will be monitored while on the study medication as well as for one year following
      discontinuation of the drug. The total study duration for each patient will be two years.
