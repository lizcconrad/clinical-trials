    <textblock>
      This study is divided for development in two complementary work packages justified by the
      need to incorporate new strategies to optimize rehabilitation outcomes in stroke patients.
      The general objectives are: 1) to determine the prevalence of respiratory muscle dysfunction
      in stroke patients; 2) to identify the existence of a potential amino acid marker of
      increased risk of muscle dysfunction after suffering a stroke; 3) to evaluate the
      effectiveness of incorporating the respiratory muscle training as an innovative adjuvant
      therapy in stroke rehabilitation program that may decrease the incidence of morbidity and
      mortality in the medium and long term; and 4) to quantify the potential impact of respiratory
      muscle training on the costs of care for stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It determines a substantial
      socioeconomic burden. Stroke can lead to varying degrees of oropharyngeal dysphagia (25-85%
      of patients) and respiratory muscle dysfunction associated with an increase in medical
      complications such as bronchoaspiration pneumonia, malnutrition and death. The respiratory
      muscle dysfunction is a common functional abnormality in chronic respiratory diseases such as
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, multiple sclerosis in which it
      has been shown to modify the expected survival. Dysphagia is present in a significant
      proportion of patients admitted to Rehabilitation (up to 85% depending on series) in the
      subacute phase of stroke. There is no drug able to restore the swallowing function and
      inspiratory and expiratory muscle function in these patients. Consequently, neurological
      rehabilitation is the mainstay of treatment of these disorders.

      Amino acids (AA) are essential for proper protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle represents the
      largest reserve of body AA, which may be used according to metabolic needs. Within this group
      of compounds, the most involved in muscle metabolism are glutamate, aspartate, asparagine,
      valine, leucine and isoleucine. A pathobiological association between decrease in muscle
      glutamate and diaphragm dysfunction in patients with chronic respiratory diseases has been
      demonstrated in chronic respiratory patients. Moreover, glutamate levels of the diaphragm can
      be restored as a result of muscle training, playing a decisive role as a precursor of certain
      AA (glutamine and alanine), and glutathione in patients with COPD. Other studies have defined
      that glutamine may be a biomarker of training response in healthy individuals. Several
      publications have reflected the decrease of glutamine and glutamate as a result of different
      diseases and in some cases have tried to supplement this deficit.

      Muscle dysfunction is defined as a function impairment (decrease in strength and/or
      resistance) of muscles whose main consequence is muscle fatigue. Although exercise training
      has been used successfully to restore function in patients with some chronic illnesses and
      frailty, there is little evidence of the beneficial effects of an overall muscle training in
      stroke patients. Regarding peripheral muscles, a high-intensity training improves strength
      and endurance of lower limbs muscles (paretic and non paretic) in stroke patients.
      Dysfunction of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles has important clinical
      implications. It associates with susceptibility to hypercapnic ventilatory failure,
      ineffective cough, and even higher incidence of repeated hospital admissions and mortality.
      Therefore, respiratory muscle weakness described in some stroke patients justifies the need
      to train respiratory muscles because there is no general exercise (bicycle, legs, arms) able
      to induce an overload enough to achieve training effect on respiratory muscles.

    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength is assessed through maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP, respectively) using a pressure transducer connected to a digital register system. The MIP is measured at mouth during a maximum effort from residual volume against occluded airway. To determine the MEP, the patients will perform a maximum expiratory effort from total lung capacity (TLC) in the face of the occluded airway. A specific and validated respiratory pressures manometer will be used (Micro RPM, Cardinalhealth, Kent, UK). For the purposes of the study, 'responders' will include the group of patients with an increase of 25% or more in respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP).
Measures will be done once every week</description>

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip strength will be assessed during maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the flexor muscles of the fingers, using a dynamometer (JAMAR, Nottinghamshire, UK). We consider both the non-dominant and dominant hand. Reference values are those from Webb et al. (J Par Ent Nutr 1989, 13:30-3).

    <description>Lower limb strength will be measured during a maximal voluntary isometric knee extension while the patient is sit in a bank of exercise (DOMYOS HG 050, Decathlon, France). An isometric dynamometer Nicholas Manual Muscle Tester (NMMT) (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana) will be used according to Dunn JC (J Phys Ther Ger 2003).

    <description>Analysis of plasma samples (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) will determine levels of glutamine, valine, isoleucine, leucine and glutamate at baseline and at the end of muscle training using the technique previously described and validated (Clin Chem 1988, 34 (12): 2510-3). Venous blood samples will be collected in heparinized tube and centrifuged to obtain plasma. Later proceed to deproteinization with sulfosalicylic acid for analyzing the concentration of amino acids (AA). Finally the sample will be frozen at -80 ยบ C for further analysis.</description>
