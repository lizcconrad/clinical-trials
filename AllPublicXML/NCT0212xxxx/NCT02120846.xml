  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients will be assigned to either a training group (12 wk unilateral knee extension
      flywheel resistance exercise; 4 sets of 7 reps 2 days/week) or a control group. Patients will
      maintain daily routines and any prescribed rehabilitation program. Established methods to
      assess muscle and cognitive function will be employed before and after the intervention.

      This project will disclose whether an exercise paradigm, known to improve muscle function and
      increase muscle volume in healthy populations, will induce similar adaptations in chronic
      stroke patients. More importantly, this study will elucidate if any impairment in cognitive
      function caused by stroke, can be reversed with this particular resistance exercise regimen.

      The information gained from this project will have significant implications and aid in
      advancing rehabilitation programs and exercise prescriptions for men and women suffering from
      stroke. The overall objective of this research is to promote independence and hence quality
      of life in these patients.

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed before and after the training period in all participants. In a 60-90 min session, with 10 min of rest is needed, validated tests will be used to evaluate different domains of cognitive function: Speed of information processing; Short- and long-term memory; Attention; Language; Learning; Delayed recall; Working memory; Inhibition; Visuo-motor scanning; Dual task attention; Quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants from the resistance exercise group will perform a 12-wk unilateral flywheel resistance training program with the paretic limb. Four sets of seven coupled concentric and eccentric actions will be completed in the leg press device using flywheel technology twice weekly. Power in each set and repetition will be measured. During all training sessions, subjects will receive visual real-time feedback of power and force produced during each concentric-eccentric action.</description>
