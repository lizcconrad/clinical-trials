  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By 2020, it is estimated that 3.7 million Canadians will have diabetes mellitus, with type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) accounting for more than 90% of cases. Estimates of the prevalence of
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy among adults with T2DM range from 26% to 47%. It increases
      with patient age and duration of disease and it can be as high as 60 to 70% in older cohorts.
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is documented in most studies as numbness, tingling, pain
      and/or objective sensory changes. Pain is an early manifestation of neuropathy and may be the
      presenting symptom of diabetes. Even the best medications and procedures rarely relieve more
      than 30% of the discomfort of chronic painful conditions. Diabetic patients continue to
      experience debilitating and disabling pain. Pain affects our ability to work, our ability to
      participate in recreational activities, our mood and our relationships. It is
      well-established that an interdisciplinary approach is key to the treatment of some types of
      chronic pain, but little research has been done on the effectiveness of interdisciplinary
      treatments for patients suffering from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The
      investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary approach combining
      medical treatment and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to reduce disability and
      improve quality of life among patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The
      investigators will also evaluate the impact of the program on psychological distress, pain
      cognitions, and biomarkers of stress and glycemic function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 110 adults with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. All
      will have their medical treatment optimized by a pain medicine specialist before being
      randomly assigned to either an 8-week group MBSR program or a wait-list. All participants
      will complete self-report questionnaires, provide a hair sample for cortisol measurements and
      a blood sample to measure glycemic index. We will be collecting outcome data for both groups.
      Patients randomized to MBSR will have data collected at 4 time points: 1) before medical
      optimization; 2) after medical optimization and before the MBSR group intervention begins, 3)
      2 weeks after the group intervention; and 4) 3 months following completion of MBSR. Patients
      randomized to control will have data collected at 6-7 time points depending on when are
      participants enrolled in the trial: 1) before medical optimization; 2) after medical
      optimization and before the MBSR group intervention begins; 3) 2 weeks after the group
      intervention; 4) 3 months following completion of MBSR; 5) Re-test before control group
      intervention begins; 6) 2 weeks after control group intervention; and 7) 3 months after
      control group intervention.

      The primary hypothesis is that after all patients are medically optimized, those randomized
      to MBSR will have a 30% higher incidence of clinically significant (≥1.0 decrease in mean BPI
      interference score) improvement (responders) compared to controls measured 3 months following
      completion of MBSR. A significant change is defined as ≥ 1 decrease in BPI interference
      score. A one point change on the Interference Scale, has been recommended by the Initiative
      on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group as a
      minimally clinically important change. This design controls for the effect of time and
      disease fluctuation, regression to the mean, and the effect of testing. In this preliminary
      research, where our primary goal is to establish proof of concept and obtain data needed to
      plan a comparative trial, we are not controlling for the placebo effect. We believe that a
      wait-list controlled study is the necessary foundation on which to build a rigorous program
      of research.

    <measure>Change from baseline in pain-related disability, as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory. Pain interference scale at 3-month post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is pain-related disability, as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory pain interference scale which consists of 7 numerical scales (0 to10) rating pain interference with general activity, mood, walking ability, work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pain severity, as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory - Pain Severity scale, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Severity will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - Pain Severity. The BPI consists of 4 numerical scales (0 to 10) rating pain severity at its worst, at its least, on average, and at the time of filling out the measure. Each severity question is analyzed individually.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mood states, as measured by the Profile of Mood States scale, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS-2A) will be used to measure mood disturbance. Participants are asked to rate 65 adjectives using a 5-point likert scale (0= not at all, to 4 = extremely) based on how they have been feeling during the past week, including the day they are filling out the questionnaire. A total mood disturbance score is calculated, as well as scores for 6 subscales: depression, tension-anxiety,anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue, confusion-bewilderment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall change in status from baseline, as measured by Patient Global Impression of Change scale, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The participants perceived degree of change in overall status will be measured using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale. The PGIC uses a 7-point likert scale (very much worse, to very much better) to measure how much the participant feels their overall status has changed since the start of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) will be used to measure the participants' perceived stress levels. The PSS uses a 5-point likert scale (0=Never, to 4=Very often) to measure the degree of stress a participant has experienced over the past month. A total perceived stress score is obtained by reversing the scores on items 4, 5, 7, and 8, and then summing across all 10 items. Higher scores indicate higher perceived stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 scale, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) is a 9-item scale used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks and is based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM- V) diagnostic criteria for major depression. Total scores range from 0 to 27, and clinical cut-points correspond to mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pain catastrophizing, as measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a 13-item instrument which will evaluate the degree to which patients have negative self-statements and catastrophizing thoughts and ideations when in pain. The PCS uses a 5-point likert scale (0=not at all, 4=all the time) and consists of three subscales (rumination, magnification, helplessness).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mindfulness, as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness will be measured using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The FFMQ is a 39-item instrument measuring five aspects of mindfulness: Non-reactivity to inner experience, observing, describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging of experience. Participants are asked to use a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = never or rarely true 5 = very often or always true) to rate how true of them they believe each statement to be.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in quality of life, as measured by the Short-Form-12 Health Survey, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured by the Short-Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12v.2). The SF-12v2 is a brief, twelve-item self-report measure based on the Short-Form-36. It includes items assessing eight health domains, such as bodily pain, social functioning, role limitations due to physical health, and general health perceptions. Two summary scores, the physical composite scale (PCS) and mental composite scale (MCS) are computed based on the 12 items. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in quality of life, as measured by the Neuropathy-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (NeuroQOL).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The NeuroQoL was designed for and validated in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and it captures the key dimensions of the patient's experience. Factor analysis revealed 3 physical symptom measures and 2 psychosocial functioning measures with good reliability (α = 0.86 - 0.95). This instrument was more strongly associated with severity of DPN than the SF-12 and more fully mediated the relationship between DPN and overall quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in quality of health and life, as measured by the The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SDSCA is an 11-item self-report measure used to assess the diet, exercise, smoking, blood glucose testing and footcare habits of patients with diabetes. The scale has been found to be valid with moderate test-retest reliability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in adverse reactions as a result of their glycemic control, as measured by the Blood Sugar Reactions Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>These 5 questions were developed using the &quot;Diabetes Care Profile&quot; from the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Centre as a guide.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from pre-intervention in biomarkers of stress, as measured by hair cortisol levels, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol is a useful biomarker of stress levels. One cm hair samples will allow us to collect data on cortisol exposure over the past month. Hair cortisol will allow us to explore the relationship between systemic exposure to a potential mediator of the interaction between pain, stress, and glucose control in patients with diabetes. This novel aspect of the present proposal may help validate an important biomarker for investigating the neuro-endocrine correlates of chronic pain.</description>
