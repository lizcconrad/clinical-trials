  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is learn if Revlimid® (lenalidomide) can help to
      keep acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in remission. The safety of this drug will also be
      studied.

      This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM). Its use in
      patients with high risk AML that is in remission is investigational.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. All will take part at MD
      Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take lenalidomide by
      mouth with water 1 time a day during each 28-day cycle. If your doctor thinks it is needed,
      the amount of lenalidomide you take while on study may be increased.

      Study Visits:

      Every month for the first 3 months, then every 3 months until Month 12, then every 6 months
      after that, you will have a physical exam.

      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1-2 times every week during Cycle
      1, then every 2-4 weeks during Cycles 2-6, then every 4 weeks after that.

      After cycle 1, after 3 months of therapy, then every 3 months until Cycle 12, and then every
      6 months after that, you will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the
      disease. This may be performed at other times if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      As part of the study, you will be enrolled on a special program called REMS that will inform
      you about the risks of lenalidomide and pregnancy. As part of this program, you will be
      required to have regular pregnancy tests if you are a female who is able to have children.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 24 cycles as long as the doctor thinks it is
      in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients aged 18 to 55 years with high risk (as defined in #2) AML who have achieved
             their FIRST CR or CRi within 12 months of enrollment and are not immediately
             candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplant. Patients above age 55 who are not
             eligible for other protocols may be considered for enrollment on a case by case basis
             after discussion with the PI.
