    <description>Asthma exacerbations are considered to be moderate if treatment with rescue systemic corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 3 days as outpatient or less than or equal to 24 hour emergency room visit was required. Asthma exacerbations are considered severe if treatment with rescue systemic corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 3 days and hospitalization or emergency department visit greater than 24 hours were required or death due to asthma.

    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) Overall Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms will be evaluated by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7). The ACQ has six questions to be answered by the patient, each with a 7 point scale (0-good control, 6-poor control), and one item where the actual pre-bronchodilator FEV1 value expressed in % of predicted FEV1.

    <description>There are 32 questions in the AQLQ and they are in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental exposure). Each question will be answered on a 7 point scale (1-totally limited/problems all the time, 7-not at all limited/no problems). The overall AQLQ score is the mean of all 32 responses, and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains (a minimum domain / overall score of 1 = Severely impaired whereas a maximum domain / overall score of 7 = not impaired at all). A positive change from baseline score indicates improvement.</description>
