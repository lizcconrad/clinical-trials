  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is two-fold: (1) to determine the feasibility of recruiting rural
      African American (AA) adults in South Carolina (SC) for assessing the usefulness of
      tablet-based resources in good diabetes self-management behaviors, and (2) to test a
      tablet-aided intervention for improving diabetes self-management behaviors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the feasibility of recruitment of African American adults
      residing in rural South Carolina who will assist with improving the usability of tablet
      computers. In addition, we will implement a pilot trial of the TABLETS (Tablet-Aided
      BehavioraL intervention Effect on Self-management skills) intervention for diabetes, using
      motivational strategies, among rural African Americans. The proposed project is designed to
      address 3 important issues: recruitment for a hard-to-reach population, utility of
      technology-enabled intervention, and development of a tablet-aided intervention tailored to
      understand best practices for diabetes self-management

    <description>Apart from study visits, individuals randomized to the Usual Care group will receive usual care for diabetes management as provided by their primary care physician. The provider will be responsible for determining changes in the treatment regimen and determining the timing of follow-up visits for diabetes care. Between scheduled office encounters, contact will be initiated by the individual.</description>

    <description>The TABLET intervention adds a novel tablet-based delivery mechanism to provide real-time videoconferencing education about diabetes self-management behaviors to high-risk, low-income African American (AA) adults with diabetes. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) knowledge/ information modules consist of materials developed from a CVD patient education booklet adapted from Maine Heart Center of Maine Health and supplemented by clinical guidelines to specifically address behavioral risk factors. Motivation/behavioral skills training modules consist of patient activation (asking questions to providers), patient empowerment (CVD responsibility contracts, flow charts for lab results), and behavioral skills training (self-monitoring, goal-setting).</description>
