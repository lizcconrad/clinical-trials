  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established in studies across several countries that tobacco smoking is more
      prevalent among depressed patients than the general population. Electronic cigarettes are
      becoming increasingly popular with smokers worldwide. To date there are no large randomized
      trials of electronic cigarettes in depressed smokers. A well-designed trial is needed to
      compare efficacy and safety of these products in this special population.

      We have designed a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of
      electronic cigarette. The trial will take the form of a prospective 12-month randomized
      clinical study to evaluate smoking reduction, smoking abstinence and adverse events in
      depressed smokers not intending to quit. We will also monitor quality of life, neurocognitive
      functioning and measure participants' perception and satisfaction of the product.

      Outcome measures: A ≥50% reduction in the number of cigarettes/day from baseline, will be
      calculated at each study visit (&quot;reducers&quot;). Abstinence from smoking will be calculated at
      each study visit (&quot;quitters&quot;). Smokers who leave the study protocol before its completion and
      will carry out the Early Termination Visit or who will not satisfy the criteria of &quot;reducers&quot;
      and &quot;quitters&quot; will be defined &quot;non responders&quot;.

    <description>Quality of life, Neurocognitive Functioning and Psychopathological status will be reassessed by Quality of Life Scale (QLS), Repeatable Battery for the assessment of Neuropsychological Study (RBANS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively.
Participants' perception and liking of the product will be assessed by asking to rate their level of satisfaction with the products compared to their own cigarettes using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 points (0 = being 'completely unsatisfied', 10 being = 'fully satisfied'); using the same scale, they will also rate how much they miss their own brand (0 = being 'did not miss it at all', 10 being = 'missed too much') and whether they would recommend it to a friend/relative (0 = being 'not recommended at all', 10 being = 'absolutely recommended').</description>
