  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although lysosomal storage disorders, such as Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Pompe
      disease, represent serious challenges in the healthcare system, no study has yet investigated
      the prevalence of these diseases in the US. Frequently, patients show progressive worsening
      of symptoms for several years before they get diagnosed. Since many of these diseases can be
      managed therapeutically, it is important to identify and treat patients in order to avoid
      organ damage. The investigators aim to undertake a screening study that identifies
      undiagnosed patients with lysosomal storage disorders and determine the prevalence of these
      diseases with special focus on underrepresented minority groups.
