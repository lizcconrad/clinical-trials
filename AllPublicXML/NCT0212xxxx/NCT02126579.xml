  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what effects (good and bad) an experimental vaccine
      (LPV7) plus tetanus peptide and other substances called polyICLC, resiquimod, and Montanide
      ISA-51 have on you and your melanoma. We will also look at whether the experimental vaccine
      and these drugs cause any changes in your immune system.
