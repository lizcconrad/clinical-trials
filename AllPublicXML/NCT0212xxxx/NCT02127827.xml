  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin replacement therapy is absolutely required for patients with Type 1 diabetes. The
      insulin pump provides for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), which can
      approximate the insulin release patterns of the normal pancreas. Timely and accurate
      knowledge of ambient glucose levels is important for insulin dose adjustments. Typically,
      glucose values are measured volitionally, several times a day, using capillary &quot;fingerstick&quot;
      samples. In addition, glucose in the interstitial fluid can be measured automatically and
      continuously using implantable glucose oxidase-based sensors. Recent study showed that this
      continuous measurement of glucose levels allows for a fully automated &quot;closed-loop&quot; insulin
      replacement therapy which requires an algorithm that receives glucose data, calculates an
      appropriate insulin dose, and directs the pump to deliver the insulin dose.The need for
      development of a closed-loop insulin replacement system that integrates insulin delivery,
      glucose measurement, and control subsystems will present several challenges to biomedical
      engineers.

          2. Subject's weight is between 50 and 120 kg

          3. A clinical diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes as determined by the Investigator for a
             minimum of 36 months prior to enrollment

          4. Subject has ongoing use of an insulin pump ≥ 6 months prior to screening

          5. Subject has an glycated hemoglobin value ≤ 9.0% demonstrated at the time of
             enrollment.

          6. Subject uses a rapid-acting analogue insulin in his/her pump

          7. Patient is willing to undergo all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subject who has a positive serum pregnancy screening test, or who plans to
             become pregnant during the course of the study

          2. Subject has unresolved adverse skin condition, or unable to tolerate tape adhesive, in
             the area of sensor placement or device replacement (e.g., psoriasis, rash,
             Staphylococcus infection)

          3. Subject has a history of hypoglycemic seizure or hypoglycemic coma within the past 12
             months

          4. Subject has a history of seizure disorder unrelated to diabetes within the past 12
