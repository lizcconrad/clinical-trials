  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neuropathic pain is a common problem for breast cancer survivors. Even with the best
      medical treatment, some survivors continue to experience disabling pain. It is
      well-established that an interdisciplinary approach is key to the treatment of some types of
      chronic pain, but little research has been done on the effectiveness of interdisciplinary
      treatments for cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain. The investigators will
      evaluate the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary approach combining medical treatment and
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to reduce disability and improve quality of life
      among breast cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain. The investigators will also
      evaluate the impact of the program on psychological distress, pain cognitions, biomarkers of
      stress and immune function, cognitive function, as well as brain structure and function.

      The investigators will recruit 108 adult women survivors of breast cancer living with chronic
      neuropathic pain. All will have their medical treatment optimized by a pain medicine
      specialist before being randomly assigned to either an 8-week group MBSR program or a
      wait-list. All participants will complete self-report questionnaires, provide a hair sample
      for cortisol measurements and a blood sample to measure several markers of immune function at
      four different time points: before medical treatment, after medical treatment and before
      randomization to MBSR or waiting, after the completion of MBSR as well as at 3-month
      follow-up. A sub-sample will complete a series of tasks while undergoing functional magnetic
      resonance imaging before and after participation in MBSR.

      The primary outcome is pain interference. The investigators will compare the proportion of
      participants who report reduced pain-related disability, as measured by the Brief Pain
      Inventory-Interference Scale, in each group. The primary hypothesis is that at 3-month
      follow-up, there will be at least 30% more responders (≥1.0 decrease in mean Brief Pain
      Inventory Interference score) in the interdisciplinary program in comparison to medical
      treatment alone.

    <measure>Change from baseline in neuropathic pain intensity, as measured by the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropathic pain intensity will be measured using the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), a self-report questionnaire that consists of 10 pain descriptors and two temporal items. Responses are rated on a numerical scale (0-10) and a total intensity score is calculated. Five sub-scores are also derived: spontaneous burning pain, spontaneous pressing pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain and paresthesia/dysesthesia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pain severity, as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory - Pain Severity scale, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Severity will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - Pain Severity. The BPI consists of 4 numerical scales (0 to 10) rating pain severity at its worst, at its least, on average, and at the time of filling out the measure. Each severity question is analyzed individually.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mood states, as measured by the Profile of Mood States scale, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS-2A) will be used to measure mood disturbance. Participants are asked to rate 65 adjectives using a 5-point likert scale ( 0= not at all, to 4 = extremely) based on how they have been feeling during the past week, including the day they are filling out the questionnaire. A total mood disturbance score is calculated, as well as scores for 6 subscales: depression, tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue, confusion-bewilderment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall change in status from baseline, as measured by Patient Global Impression of Change scale, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The participants' perceived degree of change in overall status will be measured using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale. The PGIC uses a 7-point likert scale (very much worse, to very much better) to measure how much the participant feels their overall status has changed since the start of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) will be used to measure the participants' perceived stress levels. The PSS uses a 5-point likert scale (0=Never, to 4=Very often) to measure the degree of stress a participant has experienced over the past month. A total perceived stress score is obtained by reversing the scores on items 4, 5, 7, and 8, and then summing across all 10 items. Higher scores indicate higher perceived stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 scale, at 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) is a 9-item scale used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks and is based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for major depression. Total scores range from 0 to 27, and clinical cut-points correspond to mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pain catastrophizing, as measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a 13-item instrument which will evaluate the degree to which patients have negative self-statements and catastrophizing thoughts and ideations when in pain. The PCS uses a 5-point likert scale (0=not at all, 4=all the time) and consists of three subscales (rumination, magnification, helplessness).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mindfulness, as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness will be measured using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The FFMQ is a 39-item instrument measuring five aspects of mindfulness: Non-reactivity to inner experience, observing, describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging of experience. Participants are asked to use a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = never or rarely true; 5 = very often or always true) to rate how true of them they believe each statement to be.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in quality of life, as measured by the Short-Form-12 Health Survey, at 3 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured by the Short-Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12v.2). The SF-12v2 is a brief, twelve-item self-report measure based on the Short-Form-36. It includes items assessing eight health domains, such as bodily pain, social functioning, role limitations due to physical health, and general health perceptions. Two summary scores, the physical composite scale (PCS) and mental composite scale (MCS) are computed based on the 12 items. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>
