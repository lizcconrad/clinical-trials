  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of 50 postpartum women interested in having the Mirena® LNG-IUS placed for
      contraception. The Mirena® is an FDA approved intrauterine contraceptive device that provides
      contraception for 5 years with excellent effectiveness. Women enrolled in this study will
      only have the Mirena® placed at two-weeks postpartum (day 14-20 postpartum). The participants
      will be followed at 6-weeks and 6-months postpartum for study visits to evaluate for
      satisfaction, symptoms, expulsion, and perforation. The study will be completed at six-months
      postpartum, and participants will be able to keep their LNG-IUS following study completion.
