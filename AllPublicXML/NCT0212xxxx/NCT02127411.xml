  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BZD) are the most prescribed psychiatric drugs in Brazil, especially for
      women. Although it is recommended that the use of BZD is not greater than four weeks, there
      are many cases of prolonged use due to the lack of treatment options for dealing with
      complaints of insomnia. Given this, the aim of this project is to evaluate the program
      Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) for adult women with chronic use of
      benzodiazepine (BZD) to induce sleep. Specifically aims to evaluate if the MBRP program, can
      reduce the pattern of use and level of dependence of chronic users of BZD under gradual
      reduction (tapering) or cessation of the use of BZD. This study will be conducted at the Drug
      Dependency Unit (UDED) of the Department of Psychobiology of Federal University of São Paulo.
      The study will count with two groups: intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) (that
      will stay in the waitlist until the eighth month . The sample will comprise 100 women with
      chronic use of BZD as hypnotics, 50 will be randomized in the IG condition and 50 in the CG
      condition. Changes will be evaluated on several variables such as cessation and dependence of
      BZD, quality of life, sleep, anxiety, depression and sexual satisfaction before and after the
      intervention in both groups. The data will be submitted to descriptive and inferential
      bivariate and multivariate statistic analyzes. It is hoped that this study create subsidies
      for the development of complementary interventions for the management of withdrawal symptoms
      in chronic users of BZD.

    <measure>reduction of benzodiazepine use</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in benzodiazepine use at 8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate the reduction through a percentual comparison between the dose the patient is using at follow-up assessments and the dose related at the beginning of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of insomnia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in insomnia severity at 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will evluate the severity os insomnia with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) which is a self-report questionnaire and consists of seven items that evaluate severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakening problems; sleep dissatisfaction; interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning; noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by sleep difficulties. The score for each item ranges from 0 to 4, totaling 0 to 28 points, with a higher score indicating greater insomnia severity.</description>

    <measure>Stage of change related to benzodiazepine use</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline of the stage of change at 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by an analogic rule from 1 to 10, in which 1 means &quot;not ready to change&quot; and 10 means &quot;actively working in the change&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>self report mindfulness level</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in mindfulness level from baseline at 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured with the self report questionnaires: Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. This is a self-report questionnaire and do not have a specific metric to measure mindfulness. The scores are absolute and a higher score denotes higher levels of mindfulness</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Benzodiazepine dependence (from mild to severe)</measure>
    <time_frame>change in benzodiazepine dependence severity from baseline at 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>this will be measured through the Benzodiazepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire, which is a self report questionnaire and do not provides a specific metric to measure the severity of dependence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in symptoms of depression from baseline at 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The symptoms of depression will be measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale - CES-D. As it is a self report scale, there is no specific metric to measure depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in sleep quality from baseline at 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</description>

    <measure>Epigenetic modifications</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Blood collection will be held, and the plasma will be analyzed to evaluate levels of homocysteine and cysteine , two aminoacids that are related to epigenetic modifications that can modulate the behavioral responses resulting from the practice of meditation</description>

    <measure>Trait Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4 6 and 8 months follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated using the State and Trait Anxiety Index (STAI), validated in Brazil (α = 0.87). We used only the subscale of trait anxiety, less susceptible to environmental alterations. This subscale is composed by 20 items on a four-point Likert scale (&quot;almost never&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;almost always&quot;), in which the participant is instructed to answer &quot;how do you usually feel&quot;. The Cronbach α in this sample was 0.90.</description>
