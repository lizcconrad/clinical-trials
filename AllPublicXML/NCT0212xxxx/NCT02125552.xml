  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether the use of ultrasound guidance compared to
      standard IV access improves the proportion of successful IV placement on a first attempt for
      children in a pediatric emergency department who have predicted difficult access by a
      validated score. Secondary objectives include determining whether ultrasound-guided IV access
      lowers the overall number of IV attempts and/or reduces time to IV access. The investigators
      will also examine the duration of IV access and any complications related to IV access in
      both the traditional and ultrasound guided IV access group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized trial of ultrasound guided IV access compared to
      traditional IV access in patients determined to have difficult IV access based on the
      Difficult Intravenous Access (DIVA) scale. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized
      to traditional IV access or ultrasound guided IV access. If randomized to ultrasound guided
      IV access, the IV will be placed under direct visualization. Following IV placement or when
      attempts at IV access have ceased, the patient and family will be asked to complete a series
      of questions related to their satisfaction regarding IV placement. The follow-up phase
      examining duration of the IV and any related complications will continue until the IV placed
      as part of the study has been removed.
