      The work will evaluate the metabolic costs for daily activities across the lifespan and
      evaluate the influence of having functional impairments. The project will simultaneously
      conduct a cross-sectional and a case-control study. The primary aim will investigate
      cross-sectional association between older age and the energy expenditure of daily activities
      by recruiting approximately 25 adults in each of 7 age groups
      (20-30,30-40,40-50,50-60,60-70,70-80,80+) for a total of 180 individuals. A secondary aim
      will investigate the effect of functional impairments on the energy expenditure of daily
      activities by conducting a case-control study. An additional 25 older adults with functional
      impairment will be recruited in each age decade (60-70, 70-80, and 80+ years old) to
      accomplish this aim. Additional outcomes will evaluate rating of perceived exertion
      differences in daily activities. A tertiary aim will investigate using accelerometers to
      predict the metabolic costs of daily activities.

          -  Failure to provide informed consent

          -  A 10% enrollment limit will be applied to avid exercisers in each age decade. Avid
             exercises will be defined as doing structured exercise 3 or more days per week (e.g.
             jogging, sports etc., walkers will be permitted in the study). Based on our
             experience, avid exercisers volunteer for this type of research at a high rate and
             thus the investigators will limit these individuals to prevent a biased comparison
