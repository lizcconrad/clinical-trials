  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a pharmaceutical consultation
      at the time of hospital discharge on the adherence of patients ; non-adherence is determined
      by the following criteria:

      As concerns prescribed anti-infectious treatments, at least one of the following 4 criteria
      is true:

        1. . the patient did not go and get his/her treatment at the pharmacy;

        2. . the number of treatment units dispensed by the pharmacy is &lt; the number of treatment
           units prescribed;

        3. . the patient stopped taking a treatment before the recommended time, or continued
           taking a treatment after the recommended time;

        4. . the number of treatment units taken by the patient (self-declaration) is &lt; or &gt; to the
           number of units prescribed.

      The secondary objectives of this study are :

      A- To assess the percentage of patients who obtained their anti- infective pharmaceuticals

      B- To evaluate the ratio of the number of units of anti- infective drugs dispensed by the
      pharmacy over the number of units of anti- infective drugs prescribed

      C- To determine the ratio of the number of premature discontinuations of anti -infective
      treatments over the number of lines of anti -infective treatments prescribed

      D- Evaluate the ratio of the number of units actually taken by the patient (based on a
      self-declaration) over the number of units of anti- infective drugs prescribed

      E- To measure the comprehension concerning anti- infective treatments after returning home
      (based on a quiz)

      F- To determine the risk factors for non- adherence to anti- infective therapy based on the
      characteristics of the study population

      G- Assess patient satisfaction concerning a pharmaceutical consultation at hospital discharge
      (questionnaire)

      H- Assess the impact of a pharmaceutical consultation on primary non-adherence (criteria 1
      and 2) and secondary non- adherence (criteria 3 and 4)
