      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a manualized psychotherapeutic intervention
      that is a combination of mindfulness techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy. MBCT-C,
      which is mindfulness based cognitive based therapy for children, involves weekly group
      sessions, home practice, and the core curriculum of formal mindfulness practices (e.g. body
      scan, sitting, movement and walking meditations). Group sessions will involve guided
      meditation practices, instructor-led discussion of experiences and psychoeducation. By
      fopstering the ability to pay close attention to thoughts, emotions and body sensations,
      participants learn to make better choices to deal with stress, anxiety, depression, pain and
      other challenges. This can allow them to more effectively use the principles of cognitive
      behavioral therapy.

      Twelve children aged 10-17 with mood dysregulation and a bipolar parent will be in the study
      for 12 weeks. There will be two groups receiving intervention: one group recruited from the
      community and one group recruited from a known high-risk cohort.

    <description>We will examine baseline to endpoint changes in task related VLPFC, amygdala, and insula activation. We will examine associations among changes in activation in these brain regions and changes in mood regulation rating scale scores.Additionally, we will examine changes in seed-based resting state connectivity measures using amygdala and insula as the seeds and examining connectivity with VLPFC regions. Finally, we will use correlation to assess associations among changes in resting state connectivity of these regions and changes in mindfulness measures.</description>
