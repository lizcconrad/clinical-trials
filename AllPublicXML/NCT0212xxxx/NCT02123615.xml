  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASIS Corporation (ASIS) has developed the only automatic injection system for delivery of
      injectable products to it's optimum/right spot, just outside of the fascia, which exists
      subdermally (between the skin and muscle). Bloodless basically implies longer lasting
      medicinal effects, and minimal side effects - advantages that reflect the NIH mission of
      enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing the burdens of illness and disability. ASIS
      device is stabilized on the surface of the skin with negative pressure and emits an
      electrical current to create a bloodless cavity subdermally. ASIS device correctly,
      automatically, and consistently delivers therapeutic agents, yet requiring little skill of a
      practitioner - providing the steady and safe infusion into subdermal bloodless space of
      virtually any injectable product in addition to Botox, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID, Enbrel,
      Insulin, and Fillers, etc. According to the FDA, &quot;This innovation will have major impact on
      the healthcare industry.&quot;

      Aim 1 would require 6 months, to demonstrate ASIS device's consistent performance on 60
      subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency (PI), and the particular skin affected by this
      disease.

      30 subjects will receive Gadolinium subcutaneously, and 30 subjects will receive Gadolinium
      subdermally with ASIS device. An MRI will be taken promptly after Gadolinium injection, as
      starting reference, to which subsequent MRI taken at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs later will be
      compared for Persistent %. Since there isn't a way to measure level of Gadolinium within it,
      or any other (e.g.

      GAMMAGARD) for that matter, at least the Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by
      the greater or longer Persistent % on MRI. However, this approximation can only work if the
      variables are minimized to the same population with Primary Immunodeficiency (PI), and the
      particular skin affected by it. Case in point, Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) patients are
      prone to infection, and tend to have scared skin with less vascularity, so expectantly will
      have prolonged Gadolinium subcutaneously Persistent %, which will be very different from the
      skin of normal patients, while the Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % may or may not change.
      Therefore, the Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over
      that of total Persistent % subcutaneously, will be different and very specific for the
      particular skin affected by Primary Immunodeficiency. However, they are valuable indicators
      that will help us modify the GAMMAGARD dosage and duration to inject into that &quot;unknown&quot;
      subdermal space for Aim 2.

      Aim 2 would require 12 months, using GAMMAGARD, instead of Gadolinium, to demonstrate the
      advantages of ASIS device subdermally over subcutaneously, for the same Primary
      Immunodeficiency subjects. Of course that Relative Prolongation Ability Score in Aim1 will be
      valuable, but it isn't absolutely required to start Aim 2, because GAMMAGARD's
      Pharmacokinetics will be studied anyway, by following Peak and Trough levels of
      immunoglobulin G.

      However, the Pharmacokinetics of subdermally injected GAMMAGARD will be just dependent on
      GAMMAGARD's diffusion out of that subdermal bloodless space; therefore, if GAMMAGARD getting
      into the bloodstream becomes so severely inhibited, then we can just change the osmolality of
      GAMMAGARD in the end. The therapeutic advantages of GAMMAGARD with ASIS device subdermally
      over subcutaneously will also be studied by comparing the reduction of Validated Acute
      Serious Bacterial Infections, adverse reactions, and injection site pain.

    <description>Gadolinium will be injected with ASIS subdermally (30) or conventional subcutaneous (30) for 60 adult subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency. The first MRI taken promptly after Gadolinium injection for each patient would be his or her reference of 100% Persistent, to which his or her subsequent MRI taken @ 6 hr, @ 12 hr, and @24hr later will be compared for Persistent %. This approximation can only work if the variables are minimized to the same population with Primary Immunodeficiency. The Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent % subcutaneously, in Primary Immunodeficiency will be very valuable indicators for us to modify the GAMMAGARD dosage and duration for testing with that &quot;unknown&quot; subdermal bloodless space in Aim 2.</description>
