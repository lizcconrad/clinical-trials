    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define whether 6 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can lead
      to a higher rate of complete cytoreductive surgery compared with 3 courses of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to define whether 6 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can lead to a higher rate of complete cytoreductive surgery compared with 3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with bulky stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with grade 3-5 perioperative toxicity (according to CTCAE), as a measure of safety</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a lower rate of perioperative grade 3-5 toxicities. The surgical adverse events are defined as:
intraoperative, which occur during surgical procedure
perioperative , which occur from day 1 to day 7 after surgery
postoperative, which occur from day 8 to 30 days after surgery
Adverse events list for surgical procedures:
Postoperative death (&lt;30 days); Hemorrhage/bleeding intraoperative or postoperative requiring at least transfusion of 2 units of non-autologous red blood cells; Vascular events: thrombosis/embolism, disabling or life-threatening vessel injury-artery or vein, symptomatic or life-threatening visceral arterial ischemia; Infections requiring IV antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral interventions or at risk for life-threatening consequences; Gastrointestinal fistula; Urinary fistula; Lymphocele, requiring medical or operative intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with pathological complete response</measure>
    <time_frame>after surgery, up to 1 month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with higher rate of pathological complete response.
Complete pathological response is defined as the absence of cancer cells in surgical specimens, and very good partial remission is defined as the persistence of only small clusters (&lt; 1 cm) or individual cancer cells and no macroscopic residual after surgery. Partial pathological remission is defined as a tumor burden reduction between 30 and 90% at surgery, while stable disease is defined as no tumour burden reduction or reduction lower than 30% at surgery, compared with initial diagnostic laparoscopy. Only patients with complete and very good partial remissions are considered as pathological responders, while all the other cases are considered as pathological non-responders.</description>
