  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of breast cancer has traditionally been based on the primary tumour's features in
      the breast. Only recently, when cancer returns at other sites, has there been an attempt to
      biopsy the metastatic disease and change treatments accordingly. A 'repeat biopsy' can be
      technically difficult, painful and, when possible, only represents a small sample of one of
      many metastases.

      Even when one deposit responds to a new treatment, a neighbouring one may continue to grow.
      There is an urgent need to characterise all deposits, particularly the lethal ones which
      progress despite all treatments.

      This study will enable the comprehensive analysis of the metastatic process and the evolution
      of the breast cancer through the course of its treatment. Patients who have consented during
      life to donate their tissues for molecular analysis will provide the means for such an
      analysis.

      Main aims:

        -  To comprehensively and systematically examine metastatic breast cancer by its detailed
           exploratory molecular characterization to elucidate the possible inter- and
           intratumoural heterogeneity between the primary tumour and the majority of metastatic
           sites.

        -  To map the natural history of the metastatic breast cancer process
