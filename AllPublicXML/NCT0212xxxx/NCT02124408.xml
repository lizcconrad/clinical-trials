      With the development of economy and change of lifestyles, it is characterized that there is a
      dramatic increase of diabetes in China. Changes in lifestyle/self-care behaviors by diabetes
      patients are required to improve blood glucose and subsequent outcomes. Mobile phone
      intervention was a kind of high cost efficiency and high quality health care. Our study
      evaluated a diabetes coaching system, using mobile phones and patient/provider portals for
      patient-specific treatment and communication.
