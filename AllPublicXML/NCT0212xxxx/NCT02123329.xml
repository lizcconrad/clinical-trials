  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty seven percent of adult male population smoke cigarettes in Qatar. The Global Youth
      Tobacco Survey also stated that 13.4% of male school students aged 13 to 15 years in Qatar
      smoke cigarettes. Smoking cessation is a key to reducing smoking related diseases and deaths.
      Health care providers are in an ideal position to encourage smoking cessation. Pharmacists
      are the most accessible health care providers and are uniquely situated to initiate behavior
      change among patients. Many western studies have shown that pharmacists can be successful in
      helping patients quit smoking. Studies demonstrating the effectiveness of pharmacist
      delivered smoking cessation programs are lacking in Qatar. This proposal aims to test the
      effect of a structured smoking cessation program delivered by trained ambulatory pharmacists
      in Qatar. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted at 8 ambulatory
      pharmacies in Qatar. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a 4-session
      face-to-face structured patient-specific smoking cessation program conducted by the
      pharmacist or 5 to 10 minutes of unstructured brief smoking cessation advice given by the
      pharmacist. Both groups will be offered nicotine therapy if feasible. The primary outcome of
      smoking cessation will be confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide test at 12 months. If proven
      to be effective, this smoking cessation program will be considered as a model that Qatar and
      the region can apply to decrease smoking burden.

    <description>The first session will be time-intensive taking around 30 minutes. In this session, the study pharmacist will facilitate the participant's preparation to quit. The participant will select a quit date within the next 2-4 weeks. The pharmacist will discuss with the participant the benefits of smoking cessation and will provide him or her with tailored behavioral and lifestyle strategies.
To prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms, the participant will be offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) The first follow-up session will be scheduled after 1 week of the participant's quit day and will take around 20 minutes. In this session, the pharmacist will determine the participant's smoking status and assess the NRT tolerability.
â€¢ If the participant fails to quit smoking, the pharmacist will carefully review the participant's experience during the attempt to quit and will work through the identified problems</description>
