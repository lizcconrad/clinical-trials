      1. BACKGROUNDS: Currently, elderly people comprise more than 10% of the total Taiwanese
           population. However, within the context of self-reported sleep duration and health
           risks, research into the association between sleep duration and body composition changes
           in older people is limited. It is important to gain an understanding of such an
           association of older people to estimate the public health burden.

        2. OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between self-reported sleep duration and
           sarcopenia as well as obesity in community-dwelling older adults.

        3. HYPOTHESIS: Self-reported sleep duration is associated with prevalence of sarcopenia and
           obesity in community-dwelling older adults.

        4. DESIGN: A cross-sectional investigation.

        5. SETTING: Communities in Zhongzheng district, Taipei.

        6. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and forty-eight community-dwelling adults (224 men and 264
           women) aged 65 years and older.

        7. MEASUREMENTS: The investigators evaluated self-reported sleep duration by deriving from
           the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and 7-d recall physical activity diary. Skeletal
           muscle mass was estimated by the predicted equation from a bioelectrical impedance
           analysis measurement. The Groningen Activity Restriction Scale and the Chinese Geriatric
           Depression Screening Scale were used to evaluate physical disability and depression,
           respectively.
