  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an in vivo study which aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in
      detecting benign radiolucent lesion in the both jaws. The ultrasonography-based diagnosis of
      contents will be compared to those findings obtained from the histological examination (i.e.
      the gold standard). The second part of this study will examine the measuring accuracy by
      comparing ultrasonography-based 3D measurements with those obtained from CBCT images of the
      lesion assuming that CBCT 3D measurements are the gold standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Jaw is a common anatomical site for development of odontogenic and nonodontogenic lesions,
      and because of the wide variation of these lesions, the diagnosis is complex. Many techniques
      have been used to arrive at the final diagnosis such as conventional radiographs, computed
      tomography (CT), low dose cone beam CT, MRI.The use of ultrasonography has been shown to be
      important in evaluating the solid and cystic components of jaw lesions. Although ultrasound
      imaging technology is a safe and a minimally invasive procedure, and has been in use in
      medicine for many years, its use in dental medicine has been limited and mainly restricted to
      soft tissue applications. Studies evaluating the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of
      bone lesions of the jaw are limited.

        Patients who are primarily diagnosed as having a benign lesion in one of the two jaws are
        going to be included in the study. Patients are usually referred to the Oral and
        Maxillofacial Department at our University Dental School to confirm their primary
        diagnosis. A database of these referred patients will be created and a random sample from
        this database will be withdrawn.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the presence of a radiolucent or mixed-appearance intraosseous lesion in the upper or
             lower jaw requiring surgical removal

          -  no previous trauma to the maxillofacial region.

          -  no previous surgical intervention in the same area of the lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the presence of a completely radiopaque lesion indicating solid content.

          -  patients with systemic conditions associated with bony pathology such as
             hyperparathyroidism, Paget disease, Ô¨Åbrous dysplasia, multiple myeloma, etc...
