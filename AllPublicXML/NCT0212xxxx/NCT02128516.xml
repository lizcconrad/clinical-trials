  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this clinical trial would try to confirm whether NUTRALYS®, a fast pea protein with an
      intermediate profile, rich in leucines and other essential amino acids, can significantly
      enhance muscle mass gain during strength training. This study will compare the efficacy of
      NUTRALYS® to a reference product. If the results of the study demonstrate a significant
      improvement in relation to the placebo, not inferior to that of whey, NUTRALYS® could be
      considered as an alternative to sports nutrition products, to which many people are
      intolerant.
