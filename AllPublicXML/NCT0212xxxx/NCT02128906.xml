    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which chemotherapy combination may be
      more effective in treating locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
      The side effects of these combinations will also be studied.

      This study treatment consists of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent
      chemotherapy. For study chemotherapy, patients will be randomized between cisplatin or the
      combination of docetaxel and cetuximab. Subjects will be stratified depending on HPV status
      and the presence of ERCC-1 [4F9] in the tumor prior to randomization. The study will evaluate
      cisplatin vs. docetaxel-cetuximab in the overall population, and test which radiation and
      chemotherapy combination works best in relationship to how much ERCC-1 [4F9] is expressed in
      a tumor.

      If randomized to the cisplatin arm, you will receive cisplatin, 40 mg/m2, administered
      intravenously (IV) once a week (+/- 2 days) for 7 weeks. Per investigator discretion, if
      radiation continues beyond 7 weeks due to technical factors (not toxicity delays), an 8th
      dose of concurrent cisplatin may be added.

      It is strongly preferred that cisplatin be administered on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of
      each treatment week to maximize overlap with radiation; administration on Thursday or Friday
      for logistical purposes will be noted however will not constitute a protocol violation.
      Cisplatin can be given either before or after the radiation therapy fraction that is given on
      the same day. If a dose of cisplatin is omitted when radiotherapy is ongoing, it will not be
      made up or added to the end of treatment. The omitted dose and the reason for the omission
      should be recorded in the site's source documentation. If radiotherapy is held, cisplatin
      should be held during the treatment break and resumed when radiation restarts. In this case,
      the cisplatin dose is not considered skipped or omitted, but delayed.

      If you are randomized to arm you will receive cetuximab, 250 mg/m2, IV over 60 minutes on a
      weekly schedule (+/- 2 days). . Cetuximab may be administered either before or after the
      radiation fraction that is given on the same day. Docetaxel will be administered at least 30
      minutes following cetuximab. It is not permitted to make up missed doses of cetuximab or
      docetaxel. If a radiation therapy treatment break occurs, cetuximab should be held. When
      radiation restarts, cetuximab should resume.

      It is strongly preferred that cetuximab be administered on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of
      each treatment week to maximize overlap with radiation; administration on Thursday or Friday
      for logistical purposes will be noted however will not constitute a protocol violation.
      Cetuximab will be given once a week (+/- 2 days) for a total of 7 doses concurrent with
      radiation therapy and docetaxel.

             Patients with an initial magnesium &lt; 0.5 mmol/L (1.2 mg/dl) may receive corrective
             magnesium supplementation but should continue to receive either prophylactic weekly
             infusion of magnesium and/or oral magnesium supplementation (eg, magnesium oxide) at
             the investigator's discretion.

          -  No prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody

             written informed consent document.

          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy,
             including consent for mandatory tissue submission for ERCC1 staining (and p16 staining
             if not locally conducted). Patients should have the ability to understand and the

             patient safety.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast feeding because chemotherapy and/or cetuximab may
             be harmful to the fetus or the nursing infant. Pregnant women are excluded from this
             study because chemotherapy and/or cetuximab have the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14
             days of registration to rule out pregnancy.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible drug interactions with study drugs. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when
             indicated. Note: HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol.
