  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the plasma concentration of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) after standard treatment with one of the newest growth factor
      inhibitors, aflibercept (Eylea).

      Patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are treated today with
      anti-growth factors (anti-VEGF). Eylea appears to have a longer duration of action in the eye
      and a more powerful effect on the edema in the macula than previously used growth factor
      inhibitors. This means that the disease can be controlled with fewer number of injections
      into the eye and the investigators can therefore reduce the risk of complications associated
      with this type of treatment.

      It is unclear what the plasma VEGF concentration after treatment with Eylea into the eye in
      patients with wet age-related macular degeneration is.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macular edema secondary to exudative age-related macular degeneration is treated today
      primarily with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, anti-VEGF.

      There are currently four anti-VEGF drugs that are either approved or off-label used in
      ophthalmology. Pegaptanib (Macugen, Pfizer), ranibizumab (Lucentis, Novartis) aflibercept
      (Eylea, Bayer) and bevacizumab Avastin, Roche) . They have different molecules and
      pharmacodynamics .

      VEGF plays an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Studies
      have shown that even low-dose intravitreal treatment with bevacizumab leads to significant
      reduction of VEGF plasma concentration up to a month after treatment in patients with
      exudative AMD.

      No significant systemic effect could be detected after intravitreal administration of
      ranibizumab or pegaptanib.

      The purpose of this study is :

        -  To determine if intravitreal treatment with Eylea affects VEGF plasma levels in patients
           with exudative AMD

        -  How long after intravitreal injection is VEGF plasma concentration affected?
