  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to investigate the metabolism and mass balance of ACT-128800, and to
      identify the elimination pathways (metabolism and excretion) of ACT-128800 and compare them
      with the known metabolic profiles of ACT-128800 in animals.

    <measure>Cumulative recovery of total radioactivity expressed as a percentage of the administered dose (mass balance) in the urine</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of study, approximately 240 hours</time_frame>
    <description>On Day 1, immediately prior to the intake of study drug, subjects were instructed to empty their bladders. Thereafter, following drug intake all urine produced was collected for 10 days up to Day 11 (morning). Following administration of 14C-ACT-128800, urine samples were collected in three consecutive 8-hour intervals, from 0-8 h, 8-16 h, and 16-24 h. From Day 2 to Day 10 (inclusive), urine samples were collected at 24-hour intervals. In case of an extended observation period, urine samples were also collected at 24-hour intervals. The total amount of radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to end of study, approximately 240 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Between Day −3 and Day −1, a baseline faeces sample was collected in a light-protected polypropylene box from each subject.
From Day 1 (post-dose) to Day 10 (inclusive), all faeces samples and the toilet paper were collected in pre-weighed, light-protected polypropylene boxes. Each faeces sample was collected in a separate box and weighed. The weight of the sample and the time of collection were recorded. All faecal samples were frozen as soon as possible and stored in an upright position at −70 °C or below.The total amount of radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter.</description>
