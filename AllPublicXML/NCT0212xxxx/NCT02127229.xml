      The purpose of the study is to determine if endoscopist notification of accessory cost
      results in altered resource utilization related to the total cost and number of accessories
      used in ERCP.

      This study will be a prospective cost--analysis study. Only chart review of PHI removed
      records will be used. The only intervention used is that endoscopists will be made aware of
      the cost of accessories used in the second phase of the study following each ERCP.

      The investigators are in an era of increased medical cost consciousness. Medical education
      and post--graduate education incorporates cost savings and appropriate diagnostic test
      selection based on expense as one aspects of the decision process. This era now focuses on
      what is best for the patient with the understanding that the cost to the patient and cost to
      the overall health care system matters. Not only is this apart of postgraduate training but
      now being implemented as part of Medicare reimbursement to provide low cost and high quality
      care. Incidence of pancreatic and biliary disease is increasing. ERCP is a vital tool for
      therapeutic intervention. The costs of these procedures, to both patients and hospitals, have
      caused some to question the amount of accessories used as well as the poor reimbursement
      provided by Medicare and insurers. Studies have indicated that hospitals actually lose money
      with each ERCP used and their use is being limited many times to tertiary care centers.

      This study is a prospective cost-identification analysis of accessories used during the ERCP.
      The study will be conducted in two phases. Each phase will include at least 71 ERCP
      procedures. All consecutive patients undergoing ERCP will be included. For the first phase of
      the study the physicians performing the procedure will not be made aware of the study and
      also will not be briefed at the end of the procedure with the number of accessories used
      during the procedure and the dollar value of the accessories. For the second phase of the
      study, endoscopist will be briefed by the endoscopy manager after completion of each
      procedure about the total number of accessories used and the dollar value of the accessories
      used during the procedure.

      During the study period, all gathered information will be deidentified but the procedure
      indication and whether it was successful or not will be collected. Only deidentified
      information will be collected. Endoscopists will not be aware of the study to avoid a
      Hawthorne effect. The endoscopists resource utilization is what is being studied. They will
      be debriefed at completion of protocol.

      ERCP's requiring cholangioscopy (spyglass), stent removal alone, or just stent exchange will
      be excluded from the cost analysis, because of the atypical nature of the procedures and the
      number of accessories used during these procedures may not reflect the number of accessories
      used during a typical procedure. For both groups, if an endoscopic ultrasound is used for
      gaining biliary access it will be included in the cost analysis of this study. Both
      outpatient and inpatients will be included for both groups. All investigator patients will be
      excluded from the analysis.

    <description>Two arms in the study. One arm is observation of blinding endoscopists and calculating cost of disposable accessories used while performing ERCP. The other arm will be the intervention group.

Following each ERCP during the intervention group, the endoscopists will be informed of the cost of that individual procedure based on disposable accessories.</description>
