  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal intensive care unit patients undergoes many painful procedures during their
      hospitalization. Effective pain control in such procedures as intubation, catheterization,
      central line insertion, chest tube insertion, etc. is an important part of treatment. Opioids
      administration is a common practice for acute pain prevention. Fentanyl is the preferred
      opioid due to it rapid onset and short duration of action.

      Fentanyl may be given intravenously, transcutaneous transmucosal and intranasal. Intranasal
      administration is practiced for about 20 years. A rich vascular supply in a nose provides
      rapid absorption of the drug. This uninvasive root is now popular for pain prevention and
      treatment. There are about 20 trials with intranasal fentanyl administration to children from
      6 month old to 18 years. The investigators did not find information about this way of
      administration in neonates.

      In our pilot study the investigators want to check if intranasal administration of fentanyl
      is safe and effective in pain prevention in term and preterm neonates during invasive
      procedures and to compare it with intravenous route of administration.
