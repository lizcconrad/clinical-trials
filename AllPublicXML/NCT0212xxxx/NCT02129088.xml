    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to
      the drug), safety and tolerability of esketamine, administered intranasally (administered
      through the nose) in healthy elderly (Cohort 1) and healthy adult (Cohort 2) participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      single-center, and single-dose study of esketamine, in healthy elderly (Cohort 1) and adult
      (Cohort 2) participants. Cohort 1 will comprise of 14 healthy elderly participants (greater
      than or equal to [&gt;=] 65 years) with at least 3 participants above &gt;=75 years of age and
      Cohort 2 will comprise of 20 healthy adult participants (18 to 55 years of age, inclusive).
      The study comprises of 3 phases: a Screening phase, an open-label Treatment phase (consisting
      of 1 treatment period for Cohort 1 and 2 treatment periods for Cohort 2), and a Safety
      follow-up phase. The duration of Screening phase is of 3 weeks; duration of treatment period
      for cohort 1 is of 3 days and for cohort 2 is 3 - 5 days (In Treatment period 1: 5 days for
      the first 7 participants who will complete the additional urine and fecal collection up to 72
      hours post dose and 3 days for the last 13 participants who will be discharged after 24
      hours; in Treatment period 2: 3 days for all participants). A washout period of 5 to 10 days
      will separate each intranasal esketamine treatment regimen for Cohort 2. All participants in
      Cohort 1 will receive Treatment A (that is, esketamine 14 milligram [mg] will be
      self-administered as intranasal spray into each nostril under the direct supervision of the
      investigator or designee), whereas, all participants in Cohort 2 will receive Treatment A
      followed by Treatment B (that is, esketamine 14 mg will be self-administered as intranasal
      spray followed by self-administration of placebo solution after 5 and 10 minutes of
      esketamine administration into each nostril, under the direct supervision of the investigator
      or designee) in a fixed sequence. The total esketamine dose will be 28 mg for each regimen.
      Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters pre-dose and
      until 24 hours post-dose for evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
