  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some studies reported that selenium status is associated with cognitive function. However
      only a few reports have investigated whether selenium supplementation can benefit cognitive
      performance and in most of them selenium supplementation was not exclusive. Also, none of
      those reports have used foods rich in selenium as a source of supplementation. Thus, the aim
      of our study was to investigate whether the consumption of Brazil nuts improves cognitive
      function. We hypothesized that the daily consumption of Brazil nuts would have benefits on
      selenium status, increase antioxidant enzyme activity and improve cognitive function in older
      adults with MCI.

      We enrolled older patients with MCI who attended the Memory and Aging Unit of the Geriatrics
      Division, University of São Paulo Medical School (Brazil). All participants fulfilled the
      criteria proposed by the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment (Winblad et
      al., 2004), which include the following: (1) the person is neither normal nor demented; (2)
      there is evidence of cognitive deterioration shown by subjective report in conjunction with
      objective cognitive deficits; and (3) activities of daily living are preserved and complex
      instrumental functions are either intact or minimally impaired. The diagnosis of MCI was
      based on a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment which included the Consortium to
      Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery (Welsh et
      al., 1994; Bertolucci et al., 2001). Participants were recruited from May 2011 to August
      2012. Eligible subjects were aged 60 years or older, fluent in Portuguese, and free of any
      other significant neurologic or psychiatric diseases. None of them presented major depression
      or psychosis, had a regular intake of Brazil nuts, used supplements with selenium, or had
      intolerance to oleaginous food. An informed consent was obtained before the interview from
      all participants. The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Comittee of the
      Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas da Universidade de São Paulo.

    <description>Participants of the treatment group were instructed to take one Brazil nut daily during 6 months. Brazil nuts were supplied in 2-month allowances at no cost together with written nutritional information and a calendar to monitor the compliance. Compliance was monitored in intervals of 2 months by checking the calendar and counting returned nuts. Compliance was considered to be adequate if ≥85% of Brazil nuts were consumed. All subjects were instructed to maintain their normal diet and to avoid additional Brazil nuts during the study.</description>
