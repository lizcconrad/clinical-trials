    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish proof of efficacy for namilumab in moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis, measured as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)75 response rate
      at Week 12.

    <textblock>
      The drug tested in this study is called namilumab. Namilumab was tested to prove its
      effectiveness in treating moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. This study looked at
      improvement of plaque psoriasis in participants who take namilumab.

      The study enrolled 122 participants. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of five treatment groups that were undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Namilumab subcutaneous injection 300 mg Day 1, 150 mg Days 15, 43 and 71

        -  Namilumab subcutaneous injection 160 mg Day 1, 80 mg Days 15, 43 and 71

        -  Namilumab subcutaneous injection 100 mg Day 1, 50 mg Days 15, 43 and 71

        -  Namilumab subcutaneous injection 40 mg Day 1, 20 mg Days 15, 43 and 71

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive subcutaneous injection) - this is a liquid solution that looks
           like the study drug but has no active ingredient Days 1, 15, 43 and 71.

      This study consisted of two parts. Eligible participants received 10 weeks of treatment with
      double-blinded study medication, followed by an extended treatment period (active extension
      period, intended to be 52 weeks) with open-label study medication. At Week 12, participants
      were assessed for primary endpoint response, which determined the course of their progression
      through the open-label treatment period. Participants who showed &gt;=75% reduction of Baseline
      (Day 1) PASI at Week 12, &quot;Responders&quot;, began a washout interval (for a maximum of 24 weeks)
      with no use of study medication: this interval continued until a partial (25%) loss of Week
      12 treatment response is recorded in assessments conducted on a 2-weekly basis - thereby
      prompting the start of dosing with open-label (OL) study medication (Day 0 OL through Week 52
      OL). In contrast, participants who did not show &gt;=75% reduction of Baseline PASI score at
      Week 12, &quot;Partial/Non-Responders&quot;, began the open-label extension period 4 weeks after the
      final dose of blinded study medication.

      Participants were then followed-up through an 18-week post-treatment assessment period during
      which no medication was given. During the open-label extension period participants began
      dosing with 80 mg namilumab; however, if an inadequate treatment response was recorded, then
      dose escalation to 150 mg namilumab was implemented.

    <description>PASI is an assessment of psoriasis lesion severity and affected body area combined into single score. The body was divided into 4 sections: head (h), trunk (t), upper (u) and lower (l) extremities. For each section, percent body surface area (A) involved was estimated: 0= No involvement to 6= 90-100 percent (%). Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D); scale: 0= no symptoms to 4= very marked. Final PASI = 0.1(Eh + Ih + Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et + It + Dt)At + 0.2(Eu + Iu + Du)Au + 0.4(El + Il + Dl)Al where head: 0.1, upper extremities (arms): 0.2, trunk: 0.3, lower extremities (legs): 0.4 (corresponding to approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of body surface area, respectively); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lunula, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75 Percent Reduction From Baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score (PASI75 Response) at Week 12</title>
        <description>PASI is an assessment of psoriasis lesion severity and affected body area combined into single score. The body was divided into 4 sections: head (h), trunk (t), upper (u) and lower (l) extremities. For each section, percent body surface area (A) involved was estimated: 0= No involvement to 6= 90–100 percent (%). Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D); scale: 0= no symptoms to 4= very marked. Final PASI = 0.1(Eh + Ih + Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et + It + Dt)At + 0.2(Eu + Iu + Du)Au + 0.4(El + Il + Dl)Al where head: 0.1, upper extremities (arms): 0.2, trunk: 0.3, lower extremities (legs): 0.4 (corresponding to approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of body surface area, respectively); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease. Participants showing at least 75% reduction in PASI score relative to baseline PASI Score are reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75 Percent Reduction From Baseline PASI Score (PASI75 Response) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10</title>
        <description>PASI is an assessment of psoriasis lesion severity and affected body area combined into single score. The body was divided into 4 sections: head (h), trunk (t), upper (u) and lower (l) extremities. For each section, percent body surface area (A) involved was estimated: 0= No involvement to 6= 90–100 percent (%). Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D); scale: 0= no symptoms to 4= very marked. Final PASI = 0.1(Eh + Ih + Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et + It + Dt)At + 0.2(Eu + Iu + Du)Au + 0.4(El + Il + Dl)Al where head: 0.1, upper extremities (arms): 0.2, trunk: 0.3, lower extremities (legs): 0.4 (corresponding to approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of body surface area, respectively); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease. Participants showing at least 75% reduction in PASI score relative to baseline PASI Score are reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 50 Percent Reduction From Baseline PASI Score (PASI50 Response) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10 and 12</title>
        <description>PASI is an assessment of psoriasis lesion severity and affected body area combined into single score. The body was divided into 4 sections: head (h), trunk (t), upper (u) and lower (l) extremities. For each section, percent body surface area (A) involved was estimated: 0= No involvement to 6= 90–100 percent (%). Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D); scale: 0= no symptoms to 4= very marked. Final PASI = 0.1(Eh + Ih + Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et + It + Dt)At + 0.2(Eu + Iu + Du)Au + 0.4(El + Il + Dl)Al where head: 0.1, upper extremities (arms): 0.2, trunk: 0.3, lower extremities (legs): 0.4 (corresponding to approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of body surface area, respectively); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease. Participants showing at least 50% reduction in PASI score relative to baseline PASI Score are reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90 Percent Reduction From Baseline PASI Score (PASI90 Response) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10 and 12</title>
        <description>PASI is an assessment of psoriasis lesion severity and affected body area combined into single score. The body was divided into 4 sections: head (h), trunk (t), upper (u) and lower (l) extremities. For each section, percent body surface area (A) involved was estimated: 0= No involvement to 6= 90–100 percent (%). Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D); scale: 0= no symptoms to 4= very marked. Final PASI = 0.1(Eh + Ih + Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et + It + Dt)At + 0.2(Eu + Iu + Du)Au + 0.4(El + Il + Dl)Al where head: 0.1, upper extremities (arms): 0.2, trunk: 0.3, lower extremities (legs): 0.4 (corresponding to approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of body surface area, respectively); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease. Participants showing at least 90% reduction in PASI score relative to baseline PASI Score are reported.</description>

        <description>Assessments were performed using a portable electronic device, which was kept and used by the participant throughout the duration of the study. Participants were asked to indicate their level of itching by marking a horizontal line with “No itch” at the left extreme and “Worst itch imaginable” at the right extreme (scale ranging from 0 - 10, but not shown on the line). Each assessment was intended to capture the severity of itching experienced during the previous 24 hours.</description>

        <description>Assessments were performed using a portable electronic device, which was kept and used by the participant throughout the duration of the study. Participants were asked to indicate their severity of joint pain by marking a horizontal line with “No pain” at the left extreme and “Worst pain imaginable” at the right extreme (scale ranging from 0 - 10, but not shown on the line). Each assessment was intended to capture the severity of pain experienced during the previous 24 hours.</description>

Participants were asked to indicate their level of morning stiffness by marking a horizontal line with “No stiffness” at the left extreme and “Very severe stiffness” at the right extreme (scale ranging from 0 - 10, but not shown on the line). Each assessment was intended to capture the severity of stiffness experienced by the participant since waking on that particular day.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-Index score is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The score ranges from -0.594 to 1.000. The higher score indicates a better health state perceived by the participant.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12</title>
        <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lunula, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>
