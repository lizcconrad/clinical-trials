  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the study are: To determine if RNA recovery from tape harvesting
      allows for the identification of a disease gene signature (e.g., interferon [IFN] signature
      for lupus) or other biomarkers that may differentiate affected from normal or unaffected
      skin; To determine if the lupus gene signature is differentially expressed in the epidermis
      from active discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) or subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus
      (SCLE) lesions when compared with unaffected skin from the same participants and from the
      skin of healthy volunteers (HVs); To determine if the atopic dermatitis (AD) gene signature
      is differentially expressed in the epidermis from active AD lesions when compared with
      unaffected skin from the same participants and from the skin of HVs; and To correlate the
      levels of transcripts of targeted genes in the skin by tape harvesting with those obtained
      from the blood.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers must be in good overall health as determined by the Investigator,
             based on medical history, physical examination (per standard dermatology practice),
             and vital signs.

          -  Subjects with lupus must present with active DLE or SCLE skin disease (with or without
             systemic manifestations of SLE, as defined by ≥4 out of 11 classification criteria for
             SLE).

          -  Subjects with AD must have been diagnosed by the Eichenfield revised criteria of
             Hanifin and Rajka, disease duration for at least 2 years before Screening and disease
             activity defined as Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 at screening

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or history of allergic reactions
             likely to be exacerbated by tape harvesting (e.g., allergy to adhesives).

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the subject
             unsuitable for enrollment.

        Key Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Volunteers

          -  History of any clinically significant medical condition, as determined by the
             Investigator, that may impact study analyses

        Key Exclusion Criteria for Subjects with Discoid or Subacute Cutaneous Lupus:

          -  Evidence of skin conditions other than DLE or SCLE at the Day 1 Visit that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study execution or analysis.

          -  History of malignancy in the last 5 years (nonmelanoma skin cancer that is considered
             cured by the Investigator will not be exclusionary).

        Key Exclusion Criteria for Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis:

          -  History of any clinically significant medical condition, other than AD, as determined
             by the Investigator, that may impact study analyses, including, but not limited to:
             History of human immunodeficiency virus; History of hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B
             virus infection; Symptoms of bacterial or viral infection (including skin infection)
             within 14 days prior to the Day 1 Visit; History of malignancy in the last 5 years
             (nonmelanoma skin cancer that is considered cured by the Investigator will not be
             exclusionary).

          -  Evidence of skin conditions other than AD at the Day 1 Visit that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would interfere with the study execution or analysis.

        NOTE: Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
