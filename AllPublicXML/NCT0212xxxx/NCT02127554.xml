      The aim of this study is to find the most agreeable and in the long term most efficient
      treatment for epistaxis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the general population epistaxis occurs quite frequently. Approximately 60% of persons
      will be affected once in their lifetime, and 6% thereof will seek medical advice. Thereby
      anterior and posterior epistaxis are discerned. Anterior epistaxis is usually located at the
      Locus Kisselbachii, while posterior bleeds are found further back in the nose. There, most
      bleeds will originate from the A. sphenopalatina or the A. ethmoidalis.

      Different treatment modalities exist. Anterior epistaxis are usually easier to treat than
      posterior ones. The aim of this study is to find the most efficient treatment. This involves
      the assessment of long term results and potential sequelae. Existing data will be
      complemented with information about recurrences and complications. The question is: Which
      treatment method leads to the least numbers of recurrences in the long term with the fewest
      long term sequelae?

      Secondly, the most agreeable, least painful treatment method is to be identified. Therefore
      we will send out questionnaires to patients that were treated between March 29, 2007 and
      April 1st, 2008 at the Zurich University Hospital.
