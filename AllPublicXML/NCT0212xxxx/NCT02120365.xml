  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether perampanel alters the response to alcohol
      for heavy drinkers. It is hypothesized that perampanel will reduce the rewarding and
      reinforcing properties of alcohol in the laboratory setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the proposed study is to determine whether the AMPA-R antagonist perampanel
      alters the response to ethanol (i.e., the rewarding and reinforcing effects) using a
      validated laboratory paradigm of intravenous (IV) ethanol infusion. Fifty non-treatment
      seeking heavy drinkers (NTSHDs, N=50), will undergo three test days each: once after
      receiving a placebo medication, once after receiving moderate dose perampanel, and once after
      receiving a higher dose of perampanel. This experiment is the first step in a series of
      expedient studies that will rapidly determine perampanel's potential as a treatment for
      alcohol dependence. If findings show perampanel reduces the rewarding and reinforcing
      properties of alcohol in the laboratory setting (in humans), it would provide a strong
      rationale for clinical treatment trials with this medication. This approach is innovative
      because it tests a highly novel AMPA-R antagonist for the treatment of alcoholism, and uses a
      state-of-the-art computer assisted IV alcohol pump infusion system (called CAIS) to reduce
      variability in blood alcohol concentrations, thus improving the data quality.

    <measure>Stop Signal Test (SST, also know as Go/No-Go)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, 24, 40</time_frame>
    <description>SST is a commonly used test of response inhibition. This test consists of two parts. In the first part, the subject is introduced to the press pad, and told to press the left hand button when they see a left-pointing arrow or press the right hand button when they see a right-pointing arrow. There is one block of 16 trials for the subject to practice this. In the second part, the subject is told to continue pressing the buttons on the press pad when they see the arrows, as before, but, if they hear an auditory signal (a beep), they should withhold their response and not press the button.</description>

    <measure>The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, 24, and 40</time_frame>
    <description>This is a valid and commonly used test of risk-taking, an aspect of impulsivity. This task is computerized, and subjects press a button to analogously pump air into a balloon on the screen. Subjects are told they can earn 1 cent for each pump of the balloon banked to a reward account before they cash out and stop pumping. The balloons break at various random intervals and if the balloon breaks, the subjects lose money out of the reward account. We will use a 10-balloon paradigm, a briefer but valid version of this task. They can earn a maximum of 7.5 dollars per administration, with 4 administrations per lab, for a total of up to $90 additional pay over the course of the study, though actual payouts will likely be substantially less.</description>

    <description>Participants will have 3 test days each, 2 weeks apart, in a randomized order, following either pretreatment with daily perampanel 2mg days prior to each test day, and then observed dosing moderate 6mg dose perampanel in the lab 1 hour before a one-time alcohol infusion . Each lab session occurs exactly a week after starting the medication for that round. The wash out period between lab test session phases will be 7-10 days. Subjects will receive 2 days of 2mg perampanel after each lab to taper down (included in the washout period). The next appointment will be brief at the start of the next phase, at which point the next week of low dose perampanel or placebo will be started. With the washout period and the 7 day taper of the next phase, the actual lab sessions will occur 14-17 days apart. All test days will involve administration of alcohol with the same 3 target doses (target BrAc=20mg%, 60mg%, and 100mg%) in a step-wise fashion.</description>

    <intervention_name>Perampanel</intervention_name>
    <description>Perampanel is a noncompetitive (allosteric) antagonist of the AMPA-R that is well-absorbed (100% bioavailability), has good blood-brain-barrier penetration, and rapidly reaches peak plasma concentrations (1 hour). To date, there have been no clinical trials of AMPA-R antagonists (e.g., perampanel) for the treatment of alcoholism.</description>
