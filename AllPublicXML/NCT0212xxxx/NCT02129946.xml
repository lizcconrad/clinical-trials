  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if consumption of bagels made with resistant starch
      for 8 weeks can improve markers of type 2 diabetes, colon cancer and satiety in adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized, double-blind crossover study design, we will determine the effect of
      consuming bagels made with resistant starch daily for 8-weeks can reduce the risk of type 2
      diabetes and colon cancer in an adults who are at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes.
      Additionally, we will compare the satiating effect of these bagels to that of a standard
      bagel.
