      This study is required to demonstrate that the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement
      algorithms on two commercially available multifunction hemodynamic acquisition modules, the
      Patient Data Module (PDM) equipped with the DINAMAP® SUPERSTAT algorithm (&quot;PDM-SUPERSTAT&quot;)
      and the Patient Side Module (PSM) equipped with Datex-Ohmeda GE algorithm
      (&quot;PSM-Datex-Ohmeda&quot;), provide accurate NIBP measurements in accordance with the guidelines
      provided by the most recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
      81060-2:2013.

      Notably, the new ISO 81060-2:2013 supersedes the previous 2009 version of this standard, and
      this study is being conducted in accordance with the most recent applicable standards.

      This study will assess neonate, infant, children, pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients
      as well as adults with chronic atrial fibrillation in a population that requires non-emergent
      heart catheterization.

      This is a study conducted to satisfy both standards for two NIBP devices and, as such, does
      not require a statistical hypothesis.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Subjects will be included that:

          1. Are aged &gt;29 days requiring clinically indicated non-emergent heart catheterization OR
             aged ≤29 days with placed or scheduled placement of an indwelling femoral, radial, or
             umbilical arterial monitoring line;

          2. Have an upper limb (right OR left side) that fits a cuff size of the device
             (circumference ranging 3 cm to 40 cm) OR have a thigh (right OR left side) that fits a
             cuff size of the device (circumference ranging 38 to 50 cm);

          3. Are expected to be able to provide blood pressure measurements using both IBP and
             NIBP;

          4. Are able and willing to provide written informed consent or have a legally authorized
             representative willing to provide written informed consent with assent from minor
             patients, as required by IRB policy.

          5. For women of child-bearing potential, are currently pregnant, suspected to be
             pregnant, or are currently lactating;

          6. Have any condition that could interfere with the subjects ability to tolerate the
             procedure, including having a maximum of 4 fast flushes (adult, adolescent, or
             pediatric patients aged &gt;29 days) or 1 fast flush (neonates aged &lt;29 days);

          7. If aged greater than 29 days but less than 12 years of age, have previously had any
             clinical or research procedure requiring general anesthesia in the last 3 month
             period;

          8. If aged greater than 29 days but less than 12 years of age, are expected to require
             more than three (3) total hours of continuous general anesthesia for the scheduled
             procedure (including clinically necessary anesthesia and anticipated 25 minute
             extension for study purposes).
