      To evaluate the effective and safety of post-dilatation in patients with acute ST segment
      elevated myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous intervention after thrombus
      aspiration assessed by optical coherence tomography to examine stent Incomplete apposition
      and strut coverage in patients treated with drug-eluting stents .
