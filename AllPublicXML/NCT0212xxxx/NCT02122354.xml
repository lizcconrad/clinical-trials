  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is the accumulation of gameplay data and simulator sickness
      background surveys for trend analysis, and individual simulator sickness trigger factor
      analysis for the test subjects involved. Rather than isolating specific variables for
      hypothesis formulation, this study will be attempting to collect an array of data that is a)
      both qualitative and quantitative, and b) observational and test subject-reported. The final
      results will consist of a list of possible trigger factors to avoid for individual subjects,
      and metrics showing the directional tendencies of players depending on the severity of their
      symptoms at the time.

      The overall goal of this research is to better understand factors that contribute to
      simulator sickness, both in who it affects and why some gameplay experiences may cause it
      more than others. Operating from the basic assumption that the way a player moves through an
      environment affects how quickly that player gets sick, we will primarily be gathering data on
      how the player moves through the digital space and whether that behavior changes once they
      begin to feel sick.

    <measure>Survey of responses to simulator sickness in videogame players (global)</measure>

    <measure>Real-time player responses to simulator sickness</measure>
    <time_frame>During intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Automated real-time in-game behavior data collection of up to to 30 minutes of game play. Specifically, directional movement up until simulator sickness onset, changes in movement behavior before and after sickness onset, first symptoms and time until onset. 10 participants will be selected for exposure to the intervention post-enrollment.</description>

    <description>This is a questionnaire created by the investigator to rate simulator sickness induced by the intervention, compare it to other instances of simulator sickness and enumerate symptoms. Administered immediately after play.</description>
