  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the genetic material called microRNA of three types
      of specimens from women with breast cancer. The study also seeks to examine the effectiveness
      of using a new agent called oxytocin to increase the amount of nipple fluid that can be
      collected during surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vast majority of breast cancers arise from ductal epithelium. Ductal cells can be collected
      through the nipple orifice very early in breast cancer development. The nipple aspirate ﬂuid
      (NAF) can be used to identify biomarkers that predict risk of breast cancer. To date, the
      biomarkers identified in nipple aspirate ﬂuid (NAF) have limited utility due to the large
      volume of NAF required for data analysis. Recent studies show intranasal oxytocin's utility
      in enhancing the yield of nipple aspirate ﬂuid (NAF) among healthy, non-lactating female
      patients as well as those at high risk for breast cancer. This capability is crucial for the
      analysis of various markers associated with breast disease and cancer such as microRNAs. The
      primary aim of the study is to determine whether the microRNA profile characterization is
      feasible with the collection of tissue, serum and NAF in patients with in situ and invasive
      breast cancer. Intranasal oxytocin will be used to enhance ﬂuid yielding of the NAF.
