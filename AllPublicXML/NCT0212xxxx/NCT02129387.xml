  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposal is to identify new predictors of smoking progression in young
      light smokers (YLS: 18-25 years &amp; cpd &lt; 5) using an 18-month longitudinal design and to
      relate these predictors of progression to the genetic profile most highly associated with
      smoking progression. A number of novel predictors will be assessed in 128 YLS. Predictors
      will include individual differences (IDs) in EEG, reward sensitivity, attentional
      performance, and mood during abstinence and in response to standardized and to self-selected
      acute nicotine doses (ANIC), as well as genetically influenced affective traits, and smoking
      history. The associations of a compelling genetic functional variant polymorphism,
      rs16969968, in the alpha5 nicotinic receptor subunit will also be related to smoking
      progression and the novel predictors. The study is expected to provide insights into IDs in
      mechanisms and predictors that contribute to smoking trajectories in YLS and thereby lead to
      targeted pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for at-risk YLS.

      The purpose of the proposal is to identify new biobehavioral endophenotypes that predict
      smoking progression in young light smokers (YLS: 18-25 years &amp; cpd &lt; 5) using an 18-month
      longitudinal design and to relate these endophenotypes and progression to the genetic profile
      most highly associated with smoking progression. A number of novel predictors will be
      assessed in 128 YLS. Predictors will include individual differences (IDs) in EEG, reward
      sensitivity, attentional performance, and mood during abstinence and in response to
      standardized and to self-selected acute nicotine doses (ANIC), as well as genetically
      influenced affective traits, and smoking history. The associations of a compelling genetic
      functional variant polymorphism, rs16969968, in the alpha5 nicotinic receptor subunit will
      also be related to smoking progression and the novel predictors. The study is expected to
      provide insights into IDs in mechanisms and endophenotypes that contribute to smoking
      trajectories in YLS and thereby lead to targeted pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions
      for at-risk YLS.
