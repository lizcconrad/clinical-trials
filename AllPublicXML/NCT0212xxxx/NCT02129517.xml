      This pilot, randomized clinical trial studies a web-based tailored educational program in
      improving nurse communication with patients about clinical trial treatment options. A
      web-based tailored educational program may empower and prepare nurses to discuss clinical
      trial treatment options with patients and may also increase patient participation in clinical
      trials.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop and pilot test a theory-driven, web-based, tailored, interactive educational
      program (Oncology Nurse IMPACT: Improving Communication with Patients about Clinical Trials)
      for oncology nurses to address barriers to discussing clinical trials with patients.

      II. To implement Oncology Nurse IMPACT on a national level and conduct a formal program
      evaluation.

      III. To evaluate the mediators and moderators of education program effect on intentions to
      discuss clinical trials with patients.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

      ARM I: Oncology nurses watch web-based informational video clips addressing knowledge,
      attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (barriers of discussing
      clinical trials with patients). They also watch role-play video clips to help improve
      perceived behavioral control and address attitudinal barriers.

      ARM II: Oncology nurses view online clinical trials educational materials developed based
      upon National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trials educational materials for health care
      providers. The educational materials contain text and tables as presented on the NCI Website.

      After completion of study intervention, participants are followed for 3 months.

    <measure>Change in nurse's intention to discuss clinical trials with patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral intention will be assessed using 4 items (3 with 7 point scales, strongly agree/strongly disagree and 1 which asks for an estimated number of patients). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare intention scores, adjusting for the pre-intervention intention score as well as age, ethnicity, education, access to clinical trials, and years spent in nursing as well as other key factors found to be significantly imbalanced between groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knowledge, attitudes, normative beliefs, and perceived behavioral control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Actual behavior will be measured using a 3-item scale asking participants to provide an estimate of how many patients they spoke with about cancer clinical trials in the past three months (3-month follow-up) and over the past week (subset of nurses completing the biweekly ecological momentary assessment surveys). An ANCOVA approach will be used to examine effects of the intervention on knowledge, attitudes, behavioral control and normative beliefs.</description>
