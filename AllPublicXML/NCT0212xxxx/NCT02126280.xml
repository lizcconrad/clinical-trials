    <textblock>
      The study of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression
      profiles in human monocytes to identify new effective biomarkers that have the best
      diagnostic potential in asymptomatic atherosclerosis.

      This project is the first step in creating a method for assessing an individual activity of
      macrophages. The problems addressed in the project are socially significant because of the
      high incidence of life-threatening diseases and their effects in the population. The method
      of evaluation of monocyte-macrophages activity in human blood will be based on the analysis
      of expression of cytokines and chemokines - markers of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
      activity of macrophages. The most informative panel of cytokines and chemokines obtained
      during the project can be further used to create effective diagnostic tests.
