      A Single Arm Phase II Trial of BMN 673 for Inoperable, Advanced Endometrial Cancer With
      Retrospective PTEN, MSI and MRE11 Analysis

      PTEN= Phosphatase and tensin homolog MSI= Microsatellite instability MRE11= Double-strand
      break repair protein MRE11A

      This trial will investigate whether the drug BMN 673 has therapeutic benefit in the treatment
      of advanced endometrial cancer. Nearly 8,000 patients are diagnosed with endometrial cancer
      in the UK every year. A significant proportion are either diagnosed with advanced disease
      which may be inoperable and/or metastatic (i.e spread to other organs outside the
      endometrium), or curable disease which relapses following first line treatment. There is no
      established standard of care for these patients as both chemo and hormone therapy has limited
      effectiveness and survival benefit. Survival rates have not improved in the past 20 years.
      Furthermore there are no so called 'targeted' drugs licensed for its treatment i.e. drugs
      that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules involved in
      tumor growth and progression. This leaves an unmet need for effective systemic treatments for
      advanced, inoperable and metastatic endometrial cancer.

      BMN 673 has been shown to be potentially effective in treating cancers known to behave
      similarly to endometrial disease, both in the laboratory and in Phase I studies involving
      patients with advanced cancers. Similarly the drug appears to be relatively tolerable. A
      Phase II trial such as the one proposed by this application could demonstrate activity that
      might lead to a new effective treatment for patients with inoperable, advanced, recurrent or
      metastatic endometrial cancer, while the proposed substudy also presents the possibility of
      discovering a subset of patients more likely to derive benefit from BMN 673.

      This trial is for adult women (18 and above) with advanced, inoperable or metastatic
      endometrial cancer. Patients will be recruited from approximately 15 National Health Service
      (NHS) Trusts based in the United Kingdom (UK). The study is expected to last approximately
      18-24 months in terms of recruitment time, and a maximum of 100 eligible women will be
      registered. All patients will receive BMN 673 until their disease worsens or their doctor
      decides they should stop treatment.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Histologically confirmed endometrial cancer. All histological subtypes except for
             carcinosarcoma are eligible

          -  Evidence of inoperable, advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease by imaging and/or
             histological criteria

          -  ≤ 1 previous line of systemic cancer therapy for inoperable, advanced, recurrent or
             metastatic endometrial cancer. Chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is not considered
             a prior line of therapy unless recurrence occurred during adjuvant treatment or ≤ 6
             months after the last treatment; first line treatment of advanced disease must include
             at least one cytotoxic agent to be considered as a line of therapy; prior hormonal
             treatment is not considered a line of therapy in any setting

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any screening procedures

          -  Patients must give consent for provision of archival histological tissue for the
             purposes of translational research. If archival tissue is not available or is of
             insufficient quantity and/or quality, the patient will have the option to consent to
             undergo biopsy where feasible. If biopsy is not feasible or the patient does not give
             consent for biopsy when archival tissue is not available, the patient will not be
             eligible for the trial. The quality and quantity of archival tissue will be assessed
             by a suitably qualified individual, usually a histopathologist, at site to ensure
             adequate tissue sample available for testing PTEN, MSI and MRE11

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-2

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

             target lesion) as per RECIST v1.1

          -  Evidence of non-childbearing status and must not be lactating OR must have
             postmenopausal status

          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with a poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor

             administration of medication

          -  Serious concomitant non-malignant disease, uncontrolled organ dysfunction or medical
             disorder considered by the Investigator to make the subject unsuitable for trial
             participation including any psychiatric disorder that prevents informed consent

          -  Significant active cardiovascular disease

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases

          -  Immunosuppressant therapy or considered to be otherwise immunocompromised

          -  Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia

             post-surgical complications

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy (a single fraction of palliative radiotherapy is allowed
             provided that the site being treated is not subsequently used as a target lesion as
             per RECIST v1.1 for the purpose of assessing tumour response on trial), immunotherapy
             or other investigational therapy for cancer ≤ 21 days prior to registration (42 days
