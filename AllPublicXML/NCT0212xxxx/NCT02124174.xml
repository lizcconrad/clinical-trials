  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial combining azacitidine with valproic acid as maintenance therapy post
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with high-risk MDS/AML. We hypothesize that
      adding valproic acid to azacitidine will improve outcomes via both direct anti-tumor and
      immunologically mediated antitumor response with alloreactive donor lymphocytes, having an
      additive effect and extending 1 year survival in patient with high-risk AML/MDS after
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Based on aforementioned data from the US Department of
      Health and Human Services, standard 1 year survival for AML after stem cell transplant is
      near 40%. We hypothesize that valproic acid and azacitidine will prolong survival, with a 1
      year survival goal of 60%. In addition to assessing for 1 year survival, we will have
      secondary objectives of assessing progression-free survival, relapse, and toxicity. The
      primary toxicity endpoint from this will be cytopenias and infections.

      To assess the combination of valproic acid and azacitidine in preventing relapse in patients
      with high-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after
      allogeneic stem cell transplant. The primary objective of this study will be determining the
      1 year overall survival from combining valproic acid (VPA) with 5-azacytidine (5-aza).

      To assess the effect that adding valproic acid to azacitidine will have in patient with
      high-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic
      stem cell transplant on the following endpoints

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All allograft patients &gt; 2 years of age.

          2. Patients will have one of the following malignancies:

             a. Patients with refractory or relapsed: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (including
             inv16, t(8;21) or t(15;17)) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (defined as
             bone marrow blasts &gt; or = 5%) are eligible. Patients may be in remission at the time
             of entry.

          3. Patients with adequate organ function and performance status criteria measured by:

               1. Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 70% or Performance status of &lt; or = 2 by
                  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

               2. Adequate liver function (bilirubin of &lt; 2mg/dL, serum glutamate pyruvate
                  transaminase &lt; 3 * ULN) and renal function (creatinine &lt; 2mg/dL)
