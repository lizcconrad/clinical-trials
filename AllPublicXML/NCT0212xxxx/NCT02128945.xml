  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of positron emission tomography with lymphoproliferative diseases today
      provides diagnostic and therapeutic information of major importance , especially in terms of
      speed and quality of response to treatment. The radiopharmaceutical used in clinical practice
      for this exam is fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose
      ([18F]-FDG) . However , the uptake of this tracer is not elective in lymphoid tissues , with
      a lack of specificity. In addition , the avidity of this tracer is unequal according to the
      histological subtype (lack of sensitivity).

      To try to improve the results of this clinical exploration of lymphoid malignancies, the
      investigators developed a new radiopharmaceutical ( [18F] - fludarabine ). The idea of
      transforming the fludarabine radiopharmaceutical is based on the existence of a fluorine atom
      in the molecule and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this drug. The [18F]-Fludarabine
      is a new radiopharmaceutical reproducing the same dosage formulation of fludarabine , a drug
      used for the treatment of certain types of lymphoproliferative diseases, especially those
      where the tumor cells have a low proliferation kinetics . This drug is used in therapy in
      particular pharmacokinetic effect for a high affinity for the lymphoid tissue . Preclinical
      results on normal and lymphoma xenograft -bearing mice showed a specificity restricted to
      lymphoid tissue fixation with [18F]-Fludarabine compared with [18F]-FDG .

      Based on these encouraging results , the investigators propose in this work to explore the
      Dosimetry and Biodistribution of [18F] - Fludarabine in human lymphoproliferative diseases :
      1)A first group of patients with non-Hodgkin's large cell lymphomas in which it already has a
      wealth of experience in exploration [18F]-FDG, and 2) a second group of patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia, where the results of the exploration [18F]-FDG are considered
      disappointing and did not, for this reason, experienced clinical development.
