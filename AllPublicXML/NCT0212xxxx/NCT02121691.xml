    <textblock>
      The project will target two behavioral causes of obesity: a sedentary lifestyle and an
      unhealthy diet. The goal is to test a faith-based intervention among men and women who are
      members of participating Appalachian churches.

      The primary hypothesis being tested in this project is: The change in body mass index from
      baseline to one year follow-up in intervention churches will be greater than among comparison
      churches, such that the differential change will be negative on average.
