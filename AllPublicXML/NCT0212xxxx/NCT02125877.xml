    <measure>Overall Safety as Measured by Changes in Laboratory Values From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (BL), 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with post-baseline laboratory values meeting specified criteria for notable/extended range was assessed. The following laboratory parameters were measured: platelet count, absolute neutrophils, serum creatinine , creatinine clearance, urinary protein/urinary creatinine ratio, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Note that within data categories, creat = creatinine, cons = consecutive, ULN = upper limit of normal and urin = urinary.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Selected Gastro-intestinal (GI) Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with any GI adverse event, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain was assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Domain Scores of the Modified Satisfaction With Iron Chelation Therapy (Modified SICT)</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 2, 3, 13 and 24 (end of treatment or within 7 days of last dose)</time_frame>
    <description>The modified SICT consisted of 13 items that represent 3 domains: adherence, satisfaction and concerns. The adherence domain consisted of 7 items, 6 which were measured using a 5-point response scale and was calculated by summing the 6 items. The score range from 6 to 30 and higher scores indicated worse adherence. The satisfaction domain consisted of 3 items, 2 which were measured using a 5-point response scale and was calculated by summing the 2 items. The score range from 2 to 10 and higher scores indicated worse satisfaction. The concerns domain consisted of 3 items to address any concerns or worries with his/her medication. All 3 items were measured on a 5-point response scale and were calculated by summing the 3 items. The score range from 3 to 15 and higher scores indicated fewer concerns. For all three domains, the meaningful difference between two treatment arms was determined to be 1 point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Palatability Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 2, 3, 13 and 24 (end of treatment or within 7 days of last dose)</time_frame>
    <description>The palatability questionnaire consisted of 4 items. The first item measured the taste and aftertaste of the medication and were scored a on a 5-point response scale. The second item offered an additional response option of &quot;no aftertaste&quot;. The last 2 items referred to whether the medication was taken, i.e. swallowed or vomited, and how the participant perceived the amount of medication to be taken. The palatability summary score was calculated using a scoring matrix from items 1, 3 and 4 scores and the score ranges from 0 - 11. Higher scores indicated the best palatability. A meaningful difference between two treatment arms was determined to be 1 point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Average of Daily Scores of the Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks -1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The GI symptom diary consisted of 6 items, five which were scored using a 0 - 10 rating scale with item appropriate anchors to rate the symptom, for example, Pain in your belly: 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain. The GI diary summary score was created using the 10 point response scale for the 5 items. The GI symptom daily diary had a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 50. The weekly average score for the 7 days was calculated for each individual item and the GI summary score was created from these weekly averages. Higher scores indicated worse symptoms. A meaningful difference between two treatment arms was determined to be 0.3 point.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Weekly Average Compliance of Medication Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Dose Violation Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24</time_frame>

Note that within data categories, creat = creatinine, cons = consecutive, ULN = upper limit of normal and urin = urinary.</description>

        <title>Mean Domain Scores of the Modified Satisfaction With Iron Chelation Therapy (Modified SICT)</title>
        <description>The modified SICT consisted of 13 items that represent 3 domains: adherence, satisfaction and concerns. The adherence domain consisted of 7 items, 6 which were measured using a 5-point response scale and was calculated by summing the 6 items. The score range from 6 to 30 and higher scores indicated worse adherence. The satisfaction domain consisted of 3 items, 2 which were measured using a 5-point response scale and was calculated by summing the 2 items. The score range from 2 to 10 and higher scores indicated worse satisfaction. The concerns domain consisted of 3 items to address any concerns or worries with his/her medication. All 3 items were measured on a 5-point response scale and were calculated by summing the 3 items. The score range from 3 to 15 and higher scores indicated fewer concerns. For all three domains, the meaningful difference between two treatment arms was determined to be 1 point.</description>

        <description>The palatability questionnaire consisted of 4 items. The first item measured the taste and aftertaste of the medication and were scored a on a 5-point response scale. The second item offered an additional response option of &quot;no aftertaste&quot;. The last 2 items referred to whether the medication was taken, i.e. swallowed or vomited, and how the participant perceived the amount of medication to be taken. The palatability summary score was calculated using a scoring matrix from items 1, 3 and 4 scores and the score ranges from 0 - 11. Higher scores indicated the best palatability.

        <title>Weekly Average of Daily Scores of the Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom Diary</title>
        <description>The GI symptom diary consisted of 6 items, five which were scored using a 0 - 10 rating scale with item appropriate anchors to rate the symptom, for example, Pain in your belly: 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain. The GI diary summary score was created using the 10 point response scale for the 5 items. The GI symptom daily diary had a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 50. The weekly average score for the 7 days was calculated for each individual item and the GI summary score was created from these weekly averages. Higher scores indicated worse symptoms. A meaningful difference between two treatment arms was determined to be 0.3 point.</description>
