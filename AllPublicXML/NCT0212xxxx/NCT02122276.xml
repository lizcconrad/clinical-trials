  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In animal and human studies, histochemical and physiological evidences showed that the muscle
      transferred from slow, fatigue-resistant muscle to fast, fatigable muscle after spinal cord
      injury. The alternation of muscular property was accompanied by the alternation of spinal
      circuitry property, and was related to the immobilization adaptation. Previous study showed
      that remobilization by continuous passive motion (CPM) for one month would restore the
      function of spinal circuitry in individual with chronic SCI. It is possible that long term
      application of CPM can reverse the adaptation of contractile properties of the paralyzed
      muscle after SCI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a four month CPM
      training on muscular properties in individuals with chronic SCI.
