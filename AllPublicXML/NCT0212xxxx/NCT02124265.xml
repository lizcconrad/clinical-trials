    <textblock>
      In patients with moderate to severe thermal injuries (&gt; 20% TBSA) adequate fluid
      resuscitation is the main priority to achieve successful outcomes. Soon after burn injury
      substantial amounts of fluid accumulate rapidly in the wound while more is lost in the third
      space. Without intervention this process leads to hypotension and shock. The Parkland formula
      was devised to calculate how much intravenous (IV) fluid, i.e. crystalloids, is needed for
      adequate resuscitation during the first 24 hours post-burn. However, IV resuscitation can
      lead to overexpansion of (third space) volume, leading to severe complications such as
      compartment syndrome or pulmonary edema.

      In major population centers, catastrophic events causing mass casualties will disrupt many
      hospital and emergency services, potentially delaying acute IV fluid resuscitation. Burn
      patient case reports have shown that oral rehydration therapy (ORT) used to supplement or in
      place of IV therapy is efficacious. ORT could be easily applied in mass burn casualties.

      ORT is generally known in the third world for treating life-threatening dehydration due to
      diarrhea. The glucose-sodium co transport mechanism enables the affected human intestine to
      absorb a sufficient amount of water and electrolytes to replace large fluid losses due to
      severe diarrhea, even under adverse field conditions. No electrolyte disturbances have been
      recorded in such cases. Studies on enteral resuscitation in animal burn models showed high
      rates of small intestinal absorption which should be adequate for resuscitation following
      major burn injury.

      The optimal composition of oral rehydration solution for resuscitation in burn wounds has not
      been determined. In cholera patients, Ceralyte® has proven superior to the WHO Oral
      Rehydration Solution, increasing fluid absorption of the intestine. The Ceralyte® 90
      solution, with 90mEq/L sodium and a low osmolarity of &lt;275mOsm, may also contribute to
      optimal intestinal fluid uptake without causing electrolyte disturbances in thermal injury.
      ORT use might reduce the occurrence of compartment syndrome and pulmonary edema since fluid
      is regulated by the intestine according to physiologic requirements. The investigators
      propose to conduct a prospective study using Ceralyte® 90 to show that oral resuscitation
      therapy (ORT) in burns can reduce the total amount of IV fluid needed for adequate
      resuscitation and to test the efficacy and safety of ORT in the resuscitation of burn
      patients.

    <description>Ceralyte® will be administered during the first 24-hours post-burn. Fluid requirements will be calculated according to the Parkland Formula with 50% administered during the first 8 hours and the second 50% administered over the next 16 hours. During the first 2 hours IV fluids will be started at the Parkland goal minus 250cc, which will be administered using Ceralyte via oral, NG, or dobhoff tube. ORT and IV fluids will be monitored with additional doses given hourly. Urine output will be monitored hourly and gastric residuals will be monitored every 2 hours, with adjustments made as needed to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective pilot study of patients with moderate-major burn wounds (20-65% TBSA).
Patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study upon admission to the Burn Unit.
Fluid requirements will be calculated according to the Parkland Formula (4 cc/kg/% Total Body Surface Area) administered over 24 hours since time of injury.
5. Patients will be monitored according to standard of care.
a. If gastric residuals are &gt;300cc, ORT will be stopped and only IV fluid resuscitation will be used.</description>
