    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patient specific cutting guides are custom-made for each patient based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Before surgery, MRI of the knee is done and used to create a cutting guide that is formed to the exact shape of the knee. The patient specific cutting guides have platforms that can be attached to the bone, so the rod does not need to be placed in the leg bone.</description>
