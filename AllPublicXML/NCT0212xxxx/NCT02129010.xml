  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective clinical study to investigate the pathogenesis of Terson syndrome and the
      prognostic value of the CSF-biomarkers tau-protein and amyloid-β 40 and 42 in patients with
      aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our two hypotheses are as follows:

        1. The incidence of Terson syndrome correlates with the initial intracranial opening
           pressure (measured with extra ventricular drain)

        2. The CSF-biomarkers correlate with the outcome assessed at discharge, 3-, 6- and
           12-months postictally using Glasgow-Outcome-Scale-Extended (GOSE) and Euro-Qol-5 as well
           as with complications related to aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage such as cerebral
           vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia and re-bleed.

      In this prospective clinical study the pathogenesis of Terson syndrome and the prognostic
      value of the CSF-biomarkers tau-proteine and amyloid-β 40 and 42 in patients with
      aneurysmatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage are investigated. Intracranial opening pressure will
      be measured in patients requiring CSF-diversion for acute hydrocephalus and correlated with
      the incidence of Terson syndrome tested by an opthalmologic exam (group A: Terson syndrome
      positive, group B: Terson syndrome negative). CSF samples from external ventricular drainages
      are obtained at day 0, 2 and 6 and concentration of tau-protein and amyloid-β 40 and 42 are
      determined and correlated to secondary outcome measures such as delayed cerebral ischemia,
      clinical vasospasm, re-bleed, necessity for surgical intervention secondary to raised
      intracranial pressure or CSF-diversion. Outcome in terms of Glasgow-Outcome-Scale-Extended
      and Euro-Qol-5 will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months.

      CSF from patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic tapping of their internal ventricles
      for normal pressure hydrocephalus or shunt diagnostics serve as a reference for
      CSF-biomarkers concentration in healthy individuals.
