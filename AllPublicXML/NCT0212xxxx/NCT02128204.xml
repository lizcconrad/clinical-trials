  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, randomized, within-subject controlled, 2-armed, single-centre
      study sponsored by SciVision Biotech Inc. and approved by Yuan's General Hospital
      Institutional Review Board. The aim of this post-marketing study is to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of HYADERMIS LA facial dermal implant for the improvement of nasolabial folds.

      The study was estimated to be held half to one year including a 0-2 weeks screening period, a
      day of treatment, and follow-up at week 1 and 2. Patient informed consent forms will be
      obtained before volunteers enter screening period. If the volunteers meet all the criteria,
      they will be given a number to replace their name in the study. The participants will be
      randomised assigned to receive experiment treatment, HYADERMIS LA, in one side of nasolabial
      folds and control treatment, Hya-Dermis, in the other side of the face. The safety assessment
      evaluated any recorded adverse events following the device treatments either by blinded
      evaluator or subjects. The effectiveness of the treatment devices will be assessed by using
      photographic assessment, nasoalabial folds severity scale, global aesthetic improvement
      scale, and pain visual analog scale.

    <time_frame>From the date of treatment to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse events and abnormal physical parameters or reports occurred and disappeared should be monitored throughout the trial. The records should be assessed and keep on track of the severity of individual adverse events and correlation with the treatment. Severity assessment: To assess the level of severity by rating 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (median), and 3 (sever). Correlation assessment: Physicians evaluate the impact of adverse events for each individual and determine their causality of the treatment, giving score 0 (no correlated), 1 (low correlated), 2 (suspected correlated), 3 (most likely correlated ). Subjects will be given a medical diary after the treatment to record any adverse event and report to a physicians. Physicians keep following up adverse events until the symptoms stabilised.</description>

    <measure>Pain Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of treatment, an expected average of 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A quantification of the severity of pain experienced by the participants during the treatment. A scale of 100 mm horizontal line will be labeled by subjects to assess pain on both sides of the injected areas during the treatment. The one on the scale's extreme left (0) represents painless while the one on the extreme right (100) is set as the most pain could be imagined by subjects.</description>

    <description>Based on Skin Aging Altas: Volume 2, Asian type photographs, taking gender and nasolabial folds into consideration to quantify the degree of nosalabial folds severity. A validated 8-point photographic scale scored the severity grade from 0 (absent) 7 (extreme) will be used to assess the severity.</description>

    <measure>Global aesthetic improvement scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post-treatments and follow-ups at 1 and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify the level of overall aesthetic improvement and so giving a scale from 1 (worse), 2 (no change), 3 (improved), and 4 (much improved), and 5 (very much improved).</description>
