      This study is largely a qualitative study with a small survey component. The aim of the
      survey would be to gain a quantitative perspective of how women use NRT after this has been
      prescribed by stop smoking services (SSS). The aim of the qualitative study would be to
      enhance knowledge of pregnant smoker's views and attitudes about their experiences of using
      NRT and in particular to understand why pregnant women who start using NRT often discontinue
      this early or do not use the medication as it is prescribed. This information is important
      for a number of reasons; firstly it will help health professionals and researchers gain an in
      depth understanding about how women experience using NRT, which may be used to help devise
      strategies for encouraging better adherence and which could be used in future clinical trials
      to gain a clearer understanding as to whether or not NRT is effective in pregnancy.

        Participants will be identified through two identification sites; New Leaf Stop Smoking
        Services in Nottinghamshire and Nottingham City. The study will consist of a short survey
        focussing on how NRT is used during pregnancy. As well as providing information the survey
        responses will also be able to distinguish who is eligible to participate in qualitative
        telephone interviews. A subsection of these women will be asked to participate in an
        interview. The survey and interviews will be conducted as close as possible after
        participants have had an appointment with a smoking cessation advisor and, have given
        consent for the researcher to contact them, this is likely to be within a two week period.
