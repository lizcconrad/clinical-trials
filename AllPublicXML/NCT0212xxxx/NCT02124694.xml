    <textblock>
      This study will pilot an intervention that combines group Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT),
      an empirically-supported treatment, and the Historical Trauma and Unresolved Grief
      Intervention (HTUG), a Tribal Best Practice for American Indians. HTUG focuses on grief,
      depression, and trauma response resolution related to collective massive group trauma across
      generations, including the lifespan, for American Indians. We anticipate more positive
      responses to, and patient engagement in, the combined HTUG/IPT intervention than to IPT Only.

    <textblock>
      In this pilot study (R34), we will explore the feasibility, acceptance and sustainability of
      a treatment engagement and retention strategy that combines the Historical Trauma and
      Unresolved Grief Tribal Best Practice (HTUG) and Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT).
      HTUG is designed to engage and retain American Indian (AI) adults in treatment by focusing on
      grief resolution related to AI collective massive group trauma across generations. The model
      has potential for engaging AIs in empirically supported or evidence based treatments (EBTs)
      through the acknowledgment of the negative effects of colonialism on well-being and reducing
      the stigma of mental health problems. This study will test HTUG's potential to engage AIs in
      IPT, an EBT that may be particularly well suited for treating depression and related mental
      disorders in this population. IPT has demonstrated efficacy for treatment of depression and
      grief in diverse populations, and promising results to date with PTSD; however, to our
      knowledge, IPT has not been studied with AIs.

      The specific aims for this proposal are:

        1. Manualize, field test, and refine a combined group HTUG/IPT intervention model and
           related clinician training and research protocols. Under Aim 1, we will: a) develop
           HTUG/IPT model and initial manual, b) refine IPT for use with AIs, c) solicit AI
           Advisory Panel (AP) member and clinician review of models, d) prepare pilot measures, e)
           prepare HTUG/IPT training materials, and f) recruit and train providers.

        2. Conduct a pilot randomized trial of HTUG/IPT compared to IPT Only at two sites
           (Albuquerque, New Mexico and Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota) to further
           refine the manual and protocols, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of our
           procedures for conducting a subsequent large-scale clinical trial. Under Aim 2, we will
           conduct the randomized trial in two waves; we will: a) recruit participants, b)
           implement interventions and collect data, c) analyze data, and d) develop &quot;products&quot; -
           the finalized HTUG/IPT manual, an R01 proposal, conference presentations and
           manuscripts, and the final manual and data report to the two clinics.

      Upon completion of these aims, we will have piloted methods and established the feasibility
      and acceptance of the HTUG/IPT intervention model, which will provide foundational data for
      an R01 to test strategies for improving engagement and retention of AIs in EBTs. What is
      learned in the proposed program of research could have significant promise for reducing
      disparities in mental health treatment and disease burden across AI populations and in
      culturally unique, disadvantaged and poorly served populations in general. Improving
      engagement and retention in culturally relevant EBTs among AIs is of great practical
      importance given the rates of lifetime prevalence of mental health disorders (ranging from
      35% to 54%), the fact that mental health care for AIs is severely underfunded, and the
      reality that treatment research with AIs is sorely lacking.

      Two sites are participating in this project in two different Indian Health Service (IHS)
      Areas: Southwest urban and Northern Plains reservation outpatient behavioral health clinics.
      These include First Nations Community HealthSource in the Albuquerque Area in New Mexico and
      Oglala Lakota College/Kyle Health Center on the Pine Ridge Reservation in the Aberdeen Area
      in South Dakota. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the IPT Only treatment or
      the combined HTUG/IPT group; both will be 12 two hour sessions of group intervention. We
      anticipate that the HTUG/IPT group will show increased positive response to the intervention
      as measured on a number of scales for depression, grief, and interpersonal functioning as
      well as satisfaction with the model. We will use the results to design a more in-depth
      randomized clinical trial (R01) at additional tribal sites.

    <measure>Changes in Hamilton Depression Scale from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial Screening, two mid-points (weeks 4 and 8), end of intervention (week 12) and follow up (8 weeks post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Scale commonly used in IPT studies to assess depressive symptoms and track change over time. The Ham -D24 (and other shorter versions) is a commonly used clinician-administered depression assessment scale. This HAM-D24 is a 24 item version that incorporates three new items that assess helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness. The measure is commonly used to rate the severity of, and change in, a patient's major depression. It includes 24 items rated on a scale from 0-2, 0-3, or 0-4, with a total score computed ranging from 0-75. An earlier version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale the HAM-D17 has the following psychometric properties: Cronbach's alphas have been found to range from 0.46 to 0.97; inter-rater reliability, Pearson's r ranged from 0.82 to 0.98; and the intraclass r ranged from 0.46 to 0.99. The HAM-D24 is believed to have similar psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>Changes on the Historical Losses and Historical Losses Associated Symptoms Scales (HLS/HLAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of intervention (12 weeks), and 8 weeks follow up post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Historical Losses and Historical Losses Associated Symptoms Scales - The items selected for HLS were determined by a series of focus groups conducted with elders in two tribes in the upper Midwest to identify the kinds of losses associated with historical trauma and the types of emotions felt when thinking about those losses. The HLAS asks how often the respondent feels each of 12 symptoms (e.g. anger, sadness, like the loss is happening again) when they think about the losses. The scale has good internal reliability, with a Cronbach's alpha of .89.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of intervention (12 weeks), and 8 weeks follow up post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The ICG assesses indicators of pathological grief, such as anger, disbelief, and hallucinations. It consists of 19 first-person statements concerning the immediate bereavement-related thoughts and behaviors of the client, with 5 response options ranging from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Always.&quot; The ICG's internal consistency is good, with a Cronbach's alpha of .94. The test-retest reliability has been found to be .80. The scale has a well validated clinical cut point, with individuals scoring over 25 considered at risk for requiring clinical care.</description>

    <measure>Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of intervention (12 weeks), and 8 weeks follow up post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The IIP is a self-report measure that identifies an individual's most salient interpersonal difficulties. There are two forms: The IIP-64 contains 64 statements describing common interpersonal problems. Scales include: Domineering/ Controlling, Vindictive/Self-Centered, Cold/Distant, Socially Inhibited, Nonassertive, Overly Accommodating, Self-Sacrificing, and Intrusive/Needy. Respondents rate how distressed they have been by each problem on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The IIP scales have adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability.</description>

    <measure>Indigenous Peoples Survey (IPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The IPS is a clinician administered instrument for collective group trauma, lifetime trauma exposure, tribal cultural identity values and practices, religiosity/spirituality and the experiencing of racism and discrimination on mental health symptoms and associated outcomes. The IPS is an investigator constructed measure grounded in prior work on HTUG. The IPS includes questions about tribal cultural identity, values and practices; health and mental health; grief, trauma exposure and symptoms; and experiences of racism and discrimination. It includes investigator constructed questions and standardized measures, with the intent that AI mental health clinics could use the IPS to conduct more comprehensive assessments framed in a culturally resonant structure.</description>
