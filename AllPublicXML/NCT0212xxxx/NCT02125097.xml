    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Barrel™ VRD when used to facilitate endovascular coiling of wide-neck bifurcating or branch
      intracranial aneurysms with any approved embolic coils.

    <description>Effectiveness measures are successful aneurysm treatment with the Barrel™ VRD, as measured by angiography with an aneurysm Raymond Grade Scale of 1 or 2 at 12 months post procedure in the absence of retreatment, parent artery stenosis (&gt; 50%), or target aneurysm rupture.
Safety measures are the absence of neurological death or major stroke at 12 months post treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Successful delivery of the device measured by technical success.</measure>
    <time_frame>At implant up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Technical success is defined as access to the lesion, successful deployment of the Barrel™ VRD and correct positioning of the device over the aneurysm.</description>

        Summary Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥18 years old.

          2. A wide neck, intracranial, bifurcating or branch aneurysm with a neck ≥4 mm or a
             dome-to-neck ratio &lt;2, including non-de novo aneurysms where no stent was utilized.

          3. Subject's aneurysm arises from a parent vessel with a diameter ≥ 2.0 mm and ≤ 4mm,
             measured by 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA).

          4. Subject responds to anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapy according to the test
             used in each study center.

          5. Subject is eligible to undergo a procedure with the use of contrast media.

          6. Subject is willing to comply with protocol requirements and return to the treatment
             center for all required clinical evaluations and follow-up.

          7. Subject has given written informed consent.

          8. Life expectancy &gt; 12 months.

        Summary Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject presents with ruptured aneurysm, unless rupture occurred 30 days or more prior
             to screening.

          2. Subject is currently undergoing radiation therapy.

          3. Subject has known allergies to nickel-titanium metal.

          4. Subject has known allergies to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine, or clopidogrel.

          5. Subject has a life-threatening allergy to contrast media (unless treatment for allergy
             can be tolerated).

          6. Subject has a known cardiac disorder, likely to be associated with cardio-embolic
             symptoms such as atrial fibrillation (AFIB).

          7. Subject has any condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician, would place
             the subject at a high risk of embolic stroke.

          8. Subject is currently participating in another clinical research study.

          9. Subject has had a previous intracranial stenting procedure associated with the target
             aneurysm.

         10. Subject is unable to complete the required follow-up.

         11. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.(Females of childbearing potential must have a
             pregnancy test and provide written proof that they are not pregnant prior to
             inclusion.)

         12. Subject has participated in a drug study within the last 30 days.

         13. Subject who cannot or is unwilling to take ASA/Clopidogrel for a minimum of at least 3
             months following the procedure.

         14. Extradural aneurysms.
