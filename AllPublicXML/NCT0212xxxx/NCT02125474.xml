  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNETs) are uncommon neoplasms with an increasing
      number of new cases reported in the annual statistics of the Instituto Nacional de
      Cancerología (INC). The majority are advanced-stage presentations with limited chances of a
      complete surgical resection of the primary tumor, a clinical scenario where medical treatment
      options are also limited. In view of the characteristically defined expression of peptide
      receptors in WDNETs, radioactive molecular probes to target specific cellular receptors have
      been designed using radioisotopes with short range of penetration in tissues. We have
      designed a one-arm phase II prospective sequential clinical trial to assess the therapeutic
      efficacy of 177-Lu-[DOTA 0, Tyr 3] octreotate (177-Lu- DOTATATE) applied intravenously in
      three separate doses to patients with inoperable progressive WDNET. Selected patients
      matching inclusion criteria will be enrolled at the INC's Section of Endocrinology. Tumor
      response, treatment safety (side effects) and survival will be appraised. Data from clinical,
      biochemical and imaging follow-up will be periodically registered during treatment and until
      two years after the last infusion of 177Lu- DOTATATE. This phase II trial is justified
      because despite the fact that many preclinical and clinical studies have showed the potential
      usefulness of this novel palliative approach to treat patients with advanced-stage WDNETs
      there is a paucity of vigorous results to establish its efficacy as first-line treatment.
