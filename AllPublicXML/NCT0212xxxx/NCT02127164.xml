  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergent abdominal surgeries have very high rate of wound contamination due to exposure to
      bacteria from GI tract. There are several different approaches to wound management in these
      patients including wet-to-dry dressing or application vacuum assisted device on the wound.
      The investigators propose using the vacuum assisted device with Dakin's solution on patients
      undergoing emergency surgery for hollow viscus perforation installed immediately at the end
      of operation and remained there for the first 3 postoperative days, followed by delayed
      primary closure on postoperative day 4. The investigators believe this technique can achieve
      earlier wound closure, decrease patient discomfort, improve cost savings, and potentially
      standardize and revolutionize the investigators management of heavily contaminated wounds.

    <description>Rate of surgical site infection and microbial colonization rate (which is directly related to the likelihood of delayed primary closure on postoperative day 4).
Wound infection is defined as the presence of localized inflammatory signs such as hyperthermia, erythema, tenderness, or purulent discharge that results in positive cultures, along with positive wound cultures. Wounds can also be regarded as infected based on the individual discretion of the treating physician.
Wounds with &gt;10^5 colonization in swab will be considered contaminated</description>
