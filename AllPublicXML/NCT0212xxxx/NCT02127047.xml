  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggests pancreatic islet beta-cell regeneration occurs throughout the
      course of the disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, decreased beta-cell mass
      in type 1 diabetes may be improved through inhibition of beta-cell destruction and
      stimulation of proliferation, even after prolonged duration of disease.

      Physical activity improves insulin secretion via unknown underlying mechanisms. We recently
      observed that Interleukin-6 induces glucagon like Peptide (GLP)-1 production and release from
      the islet alpha-cell and the intestinal L-cell. Furthermore, exercise induces release of
      Interleukin-6 from skeletal muscle resulting in elevated circulating Interleukin-6 levels.
      Therefore we hypothesize that exercise-induced Interleukin-6 promotes glucagon like peptide-1
      secretion from the islet α-cell and the intestinal L-cell, thereby providing a mechanism how
      physical activity can help maintain and improve beta-cell function in patients with type 1
      diabetes. This mechanism can be enhanced by concomitant dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition.

      Physical activity is also known to enhance insulin sensitivity and to attenuate the immune
      system activity.

      Therefore by combining physical activity and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition we aim to
      allow for beta-cell regeneration in a interventional randomized open-label study.
