    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is:

      1) To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of an SMS reminder intervention for promoting an
      health-related exercise programme (myPAtHS) among older Malaysian adults, in a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT).

      Hypothesis: Frequency and duration of the exercise programme execution will be higher for the
      SMS reminder condition compared to the programme only condition. The effect may be reduced
      from post- to follow-up measurement (24 weeks after baseline and 12 weeks after
      post-measurement) but all outcomes will remain significantly higher at 24 weeks.
