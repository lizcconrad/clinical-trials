  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies whether acetylcysteine oral rinse will lessen
      saliva thickness and painful mouth sores in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing
      radiation therapy. Side effects from radiation therapy to the head and neck, such as
      thickened saliva and mouth sores, may interfere with activities of daily living such as
      eating and drinking, and may also cause treatment to be stopped or delayed. Acetylcysteine
      rinse may reduce saliva thickness and mouth sores, and improve quality of life in patients
      with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (acetylcysteine) in improving saliva
      viscosity (as measured by the Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia [GRIX]) in patients
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can improve other GRIX subscale for patients
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      II. To determine whether NAC can improve patient reported quality of life as measured by the
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (QLQ) Head &amp; Neck (H&amp;N)35.

      III. To assess the adverse event profile of NAC as measured by the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) every week during radiation.

      IV. To determine patient adherence to N-acetylcysteine mucoadherent rinse using patient
      reported surveys.

      V. To determine the long-term benefits of N-acetylcysteine as measured by the GRIX
      questionnaire at 45 days and 90 days post treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetylcysteine oral rinse and gargle or swish for 60 seconds then
      spit 5 times per day, beginning within 3 days of the initiation of radiotherapy to 14 days
      following completion of radiotherapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive a placebo oral rinse and gargle or swish for 60 seconds and then
      spit 5 times per day beginning within 3 days of the initiation of radiotherapy to 14 days
      following completion of radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 45 and 90 days.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks following radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated for each patient from baseline to 2 weeks following radiotherapy. The AUC values will be compared between the two arms using either t-tests or Wilcoxon nonparametric tests and tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the normality assumption is rejected at a 0.20 level, Wilcoxon tests will be used to compare the AUC values between arms. If the normality assumption is not rejected, an F test will be used to compare the variances of the AUC values between the two arms at the 0.20 level.</description>
