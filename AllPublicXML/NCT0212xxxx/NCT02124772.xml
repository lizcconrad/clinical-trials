  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-part (Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D), Phase I/IIa, multi-center, open label,
      study in pediatric subjects with refractory or recurrent tumors. Part A is a repeat dose,
      dose escalation monotherapy study that will identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) on
      the continuous dosing schedule using a 3 + 3 dose- escalation procedure. Part B will evaluate
      the preliminary activity of trametinib monotherapy in 4 disease-specific cohorts of subjects.
      Each cohort will enroll at least 10 response-evaluable subjects (evaluable for response is
      defined as a subject with a pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose disease assessment or clinical
      assessment of progression of disease). Part C is will be a 3+3 study design to determine the
      safety, tolerability and preliminary activity of the RP2D of trametinib in combination with a
      limited dose escalation of dabrafenib. Part C will enroll up to 24 subjects. Part D will
      evaluate the preliminary activity of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in 2
      disease-specific cohorts of subjects diagnosed with LGG and LCH. LGG cohort will enroll
      approximately 20 response-evaluable subjects and the LCH cohort will enroll approximately 10
      response-evaluable subjects. The overall goal of this trial is to efficiently establish safe,
      pharmacologically relevant dose of trametinib monotherapy and trametinib in combination with
      dabrafenib in infants, children and adolescents and determine preliminary activity of
      trametinib monotherapy and trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in selected recurrent,
      refractory or unresectable childhood tumors.

             atrial fibrillation controlled for &gt;30 days prior to dosing are eligible); a history
             of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction or unstable angina),

             Heart Association (NYHA) guidelines; subjects with intra-cardiac defibrillators;
             abnormal cardiac valve morphology (&gt;=grade 2) documented by echocardiogram (subjects
             with grade 1 abnormalities [i.e., mild regurgitation/stenosis] can be entered on
