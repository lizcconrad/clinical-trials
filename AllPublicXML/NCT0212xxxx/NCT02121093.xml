  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vibration stimulation is regarded as a new method of training and therapy to change
      afferent parts and cortical projections, which are important for motor control. This study
      aims to check effects of different frequency parameters for electrical cortical potentials
      and electrical muscular potentials in healthy young adults. 80 volunteers will participate in
      the study, and they will be randomly subdivided in four groups for trials. The methodology
      consists of electroencephalographic and electromyographic assessment before and after
      15-minute vibration application with a digital vibratory pad.

      The vibratory stimulation is regarded as a new training method and capable of modulating
      peripheral afferents and cortical projections therapy, which are important in motor control.
      This study aims to determine the effects of different parameters on cortical frequency
      electric potential and electric potential muscle in healthy young adults. Will participate in
      the study 80 volunteers, these randomly divided into four groups for the experimental
      procedures. The methodological approach consists of an electroencephalographic and
      electromyographic evaluation before and after 15 minutes of application of vibration through
      a digital vibrating pad.

    <description>We know that the vibration has multiple physiologic effects, promoting normal patterns of motor activity by changing motor-neuron excitability. Vibrations increase the final afferent influx of the primary muscular fuse, allowing the reflex contraction, the so-called tonic vibration reflex . This reflex is mediated by both segmental and supra-segmental spine path, and is supported by upper centres.</description>
