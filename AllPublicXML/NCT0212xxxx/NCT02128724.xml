  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a drug called BKM120 is a safe and effective treatment when
      given to lung cancer patients having radiotherapy treatment. The trial will identify which of
      three possible doses of BKM120 is best to give with lung radiotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-centre, open-label, 3+3 cohort, dose escalation phase I study of
      the use of BKM120 in combination with thoracic radiotherapy. Patients with incurable NSCLC
      requiring palliative thoracic radiotherapy will be eligible for entry.

      The first three cohorts of patients will be treated with escalating doses of BKM120. These
      patients will be treated with BKM120 for a total of fourteen days. One week after commencing
      BKM120, patients will start palliative radiotherapy treatment. Radiotherapy treatment will be
      delivered as 20Gy in 5 fractions over a one week period. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be
      determined and a further 6 patients will be treated at this dose. Response to BKM120
      treatment will be based upon changes in tumour hypoxia and perfusion as detected by 18F-Miso
      PET-CT scans and perfusion CT scans respectively.

      In the event that no changes are detected in tumour hypoxia or perfusion in cohorts 1-3, an
      optional group of patients (cohort 4) will be recruited. These patients will receive BKM120
      treatment for a total of 28 days. Three weeks after commencing BKM120, this cohort will
      receive palliative radiotherapy with 20Gy in 5 fractions over a one week period.

    <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable patients or 0 of 3 evaluable patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLTs will be defined per NCI CTCAE v 4.0. The following will be considered DLT if they occur at any point whilst the patient is on study: 1) Any ≥ grade 3 non-haematological toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) that requires hospital admission or which does not resolve to ≤ grade 2 within 7 consecutive days of optimal treatment. 2) Any ≥ grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea will be considered DLT only if any of them persist for &gt;48 hours despite maximum supportive care. 3) ≥ Grade 3 pneumonitis 4) Any ≥ Grade 4 haematological toxicity. 5) Mood deterioration from baseline. DLT will be any grade ≥3 mood change if BL score of 2. DLT will be any grade ≥2 mood change if baseline score of ≤ 1.</description>

    <description>18F-Miso is a radiotracer that selectively accumulates in hypoxic tissues. 18F-Miso PET-CT scans are able to non-invasively image tumour hypoxia. A 18F-Miso PET-CT scan will be conducted prior to commencing BKM120 and repeated prior to commencing radiotherapy treatment to identify changes in tumour hypoxia due to BKM120 treatment.</description>

    <description>Perfusion CT is a technique used to study the vasculature within tumours and other tissues. It is non-invasive and readily incorporated into existing CT protocols using conventional contrast agents. A perfusion CT scan will be conducted prior to commencing BKM120 and repeated prior to commencing radiotherapy treatment to identify changes in tumour physiology due to BKM120 treatment.</description>

    <description>The levels of phospho-Akt expression in normal tissues may reflect the efficacy of BKM120. Changes in phospho-Akt expression will be monitored during the trial using PBMCs taken during the trial.
Reductions in phospho-Akt expression of PBMC's following BKM120 treatment will be correlated with changes observed with the functional imaging investigations.</description>
