  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the dydrogesterone therapy is associated with
      reduction in miscarriage in women with first trimester threatened miscarriage. The hypothesis
      is that the dydrogesterone therapy will significantly reduce the risk of miscarriage in women
      with threatened miscarriage.
