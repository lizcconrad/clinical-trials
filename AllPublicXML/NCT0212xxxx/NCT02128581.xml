  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exendin-(9,39) has been shown to have effects on beta-cell function, and after gastric
      bypass, to accelerate gastrointestinal transit. - infused at rates of 300pmol/kg/min. Given
      that gastrointestinal transit is typically delayed by Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
      also that this hormone causes decreased food intake through increased satiation, it is
      reasonable to expect an effect of Exendin-9,39 on appetite. This may help explain the effects
      of gastric bypass on food intake. To examine the effect of Exendin on food intake we propose
      a dose-response study to determine whether the compound has effects in a dose-dependent
      fashion. We will examine the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms as well as food intake in
      the immediate aftermath of a test meal and the subsequent hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have undergone Roux en-Y Gastric Bypass at least 6 months prior to
             enrollment in the study.

          -  Subjects without active systemic illness.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &lt;20 years of age will not be studied to minimize the possibility of type 1
             diabetes.

          -  Subjects &gt;70 years of age will not be studied to minimize the potential confounding
             effects of age on glucose tolerance.
