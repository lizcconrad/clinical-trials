  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to determine whether an intensive lifestyle intervention
      was as effective as surgery to treat morbid obesity nine years post-intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral/lifestyle interventions produce acceptable success in treating moderately obese
      subjects. However, their effectiveness on weight loss and maintenance in morbidly obese
      subjects remains elusive.

      Twenty-nine morbidly obese females participated in this non-randomized study. Fifteen
      subjects were assigned to the lifestyle group and 14 underwent vertical banded gastroplasty.
      Subjects in the lifestyle group attended 30 behavioral modification sessions over three
      years, whereas the surgery group received the standard of care nutrition. Body weight,
      resting metabolic rate, physical activity, body composition measurements and dietary intake
      data were assessed at standard time points during the first 3 years post-intervention.
      Follow-up data on body weight and physical activity were also collected 9 years later.
