      The present study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of EUS-guided ethanol
      ablation of an insulinoma.

    <textblock>
      As the major insulinomas are functioning islet cell tumors, surgical resection is currently
      first-line therapy for or treatment of insulinomas. However, the surgical resection of
      pancreatic neoplasm is conditional for specific patients and may be associated with
      substantial life-threatening complications. Several studies declared that endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS)-guided lavage may offer an alternative to surgical resection of insulinomas.
      Nevertheless, their sample sizes were small and conclusions were built based on short-term
      outcomes. In addition, the amount of ethanol administrated for different types of insulinomas
      were inconsistent among those studies.

      The present study aims to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of EUS-guided ethanol
      ablation therapy of insulinomas. We will use cytopathology and immunohistochemistry in
      combination with EUS-FNA for diagnosis of insulinoma. After EUS-guided ethanol ablation
      therapy, the safety and efficacy will be assessed at the baseline and different time points
      during follow-up by physicians blinded to the treatment or control status.

    <description>Diagnostic evaluation for suspected insulinoma is performed by cytology or immunohistochemistry. EUS-FNA is performed to obtain samples. After puncturing with the needle, ethanol under the guidance of EUS was injected into the lesion. The amount of ethanol is administrated according to the size of lesion.</description>
