      Background:

      - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited disease. It causes weakness in
      muscles used for swallowing, breathing, and speaking. SBMA mainly affects men, but women can
      carry the gene for it. Researchers think there may be a link between SBMA and excess fat in
      the liver.

      Objective:

      - To look for fatty liver and liver injury in people with SBMA, people with motor neuron
      disease, and people who carry the gene for SBMA.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults 18 years and older who have SBMA, have motor neuron disease, or are carriers of
           SBMA.

        -  Healthy adult volunteers.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

        -  Participants will have 1 outpatient visit of 1-2 days. Women will have a urine pregnancy
           test. All participants will have:

        -  Blood tests.

        -  Liver ultrasound. A probe is placed on the abdomen at certain locations and angles and
           takes pictures. The painless procedure takes 20-30 minutes.

        -  Liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder with a
           magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of it. They will
           be in the scanner for about 30 minutes. They will get earplugs for loud noises.

        -  Some participants with abnormal liver testing will have a biopsy (small piece) of the
           liver taken. The biopsy site will be located with ultrasound, then cleaned and numbed.
           The physician will quickly pass a needle in and out of the liver while the participants
           holds their breath. Afterward, participants will be monitored in bed for 6 hours.

        -  Participants may return for follow-up and another 1-2 day outpatient visit yearly for up
           to 2 years.

      Objectives:

      Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), or Kennedy s disease, is a slowly progressive
      hereditary motor neuron disease for which there is currently no effective treatment. Whether
      the liver is affected in SBMA is unclear. Preliminary analysis in SBMA patients has shown
      changes including increased hepatic fat, which requires additional investigation. Female
      carriers and patients with motor neuron disease will also participate in the study to
      evaluate for liver fat and function via imaging and laboratory tests.

      Study Population:

      We plan to enroll 15 men with genetically confirmed SBMA, 15 age-matched healthy control men,
      15 SBMA carrier women, 15 age-matched healthy control women and 15 males with other motor
      neuron disease patients as disease controls.

      Design:

      Subjects will complete liver evaluations at the NIH that may include blood work, liver MRI
      imaging with spectroscopy (MRS), ultrasound, and biopsy. Liver biopsies will be done on up to
      20 subjects with evidence of fatty liver by MRS: up to 10 subjects with SBMA, 5 female
      carriers, and 5 patients with other forms of motor neuron disease. Liver biopsy will be
      performed on a subset of subjects who have a clinical indication for biopsy analysis. Liver
      tissue will be analyzed by the NIH Clinical Center Pathology Department, and additional
      studies will be done in the research laboratory at NIH. Patients may undergo repeated
      non-invasive testing to determine if the liver findings are changing over time. An evaluation
      of muscle fat by MRI spectroscopy will be done with a subset of up to 10 subjects receiving
      the liver studies.

      Outcome measures:

      Subjects will be assessed using several different types of measurements including blood work
      for fatty metabolism, muscle function, and hepatic function. Liver biopsies will be used to
      determine the pattern and degree of fatty infiltration. Liver and muscle imaging will be used
      to detect fat. Ultrasound elastography will be used to assess the extent of fibrosis and loss
      of elasticity in the liver.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The study population will consist of several subgroups of patients. An individual must meet
        one of the following subgroup inclusion criteria to participate in this study.

        Healthy male control:

          1. Male

          2. No history or diagnosis of liver disease

          3. No history of SBMA or other motor neuron disease

          4. Greater than 18 years old

          5. No diagnosis of diabetes or insulin resistance

          6. No history of alcohol abuse within the last 1 year

          7. No history of hyperlipidemia (LDL &lt; 195) or hypertriglyceridemia (TAG &lt; 225)

        Healthy female control:

          1. Female

          2. No history or diagnosis of liver disease

          3. No history of SBMA or other motor neuron disease

          4. Greater than 18 years old

          5. No diagnosis of diabetes or insulin resistance

          6. No history of alcohol abuse within the last 1 year

          7. No history of hyperlipidemia (LDL &lt; 195) or hypertriglyceridemia (TAG &lt; 225)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Diagnosed with an acquired or inherited liver disease eg., hepatitis B, hepatitis C,
             HIV, autoimmune hepatitis, cholestatic liver disease, Wilson s disease, iron overload
             disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hepatocellular carcinoma, (hepatic neoplasm
             or metastasis, etc.) or injury except for fatty liver disease.

          -  Contraindications to MRI such as a contraindicated non-removable metal device (i.e.

          -  Currently pregnant or pregnant within the past 6 months. Pregnant women are excluded
             from the study because of the known associated abnormalities in liver function that
             can occur in this population. The long term effects of MRI on the developing fetus are
             unknown and would present a risk with participation.

        In addition to the above criteria, the patients receiving a liver biopsy will need to meet
        the additional exclusion criteria below:

        -Coagulopathy (PT/PTT values that are prolonged &gt;= 3 seconds

        from the upper limit of normal, including treatment with oral and parenteral
        anticoagulants), thrombocytopenia (&lt; 70,000), abnormal bleeding time or platelet
        dysfunction.

          -  Taking anti-platelet agents for cardiovascular protection that cannot be safely
             stopped for the performance of the liver biopsy.
