    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety of azficel-T treatment for dysphonia
      related to vocal fold function and to evaluate the efficacy of azficel-T for the treatment of
      dysphonia related to vocal fold function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty subjects with dysphonia caused by vocal fold scarring or age-related dysphonia will be
      randomized for treatment with autologous cultured fibroblasts (azficel-T, n=14) or placebo
      (saline, n=6). Subjects will receive treatment to the vocal fold(s) in the lamina propria
      compartment.

      Subjects with both unilateral and bilateral vocal fold scarring will be treated in this
      study. Only one vocal fold will be treated at each treatment session alternating to the
      opposite vocal fold (if applicable) at the next treatment. Subjects are to receive a total of
      three treatments with study drug (azficel-T or placebo) if one vocal fold is to be treated
      and up to a total of six treatments with study drug (azficel-T or placebo) if two vocal folds
      are to be treated at approximately 2-week intervals. Follow-up examinations will be performed
      at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months after the final treatment. If there are any evident safety issues,
      follow-up treatments will be delayed or withheld.

      In the Blinded Phase of the study, subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy for 4
      months after the final treatment. After all subjects have completed the 4-month follow-up
      visit, the study will be unblinded and subjects will continue to be followed for safety for
      12 months after the final treatment. Efficacy assessments will be made through the 12-month
      follow-up visit in order to document any duration of effect. All AEs that have an onset date
      from biopsy through the 4-month follow-up visit will be recorded.

    <description>Autologous fibroblasts will be cultured from three 3-mm post auricular punch biopsies. Biopsies will be shipped from the clinical sites to the Fibrocell manufacturing site where the cells will be harvested, tested for sterility, endotoxin level, cell identity, viability and concentration. When the desired cell number is reached, cells will be transported to the investigative site as a suspension in shipping media.
Depending upon the clinical circumstances for each subject, the vocal fold(s) will be injected transorally or percutaneously in order to deposit 1.0 mL of study drug into the lamina propria layer of each vocal fold. The injection process will be visualized via a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscope inserted through the nostril.</description>
