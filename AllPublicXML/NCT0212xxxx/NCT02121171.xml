  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective randomised study is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      ologen CM (Collagen matrix) as adjunct to combined trabeculotomy-trabecuectomy in congenital
      glaucoma cases, the efficacy being the primary objective and the safety being the secondary.
      The investigators hypothesize that combined trabeculotomy-trabecuectomy with Ologen collagen
      matrix implant implantation in congenital glaucoma is a safer procedure and may yield better
      results than combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Ologen Â® CM&quot; is a biodegradable collagen matrix. To prevent episcleral fibrosis and
      subconjunctival scarring thay may result in the surgical failure in filtration surgery, its
      sporous matrix modulates the migrations and proliferations of fibroblasts to create a
      vascular and long-lasting bleb without the adverse effects.

      Results of ologen CM studies have been published at conferences and published in
      peer-reviewed journals; ologen CM is approved in Europe as an aid for tissue repair, and by
      the FDA in the US as an adjunct in wound management(K080868). In general, over 7,000 ologen
      CM have been implanted worldwide during the past two years with good results and excellent
      safety profile.

    <description>&quot;Complete success&quot; is consider for IOP less than 21mmHg(inclusive) with no glaucoma medications and with more than 20% reduction(inclusive) from baseline IOP.
Definition of success rate is calculated in percentage by the number of complete success patients over the total sample size.
&quot;Qualified success&quot; that meets the postoperative IOP requirements with postoperative glaucoma medicaitons and &quot;Failure&quot; of meeting the IOP requirements are the other efficacy parameters.
In the specified time frame, patients will also visit for record at day 7, 30, 90, 180 days, 12, 18, and 24 months.</description>

    <description>Use of ologen Collagen Matrix in trabeculectomy (ologen) Place ologen CM on the top of the loosely-sutured scleral flap under conjunctiva before suturing. It is recommended to suture the scleral flap with 1 or 2 stiches loosely and to coordinate with the tamponading effect of ologen CM to create a fluctuating scleral flap that prevents bleb wound adhesion and modulates aqueous humor outflow for ideal IOP control without leakage.</description>
