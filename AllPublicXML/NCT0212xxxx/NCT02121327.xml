  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that stroke is the first cause of becoming bedridden, and its cumulative
      recurrence rate in 5 years is approximately 35%. There is a high probability that patients
      reduce or discontinue medications by self-determination, leading to a high risk of stroke
      recurrence in these patients. Comprehensive and long-term patient educations ameliorating
      their self-management are important making patients possible to be managed according to the
      guidelines for their risk factors. Using disease management programs created for each of risk
      factors according to clinical practice guidelines, the influence of those programs were
      evaluated for the prevention of stroke recurrence in this Disease Management Program Stroke
      Trial.
