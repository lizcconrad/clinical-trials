  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RADIATION PROTECT is a randomized, controlled trial of patients undergoing coronary
      angiography or PCI with or without a pelvic lead shield. Interventional cardiologists who
      will perform the procedure will wear a radiation protection cap in all procedures.

      It is hypothesized that routine use of the pelvic lead shield and radiation protection cap
      during these procedures will reduce the amount of radiation in which the interventional
      cardiologists get exposed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred for coronary angiography or PCI will be randomized to undergo their
      procedure with or without the pelvic lead shield and the operator will wear a radiation
      protection cap.

      Clinical efficacy will be assessed based on the total radiation dose that the interventional
      cardiologist got exposed to as well as a secondary outcome measuring the total radiation
      exposure dose per minute.

    <description>The total radiation dose that the interventional cardiologist got exposed to as read by dosimeters (µSv) at left breast.
The difference between both groups in radiation dose that the interventional cardiologist got exposed to divided by Air Kerma (µSv/mGy).
For the radiation protection cap, the primary outcome is the difference between total radiation dose as measured by two dosimeters (µSv) at left temporal region of the head of the interventional cardiologist (one on the outside of the radiation protection cap and the other one on the inside of the cap).</description>
