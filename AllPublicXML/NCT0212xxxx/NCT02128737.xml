      This project continues an innovative line of research on how to optimally use sleep as an
      intervention to promote cognitive recovery from, and resistance to, the neurobehavioral risks
      posed by chronic partial sleep deprivation. Chronic insufficient sleep is estimated to affect
      at least 20% of adults. It can result from medical conditions and sleep disorders, as well as
      work demands, and social or domestic responsibilities. It is associated with significant
      clinical morbidity, and directly causes errors and accidents that are due to its adverse
      neurobehavioral effects on alertness, mood, and cognitive functions. In seminal experiments
      conducted under this grant, we showed that the neurobehavioral effects of chronic sleep
      restriction accumulate to severe levels in a few days, without the full awareness of the
      affected individuals, and that recovery from chronic sleep restriction requires more sleep
      than previously assumed. We also discovered that recovery from chronic sleep was illusory,
      because it masked a heightened neurobehavioral vulnerability to even a single post-recovery
      night of sleep restriction. The implications of these findings are that apparent recovery
      from chronic sleep restriction masks a more severe cognitive response to subsequent sleep
      restriction suggesting that there are longer time constants in the brain for neurobehavioral
      recovery from chronic sleep restriction. In light of this finding, we now seek to determine
      whether additional nights of extended recovery sleep will reduce the heightened vulnerability
      induced by prior exposure to sleep restriction. A total of 87 healthy adults (ages 21-50)
      will be studied in the laboratory during a 17-night (N=63) and a 19-night (N=24) protocol
      evaluating cognitive, psychological and physiological responses to varying recovery days
      between two sleep-restriction periods. The results will establish the number of nights of
      recovery sleep needed to prevent accelerated deterioration during a subsequent period of
      sleep restriction. The findings will advance theoretical understanding of sleep homeostasis
      and its relationship to cognitive functions, as well as inform theories of sleep need, and
      have substantial implications for sleep biology, for the treatment of clinical disorders that
      regularly disrupt sleep, and for managing lifestyle factors that frequently restrict sleep.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A total of N=87 adult subjects (aged 21-50 yr), N=43 females and N=44 males of all
        ethnicities, will be randomized to the 3 different conditions (n=26 for each of 2
        experimental conditions; n=11 for the control condition) for the 17-night protocol or
        assigned to the 5-night experimental recovery condition (n=24) for the 19-night protocol.
        Subjects must also be comparable in terms of their homeostatic and circadian sleep-wake
        regulation parameters. In order to be eligible to participate, subjects must meet the
