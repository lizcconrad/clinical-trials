  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early recurrence of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is common,
      reaching approximately 6% within 30 days after initial stroke. Therefore, it is preferable to
      provide early anticoagulation for cardioembolic stroke. However, early anticoagulation may
      increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of cerebral infarcts. It is difficult to
      decide the timing of initiation for anticoagulant therapy in stroke patients with
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). In 2013 the European Heart Rhythm Association
      presented the practical guides for oral anticoagulants in NVAF patients, which recommend that
      the optimal time to start anticoagulant therapy should be determined according to the stroke
      severity. However, this recommendation is principally an experts' opinion and is not suitable
      in the clinical practice in Japan.

      RELAXED, a multicenter observational study is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      an oral direct activated coagulation factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, for acute ischemic
      stroke patients with NVAF in consideration of the infarct size, timing of initiation for
      rivaroxaban medication, and other patient characteristics, and thereby to determine the
      optimal timing of the initiation during acute ischemic stroke. The consecutive acute ischemic
      stroke / transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients with NVAF who are treated with rivaroxaban
      will be enrolled. The infarction size at 0-48 hours after stroke onset will be measured by
      the diffusion weighted image (DWI) MRI. The primary efficacy endpoint is recurrent ischemic
      stroke within 3 months. The primary safety endpoint is major bleedings within 3 months. The
      optimal timing to initiate rivaroxaban during acute ischemic stroke is determined by analysis
      of co-relation between primary endpoints and the infarct size / time to initiate rivaroxaban.
