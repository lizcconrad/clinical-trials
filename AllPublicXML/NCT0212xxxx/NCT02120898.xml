      The purpose of this study it so compare the safety and efficacy profiles of a generic

      Aldara® (imiquimod) Cream, 5% was the first imiquimod product approved by the FDA for the
      topical treatment of actinic keratosis, superficial basal cell carcinoma and external genital
      and perianal warts. The FDA approved regimen for the treatment of AK is application of 250 mg
      of cream twice a week for 16 weeks to a 25-cm2 area. In 2011, a lower strength imiquimod
      cream, Zyclara (imiquimod) Cream, 2.5% was approved by the FDA. When used for the treatment
      of AK, Zyclara is applied for a shorter duration and in an expanded treatment area (e.g.,
      face or scalp) in comparison to Aldara®. This study will be conducted in compliance with the
      protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Marketed
      by Medicis, Zyclara® (imiquimod) cream 2.5% is a safe and effective topical therapy for the
      treatment of actinic keratosis of the face and scalp. Actavis has developed a generic
      formulation of imiquimod 2.5% cream and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of this formulation.

          -  Subject is willing and able to apply the test article as directed, comply with study
             instructions and commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study.
