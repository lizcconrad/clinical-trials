      This is a longitudinal study supported by Pfizer and is a collaboration between DMPI (Duke
      Molecular Physiology Institute) and DIAL (Duke Image Acquisition Laboratory) to measure the
      effects of acute exercise on carnitine and acylcarnitine levels in the muscle and on insulin
      sensitivity in the plasma. This pilot study seeks to explain why moderate intensity exercise
      provides more improvements in glucose control for pre-diabetic patients than vigorous
      intensity. The investigators hypothesize that moderate intensity exercise might be beneficial
      for elderly individuals who are overweight or obese, specifically by: 1. Reducing damaging
      excess protein acetylation (measured in muscle biopsy), 2. Improving the
      acylcarnitine/carnitine ratio (measured by MRS), 3. Improving overall mitochondrial function
      as reflected in reduced phosphocreatine recovery time (measured by MRS) and 4. Increasing
      insulin sensitivity as measured by a 4-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Investigators intend
      to use the results of this study to show feasibility in measuring mitochondrial function at
      Duke for a larger federal grant submission. Investigators hypothesize that carnitine
      insufficiency might contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-related impairments
      in glucose tolerance and insulin action.
