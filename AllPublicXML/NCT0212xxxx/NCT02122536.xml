    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, intraindividual split face study will
      be to compare onabotulinumtoxinA to incobotulinumtoxinA for the correction of facial wrinkles
      using a 1:1 dose ratio.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to which side of the face will be injected with
      onabotulinumtoxinA and incobotulinumtoxinA. A total dose of 22.5 units of onabotulinumtoxinA
      and 22.5 units of incobotulinumtoxinA will be administered at baseline to the respected side
      of the face. One vial (100 MU) of BoNTA will be reconstituted with 2.0 mL of 0.9% sterile
      saline solution. Similarly, one vial (100 MU) of BTXCo will be reconstituted with 2.0 mL of
      0.9% sterile saline solution. 2.5 units of the respective neurotoxin will be administered to
      three sites in the crow's feet area on each side (7.5 units total for one side), 2.5 units to
      two locations of the forehead on each side (5 units total for one side), and 5.0 units to two
      locations in the glabella on each side(10 units total for one side). The duration of the
      study will be 4 months. The followup visits after the initial injections will be at 3 days, 2
      weeks, 3 months, and 4 months after the initial treatment. At each of these visits,
      standardized digital photographs of the treated facial area will be taken. Both static and
      dynamic photos will be taken of each region. At the conclusion of the study, three
      independent raters will individually perform blind assessments of the photographs according
      to the Validated Assessment Scaled for the Upper Face published by Flynn et al 2012.
