      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of esomeprazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole. In addition, safety and tolerability of isavuconazole
      alone and in combination with esomeprazole will be assessed

             kg/m2, inclusive

          -  The subject's 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal

          -  The subject's clinical laboratory test results are within normal limits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has any history or evidence of any clinically significant cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic,

             disease or malignancy

          -  The subject has a history of bowel obstruction, swallowing disorder, severe

             occasional use of acetaminophen up to 2 g/day

          -  The subject has participated in any interventional clinical study or has received any
             investigational drugs within past 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer

          -  The subject has had any significant blood loss, donated one unit (450 mL) of blood or
             more, or received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or
             donated plasma within 7 days prior to clinic admission

          -  The subject anticipates an inability to abstain from alcohol or caffeine use for 48
             hours prior and throughout the duration of the study; or from grapefruit, grapefruit

             hours prior and throughout the duration of the study

          -  The subject has history of consuming more than 14 units of alcoholic beverages per
             week within 6 months prior to screening or has a history of alcoholism or
             drug/chemical/substance abuse within past 2 years prior to screening (Note: one unit =
             12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine or 1 ounce of spirits/hard liquor) or the subject
             tests positive for alcohol or drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates)

          -  The subject has taken part in strenuous exercise within 3 days before Day 1
