  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery has been proved as an adequate alternative for management
      of many lung conditions such as pneumothorax , lung volume reduction, pulmonary
      metastasectomy, removal of lung nodules, segmentectomy and lobectomy. However, the
      hemodynamic changes during one lung ventilation have not been fully investigated. The goals
      of this study are to compare the changes of hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart
      rate, cardiac output, pulse pressure variation, fluid responsiveness) during one lung
      ventilation between conventional intubated and non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic
      (VATS) operations.

    <textblock>
      Non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) is proved safely performed as well as
      traditional intubated VATS. However, the differences of hemodynamic changes and fluid
      responsiveness during one lung ventilation(OLV) between these two groups were rarely
      reported. For complete lung collapse, spontaneous negative pressure respiration must be well
      maintained on non-intubated VATS. In comparison, positive pressure ventilation on dependent
      lung was applied during OLV in intubated VATS. This study planned to compared the changes of
      hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output) during OLV between
      groups. As functional hemodynamic monitoring (FloTrac system) was mostly utilized with
      positive pressure ventilation, the applicability of FloTrac in non- intubated VATS was also
      testified. In this study, we also measure the fluid responsiveness by FloTrac system with
      rapid infusion (within 10 minutes) of 10 mL/kg crystalloid fluid. We planned to compare the
      changes on cardiac output and the fluid responsiveness during OLV between these two groups.
