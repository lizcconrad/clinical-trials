      Objective:the purpose of this study is to investigate the
      efficacy,feasibility,reliability,and safety of laparoscope combined air-pressure ballistic
      lithotripsy in the treatment of patients with bile duct stones.

      Methods:We are going to select 60 patients diagnosed with hepatolithiasis who carry on the
      treatment in our hospital from April 2014 to April 2015.According to the unified inclusion
      and exclusion criteria,the patients are divided into the experimental group and the control
      group.The experimental group use the treatment of laparoscope combine with air-pressure
      ballistic lithotripsy to treat hepatolithiasis,while the control group treat the patients
      with hepatolithiasis with the method of lobectomy and segmental resection of
      liver.Contrastive analyzed two group of patients' clinical care effects.

      Research hypothesis:according to compare two groups' duration of surgery,blood
      loss,postoperative complication rate,hospital stay,the stone clearance rate,,the residual
      stone rate,reoperation rate etc.We suppose that the clinical results of the experimental
      group are superior to the control group,difference is statistically significant(P&lt;0.05).So we
      can draw the conclusion that the method of laparoscope combined air-pressure ballistic
      lithotripsy is useful in treatment of patients with hepatolithiasis.

      To select 60 patients diagnosed with hepatolithiasis who carry on the treatment in our
      hospital from April 2014 to April 2015.According to the unified inclusion and exclusion
      criteria,the patients are divided into the experimental group and the control group.The
      experimental group use the treatment of laparoscope combine with air-pressure ballistic
      lithotripsy to treat hepatolithiasis,while the control group treat the patients with
      hepatolithiasis with the method of lobectomy and segmental resection of liver.

      The experimental group performed under the situation of tracheal intubation general,placing
      the ureteroscope into common bile duct and exploring the bile duct after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy and choledochotomy.Associated with air-pressure ballistic lithotripsy once
      discover bile duct stones and retrieve the rubble by flowing it out.To stone's diameter lower
      than 5 mm,use lithotomy forceps pull it out.Examining the bottom of common bile duct,ensuring
      that it will not obstructed.Last,placing the T-tube continuous drainage the residual
      stones.The control group using the way of hepatectomy.Choosing suitable surgical options
      according to the stones' location and associating with choledochoenterostomy if needed.

      Contrastive analyse two groups' clinical indicators,such as operation time,blood loss during
      the surgery,hospital stay,the stone clearance rate,the residual stone rate,the incidence of
      postoperative complications and so on.
