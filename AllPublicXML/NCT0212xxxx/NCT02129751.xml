      -  The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change from Baseline to EOT in total CDRS-R
           (raw) score.

        -  The secondary efficacy endpoints include:

             -  Proportion of subjects characterized as responders at EOT (≥40% improvement from
                Baseline total CDRS-R raw score)

             -  Proportion of subjects characterized as in remission at EOT (total CDRS-R raw score
                &lt;29)

             -  Mean change from Baseline to EOT in CGI-C.

      Safety endpoints include:

        -  Incidence of AEs

        -  Change from Baseline to EOT in vital signs (blood pressure and radial pulse rate), blood
           and urine laboratory panel, and ECG

        -  Treatment discontinuation due to AEs

        -  Suicidality as assessed by the C-SSRS score

        -  Change from Baseline to EOT in sleep as assessed by the sleep subscale of the CDRS-R.
