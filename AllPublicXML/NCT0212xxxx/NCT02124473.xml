  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is a common clinical problem faced by both primary care
      clinicians and specialists worldwide. Patients with RHTN have higher rates of cardiovascular
      events and mortality compared with patients with more easily controlled hypertension. In
      addition, RHTN is often complicated by metabolic abnormalities.

      Homeopathy, although widely used in hypertension, but no study has been taken to evaluate the
      impact on resistant hypertension. The aim of this trial was to evaluate individualized
      homeopathy on BP in patients with resistant hypertension.
