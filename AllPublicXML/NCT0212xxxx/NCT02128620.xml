      The objective of this project is to assess the impact of a Game-Based Appointment System on
      both, the clinical settings, and on the use of the educational web app www.sjekkdeg.no.

      An A/B testing methodology will be used. This methodology consist on the redirection of the
      users to two different versions of the website, and therefore allows to assess the
      interactivity of the users according to the design of the webpage and determine which one has
      a higher impact on the clinical settings, and consequently on prevention of STDs.

      For the A/B test we will test the interactivity of two versions of a web page
      www.sjekkdeg.no: the A version (control), consisting en the educative web app; and the B
      version, consisting in the web app www.sjekkdeg.no including the Game-Based Appointment
      System.

      The Game-Based Appointment System will offer the users the option of booking appointments at
      the venereology department at the University Hospital of North Norway. The system will
      include an automatic priority appointments function, with three levels of prioritization
      (triage): 1) Emergency-appointment: The user should go to the doctor on the same day or the
      following day. 2) Haste-appointment: Within 3-4 days; or 3) Routine-appointment: within 2-3
      weeks.

      The hypotheses of this research project are:

        1. The number of visits with the health professionals will be larger in the game-based
           appointment group than in the control group.

        2. The number of visits to the educative components of www.sjekkdeg.no will increase after
           the launch of the Game-Based Appointment System functionality.

        3. The number of visits to the educative components of www.sjekkdeg.no will be larger in
           the appointment group than in the control group.

        4. The time spent per visit to the website will be larger in the appointment group than in
           the control group, meaning a higher exposure to health information.

        5. The visitors returning rate is larger in the appointment group than in the control
           group.

      - Compliance with strategic documents: This project is in line with recommendations made by
      the Norwegian Public Health Authorities, that state that ìchange of sexual practice, i.e.,
      increased used of condoms and fewer partners, will be the main focus of containment (of
      sexually transmitted diseases).

      - Relevance to society: The premise guiding the development of the Game-Based Appointment
      System is that Information and Communication Technology may facilitate the access to health
      services to youth regarding sexual health and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, as
      well as increase their exposure in an educative environment. Early triage of health service
      consumers is now more and more used as an effective way to reduce expenses and the use of
      healthcare staff resources.

      - Environmental perspectives: The project will provide a health related social network aimed
      at empowering the citizens to better understand and prevent sexually transmitted diseases,
      therefore minimizing the number of travels to visit the doctor at the healthcare service.

      - Ethical aspects: The research activities will strictly follow the regulations provided by
      the Health Register Act (Helseregisterloven) and the Health Personnel Act
      (Helsepersonelloven). Both acts (with accompanying regulations) being supervised by the
      Ministry of Health and the Norwegian Board of Health. To guarantee approval regarding any
      possible use of data in a personal way, this project will pursue conformance to the
      regulations of the Personal Data Act (based on the European Data Protection Directive). The
      Personal Data act and other relevant acts and regulations are enforced and supervised by the
      Norwegian Data Inspectorate (Datatilsynet).

      - Gender equality and gender perspectives: The planning of the this research project has
      stressed that the selection of participants and the conduct of the trial will all be
      gender-neutral.

    <description>To assess if the Game-Based Appointment System increase the number of consultancies on sexually transmitted diseases with the health professionals in Tromsø, we will analyse the total number of appointments booked through the Game-Based Appointment System after 1 year of the start of the project. And we will compare the total number of sexually transmitted diseases consultancies in all health professionals Tromsø with a reference number ranging from 1000 to 1999 (Group A) versus total number of consultancies with codes ranging between 2000 and 2999 (Group B).</description>

    <description>To assess if the launch of the Game-Based Appointment System increase the number of visits to the educative component of the app www.sjekkdeg.no we will analyse and compare the absolute number and per cent of visits (new visitors and returning visitors) of users in Group A versus Group B after 1 year of the start of the project. The total number of visitors as well as the number of news and returning visitors in both versions of web app and every of its components will be tracked through Google Analytics.
To assess the impact of the launch of the Game-Based Appointment System on the utilisation of the web app www.sjekkdeg.no, we will analyse and compare the total and average time spent on the web app and in every educative component of users in Group A versus Group B after 1 year of the start of the project. The total time spent in both versions of the web app as well as the average time spent on every of its components will be tracked through Google Analytics.</description>
