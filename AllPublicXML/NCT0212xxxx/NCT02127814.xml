  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find whether Lactobacillus reuteri prevents
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and related Clostridium difficile infections. Subjects will be
      admitted from the University Hospitals Case Medical Center. They will be randomly assigned to
      an intervention group receiving L. reuteri or a placebo. Supplementation will occur during
      antibiotic treatment and for an additional 7 days after cessation of treatment. Data
      collection will occur at baseline, end of antibiotic use, 7 days after antibiotic cessation,
      and 21 days after antibiotic cessation. Primary data includes diarrhea instances. Secondary
      data includes severity of diarrhea, presence of C. difficile toxins, and presence of other GI
      symptoms.

      The data being measured for this study include:

      Primary outcome = incidence of diarrhea during and after treatment with antibiotics. An
      episode of diarrhea is defined as the discrete period between the time when stool output
      meets or exceeds three soft and unformed or watery bowel movements to the time when formed
      stools return, which must be at least 48 hours later.

      Secondary variables:

        1. severity of diarrhea measured as the discrete period between the time when stool output
           meets or exceeds 3 soft and unformed or watery bowel movements to the time when formed
           stools return.

        2. frequency of stool samples positive for C. Difficile toxin A or B at baseline, when
           presenting with diarrhea during the study period, and at the follow-up 21 days
           post-antibiotic-treatment to detect possible clearance of C. Difficile, in patients
           ingesting L. reuteri versus placebo.

        3. frequencies of other gastrointestinal symptoms at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, in the L. reuteri
           group versus placebo and assessed by the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating
           Score.
