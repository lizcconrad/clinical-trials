  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III,vehicle controlled, double masked, single center study. A single eye
      of 60 individuals with mild to moderate non-exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
      will be randomly assigned to receive either topical 1% MC-1101 or a vehicle control over 2
      years. The study design will assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MC-1101 for
      these patients.

      An analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted when all subjects have
      completed Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MC-1101is a topically administered drug which in previous clinical studies has been proven to
      get to the back of the eye. MC-1101is a 505 (b) 2 compound and has FDA Fast Track Status. It
      is a strong, vasoactive drug which is intended to increase choroidal blood flow.
