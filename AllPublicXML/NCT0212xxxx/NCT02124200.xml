  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E-cigarettes are proving to be an attractive long-term alternative to conventional
      cigarettes. Although they may also help smokers to remain abstinent during their quit
      attempt, recent clinical trials with first generation e-cigarettes have shown only modest
      quit rates. Second generation devices may result in much higher quit rates. Their efficacy
      and safety in long-term smoking cessation and/or smoking reduction studies have never been
      investigated.

      In this prospective proof-of-concept study we monitored modifications in smoking habits of 50
      regular smokers (unwilling to quit) who were asked to switch to a second generation device
      focusing on smoking reduction and smoking abstinence. Study participants were invited to
      attend a total of five study visits: at baseline, week-4, week-8, week-12 and week-24.
      Product usage, number of cigarettes smoked, and exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels were
      measured at each visit. Smoking reduction and abstinence rates were calculated. Adverse
      events and participants' opinions of these products were also reviewed.
