      This research is being done to study the molecular effects of topically applied itraconazole
      ointment on the growth of basal cell carcinomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer in Caucasians worldwide. Although
      rarely metastatic, it can be locally destructive causing disfigurement and pain. Current
      therapies include surgical removal, local destruction, radiotherapy and others.

      Advances in understanding the molecular basis behind BCCs indicate that mutations in the
      hedgehog signaling pathway can lead to the development of many sporadically occurring basal
      cell carcinomas (BCCs). An oral drug that targets the hedgehog signaling pathway has been
      shown to be effective in treating patients with metastatic and inoperable BCCs. There is
      evidence that itraconazole, a commonly prescribed antifungal medication may also affect this
      pathway. It is not known whether itraconazole ointment applied topically can affect the
      growth of BCCs.

    <description>Itraconazole comes in the form of capsules and liquid (oral solution). It is FDA approved for treatment of systemic Blastomycosis, Histoplasmosis and Aspergillosis in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients at doses ranging from 200mg to 400mg daily. The current FDA approved dosage recommendation for treating toenail onychomycosis (nail fungus) is 200mg PO per day for 3 months. Test materials in this study will be prepared as an ointment (compounded in petrolatum jelly).</description>
