      This study evaluates two strength training protocols (one in peripheral muscles and one in
      inspiratory muscles) in the improvement of skeletal muscle mass and function in
      institutionalized elderly with sarcopenia. Participants will be assigned randomly in a
      control or one of both experimental groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle
      mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality
      of life and death (Goodpaster et al, 2006; Delmonico et al, 2007). The contributing factors
      are those related to aging process, non-optimal diet, bed rest or sedentary lifestyle,
      chronic diseases and certain drug treatments. Most of these factors are present in the older
      population with comorbidity, frequently institutionalized to receive a professional long-term
      care.

      Since the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (Cruz-Jentoft et al, 2010)
      recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength
      and/or physical performance) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, interventions should be focused
      in both criteria. The aim of this study is to prevent loss of skeletal muscle mass and
      strength in institutionalized elderly with sarcopenia.

      To this purpose, the investigators study undertakes two physiotherapy interventions to
      preventing/treating Sarcopenia, namely, maintenance of muscle mass and improvement of
      strength in peripheral and respiratory muscles. Both interventions are common in the
      following features: supervision, duration, frequency and intensity of the training program.

      The primary outcomes are those related to muscle mass and strength. Secondary outcomes will
      be related to muscle function (muscle endurance and/or physical performance), costs and
      health status (number of falls and fractures, exacerbations of chronic diseases,
      hospitalizations and deaths during the year after concluding the physiotherapy
      interventions).

    <description>Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) estimates the volume of fat and lean body mass. The test itself is inexpensive, easy to use, readily reproducible and appropriate for both ambulatory and bedridden patients. Reference: J Aging Phys Act 2015;23(4):597-606.

    <measure>Change in Maximum Respiratory Pressures (MIP and MEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups will be assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the end of the training program (week 12, post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>MIP and MEP are probably the most frequently reported non-invasive estimates of respiratory muscle strength. Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes. Pressure is recorded at the mouth during a quasi-static short (few seconds) maximal breathing. Reference: Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2002;166:531-535.</description>

    <time_frame>The groups will be assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the end of the training program (week 12, post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric hand grip strength is strongly related with lower extremity muscle power, knee extension torque and calf cross-sectional muscle area. In practice, there is also a linear relationship between baseline handgrip strength and incident disability for activities of daily living. Reference: Age and Aging. 2010;39:412-423.</description>

    <description>This ventilatory test is a non-invasive technique and is a measure of both inspiratory and expiratory muscle endurance. The MVV is the largest volume that can be breathed in and out of the lungs during a 12 -15 second interval with maximal voluntary effort.

    <description>The 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT) is a measure of gait speed (measurement of physical performance). The walking course consist of 14 m in a hallway: a 2 m warm-up, 10 m use for the speed measurement, and 2 m for slowing down to stop. Participants can use the assistive device (eg, cane, walker) or orthotic device (eg, ankle-foot orthosis) that they use &quot;most often&quot; (if any) at each time point.
