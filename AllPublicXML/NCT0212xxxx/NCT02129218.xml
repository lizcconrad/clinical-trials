    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of a low glycemic load diet in patients
      with stage I-III colon cancer. A low glycemic load diet includes foods that have low scores
      on the glycemic index. The glycemic index is a scale that measures how much a certain
      carbohydrate causes a person's blood sugar to rise. A low glycemic load diet may help
      decrease the chance of cancer coming back and improve the survival in patients with colon
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of following a low or medium glycemic load diet in patients
      with stage I-III (local-regional) colon cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine patient-reported acceptability of diet. II. To determine nutritionist
      resources utilized. III. To evaluate the effect of lowering dietary glycemic load on body
      mass index (BMI), lipid metabolism and pro-oncogenic intermediaries of cellular metabolism.

      OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially enrolled in 1 of 4 possible cohorts as needed based on the
      feasibility of the prior cohort.

      COHORT 1: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention
      (contact with nutritionist in person every 2 weeks with phone contact on the alternating
      weeks) for 12 weeks.

      COHORT 2: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention
      (contact with nutritionist in person every week) for 12 weeks.

      COHORT 3: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention for
      12 weeks.

      COHORT 4: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention
      for 12 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual patient compliance, defined by following assigned target glycemic load index &gt;= 75% of the time between weeks 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This compliance rate will be determined through conducting a 24 hour telephone recall, every 2 weeks at random and calculating the glycemic load. For each dose cohort, the number and percentage of patients who are compliant will be summarized, with 90% confidence interval that accounts for the two-stage design.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food acceptability score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Results of the acceptability survey will be tabulated and described (the questions use a 7 point likert scale), separately for each cohort.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hours of nutritionist time per week</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The median number of hours will be calculated based on time spent with each patient, separately for each cohort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in serum levels of glycosylated hemoglobin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Separately for each cohort, serum levels will be summarized descriptively and graphically across the follow-up period. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to compare baseline vs. post-intervention levels of all biomarkers. Changes in biomarkers will be correlated with dietary glycemic index (GI) using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients, across the follow-up period.</description>
