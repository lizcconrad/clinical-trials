    <textblock>
      It has been shown that restoration of the normal makeup of the bowel bacterial population is
      the most effective way to treat recurrent colitis due to Clostridium difficile. Restoration
      of the normal bowel bacterial population is best done by transplanting stool from a healthy
      donor. The investigators wish to transplant stool from healthy donors to treat recurrent C.
      difficile colitis by incorporating the stool into capsules that are administered by the oral
      route.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent colitis due to Clostridium difficile results from disruption of the normal gut
      flora, and is very difficult to treat. It is now clear that restoration of the normal gut
      flora is the most effective way to treat recurrent C. difficile colitis. Restoration of the
      normal gut flora is best done by transplanting stool from a healthy donor, and this is
      accepted as a superior therapeutic modality for recurrent C. difficile colitis. This fecal
      microbiota transplantation can be done with direct instillation of the donor stool into the
      GI tract via a naso-duodenal tube or colonoscope. Recently, a non-invasive method of stool
      transplantation has been developed where the donor stool is encapsulated and administered in
      pill form. The investigators would like to use fecal microbiota transplantation with
      encapsulated stool as a non-invasive therapy for patients with recurrent C. difficile
      colitis. To qualify, patients must have a history of, at least, 3 episodes of C difficile
      colitis within the past year or, at least, 2 episodes of C difficile colitis that resulted in
      hospitalization. Stool samples will be obtained from healthy volunteers who have been
      screened for infections that can be transmitted via stool, and the investigators will prepare
      capsules containing processed stool for administration during a single outpatient clinic
      visit. Patients will be followed closely after administration of the fecal transplant with
      serial clinic visits, and the primary endpoint will be prevention of any further episodes of
      C. difficile colitis in the six month period following transplantation. The investigators
      will also obtain and store stool samples from patients before and after fecal microbiota
      transplantation for possible future microbiome analyses. The obvious safety concern is the
      transmission of an infection from the donor. All donors will be carefully screened for
      high-risk exposures and will undergo testing of both blood and stool to ensure that they are
      free of infections due to HIV, acute hepatitis A, acute/chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C,
      giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, and Helicobacter pylori.

    <description>Patients will be followed 1, 7, 28, and 180 days after the treatment and success will be defined as resolution of C. difficile infection without recurrence within a six-month time period. Patients will be assessed by interview and physical exam. Any patients with suspected persisting/recurring C. difficile colitis will undergo further evaluation with a repeat stool C. difficile toxin assay.</description>

    <measure>Tolerability of oral fecal microbiota transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>We will monitor for side effects during the administration of the fecal microbiota capsules by close observation within the clinic for one hour. All subjects will return 24 hours after administration for repeat examination and for repeat assessment of tolerability using a questionnaire. Symptoms that will be specifically monitored include the patient's subjective measure of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping/pain, belching, diarrhea, constipation, and changes in the quantity or quality of stool.</description>

    <measure>Safety of oral fecal microbiota transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>The main safety concern is for the transmission of infection from the donor to the recipient. At each follow-up visit (1, 7, 28, and 180 days after treatment) subjects will be assessed for any signs or symptoms of infection by history and physical exam. Some of the specific infections that will be considered will be infectious colitis, infection due to Helicobacter pylori, viral hepatitis, and HIV infection. Patients with signs or symptoms of a suspected infection will undergo appropriate workup with blood and/or stool studies.</description>
