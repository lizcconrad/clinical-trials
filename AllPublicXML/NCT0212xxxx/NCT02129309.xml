  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in studying how Pulmonary Hypertension occurs. A substance
      called 'apelin', that naturally occurs in the body has been shown to have an important role
      in heart disease. Previous studies have shown that it can make blood vessels get wider, and
      help blood flow around the body and thus improve the way the heart and lungs work.

      The investigators are looking to recruit both healthy and COPD pulmonary hypertension
      patients to study 3 types of apelin. The purpose of this study is to help the investigators
      understand how Pulmonary Hypertension occurs which may will help with the development of
      future treatments.

      The purpose of this study:

      To investigate the physiological role of apelin in the cardiovascular system in patients with
      COPD with raised pulmonary artery pressures.

      Study Aim and hypotheses:

      The primary objective is to test the above hypotheses using forearm blood flow and systemic
      infusions of apelin peptides.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Apelin agonists are vasodilators in human resistance vessels and this effect will be
           altered in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

        2. Apelin peptides improve right ventricular and pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with
           elevated pulmonary artery pressures.

      Study 1a - A validation dose study of 3 apelin agonists performed in healthy volunteers and
      COPD patients with elevated pulmonary artery pressures.

      Study 1b- A validation dose study of apelin receptor antagonist, in healthy volunteers and
      COPD patients with elevated pulmonary artery pressures.

      Study 2a - To define the haemodynamic response to apelin agonists in healthy volunteers and
      evaluate the response.

      Study 2b - To investigate the haemodynamic response to 3 apelin agonists in COPD patients
      with elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
