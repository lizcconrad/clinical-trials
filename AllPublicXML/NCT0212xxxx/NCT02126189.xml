  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to refine the aetiological causes of cancers of the head and neck and
      investigate the ways in which human papillomavirus and life-style factors cause head and neck
      cancers. This study will determine if these factors affect the treatment of cancer.

      All patients attending the Head and Neck Clinic at the Princess Alexandra Hospital is invited
      to complete a risk factor questionnaire and give consent for their clinical data and tissue
      samples to be available for future research activities. The risk factor questionnaire is
      based on existing validated instruments developed by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research
      Institute Cancer Control Group, and will collect standardised information relating to
      demographics and causal factors (tobacco and alcohol intake), risk modifiers (dentition,
      asprin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), height, weight, physical activity,
      diet quality etc) and behaviours (oral sex etc)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data is collected using a simple four-page paper-based questionnaire. Information to be
      collected include age, sex, height and weight (at age 20, current age, and heaviest ever),
      history of cancer (own and partner). Questions about recreational physical activity, smoking
      history and alcohol consumption, acid reflux, heartburn, denture use and tonsillectomy,
      frequency of use of paracetamol, antihistamine and NSAIDS.

      The questionnaires also ask participants some detailed questions about sexual behaviour and
      history if they are comfortable to give this information.

      Participants are asked to give their consent for researchers to obtain tissue from tumour
      blocks. This tissue is taken as part of their normal care and treatment. If consent is given,
      formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples will be used to determine HPV status.
