      To attest if a cardiac fatigue appears (and to measure it if it does) during intense physical
      exercises in two groups of subjects:

        -  Canoeists from a training center of the French canoeing team during an intensive session
           of three weeks of endurance training;

        -  Young recruits in military school of officers in ground forces of the French army during
           an intensive.

Echocardiographic data will be recorded at rest and during a submaximal exercise.</description>
