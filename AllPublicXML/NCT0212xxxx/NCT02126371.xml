      LEO 32731 (&quot;Study Drug&quot;) is an investigational drug which is being developed by LEO Pharma
      A/S (&quot;the Sponsor&quot;), with an aim to help people with skin conditions called psoriasis. The
      aim (s) of this Study are to determine:

        -  The effects of the Study Drug when given as different formulations intended for oral
           administration (tablets and capsules)

        -  The safety of the Study Drug and any side effects that might be associated with it

        -  The effect of food on the Study Drug

        -  The Study will also measure how much of the Study Drug gets into the blood stream and
           how long it takes the body to remove it and what affect the Study Drug has on the body.

             appropriate contraception (such as a condom with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), or donate sperm from the time of the first dose
             until 3 months after the final dosing occasion. Male subjects whose partners are of

             of contraception

          2. Subjects who have an abnormality in heart rate, blood pressure, temperature or
             respiration rate that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of
             participating in the study, in accordance with Covance current reference ranges at
             screening confirmed by a repeat assessment.

          3. Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study, confirmed by a repeat
             ECG: such as QTcB interval &gt;450 msec, 2nd or 3rd degree, Atrioventricular block,
             complete left bundle branch block, complete right bundle branch block,
             Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, defined as PR&lt;110 msec,

          4. Subjects who have received: any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14

          5. Subjects who are still participating in a clinical study (e.g. attending follow-up
             visits) or who have participated in a clinical study involving administration of an

             dosing occasion

          6. Subjects with a significant history of drug allergy as determined by the Investigator.
