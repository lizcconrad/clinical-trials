      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TDCS is an effective prophylactic therapy
      of chronic migraine.

      Consenting patients will report on a book, all of their migraine attack for 1 month. Then
      they will be randomized to the active tDCS group or sham tDCS group. Patients will have one
      session of tDCS per day during the first week, then one session per week for a month and
      finally a session every 15 days for 1 month. After tDCS sessions, patients will be followed
      for 3 months. Throughout their participation in the study, patients will complete their
      migraine record (1month of base line before tDCS, 2 months during tDCS, 3 months after tDCS).

      Patients will have 5 evaluation examinations:

        -  The first, one before tDCS,

        -  The second, 1 month after the beginning of tDCS

        -  The third, immediately after the end of tDCS

        -  The fourth, 1 month after the end of tDCS

        -  And the last one, 3 months after the end of tDCS.

      The physician responsible for conducting tDCS sessions will make the randomization via a
      website.

      The physician in charge of the evaluation examinations will don't know the allocated
      treatment.

    <description>The area of stimulation is determined by by EEG system 10/20. The two electrodes are soaked in saline and then placed on the scalp.
Stimulation parameters:
The intensity of the stimulation current is 2 mA
The current is applied during the first 30 seconds with rise times and fall times of 10 seconds each. Then the session will be continued without actual stimulation.</description>
