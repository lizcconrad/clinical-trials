      To assess the safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of PF-06664178 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose and select the

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 6 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response, was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 by calculating the Overall Response Rate, and Prolonged Stable Disease. The criterion is defined as: Objective Progression(PD):20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed, with a minimum absolute increase of 5mm; Stable (SD): All target lesions must be assessed. Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds; symptomatic deterioration(Sym):Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time; Indeterminate (In):Progression has not been determined and one, or more non-target sites were not assessed, or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at baseline.</description>

        <title>Overall Number of Participants With Objective Tumor Response[Part 1]</title>
        <description>Objective tumor response, was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 by calculating the Overall Response Rate, and Prolonged Stable Disease. The criterion is defined as: Objective Progression(PD):20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed, with a minimum absolute increase of 5mm; Stable (SD): All target lesions must be assessed. Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds; symptomatic deterioration(Sym):Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time; Indeterminate (In):Progression has not been determined and one, or more non-target sites were not assessed, or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at baseline.</description>

          <title>Overall Number of Participants With Objective Tumor Response[Part 1]</title>
          <description>Objective tumor response, was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 by calculating the Overall Response Rate, and Prolonged Stable Disease. The criterion is defined as: Objective Progression(PD):20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed, with a minimum absolute increase of 5mm; Stable (SD): All target lesions must be assessed. Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds; symptomatic deterioration(Sym):Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time; Indeterminate (In):Progression has not been determined and one, or more non-target sites were not assessed, or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at baseline.</description>
          <population>Of all enrolled 31 patients who were treated, 1 participant from the 0.60mg/kg cohort and 1 participant from the 4.20mg/kg cohort did not have post-dose tumor evaluations for they were discontinued form study prior to having disease assessment .</population>
