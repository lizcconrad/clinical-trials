             to the pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.

             visit.

          -  An average composite score of at least 6 on the rTNSS and a minimum score of at least
             2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; and a minimum score of at least 2 for one of the remaining 3
             symptoms representing the last 3 days of the 7-day placebo lead-in period before the
             randomization visit and the morning of the first day.

             pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.
