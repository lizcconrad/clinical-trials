      The purpose of this study is to observe the clinical manifestation, Lab findings including
      chest CT scans, pathological findings and outcomes in chinese patients with pulminary
      vasculitis.

      Presentation of patient with suspected vasculitis

        1. Established diagnosis Clinical findings Laboratory workup Tissue biopsy Angiogram where
           appropriate

        2. Evaluating respiratory system Chest HRCT Pulmonary function test Bronchoscopy exam(BALF,
           TBB) Lung biopsy(needle biopsy, VAST)

        3. screening underlying damage to other system Paranasal sinus, vision &amp; audition Nervous
           system Kidney Gastrointestinal tract Heart &amp; vessel Skin Hematology Muscle, bone &amp; joint

        4. Treatment

        5. Prognosis

      Evaluation

        1. Study visits occurred at baseline; at weeks 4; and at 2, 4, 6,12,18,24,30 months.

        2. Disease activity was measured on the basis of the BVAS/WG and the physician's global
           assessment.

        3. Damage related to disease or treatment was scored according to the Vasculitis Damage
           Index (scores for this index range from 0 to 64, with higher scores in- dicating more
           severe damage).

        4. Health related quality of life was scored with the use of the Med- ical Outcomes Study
           36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).Scores on this scale range from 0 to 100, with
           higher scores indicating better health.

        5. Serial serum samples were tested for proteinase 3-ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA by means
           of a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
