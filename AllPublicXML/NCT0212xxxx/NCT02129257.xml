      The AMALTHEA (Aflibercept MAintenance after first-Line THErapy with FOLFIRI+Aflibercept in
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients) trial is an investigator-initiated, single arm,
      open-label, phase II study. Patients with histologically proven metastatic colorectal
      carcinoma will be treated with a combination of FOLFIRI and aflibercept for 6 months. Both
      Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild type (wt) and mutant (mut) patients
      wil be enrolled. In the absence of Progressive Disease (PD) after 6 months of the combination
      of chemotherapy and aflibercept, the patient will be treated with a maintenance therapy with
      aflibercept alone until PD or unacceptable toxicity, investigator's decision or patient's
      refusal of further treatment or death, whichever comes first.

      Statistical hypotheses and sample size calculation:

      It is estimated that the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1year will be improved from
      33% (corresponding to a median PFS of 7.5 months [null hypothesis]) to 47% (corresponding to
      a median PFS of 11 months [alternative hypothesis]) with the combination of first-line
      Folinic acid/5-Fluorouracil/Irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus aflibercept therapy in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Using the one-stage Fleming's design, in order to reject
      the null hypothesis in a one-sided test with a type I error of 5% and power 80%, 73 patients
      will be needed to enter the study.

      Analysis population:

        -  Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all patients who will have given their informed
           consent and who will have been correctly registered to the study

        -  Evaluable population for tumor response: all treated patients, without major protocol
           deviation, with at least one tumor evaluation while on treatment (except for early
           disease progression or death) and evaluable for response

        -  Safety population: the subset of the ITT population that took at least one dose of study
           medication

      Primary analysis:

      The primary efficacy parameter will be PFS rate at 1 year and it will be calculated in the
      ITT population.

      Analysis of secondary endpoints:

      Response to treatment will be described in a frequency table along with the corresponding
      percentages and 95% exact confidence intervals.

      Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate median PFS and overall survival (OS) values and
      95% confidence intervals. All of these analyses will be performed in the ITT population.
      Analysis for objective response rate (ORR) will additionally be presented in the evaluable
      population for tumor response.

      Adverse Events (AEs) of the safety population for the FOLFIRI-aflibercept treatment part and
      the maintenance therapy will be presented in frequency tables according to grade, along with
      the corresponding percentages (N, %).

      Exploratory endpoints:

      Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses will also be performed to explore
      prognostic factors among basic clinicopathological characteristics and evaluated biomarkers,
      with respect to PFS and OS. Time-to-event distributions for the expression of examined
      markers will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test.

      Formalin-fixed embedded tumor tissue blocks will be collected from the primaries or
      metastases for the immunohistochemical and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) study of key
      angiogenic effectors and regulators, such as: vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A),
      vascular endothelial growth factor A-121 (VEGFA-121), vascular endothelial growth factor
      A121b (VEGFA121b), short and long VEGFA isoforms, metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3),
      vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B), placental growth factor (PlGF), vascular
      endothelial growth factor-C (AVEGF-C), Semaphorins, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1),
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor 2 (VEGFR2), neuropilin 1 (NRP1), neuropilin 2 (NRP2), thrombospondin 1 (TSP1),
      thrombospondin 2 (TSP2), angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), Tie2, interleukin 8
      (IL8), CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1), CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)

      Pharmacokinetic(PK)/Pharmacodynamic analyses (PD) PK/PD assessments (plasma analytes, plasma
      free and VEGF-bound aflibercept) will be performed in all registered and treated patients at
      specified timepoints during both FOLFIRI-aflibercept induction and aflibercept maintenance
      therapy, to assess the free/bound aflibercept ratio over cycles and the potential correlation
      with clinical endpoints (safety and efficacy).
