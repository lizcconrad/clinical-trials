    <textblock>
      The cone beam image is a part of the radiotherapy treatment machine and uses lower energy
      xrays as the head of the radiotherapy machine moves around the patient in a circle. This
      takes pictures that give 3-dimensional information, somewhat like a CT scan. These images are
      better at showing the position of the tumour and surrounding soft tissues than the standard
      xrays that were previously used. Cone Beam Imaging Technology is not new and has been used
      regularly at The Christie for many years. The standard cone beam scan is taken before the
      actual radiotherapy treatment or after the treatment has been delivered.

      Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT or Arc Radiotherapy) is a novel method of delivering
      radiotherapy that involves the continuous movement of the radiotherapy treatment machine head
      around the patient and MLC during radiation. Arc radiotherapy has been clinically implemented
      at The Christie for prostate radiotherapy treatments and work is in progress for
      implementation in lung radiotherapy. The continuous gantry rotation inherent to VMAT delivery
      makes this simultaneous imaging possible, although there are concerns associated with the
      impact that this may have on patient dose and image quality.

      The aim of this research is to assess whether the image quality of cone beam scans taken
      during treatment are as good as standard cone beam scans taken before or after treatment used
      to determine the accuracy of patient position and the tumour coverage by radiotherapy.
