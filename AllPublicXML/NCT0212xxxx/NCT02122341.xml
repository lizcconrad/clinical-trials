    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate BackStop, a polymer-based device that is
      intended to be used during ureteroscopic lithotripsy to prevent retrograde stone migration.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During ureteroscopic treatment for ureteral stones, lithotripsy, irrigation, and manipulation
      of the stone often pushes stone away into the kidney itself. This phenomenon is called
      retropulsion, which is defined as clinically significant retrograde migration of stone or
      stone fragments. Movement of stones retrograde into the renal pelvis could potentially add
      and complicate the surgery further. Often scopes need to be changed in order to reach the
      stone, and chasing these stones will add time to the surgery and require more valuable
      resources. Furthermore, sometimes a second operation will need to be done when these
      retropulsed fragments could not be all found and cleaned out.

      A number of devices have been developed to prevent such migration including stone baskets and
      conical devices. These are wire-based devices which have the potential of injuring the
      ureter. Because of safety concerns and that there is limited data available on the
      effectiveness of these devices; these are not widely used by urologists. BackStop has
      recently been developed as another tool to prevent retropulsion. It is a water soluble gel
      that is injected proximal to the stone. This creates a physical barrier that prevents stone
      migration during ureteroscopic lithotripsy for ureteral calculus.

    <description>BackStop™ is a FDA approved device. It is intended for use during ureteroscopic lithotripsy to prevent retrograde migration of stones and stone fragments. It is comprised of a solution of a thermosensitive polymer, a purified version of poloxamer 407 having been fractionated in saline. BackStop™, which is injected above the stone, is provided in sterile, pre-filled 2.5ml and 5ml syringes along with and a corresponding injector and a catheter (3F or 5F).</description>
