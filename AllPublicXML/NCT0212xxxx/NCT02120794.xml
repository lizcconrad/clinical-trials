    <textblock>
      The study objective is to demonstrate that home use of Threshold Suspend (TS) is not
      associated with glycemic deterioration in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, as
      measured by change in A1C.

      This study is a longitudinal, multi-center trial that aims to observe the Threshold Suspend
      (TS) feature with a sensor-augmented insulin pump in patients 7-15 years with Type 1
      diabetes. The study will measure the change in A1C from baseline over a period of one year
      while subjects are wearing the study pump.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is age 7 to 15 at time of screening

          2. Subject has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and must have been diagnosed
             for at least one year prior to screening

          3. Subject is currently transitioning from pump therapy, with or without continued
             glucose monitoring (CGM), to the 530G insulin pump system.

          4. Subject is willing to perform greater than or equal to 4 finger stick blood glucose
             measurements daily

          5. Subject is willing to perform required sensor calibrations

          6. Subject is willing to wear the system (Pump, glucose sensors, meter) continuously
             throughout the study

          7. Subject is willing to upload data every 21 days from the study pump

          8. Subject must have Internet access and access to a computer system that meets the
             requirements for uploading the pumps. This may include use of family or friend's
             computer system with Internet access.

          9. Subject is using either Humalog or Novolog at time of Screening and plans to use
             either of those insulins throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device) wherein
             he/she is receiving treatment from an investigational study drug or investigational
             study device.

          2. Women of child-bearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at screening or
             plan to become pregnant during the course of the study

          5. Subject has an abnormality (out of reference range) in thyroid-stimulating hormone
             (TSH) at time of screening visit; If TSH is out of range, Free T3 and Free T4 will be
             tested; subject may be included with TSH out of range as long as Free T3 and Free T4
             are in normal reference range.

          6. Subject has taken any oral, injectable, or IV steroids within 8 weeks from time of
             screening visit, or plans to take any oral, injectable, or IV steroids during the
             course of the study

         11. Subject has a sickle cell disease, hemoglobinopathy; or has received red blood cell
             transfusion or erythropoietin within 3 months prior to time of screening

         12. Subject plans to receive red blood cell transfusion or erythropoietin over the course
             of study participation

         13. Subject diagnosed with current eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia

         14. Subject has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease that results in chronic anemia

         15. Subject is on dialysis

         16. Subject is already on a 530G system with CGM for 8 days or more.
