  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of biomarkers that can predict the outcome of the surgical treatment (i.e. the
      rate of re-rupture) of tears in the rotator cuff tendon.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears (i.e. structural failure and tissue disruption in at least one of the four
      muscles and tendons that form the rotator cuff) are extremely common injuries and represent
      the most common muscle-tendon tear in patients. Repair of rotator cuff tears is usually
      advocated for painful tears with functional impairment. However, high failure rates of 13-68%
      have been reported for surgical repair of rotator cuff tears, irrespective of the surgical
      technique employed. Higher rates of re-rupture are associated with larger tears, increased
      patient age, and increased fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles. There is no general
      consensus as to the causes of re-rupture; where mechanical factors, the existing techniques
      of suturing, and biological factors are considered as the main factors of recurrence.

    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline), 3 months after surgery, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo a clinical and functional examination which includes the assessment of mobility, pain and abduction force of the affected and healthy shoulder using standardized tests (Constant score, Quick DASH, Quality of Life Score SF-12), the quantification of the volume (cm3) and fat content (Goutallier Stage) of the affected shoulder using magnet resonance imaging.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Molecular and cellular characteristics of the tissues affected by tears of the rotator cuff</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year after the last surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Before the surgery 10 mL of venous blood will be drawn from the patients and processed for the isolation of genomic DNA and the measure of selected single nuclear polymorphisms.
Biopsies (~10 mg) will be collected intra-operatively from the affected muscle, tendon, capsule and synovial liquid and stored at -80°C. Samples will be subjected to the immunohistochemical and biochemical quantification of the content (in arbitrary units) of selected proteins and tissue composition (as % of total volume).</description>

    <measure>Correlation between the molecular and cellular characteristics at the point in time of surgery, and the clinical (magnetic resonance imaging) outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year after the last surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship of the molecular and cellular parameters (measured as primary endpoints) of affected muscle with the clinical and functional measures of shoulder function will be investigated using Pearson correlation and mutual information analysis.</description>
