  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the effect of non-supine positioning in the treatment of surgical
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The hypothesis is that non-supine positioning will
      result in a decrease in acute hypoxic events, defined as the number of apneas/hypopneas per
      hour of sleep.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will comprise of two stages. Stage 1
      is a pilot study of 30 patients at high risk or diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea who
      are scheduled for routine surgery. These patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to standard of
      care (0 degree bed angle), 30 degree bed angle, or 60 degree bed angle. Acute hypoxic events
      will be analyzed pre and post-op in the randomly assigned bed position. PACU nurses will also
      be surveyed for patient-favored non-supine positioning (30 vs. 60 degrees). Stage 2 will be a
      larger, powered trial to evaluate the efficacy of just one bed angle (30 or 60 degrees) based
      on the Stage 1 results.
