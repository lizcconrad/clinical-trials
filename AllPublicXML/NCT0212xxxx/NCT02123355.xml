  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is high and POCD affect the life
      quality and the prognosis of patients. Geriatrics is the independent risk factor of POCD, and
      POCD is also correlated with many other factors such as type of surgery, the duration of
      anesthesia and the anesthesia drugs used et al. So, the prevention and treatment of POCD in
      geriatrics is important.

      Dexmedetomidine is found to have the effect of neuro-protection, but it is controversy
      whether Dexmedetomidine has the effect of neuro-protection in geriatrics, especially the
      prolonged surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of Dexmedetomidine to the cognitive
      function at prolonged surgery in geriatrics in geriatrics.

    <description>Modified Newman scale to assess the cognitive function, including five tests.
The quiet environment, enough daylight, no disturb is needed when the modified Newman scale is done. All the five tests are finished within 30 min.
all the score of each test of all the patients assessed before the surgery is calculated, then get the standard variation, the score of each subject of each test is compared with the standard deviation, if one or more stand deviation decrease, then the cognitive function is considered as deterioration .
When 2 or more of the tests is considered as deterioration, then the patients is diagnosed as Post Operation Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD).</description>
