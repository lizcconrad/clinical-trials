    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to design and implement an intensive discharge intervention for
      inpatients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and determine the effects of the
      intervention on post-discharge insulin adherence, glycemic control, cardiac medication
      adherence, hypoglycemic events, and emergency department visits and hospital readmissions.

    <description>The intervention is a multi-modal program consisting of the following:
Inpatient protocol for adjusting the discharge diabetes regimen;
Nurse practitioner &quot;discharge advocate&quot; to schedule follow-up appointments, prepare an after-hospital care plan, and patient education and counseling;
Inpatient pharmacist counseling (identifying and addressing previous barriers to medication adherence, performing enhanced medication reconciliation, and patient education);
Visiting nurse intervention after discharge;
Follow-up in a post-discharge clinic with the NP discharge advocate and pharmacist /certified diabetes educator within 3 days of discharge;
Telemonitoring of POC glucose levels to the study CDE, patient's PCP, or endocrinologist as appropriate; and
Follow-up with PCP or endocrinologist within 1 week of discharge.</description>
