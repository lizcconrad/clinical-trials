  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study,the investigators are looking to see how older women who are survivors of
      breast cancer and either did or did not receive chemotherapy are affected by treatment,
      compared to older women who have never had cancer. Thinking and memory abilities normally
      decrease with age and the investigators want to see if the long-term effects of cancer
      treatments may make these problems worse. The investigators will also look at how thinking
      and memory abilities of older women are affected by genetics and smoking history. Genetics
      and other factors may affect the brain's chemicals or structure, and may either protect
      against the negative effects on thinking or make someone more at risk for them.

We will screen participants to ensure that 50% of each group will report no smoking history and 50% will report a smoking history. Blood or buccal samples will be collected by trained staff one time at baseline. Those who choose not to provide the blood samples will be asked to provide a buccal sample as an alternative to test for APOE polymorphisms. Both patients and controls alive/deceased status will be tracked.</description>

        We propose to enroll 540 participants into the study across the 2 sites: 270 participants
        (approximately 180 patients and 90 controls) from MSK and 270 participants from City of
        Hope (approximately 180 patients, and 90 controls).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The neuropsychological assessments were designed and validated in English and are not
             currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other
             languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.
             Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the tests.
             Friend nominated, non-cancer controls will be frequency matched on age (+/- 5 years),
             education (less than college vs. some college and above), and race will be recruited
             using the same eligibility criteria as survivors except for no history of cancer.

        For cancer patients, eligibility includes:

          -  As per medical record or self-report, post-menopausal female

          -  As per medical record or self-report, age 60 or older at recruitment

          -  As per medical record or self-report, age 55 or older at the time of breast cancer
             diagnosis

          -  As per medical record or self report, for cancers other than breast cancer or
             non-melanoma/basal cell skin cancer/squamous cell skin cancer:
