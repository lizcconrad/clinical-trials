    <textblock>
      this study aims to verify the adequacy of doses of antibiotics prescribed in clinical
      practice for the treatment of ventilated acquired pneumonia (VAP) in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) with the pharmacodynamic efficacy criteria considered relevant literature. The impact
      of these pharmacodynamic parameters on the clinical and microbiological VAP will be
      evaluated.
