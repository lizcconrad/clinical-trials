  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to understand and to improve workers´ recovery from
      work stress. Although recovery during lunch breaks is the most common within-workday break,
      it has received only minor research attention. Therefore, we will study whether lunch breaks
      including a relaxation session or exposure to nature have more favorable outcomes than
      usually spent lunch breaks concerning: a) recovery processes, b) health, c) well-being, d)
      job performance and e) creativity. We approach recovery by combining the theoretical
      frameworks of work and environmental psychology.

      We conduct an intervention study in a sample of 200 knowledge-workers who engage in different
      lunch break activities for 15-minutes per day, two weeks in a row. We randomly assign
      participants to three experimental conditions: 1) exposure to nature, 2) relaxation and 3)
      control group (lunch break spent as usual). Online questionnaires before and after the
      intervention assess long term changes regarding recovery processes and the major outcome
      variables. Before, during and after the intervention, SMS and paper-pencil questionnaires
      measure the same constructs four times a day with fewer items. We also measure blood pressure
      and collect saliva samples to map cortisol excretion across the intervention period. A timed
      experimental task (i.e., the Alternative Uses Task) is used to examine differences in
      creativity between the three groups after the intervention period.

      By combining the knowledge of work and environmental psychology about recovery and
      restorative experiences, by merging three recovery perspectives (settings, processes, and
      outcomes) and by using data triangulation, we produce valid results that broaden our view on
      mechanisms underlying recovery and enhance our understanding about their links to
      psychological, behavioural and physiological outcomes, resulting in a more comprehensive
      picture of work stress recovery in general.
