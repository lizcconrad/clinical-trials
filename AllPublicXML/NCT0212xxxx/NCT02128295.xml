  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised trial of two modern single electric breast pumps allocated to mothers
      who are exclusively breast feeding their healthy term infants. Mothers will be recruited when
      their infants are around a month old, they will be randomised either to use one of two state
      of the art modern single electric breast pumps or to act as controls with no breast pump (but
      will receive a baby care voucher of similar value). If allocated to a breast pump, mothers
      will be asked to take part in a physiological study when their babies are 6 weeks old. In
      this test the mothers will be asked to express breast milk for 10 minutes on each breast. The
      primary hypothesis is that the total weight of milk produced in a 20 minute period and the
      weight of milk produced at 1 minute intervals at age 6 weeks will be greater for mothers
      using one of the pumps. A small sample of breast milk (~5ml) will be collected for analysis,
      the remaining expressed milk will returned to the mother.

      Each month between the age of 3 and 6 months, all the mothers will be asked to complete
      online questionnaires about their breast-feeding and the use of their breast pumps (if they
      have one). At the end of the six months the mothers will be given a small voucher for a
      child-care store as a way of saying 'thank-you' for the inconvenience caused.
