  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WHO recommends to take TB drugs while fasting: if TB drugs are taken with food, perhaps drug
      concentrations are too low; on the other hand: if this is not tolerated, drugs could also be
      taken with food.

      Do lower drug concentrations - with improved adherence to therapy - outweigh the disadvantage
      of lower drug blood concentrations over time? How exactly do the drug concentrations over
      time (pharmacokinetics) compare between fasting and fed conditions, especially in the early
      stage of TB treatment when patients are relatively sick, and relatively poorly tolerate TB
      drugs?

      To evaluate the influence of concomitant food ingestion on the pharmacokinetics of HRZE in
      newly diagnosed TB patients To evaluate the influence of early disease on the PK parameters
      of HRZE in TB patients To compare the pharmacokinetics of HRZE in the early stage of disease
      with the pharmacokinetics of HRZE in more stable condition in newly diagnosed TB patients To
      evaluate adverse events of HRZE in TB patients
