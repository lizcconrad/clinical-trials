  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether CVC exposures are altered in subjects with impaired hepatic function,
      compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The results will help guide the clinical
      use of CVC in patients with hepatic impairment, determine the extent of PK changes, if any,
      and identify the potential need for dose adjustments of CVC in this population.
