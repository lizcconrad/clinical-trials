    <description>The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) is a validated health-related quality of life measure for CF that meets US Food and Drug Administration psychometric requirements for patient reported outcomes. It contains both generic and CF-specific scales and has demonstrated responsiveness in previous clinical studies.</description>
