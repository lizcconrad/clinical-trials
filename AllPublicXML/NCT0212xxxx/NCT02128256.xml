  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical management of long bone infections is often challenging. Adequate surgical
      debridement decreases the bacterial load, removes dead tissues, and gives a chance for the
      host immune system and antibiotics to arrest infection. Adequate debridement may leave a
      large bony defect. An appropriate management of the dead space is essential to arrest the
      disease, and for maintenance of the bone's integrity. The current strategy includes the use
      of antibiotic-loaded bone cement that can be used to sterilize and temporarily maintain the
      dead space. The cement are usually removed after 2 to 4 weeks and replaced with a cancellous
      graft harvested from the hip of the patient.

      CERAMENT™| G is a CE-marked resorbable ceramic bone graft substitute composed by calcium
      sulfate and calcium hydroxyapatite, intended to fill gaps and voids in the skeleton system
      and to promote bone healing. The antibiotic gentamicin is included in the ceramic to prevent
      colonization of gentamicin-sensible microorganisms in order to protect bone healing.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the device absorption and bone in-growth of
      CERAMENT™| G in a surgically revised bone infection. In addition, bone healing and infection
      non-recurrence will be evaluated during 12 months of follow-up. The investigators expect a
      treatment success of &gt;90 % and that a similar bone healing will be obtained as with a
      standard two-stage surgical procedure. In addition, the investigators believe that the use of
      CERAMENT™| G will be of advantage for the patient as bone healing will be achieved with a
      one-stage surgical procedure (in combination with antibiotic therapy), instead of a two-stage
      procedure, thus decreasing potential surgery-related complications.
