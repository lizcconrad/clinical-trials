    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of LBSA0103 (BDDE cross-linked sodium hyaluronate gel) when
      it is administered for the second time 26 weeks after its first administration in patients
      with osteoarthritis of the knee.

      The Safety and efficacy of 26weeks after its first administration will be also evaluated.
