  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blockade of the femoral nerve (FNB) is the most common postoperative pain therapy after
      total knee replacement. Because of motor-driven weakness of the quadriceps muscle induced by
      femoral nerve block mobilization of Patients is difficult even dangerous (falls) and hospital
      stays are extended.

      An alternative method could be an adductor canal block (ACB). Anatomical studies of the
      adductor canal demonstrated that the adductor canal contains the saphenous nerve, a pure
      sensory nerve for medial and anterior aspects of the knee and the tibia without any motor
      function.

      This prospective, double-blinded, randomized study investigates the effect of FNB and ACB on
      quadriceps motor weakness and analgesia determined by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

      We expect the ACB to be superior in muscle strength but equal in pain score. Both groups
      receive an additional anterior sciatic nerve block for complete sensory block of the operated
      knee
