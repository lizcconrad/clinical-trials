    <textblock>
      This study aim to investigate Changes in tumor tissue and serum biomarkers before and after
      cetuximab combined with preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced thoracic middle-lower
      segment esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.We want to find one or more effective biomarkers
      to predict and evaluate the patients who will be benefit from cetuximab combined with
      preoperative radiotherapy.
