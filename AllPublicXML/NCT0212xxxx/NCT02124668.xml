        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Subject has ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone
             (GnRH) analogue (agonist or antagonist) and plans to maintain throughout the study
             period or has had a prior orchiectomy (i.e., surgical or medical castration)

          -  Subject has had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic
             castration-resistant prostate cancer with at least one regimen containing docetaxel

          -  Subject has progressive disease and indication for change of antineoplastic regimen

          -  Subject has no known or suspected brain metastasis

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

          -  Subject is able to swallow the study drug and comply with study requirements

          -  There is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to treat the subject's
             disease

          -  Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has severe concurrent disease, infection, or co-morbidity that would make the
             subject inappropriate for enrollment

          -  Subject's absolute neutrophil count is &lt; 1000/μL, or platelet count &lt; 100,000/μL, or
             hemoglobin &lt; 6.2 mmol/L (or &lt; 10 g/dL)

          -  Subject's total bilirubin is ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for subjects
             with documented Gilbert's disease) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) is ≥ 2.5x ULN

          -  Subject's estimated creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min by the Cockcroft and
             Gault formula

          -  Subject has albumin ≤ 30 g/L (or ≤ 3.0 g/dL)

          -  Subject has received anti-androgen therapy (e.g. bicalutamide), chemotherapy, or
             biologic therapy for prostate cancer (other than bone targeted agents such as
             bisphosphonates or denosumab, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy,
             or glucocorticoids which are allowed) within 4 weeks of Day 1

          -  Subject has had prior use of abiraterone

          -  Subject has prior use, or participation in a clinical trial, of an investigational
             agent that blocks androgen synthesis (e.g. TAK-700) or targets the androgen receptor
             (e.g. ARN-509, ODM-201)

          -  Subject has:

               1. A history of seizure, including any febrile seizure or any condition that may
                  predispose to seizure including, but not limited to underlying brain injury,
                  stroke, primary brain tumors, brain metastases,

               2. A history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months
                  of Screening

          -  Subject has clinical signs suggestive of high or imminent risks for pathological
             fracture, spinal cord compression and/or cauda equina syndrome

          -  Subject has a significant cardiovascular disease

          -  Subject has received investigational therapy within 28 days or 5 half lives, whichever
             is longer, prior to Screening

          -  Subject has undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Screening

          -  Subject has shown a hypersensitivity reaction to the active pharmaceutical ingredient
             or any of the capsule components, including Labrasol, butylated hydroxyanisole, and
             butylated hydroxytoluene

          -  Subject has used or plans to use, from 30 days prior to enrollment through the end of
             the study, medications known to lower the seizure threshold or prolong the QT interval
