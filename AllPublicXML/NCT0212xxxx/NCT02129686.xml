      This study is being done to evaluate the potential benefits of using acupuncture to reduce
      symptoms of tingling, burning, numbness and pain in the hands and feet of women with
      peripheral neuropathy after completion of chemotherapy for breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer can cause temporary or permanent damage to the nerves
      in the hands and feet, a condition called &quot;chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&quot;. The
      most common symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are pain, tingling,
      burning or numbness sensation, which can lead to balance problems or trouble using fingers or
      pick up/holding things. These symptoms often last months to years after the completion of
      chemotherapy. Medications and nutritional supplements can ease the symptoms of
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, but many patients continue to experience symptoms
      despite these treatments.

      Acupuncture is an intervention in which hair-thin, stainless steel needles are shallowly
      inserted into specific points on the skin, with the goal of influencing the body's natural
      healing system. Acupuncture has been studied in clinical trials in cancer patients and has
      been shown to be effective for various conditions including chemotherapy-induced nausea and
      vomiting. A few preliminary studies have suggested that acupuncture may help to reduce
      symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but more information is needed about the benefits of
      acupuncture in breast cancer patients This study is being done to evaluate the potential
      benefits of using acupuncture to reduce symptoms of tingling, burning, numbness and pain in
      the hands and feet of women with peripheral neuropathy after completion of chemotherapy for
      breast cancer.

      This research study will help to determine the benefits of acupuncture for the treatment of
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The study will also look at two different
      acupuncture schedules to determine whether patients derive benefits from lower and higher
      dose acupuncture treatments.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PNQ includes two questionnaire items: one asking about sensory neurotoxicity and the other asking about motor neurotoxicity. The questionnaire items correspond to the neurotoxicity questions included in the NCI-CTCAE. PNQ grades range from grade A (no neuropathy) to grade E (very severe neuropathy). Answer options will be coded 0=A to 4=E, with a higher score indicating more severe CIPN</description>

    <description>Comprised of three subscales assessing sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms. Subscale scores will be calculated and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores suggesting more severe symptoms. Changes from baseline (8-week - baseline) between the intervention arms for each subscale will be of interest.</description>

    <description>Immediate acupuncture arm will receive acupuncture 3 times per week during week 1 and week 2, then 2 times per week from week 2 to week 8 for a total of 18 sessions. The crossover will take place after 8th week.
The immediate acupuncture arm will enter a follow-up phase without acupuncture for 8 weeks from week 9 to week 16, while the standard usual care will be provided.</description>

    <description>The patients on the usual care/delayed acupuncture arm will continue their standard usual care with their physicians and care team. The crossover will take place after 8th week. After crossover, the patients initially on the usual care/delayed acupuncture arm will receive the identical acupuncture protocol but a less frequent schedule from week 9 to week 16: 2 times per week at week 9, then 1 time per week from week 10 to week 16 for a total of 9 sessions</description>
