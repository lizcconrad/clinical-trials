      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of febuxostat 40 mg extended
      release (XR) and 80 mg XR in comparison with febuxostat 40 mg immediate release (IR) and 80
      mg IR, respectively, in gout participants with moderate renal impairment.

      The drug being tested in this study is called febuxostat. Febuxostat is being tested to
      decrease and maintain serum urate in people who have gout with moderate renal impairment.
      This study will look at serum urate levels in people who take febuxostat extended release
      (XR) capsules compared to febuxostat immediate release (IR) capsules and placebo.

      The study will enroll approximately 200 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the five treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Febuxostat 40 mg XR

        -  Febuxostat 80 mg XR

        -  Febuxostat 40 mg IR

        -  Febuxostat 80 mg IR

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study, and will be asked to call an interactive voice response system any time they are
      having a gout flare up. In addition to study medication, participants will also take 0.6 mg
      of colchicine every other day or naproxen 250 mg twice a day with lansoprazole 15 mg once a
      day to prevent gout flare ups.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to approximately 4 months and participants will make up to 7
      visits to the clinic.
