  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study tested the hypothesis that Platform Switching (PS) and Regular Platform
      (RP) implants would have different outcomes in the bilateral single tooth replacements
      against the alternative hypothesis of no difference.

      This study was designed as a randomised, controlled, split-mouth trial. Eighteen patients,
      with bilaterally missing single bicuspid or molar had one of the sites to be restored
      randomly assigned to be treated according to the platform-switching concept with (PS group),
      or with matching implant-abutment diameters, (RP group). A total of 36 implants, (18 Nobel
      Replace Tapered Groovy PS, 18 Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy), were bilaterally installed. All
      the implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 35 and 45 Ncm, in healed healthy
      bone and the healing abutment was connected at the same time. Both implants were delayed
      loaded with screw retained temporary crowns 3 months after implant insertion and with screw
      retained definitive crowns 2 months later. Outcome measures were implant survival, biological
      and prosthetic complications, radiographic marginal bone-level changes, soft tissue
      parameters (PPD and BOP). Clinical data were collected at baseline 6 and 12 months.
      Statistical analyses were conducted using computational program SAS (version 9.2), with
      1-away ANOVA and F-test. Statistical significance was tested at the 0.05 probability level,
      and all values were presented as mean and standard deviation with 95% confidence intervals.

    <description>Marginal bone levels: Peri-implant marginal bone levels were evaluated on intraoral digital radiographs taken with the parallel technique at the time of implant placement, at 6 months and 12 months.
If radiographs were inconclusive, they were repeated. A blinded radiologist (F.G.), unaffiliated with the study centre, interpreted all radiographs. The distances from the mesial and distal interproximal bone to the reference point (the horizontal interface between the implant and abutment) were measured with a software measurement tool (NIH Scion Image programme version 4.0.2, Frederick, MD, USA) calibrated against the space between two threads to the nearest 0.1 mm, and the mean of these two measurements was calculated for each implant. The measurements were recorded with reference to the implant axis.</description>

    <description>Peri-implant mucosal response: Probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were measured by a blinded operator (A.D.) with a periodontal probe (PCP-UNC 15, Hu-Friedy Manufacturing, Chicago, IL, USA) at 6 and 12 months. Three vestibular and 3 lingual values were collected for every implant by the same dentist.</description>

    <description>This study was designed as a randomised, controlled, split-mouth trial. all enrolled patients needed single bilateral fixed implant-supported prosthesis in molar area.
A total of 18 consecutive patients were enrolled. In each eligible patient, the right molar was randomly selected to receive either Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy implant; (Nobel Biocare®, Goteborg, Sweden) with Platform Switching (PS) or Regular Platform (RP)</description>
