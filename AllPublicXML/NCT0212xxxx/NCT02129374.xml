    <textblock>
      Lumbar spondylolysis is a relatively common condition that causes severe and perennial back
      pain in young populations. Conservative treatment of this condition may be futile, and may
      eventually require surgical treatment such as direct repair of pars defect and a segmental
      lumbar fusion with an anterior or posterior approach. Recently, of surgical treatment methods
      for spondylolysis, direct repair surgery of pars defect has been focused due to its inherited
      strengths. Most importantly, fusion surgery caused the affected segment to lose the nature
      range of motion and furthermore adjacent segment to be adversely affecting such as adjacent
      disc disease or degeneration, while direct repair theoretically could preserve the motion of
      the affected segment, which do not cause the adjacent segment problems as being the fusion
      surgery, as well as could produce better surgical outcomes with relatively less invasive
      technique as compared to fusion surgery. Moreover, previous articles have demonstrated that
      the direct repair surgery for spondylolysis of lumbar spine could achieve great functional
      and radiological outcomes. However, most of the previous studies was conducted using lower
      level designed study such as retrospective and small sample size, thereby prior literature
      does not provide clear information on the therapeutic outcome of direct repair for lumbar
      spondylolysis, especially for managing spondylolysis of young population.

      Therefore, The investigators aimed to evaluate and determine the outcomes of direct repair
      surgery for lumbar spondylolysis in young population. To our knowledge, this is the first
      report that describes the functional and radiological outcomes of direct repair for
      spondylolysis in young populations with prospective cohort study design and relatively large
      sample size.
