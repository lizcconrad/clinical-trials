    <textblock>
      Walking Meditation training would yield more favorable adaptations than walking alone in
      improving glycemic control and vascular function in patients with type 2 diabetes.

    <measure>Change from baseline in glycemic control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The glycemic control will be quantified using blood samples. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and insulin will be measured with standard procedures at the clinical laboratory (Bria Lab, Bangkok, Thailand).Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), the parameter for insulin resistance, will be calculated by using equation of [Fasting glucose (mg/dL) × Insulin level (uU/mL) / 405].</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in vascular reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular reactivity or brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) will be assessed with the ultrasound equipment (CX50, Philips, USA), using the blood occlusion technique on the right forearm. The brachial artery will be imaged above the antecubital fossa in the longitudinal plane. Baseline data will be monitored and the cuff placed around the right forearm will be inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure for 5 minutes and then deflated for 5 minutes of recovery. FMD will be calculated from the formula FMD=(D2-D1)x100/D1 when D1 is the brachial artery diameter at baseline, D2 is the maximal post-occlusion brachial artery diameter</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma cortisol will be measured with standard procedures at the certified clinical laboratory (BRIA Lab, Bangkok, Thailand).
Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured using the Heart rate variability analyzer SA-3000P, Medicore Co.,Ltd, Korea</description>

    <description>Body composition will be measured using Body Composition Analyzer (Model ioi 353, Jawon Medical Co. Ltd., Korea).
Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) will be assessed by Modified Bruce Protocol for treadmill test with Stationary Gas Analyzer (Vmax™ Encore 29 system, Yorba Linda, CA).
Lower muscle strength will be measured with back and leg dynamometer.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Peripheral arterial stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse wave velocity measurement will be assessed with MD6 bidirectional transcutaneous Doppler probe (Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA). All subjects were monitored with an EKG and PWV measurements in the computer and used as timing markers for PWV identification.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in ankle-brachial index.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle-brachial index will be evaluated with a manual MD6 bidirectional transcutaneous Doppler probe (Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA) and will be calculated by dividing the highest ankle systolic blood pressure by the highest brachial systolic blood pressure.</description>

    <description>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) will be measured in plasma samples with the ELISA kit (Human IL-6 high sensitivity ELISA, eBioscience, Austria).
Nitric oxide (NO) will be measured in plasma samples with the commercial assay kit (Colorimetric nitric oxide assay kit, PromoKine, Germany).</description>

    <description>Walking Meditation training program will be based on aerobic walking exercise combined with Buddhist meditation. The subjects will perform walking on the treadmill while concentrated on foot stepping by voiced &quot;Budd&quot; and &quot;Dha&quot; with each foot step that contacted the floor to practice mindfulness while walking. Walking Meditation will be conducted at mild to moderate intensity (50-60% maximum heart rate) and in phase 2 (week 7-12), the training intensity will be increased to moderate intensity (60-70% maximum heart rate). In both phases the training will be performed for 30 minutes, 3 times per week.</description>
