    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Corneal Staining Score With Fluorescein in the Worse Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Total corneal staining with fluorescein is measured in the worse eye utilizing the Ora CalibraTM Corneal Flourescein Staining Scale (0 to 4 scale where 0=no staining and 4= severe staining). The sum of the total includes 3 regions of the cornea, resulting in a maximum possible score of 12 (severe staining score of 4 in all three regions). A negative change from baseline represents a decrease in staining (improvement). A positive change from baseline represents an increase in staining (worsening).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Reading on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI consists of 12 questions measuring the presence of ocular symptoms. The reading question is assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time; 4=all of the time). The reading score is converted to a 0-100 score where 0 is best and 100 is worst. Higher OSDI reading scores are associated with greater severity. A negative number change from baseline indicates improvement and a positive number change from baseline indicates worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tear Film Break-up Time in the Worse Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>TFBUT is defined as the time required for dry spots to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film. A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement and a negative number change from baseline indicates a worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Interblink Interval in the Worse Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The interblink interval measures the time (seconds) between blinks in the worse eye. A positive number change from baseline indicates a worsening (more frequent blinks) and a negative number change from baseline (less frequent blinks) indicates an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Conjunctival Redness in the Worse Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival redness is scored in the worse eye on a numeric analog scale ranging from 0=None to 4=Extremely Severe (0.5 increments were allowed).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Corneal Staining Score With Fluorescein in the Worse Eye</title>
        <description>Total corneal staining with fluorescein is measured in the worse eye utilizing the Ora CalibraTM Corneal Flourescein Staining Scale (0 to 4 scale where 0=no staining and 4= severe staining). The sum of the total includes 3 regions of the cornea, resulting in a maximum possible score of 12 (severe staining score of 4 in all three regions). A negative change from baseline represents a decrease in staining (improvement). A positive change from baseline represents an increase in staining (worsening).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Conjunctival Staining Score With Fluorescein in the Worse Eye</title>
        <description>Total conjunctival staining with fluorescein is measured in the worse eye utilizing the Ora CalibraTM Conjunctiva Flourescein Staining Scale (0 to 4 scale where 0=no staining and 4= severe staining). The sum of the total includes 2 regions of the conjunctiva, resulting in a maximum possible score of 8 (severe staining score of 4 in both regions). A negative change from baseline represents a decrease in staining (improvement). A positive change from baseline represents an increase in staining (worsening).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Watching TV on the OSDI</title>
        <description>The OSDI consists of 12 questions measuring the presence of ocular symptoms. The watching TV question is assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time; 4=all of the time). The watching TV score is converted to a 0-100 score where 0 is best and 100 is worst. Higher OSDI reading scores are associated with greater severity. A negative number change from baseline indicates improvement and a positive number change from baseline indicates worsening.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Tear Film Break-up Time in the Worse Eye</title>
          <description>TFBUT is defined as the time required for dry spots to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film. A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement and a negative number change from baseline indicates a worsening.</description>
