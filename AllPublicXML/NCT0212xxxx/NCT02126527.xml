    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of auranofin and sirolimus
      when given together in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Immunosuppressive
      therapy, such as auranofin and sirolimus, may be an effective treatment for non-small cell
      lung cancer. Sirolimus may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving auranofin and sirolimus may be an effective treatment
      for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of auranofin plus sirolimus (Cohort I).

      II. To determine the confirmed response rate of auranofin plus sirolimus (Cohort II).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event and toxicity profiles associated with this treatment
      combination.

      II. To evaluate response, time to progression, progression-free survival (PFS), overall
      survival (OS), and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this treatment
      combination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate tumor biomarkers of protein kinase C (PKC) and mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling activity as predictors of clinical outcome (i.e. response, PFS, OS) for
      patients receiving auranofin/sirolimus therapy.

      II. To evaluate the use of surrogate biomarkers of PKC and mTOR inhibition in peripheral
      blood lymphocytes (PBLs) as predictors of clinical outcome (i.e. response, PFS, OS) for
      patients receiving auranofin/sirolimus therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a cohort I, dose-escalation study followed by a cohort II study.

      Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) once daily (QD) and sirolimus PO QD on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.
