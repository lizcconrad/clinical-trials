      The study aims to assess the effects of the SMS Mother Reminder system on use of health care
      in Uganda. A secondary aim of the study is to determine the behavioral factors and
      cost-effectiveness, as well as test the usability of the SMS Mother Reminder in Uganda.

      USAID/Uganda is commissioning a prospective impact evaluation of the initial SMS component of
      Uganda's National Health Record Program (NHRP) in order to inform strategic targeting of
      eHealth and future investments after the pilot phase of the NHRP mobile platform &quot;SMS Mother
      Reminder&quot;. This impact evaluation will be designed to answer the following questions:

      Primary evaluation question:

      â€¢ What is the effect on maternal health outcomes (ANC4 and IPTP2) of the village health
      teams' use of the SMS Mother Reminder system?

      Secondary evaluation questions:

        -  What factors most influence changes in health workers, village health teams and
           expectant women's knowledge, attitudes and practices in maternal health?

        -  To what extent is using the SMS Mother Reminder application to track and inform pregnant
           women a cost-effective intervention from the perspectives of USAID?

        -  To what extent can users easily carry out specific tasks (e.g. entering the information
           of pregnant women) of the SMS Mother Reminder application on mobile devices?

      This study is funded by USAID through the African Strategies for Health project.

    <description>The study is prospective and interventional comparing differences between pregnant women who receive reminder messages via the SMS Mother Reminder system to those who are not. Pregnant women will be followed from their first ANC visit at a health facility through delivery. The study will examine the effect of the mobile phone intervention on attendance to ANC appointments and IPTP2 coverage. The intervention group will be composed of pregnant women receiving SMS reminder messages in comparison with a control group of pregnant women receiving no intervention (i.e. no SMS reminders).</description>
