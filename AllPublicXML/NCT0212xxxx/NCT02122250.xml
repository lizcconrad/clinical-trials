  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will address vital questions regarding how best to design web-based materials
      for the growing population of patients with basic literacy and computer skills but lower
      levels of health literacy, building on our previous experience of developing web-based
      materials for people with lower levels of literacy and health literacy.

      This study will be carried out two phases. Phase 1 will use qualitative methods to understand
      user experiences of the web-based materials through observational 'think-aloud' interviews
      with users. Phase 2 will test the newly developed web-based materials to a static
      (non-interactive) version of the materials online.
