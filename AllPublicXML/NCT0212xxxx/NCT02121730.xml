  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is now the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
      Between 2800 and 3000 kidney transplants are performed each year in France and more than 33
      000 patients are living with a functioning graft.

      Preventing allograft rejection requires the use of immunosuppressive therapy, the intensity
      decreases as the distance from the day of transplantation. Unfortunately, treatment favors
      certain complications, including infectious and neoplastic. These represent a major cause of
      mortality in these patients. If the frequency of skin cancer is greatly increased in this
      population, that of solid tumors remains a concern. Approximately 20% of patients develop
      cancer after 10 years of graft , half non- skin cancers, the main risk factor is
      immunosuppressive therapy .

      The aim of the study is to evaluate, in a large population of patients treated in 4 regions (
      the Nord-Pas de Calais, the Upper and Lower Normandy and Picardy) risk factors (in particular
      the nature of the immunosuppressive treatment) of developing a neoplastic complication, skin
      cancers and solid tumors, after renal transplantation.

      A retrospective analysis of the previous 10 years, from 2002 to 2011 will be conducted. This
      study will better understand the epidemiology of these complications but also allow to
      identify risk factors associated, including demographic, environmental and related to
      immunosuppressive therapy.

      Thereafter, we hope to implement preventive measures or prospective studies, allowing us to
      reduce the prevalence of this complication.
