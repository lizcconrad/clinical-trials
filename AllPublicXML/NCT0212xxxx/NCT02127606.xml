  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extended periods of tilt table standing have been observed to improve spasticity in
      individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effect of three sessions of whole body vibration while tilt table standing on spasticity in
      individuals with a complete or incomplete SCI above the neurological level of T10.
      Participants in this study will undergo whole body vibration while standing on a tilt table
      for a total of approximately 14 minutes for a total of 3 sessions on 3 separate days.
      Spasticity monitoring will be evaluated prior to and after the intervention with the Modified
      Penn Spasm Frequency Scale, an interview to obtain the individual's perception and impression
      of the effect of whole body vibration on the performance of activities of daily living,
      quality of life, pain scale, and global impression of change.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive.

          -  The subject has neurological impairment secondary to a spinal cord injury that
             occurred at least six (6) months prior to the study that can be categorized as either
             a complete or incomplete spinal cord injury.

          -  The neurological level of lesion is above T10.

          -  The subject has self-reported stable moderate to severe spasticity (Modified Ashworth
             Score scale at or greater than a 2 at the hips or knees). Patients can be enrolled if
             on a stable dose of oral medications or intrathecal medications.

          -  The subject has self reported spasticity that negatively impacts his or her quality of
             life, impairs ability to perform activities of daily living (such as transfers,
             sitting, sleep, wheelchair use, and hobbies).

          -  The subject is able to stand with the assistance of a tilt table at a minimum of 70
             degrees for 45 minutes without significant orthostasis or other adverse events or
             symptoms.

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with the protocol.

          -  The subject is able to and has voluntarily given informed consent prior to the
             performance of any study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject does not self report lower limb spasticity.

          -  The subject does not have self reported spasticity that negatively impacts his or her
             quality of life, impairs ability to perform activities of daily living (such as
             transfers, sitting, sleep, wheelchair use, and hobbies).

          -  The subject experiences symptoms consistent with infection, including but not limited
             to fever, chills, dysuria, gallbladder or kidney stones.

          -  The subject experiences pain that is not well controlled with consistent pain
             medication use.

          -  The subject has recent thromboembolism, diabetes mellitus, intractable hypertension or
             cardiac/pulmonary instability, internal fixation implants, acute thrombosis,
             pregnancy, acute inflammation of the locomotor system including active arthrosis or
             arthropathy, acute tendinopathy, acute hernia, acute discopathy, recent post-surgical
             wounds, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, or recent fractures&lt;6 months.

          -  The subject has a lumbar spinal hardware or artificial joints in the lower
             extremities.

          -  The subject is participating in any experimental studies that could alter the
             patient's spasticity.

          -  The subject has a concomitant brain injury or other cognitive deficits that would
             preclude following instructions.

          -  The subject has skin breakdown in areas receiving direct pressure during tilt table
             standing.

          -  The subject has any medical condition, including psychiatric disease that would
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results or the conduct of the study.
