  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure is a standard staging technique in several types of
      cancer. One of the major problems of SLN mapping in colorectal cancer is the lack of an
      optimal dye and technique for identification of the nodes. In this study the investigators
      used the Near-Infrared (NIR) dye Indocyanin Green (ICG) to identify nodes with a newly
      developed NIR laparoscope. The investigators compared two different injection techniques;
      subserosal and submucosal injection.

      Patients planned for a laparoscopic resection of a colorectal carcinoma without distant
      metastases were included. Dye was injected in the subserosa or submucosa of the bowel. Ten
      minutes after injection the investigators searched for fluorescent nodes with the NIR
      laparoscope. Fluorescent nodes were harvested and analyzed by the pathologist using H&amp;E and
      additional immunohistochemistry.
