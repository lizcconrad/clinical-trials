    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial aims to assess feasibility and tolerability of using an LINAC based
      &quot;organ-sparing marrow-targeted irradiation&quot; to condition patients with high-risk
      hematological malignancies who are otherwise ineligible to undergo myeloablative Total body
      irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant. The target
      patient populations are those with ALL, AML, MDS who are either elderly (&gt;50 years of age)
      but healthy, or younger patients with worse medical comorbidities (HCT-Specific Comorbidity
      Index Score (HCT-CI) &gt; 4). The goal is to have the patients benefit from potentially more
      efficacious myeloablative radiation based conditioning approach without the side effects
      associated with TBI.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess feasibility and tolerability of OSMI based hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) as defined by transplant-related mortality (TRM) at day 30 as well as rate of grade
      II/III organ toxicity (defined by Bearman Regimen-Related Toxicities Scale) attributable to
      conditioning occurring within 30 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Day 100 transplant-related mortality (TRM). II. Donor chimerism assessment at day 100 (to
      assess failure of engraftment rate).

      III. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) by day 100. IV. Incidence of
      chronic GVHD at one year. V. Cumulative incidence of grade II organ toxicity through day 100.
      VI. Rate and kinetics of hematopoietic recovery. VII. Incidence of graft failure (primary and
      secondary). VIII. Rate of infectious complications. IX. Cumulative incidence of relapse,
      overall survival, and progression-free survival at 1 year.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo organ-sparing marrow irradiation twice daily (BID) on
      days -6 to -4 and receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours every 24 hours
      on days -3 to -2. Patients with an unrelated donor also receive anti-thymocyte globulin every
      24 hours on days -4 to -2.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) beginning on day -1 and
      continuing for at least 6 months and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell or bone marrow
      transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 12 weeks, at day
      100, and then at 6 and 12 months.

             leukemia (ALL), or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with fewer than 10% myeloblasts or
             lymphoblasts in the bone marrow and no blasts in the peripheral blood on morphologic
             analysis performed within 30 days of start of the conditioning regimen; if remission
             bone marrow is available beyond 30 days a new bone marrow evaluation is required to
             assess remission status

               -  The diagnosis of AML, ALL, or MDS will be based on World Health Organization
                  (WHO) criteria

               -  Pre-transplant bone marrow sample must be evaluable for assessment of remission
                  status (i.e. aspirate smear containing particles and/or evaluable bone marrow
                  core biopsy)

               -  Patients with leukemia infiltration in the central nervous system (CNS) are

                  the start of conditioning regimen must be at least 30 days

               -  Interval between completing treatment with a hypomethylating agent or other
                  non-cytotoxic chemotherapy and the start of conditioning regimen must be at least
                  10 days

          -  Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index score (HCT-CI) =&lt; 4 for
