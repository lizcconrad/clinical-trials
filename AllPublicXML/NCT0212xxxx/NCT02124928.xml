  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the association of sonographic and histological
      features of the plaque among each other and with biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. The
      predictive value of these factors concerning the long-term clinical outcome after carotid
      endarterectomy will also be assessed. This may help to improve the identification of patients
      with carotid artery stenosis who will benefit most from carotid endarterectomy. The
      investigators major hypothesis is that the morphology of carotid plaques is associated with
      objectifiable sonographic parameters, in particular with the greyscale median. Second, the
      investigators hypothesize that sonographic and histological plaque morphology are associated
      with certain biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Identification of 'vulnerable plaques' on the
      basis of a peripheral blood draw and a sonographic investigation may enable the treating
      physician to focus resources on patients who will benefit most form therapeutic interventions
      for primary prevention of ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The indication for revascularization of carotid artery stenoses is typically based on the
      degree of stenosis and the presence of symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of
      embolization from an atherosclerotic plaque may be associated with plaque density as assessed
      sonographically by determination of the greyscale median. Also, an association of serum
      proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and
      pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), matrix metalloproteinases 2, 8 and 9 with unstable
      plaques has been reported.

      The VUCAP study will include patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic or
      asymptomatic carotid artery disease. Sonographic and serological markers of plaque
      vulnerability will be compared with histological features of the plaque and clinical
      presentation (symptomatic vs. asymptomatic). Preoperatively, the greyscale median of the
      plaque is assessed. Histomorphological investigation of the carotid plaques will be
      performed. Serological investigations will include markers of inflammation,
      thrombo-modulatory factors, lipid fractions and other parameters that have been associated
      with unstable plaques.

      The aim of the present study is to assess the ability of pigment epithelium-derived factor
      (PEDF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF 1-α),
      matrix metalloproteinases 2, 8 and 9 to differentiate between vulnerable and stable carotid
      artery plaques. Identification of 'vulnerable plaques' on the basis of a peripheral blood
      draw and a sonographic investigation may enable the treating physician to focus resources on
      patients who will benefit most form therapeutic interventions for primary prevention of
      ischemic stroke.

    <description>Extended sonomorphological investigation will be performed by a sonographer blinded to patients' characteristics, for the assessment of grey scale median (GSM). After removal plaques will be fixated in RNAlater for further RNA-determinations. In addition, histomorphological characterization of the plaque will be performed and the plaque classified based on the American Heart Association (AHA) classification. RNA-determination will focus on the expression levels of PEDF. VEGF, HIF-1 alpha, MMP-2, -8 and -9. For that purpose we will perform RNA isolation from the tissue, transcription to cDNA and also a quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore immunostaining of the plaque with PEDF, VEGF, HIF-1 alpha, MMP-2, -8 and -9 antibodies to determine the distribution of those proteins within the plaques will be done.</description>

    <description>Carotid endarterectomy is a surgery used to reduce the risk of stroke, by correcting stenosis in the carotid artery. Endarterectomy is the removal of material on the inside (end-) of an artery.An incision is made on the midline side of the Sternocleidomastoid muscle. The incision is between 5 and 10 cm in length. Then the patients get 5000 IU heparin by the anesthesia. The internal, common and external carotid arteries are carefully identified, controlled with vessel loops, and clamped. The lumen of the internal carotid artery is opened, and the atheromatous plaque removed. The artery is closed using suture. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. Local anesthesia, opposite to general, allows for direct monitoring of neurological status by intra-operative verbal contact and testing of grip strength.</description>
