    <textblock>
      In general , the diagnosis of back pain can be broken into three major categories: Mechanical
      ( Osteoarthritis , Spinal stenosis , Spondylolisthesis) ; Non- mechanical ( Tumor , Infection
      , Inflammatory arthritis ) and Miscellaneous (Osteoporosis , Psychosomatic disorders ,
      neuropathic joints , visceral diseases ). Although 98% of LBP may be caused by mechanical
      factors, it is the other 2% caused by malignancy, infection, visceral diseases and other red
      herrings that must be considered most seriously.

      The investigators have observed in their practice that lateral pressure on 5th lumbar
      vertebra sometimes gives rise to cervicothoracic pain and central PA pressure over
      cervicothoracic spines reproduce original low back and leg pain. So the question arises
      whether Cervico-thoracic dysfunction is associated with low back pain with or without
      radiation to lower extremities?
