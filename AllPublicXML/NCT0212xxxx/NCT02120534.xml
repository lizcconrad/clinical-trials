  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted to determine the dynamic changes of serum soluble CD14
      and the corresponding changes of serum CD88 and their correlation in critically ill sepsis
      and SIRS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of ninty four will be included in the study. Forty seven patients are critically ill
      with evidence of sepsis during ICU stay (sepsis group) and forty seven patients are
      critically ill without evidence of infectious organism (SIRS group). At admission, Patients
      data include clinical status; SOFA score; central venous pressure; laboratory analysis and
      arterial blood gas analysis are measured. Routine cultures will be obtained. The attending
      physician will evaluate the patients for sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock as long as
      their stay in ICU. A serum level of CD 14 and CD88 will be monitored.
