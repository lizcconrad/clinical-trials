  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study is to determine the long-term safety and tolerability of momelotinib in
      previously enrolled study participants with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia
      vera myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-ET MF),
      polycythemia vera (PV), or essential thrombocythemia (ET), who have tolerated and achieved
      stable disease or better with momelotinib treatment while enrolled in a previous clinical
      trial.

Transfusion independence is defined as absence of RBC transfusions for ≥ 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of anemia response (Cohorts 1 and 2 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of anemia response is defined as the interval from the first onset of anemia response to the earliest date of loss of anemia response which persists for at least 4 weeks, or death from any cause
Anemia response is defined as:
≥ 2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin, if transfusion independent and with hemoglobin level of &lt; 10 g/dL at baseline
