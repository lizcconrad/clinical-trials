  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Restricting calories can help a person reduce risk factors for heart disease. Researchers
      have found that not eating or drinking anything but water for 24 hours prevents the
      activation of a component of the immune system, called the inflammasome. The inflammasome is
      associated with the development of diabetes and heart disease. Researchers want to learn more
      about the body s response to fasting.

      Objective:

      - To explore the benefits of calorie restriction on heart health.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults ages 21 32 with a body mass index between 26 and 29.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam and blood test.

        -  Participants will not eat or drink after 10 p.m. before their first visit.

        -  Participants have breakfast at the clinic. The breakfast will be about 500 calories.
           Then they will not eat or drink (except water) for 24 hours.

        -  Participants will return to the clinic the next morning. They will have blood drawn.
           Then they will have breakfast. Blood will be drawn again at 1 hour and 3 hours after the
           meal.

        -  Blood and urine tests at the end of the fast and following the meals will be done to
           confirm that participants have fasted for the full 24-hour period.

      A caloric restricted diet has numerous health effects including the reduction in numerous
      cardiovascular disease risk factors. The cellular programs activated by caloric restriction
      are similarly turned on in preclinical studies in response to a 24-hour fast. We have found
      that a beneficial effect of a 24-hour fasting blunts the activation of a component of the
      immune system, termed the inflammasome, which is associated with the development of diabetes
      and atherosclerosis. We would like to study the inflammasome in human blood cells to evaluate
      whether the beneficial immune effects of fasting/caloric restriction are operational in
      humans. Blood samples to test the immune response will be collected in subjects after a fixed
      caloric meal and in response to a 24-hour fast (water intake will not be restricted). The
      objective of this pilot study is to identify if these immune adaptive pathways can be
      activated in human subjects as a possible readout to test whether this pathway could be
      investigated as a therapeutic target to blunt/negate the inflammation associated with
      nutrient-excess associated diseases such as diabetes and/or atherosclerosis.

          -  Males and females between the ages of 21 and 37

          -  BMI between 23.5 and 29

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects with an acute or chronic illness as per history, on laboratory analysis or
             due to use of medications

          -  Subjects taking vitamins or supplements or any medications, except oral contraceptives
             within 4 weeks of participation into this study.

          -  BMI &lt;23.5 or &gt;29

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects who have donated blood or participated in another clinical trial involving
             blood draws in the last 8 weeks.

          -  Subjects who use nicotine products
