  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Striae distensae is a common skin condition that rarely causes significant medical problems.
      However, it often results in a considerable amount of distress to those with the condition.
      Various modalities of treatments have been used for striae distensae but few have led to
      satisfactory results.

      More recently, newer techniques such as pulsed dye laser and radiofrequency devices have been
      used with modest results. There is still, however, paucity of data using light therapy for
      the treatment of this condition. Blue light therapy using the Multiclear device has been used
      successfully in the treatment of acne. In contrast, there is little data to suggest its use
      in the management of striae distensae.

      We aim to study the effects of blue light on the treatment of striae distensae and whether
      this can be used safely to manage this condition.

      Patients will receive twice weekly blue light treatment with the Multiclear device. The first
      treatment dose will be 75mJ/cm2 ( Minimum Effective Dose;MED) for all patients. If no
      erythema develops, the subsequent treatment dose can be increased by 0.5 MED. If mild to
      moderate erythema develops, the same dose (i.e. 1 MED) will be used.If severe erythema/
      blisters develop, treatment will be stopped and the patient wil be invited one week later and
      treatment will be offered at 50% of the last dose.

      During the first consultation, patients will be assessed for the presence of striae distensae
      (SD). Duration and previous treatments of SD will be recorded. The width of the widest striae
      and the length of the longest straie will be measured at baseline and after 2 months of
      treatment. Photographs will be taken at baseline and post treatment. These will be evaluated
      by dermatologists who will be blinded (i.e. details of which photographs are pre or post
      treatment will not be given). Subjective scores will be used (Very good to excellent; &gt;75%,
      Good; 51-75%, Moderate; 26-50%, Minimal to no improvement; &lt;25%) Participants will also be
      given a feedback form to rate any improvements noted and any side effects experienced.
