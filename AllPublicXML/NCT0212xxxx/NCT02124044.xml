  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated
      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. Within HIV/HCV co-infected patients, liver disease due
      to Hepatitis C progresses even more rapidly. While combination of ribavirin (RBV) and
      pegylated interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently
      recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to PEG+RBV
      alone in HCV monoinfected patients, treatment is still associated with a high incidence of
      adverse events (AEs), discontinuations and poor cure rates in several populations. Within the
      HIV/HCV co-infected population treatment for HCV remains complicated given drug interactions
      between anti-retrovirals and HCV protease inhibitors, in addition to the extensive
      side-effects due to PEG +RBV alone. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a
      combination of anti-virals which target HCV without interferon (IFN) can cure HCV, without
      additional toxicities. These novel therapies that do not rely on an IFN backbone may
      additionally enhance cure rates in HIV/HCV co-infected, a population which has historically
      been difficult to cure.

      The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses
      and determinants of response to an IFN free regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.

      This is an open label study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two regimens
      for the treatment of HCV, asunaprevir (ASV) 100 mg BID and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg daily
      (selective HCV NS3 and NS5A inhibitors respectively) in 10 HIV/HCV genotype 1b co-infected
      treatment-naive and treatment experienced individuals and DCV + ASV + BMS-791325 administered
      as a fixed dose combination (FDC) pill in 20 HIV/HCV GT 1a or 1b coinfected treatment-naive
      and treatment experienced individuals.

      The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses
      and determinants of response to an IFN free regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.

          1. Cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following:

               1. Any biopsy showing cirrhosis (at any time, not restricted to the 36 calendar
                  months prior to baseline visit).

               2. A FibroSUR[trademark] score, of &gt;0.75 and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
                  platelet ratio index (APRI) of &gt;2 within the last year.

          2. Absence of cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following:

               1. A liver biopsy performed within 36 calendar months of screening showing absence
                  of cirrhosis.

                  In the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or absence of cirrhosis by
                  the criteria detailed above, a liver biopsy is required. The
                  FibroSURE[trademark]test can be performed and the results can be used to
                  determine the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients with Child Pugh B or C
                  cirrhotics are excluded

             9. Ability to communicate effectively with the study investigator and other key
             personnel.

             10. Willingness to comply with the study restrictions and requirements.

             11. Opioid-dependent individuals must be participating in a supervised treatment
             program.

             12. Subjects must have an external primary care doctor (outside of the Clinical Center
             and the NIH) for their medical management.

             13. Willingness to have blood or tissue samples stored for future use to study liver
             disease and immune function.

             14. Willingness to undergo HLA typing.

             15. Otherwise healthy status as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory measurements performed at screening.

        Contraception

        The effects of ASV and DCV on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, men
        and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception as outlined in
        the inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to study entry and until 5 weeks (women ) and 14
        weeks (men) after last dose of study medication. Hormonal contraception is NOT considered
        an effective form of birth control for female subjects on this study. Oral contraceptives
        are not as effective in women taking ASV and DCV so women cannot rely on this form of birth
        control to prevent pregnancy. Females of childbearing-age must have a negative pregnancy
        test result prior to receiving ASV and DCV. If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects of
        being pregnant during the course of the study, she should inform the study staff and her
        primary care physician immediately.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Current or prior history of any of the following:

               1. Clinically significant illness (other than HCV) or any other major medical
                  disorder that may interfere with the subject treatment, assessment of compliance
                  with the protocol; subjects currently under evaluation for a
                  clinically-significant illness (other than HCV) are also excluded

               2. Gastrointestinal disorder with post-operative condition that could interfere with
                  the absorption of the study drug

               3. Poor venous access interfering with required study blood collection

          2. Positive nucleotide sequence analyses of the NS5A gene for Y93H or L31M/V
             polymorphisms for the 2DAA arm only.

          3. Positive test results at screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg)

         15. Use of certain medications and herbal/natural supplements per PI discretion, expected
             to result in increases or decreases in exposure to study or non-study medications as
             listed in Section 5.5 while receving study medications and within five half-lives or
             14 days [whichever is longer] of the first dose of study medications.

         16. Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other clinical trials is restricted, other
             than enrollment in observational studies or those evaluating the use of a licensed
             medication. Study staff should be notified of co-enrollment status, as it may require
             prior approval of the investigator
