  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) seen at extremely
      low doses of radiation can be exploited to enhance the effect of chemotherapy, and that this
      effect differs from the cellular effect of higher, standard fractions of radiation used in
      traditional radiation treatment paradigms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced head and neck cancer of
             squamous type stage III, IVA and IV B and select Stage II tumors of the BOT who are
             appropriate for potentially curative therapy with chemoradiotherapy.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  No prior chemotherapy for the current locally advanced SCCHN.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Normal organ and marrow function measured within 14 days of registration as defined
             below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL

               -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin &lt; institutional upper limit of normal

               -  AST(SGOT ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits

          -  OR

             o Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
             institutional normal.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry,
             throughout the duration of active treatment and for 4 months after completion of
             chemotherapy and radiation. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree
             to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of active study
             treatment, and for 4 months after completion of chemotherapy and radiation (both
             induction and definitive) administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior chemotherapy for SCCHN

          -  Patients with known brain metastases

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Carboplatin or Docetaxel.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy

          -  Other prior malignancy except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated previous Stage I or II cancer from

             patient has been disease-free for 3 years.

          -  Patients with nasopharynx or salivary gland primary site

          -  Patients with distant metastatic disease (M1c)
