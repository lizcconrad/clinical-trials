    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder marked by emotional
      instability, difficulty with interpersonal relationships, and self-harming behaviors. Despite
      receiving psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder, studies show that patient
      recovery is slow, and there is a high rate of self injury and suicide attempts early in
      treatment. There is thus a clear need to provide therapies to augment psychotherapy. We will
      conduct a pilot trial to determine whether a 6-week Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy
      (CMIT) is feasible for subjects with borderline personality disorder to undergo when added on
      to psychotherapy treatment. CMIT is a non-validated therapy that combines principles of
      mindfulness with meditation techniques and guided imagery. Sessions led by a trained
      clinician in a group setting once a week, and participants are asked to complete daily home
      practice.

      The trial will involve 16 participants, all currently undergoing psychotherapy for borderline
      personality disorder. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a CMIT group that
      lasts 6 weeks, or a wait list group. Those in the wait list group will be able to receive
      CMIT after 6 weeks. All participants will continue to receive psychotherapy throughout the
      trial.

      During the trial, we will also obtain preliminary data to help understand whether CMIT may
      result in psychological benefits for participants. This will include measuring the pulse in
      order to determine variation in beat to beat intervals of the heart during psychological
      tests, and filling out questionnaires before and after participation in CMIT.
