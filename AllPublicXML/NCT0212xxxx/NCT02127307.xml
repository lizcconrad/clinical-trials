      This aim of the study is to investigate the prognostic usefulness of AdreView™ imaging to
      identify those subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or III HF who will
      die during 60 months of follow-up from the date of administration of AdreView™ in prior
      studies MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C (hereafter included in MBG312).

    <measure>Relationship Between the Occurrence of Death and 123I-mIBG Uptake on Planar Scintigraphy With Heart to Mediastinum (H/M) Ratio of &lt;1.60 vs H/M ≥1.60</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of administration of 123I-mIBG in studies MBG-311 or MBG-312 up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>H/M ratio for 123I-mIBG uptake at 3 hours 50 minutes post administration was calculated by dividing the counts/pixel in the total myocardium region of interest (ROI) by the counts/pixel in the 7x7 pixel mediastinal ROI. H/M ratios were categorized as 'Low' and 'High' based on being &lt;1.6 or ≥1.6 respectively. The efficacy of 123I-mIBG was based on the prognostic value of the imaging data, as reflected by the H/M ratio, for identifying HF participants at lower risk of death during 60 months of follow-up.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject was a HF subject who had signed informed consent for MBG311 or MBG312.

          -  The subject was administered AdreView™ in MBG311 or MBG312.

          -  The subject completed the late planar imaging assessments (at a minimum) required by
             the protocols for MBG311 and MBG312, and those images were read and judged diagnostic
             by at least 2 blinded readers.

          -  In addition, all subjects must meet 1 of the following 3 inclusion criteria.

          -  If the subject can be located, he/she provides informed consent to allow the
             investigator access to medical records and/or gives permission for the investigator to
             speak to treating physicians.

          -  If the subject can be located and he/she declines to provide informed consent, the
             IRB/EC provides a waiver of consent to allow the investigator to record that the
             subject is alive.

          -  If the subject cannot be located, the IRB/EC provides a waiver of consent to allow the
             investigator to access available medical records for care provided subsequent to last
             date of subject participation in MBG311, MBG312, and/or MBG313 and/or to allow
             collection of data from publicly available sources.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject withdrew or was withdrawn from MBG311 or MBG312 because of a protocol
             violation.

          -  The subject underwent heart transplantation during MBG311, MBG312, or MBG313.

          -  The subject was recorded to have died during MBG311, MBG312, or MBG313.

          -  The subject voluntarily withdrew from MBG311, MBG312, or MBG313, and the IRB/EC has
             not provided a waiver to allow recording of subject survival status in such an
             instance.

          -  The subject cannot be located, cannot be contacted, and no information can be found to
             establish survival status beyond the date of last contact in MBG311, MBG312, or
             MBG313, including information available as a result of an IRB/EC-approved waiver.
