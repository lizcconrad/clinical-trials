  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family dementia caregivers provide a needed service to relatives with dementia and to
      society, but are often at risk for consequences to their own health such as depression,
      reduced immune system function, and burnout. Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy (CMIT) is
      a novel group mindfulness and guided imagery intervention designed to help caregivers reduce
      depressive symptoms and cope with the stress of caregiving. A small study suggested that CMIT
      techniques are feasible for dementia caregivers, and resulted in a reduction of depressive
      and anxiety symptoms. The largest benefits were shown to occur within the first 4 weeks, and
      were maintained at 3 months post treatment. The early benefits of CMIT were further described
      in a recent trial of CMIT for patients with recurrent depression, which demonstrated
      promising improvement in depressive symptoms, with the largest benefits occurring within the
      first 4 weeks. We have therefore shortened CMIT for caregivers from 8 weeks to 4 weeks, and
      aim to study the effects of the four-week version (Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy,
      Short Term, CMIT-ST) on dementia caregivers with elevated depressive symptoms. We will
      conduct a pilot feasibility of CMIT-ST versus home relaxation practice with 24 dementia
      caregivers. Half of the caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive a relaxation
      recording, while the other half will receive CMIT-ST. After 4 weeks, the group assigned to
      the relaxation recording will then have the opportunity to participate in CMIT-ST.

      To measure the effects of CMIT-ST, we will obtain depression symptom ratings and
      questionnaires about psychological symptoms before and after CMIT-ST. We will also study the
      biological effects of CMIT-ST. We will do so by measuring brain activity, recording the pulse
      in order to determine variation in beat to beat intervals of the heart, and studying patterns
      of gene expression.
