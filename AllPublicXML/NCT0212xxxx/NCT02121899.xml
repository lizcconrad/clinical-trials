  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry is intended to measure the effect of myPlan Lung Cancer™ test has on
      influencing treatment decisions of Oncologists when added to standard clinical-pathological
      parameters in patients with early stage NSCLC.

      The sponsor is conducting two parallel registries, with one directed at Surgeons (ONC003) and
      the other at Oncologists (ONC006). This registry is specific to Oncologists (ONC006).
