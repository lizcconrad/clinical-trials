      HEP is a five-year, prospective, observational study whose primary goal is to identify
      clinical characteristics and biomarkers predictive of disease outcome, progression, and
      treatment response in participants with newly treated focal epilepsy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a serious disease. It affects approximately 2.4 million Americans, with a
      lifetime risk estimated at 3%. More than 181,000 Americans develop epilepsy every year, and a
      substantial proportion has seizures that cannot be controlled by available medications. For
      the vast majority of patients with epilepsy, we do not understand the biological basis of
      their disease; we do not know whether a given anti-epileptic drug (AED) will be effective;
      and we cannot predict the severity of the seizure disorder, the potential emergence of
      co-morbidities, or the likelihood of remission.

      The Human Epilepsy Project seeks to answer these unknowns by collecting high-resolution
      clinical information and treatment response, MRIs, EEGs, and blood and urine samples for
      biomarkers. A major outcome of the project is to create an open data repository of clinical
      information and biologic samples for future studies.

      HEP may have a transformative impact on epilepsy diagnosis and treatment by identifying
      critical clinical features and biomarkers at the onset of epilepsy that can be used to
      predict outcome and guide therapy. We hope to identify subsets of patients at high risk for
      pharmacoresistance who may benefit from more aggressive initial therapy and earlier
      consideration for surgical treatment. The existence of biomarkers that predict the likelihood
      of disease remission would dramatically affect treatment decisions and counseling for
      millions of patients.

      In addition to its impact on current clinical care, the data and specimens collected in HEP,
      including sequential neuroimaging, electrophysiology and metabolite profiles, and banked DNA
      for the purpose of future genomics studies, have the potential to provide new insights into
      the biological basis of focal epilepsy, which will advance our efforts to discover effective
      treatments and cures for this disorder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical seizure(s) and history consistent with focal epilepsy

          -  At least two confirmed spontaneous seizures, at least 24 hours apart, in the 12 months
             prior to enrollment

          -  Complete AED history prior to enrollment (with approximate dates and doses) is
             available (exception can be made for AEDs taken for &lt;1 week)

          -  Age ≥12 years and ≤60 years at time of seizure onset

          -  Age ≥12 years and ≤60 years at time of enrollment

          -  Treatment instituted not more than 4 months prior to enrollment

          -  One of the following:

               1. Normal MRI with inter-ictal EEG showing focal abnormality (focal sharp waves or
                  focal slowing)

               2. Normal MRI and normal inter-ictal EEG, with clinical or electrographic seizure
                  activity on ictal EEG

               3. Definitive clinical history of recurrent seizures consistent with focal epilepsy,
                  adjudicated by central reviewers, if normal MRI and normal EEG

               4. Focal lesion (non-progressive) on MRI with normal EEG (acceptable focal lesions
                  include MTS, FCD, single cavernoma, and AVMs that are not of large size and lack
                  significant amounts of hemosiderin)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Idiopathic or symptomatic generalized epilepsy

          -  Any epilepsy etiology that could produce significant gliosis or brain injury and would
             be likely to alter biomarkers. These include:

               1. Epilepsy with an etiology occurring in the previous two years that would produce
                  significant CNS injury (e.g., traumatic brain injury that involves direct
                  disruption of brain tissue, stroke, encephalitis)

               2. History of intracranial bleeding (e.g., subarachnoid, intraparenchymal)

          -  Identified genetic epilepsy syndrome

          -  Presence of moderate or greater developmental or cognitive delay prior to seizure
             onset (e.g., if an adolescent, not in self-contained classroom; if IQ is documented,
             should be &gt; 70)

          -  History of chronic drug or alcohol abuse within the last 2 years

          -  IGE/focal epilepsy mixed syndromes

          -  Progressive neurological disorder (brain tumor, AD, PME, etc.)

          -  Major medical co-morbidities such as renal failure requiring dialysis, metastatic
             cancer, HIV, or significant liver or renal disease

          -  Autism Spectrum Disorder

          -  Seizures only during pregnancy

          -  History of previous or current significant psychiatric disorder that would interfere
             with conduct of the study
