      Rationale:

      Skin cancer is common in Caucasians and often exists on sun-exposed areas, such as the face.
      Treatment of choice is mostly excision and result in an irreversible scar. As the incidence
      of skin cancer is rising, also among young people, it is important to obtain a good cosmetic
      outcome after treatment. It is believed that the type of closure of the wound after excision
      can influence the cosmetic result. Currently, primary closure of the excision can occur by
      transcutaneous (TC) or intracutaneous (IC) suturing. Both techniques are widely used among
      dermatologists and plastic surgeons and the choice is mainly dependent on the preference of
      the physician. Research comparing the cosmetic result of both techniques in the craniofacial
      area is lacking.

      Objective:

      Evaluation of the cosmetic result of transcutaneous sutures versus intracutaneous sutures in
      the craniofacial area.

      Study design:

      A randomized controlled single-blinded multi-center trial.

      Study population:

      Patients older than 18 years, with craniofacial skin tumor receiving surgery followed by
      primary closure at the department of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery of the Maastricht
      University Medical Centre, the department of Dermatology of Catharina hospital Eindhoven and
      the department of Plastic surgery of Orbis Medical Centre Sittard.

      Intervention:

      Excision of the tumor followed by IC sutures or TC sutures

      Main study endpoints:

      Cosmetic result measured on the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) by the
      patient and the researcher 12 months after surgery.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      All patients who participate have an indication for excision and will be assigned to one of
      the suture techniques. Both techniques are widely used in the regular patient care.
      Therefore, no extra risks are associated with it.

      Patients will be asked to visit the hospital 3 months and 1 year following treatment, at
      which point a questionnaire will be filled in and the redness of the scar will be measured by
      means of non-invasive techniques. In addition, patients will be asked to apply a sunscreen on
      the scar daily during the first three months of follow-up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients aged 18 years or older with a skin tumour of minimal 5mm in diameter in
             the craniofacial area requiring an excision followed by primary closure will be
             included. If a patient has more than one lesion, the largest lesion that can be closed
             primarily will be included as a maximum of one tumour per patient will be studied.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with skin lesions on the ears, nose, mucosal part of the lips or eyelids as
             patients suited for excision but where a transplantation, flap or secondary
             granulation is necessary for reconstruction of the defect will be excluded. Patients
             not capable of informed consent will also be excluded.
