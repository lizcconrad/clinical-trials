  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of inhibiting rTMS QP over the visual cortex for the prevention of chronic
      migraine. The aim of the study is to confirm that inhibiting rTMS QP is capable to decrease
      the frequency of migraine and if its effect is stronger than placebo effect.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have already inquired if inhibiting rTMS QP over the visual cortex
      determines a reduction of frequency of migraine in a previous study. After 2 weekly sessions
      for a month, the investigators demonstrated a reduction of 47% in migraine frequency. In this
      study, the investigators aim to compare rTMS QP effect with the placebo effect and to
      evaluate if rTMS QP is capable to induce changes in VEP, CHEPS and QST.

    <description>The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is able to modify cortical excitability and reactivity. 1Hz rTMS inhibits the cortex, 10Hz excites it. In particular, a new paradigm of rTMS, the rTMS quadri pulse has a more lasting and effective activity.
The side effects are rare and transient: migraine,contractions of the muscles of the neck due to muscle stimulation by the electromagnetic field of the coil.</description>
