    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a major mental illness characterized by a variety of different symptoms
      including hallucinations, paranoia, difficulties with formulating and expressing thoughts,
      feelings similar to depression, and problems with cognitive processes. Individuals with
      schizophrenia are usually treated with a class of medications called anti-psychotics, which
      typically help alleviate some of the symptoms of the disorder. In general, anti-psychotic
      medications do not completely cure the disorder, and many patients are left with some degree
      of ongoing symptoms. Furthermore, it is estimated that 20-30% of individuals with
      schizophrenia are considered treatment refractory or resistant and do not respond to
      anti-psychotic medications. The Food and Drug Administration has approved one antipsychotic
      medication for use in patients who are considered to have treatment resistant schizophrenia
      (TRS). This medication, clozapine, has been shown to be beneficial for patients with TRS,
      though as many as 40-70% of patients fail to respond or are partially responsive to treatment
      with clozapine. In an extensive search of the medical and psychiatric literature, we have
      been impressed by the potential of minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, as an adjunctive
      therapy in patients with schizophrenia based on its reported neuroprotective and
      anti-inflammatory effects. It is a fairly inexpensive drug, well tolerated, and two
      randomized clinical trials have demonstrated favorable results in early-phase schizophrenia.
      Only one case series with two patients has investigated minocycline in patients with
      schizophrenia on clozapine. Minocycline is also an interesting medication for augmentation
      with clozapine, as we are interested in previous findings of increased inflammation in the
      brains of patients with schizophrenia and the potential role of inflammation in treatment
      resistant schizophrenia. Though there are many markers of increased inflammation in the
      brain, for this current study, we are interested in a general marker of inflammation called
      C-Reactive Protein (CRP). We hypothesize that some patients may have increased levels of
      inflammation in the brain, as measured by the CRP level (drawn from peripheral blood), and
      that those patients with increased levels of CRP may respond better to augmentation with
      minocycline. The proposed pilot study will compare minocycline augmentation with clozapine in
      individuals with high vs low inflammation as measured by CRP. We hypothesize that minocycline
      will be well tolerated and will result in an improvement in the symptoms of schizophrenia,
      cognition, as well as improve the quality of life for patients preferentially in patients
      with high CRPs. We plan to use a variety of different scales to measure improvement in the
      varying symptoms of schizophrenia as well as cognitive function, which will be administered
      to patients at three week intervals for a total study time of twelve weeks. We hypothesize
      that minocycline could prove to be an effective, well tolerated, and inexpensive medication
      for treatment resistant patients with schizophrenia whom have particular difficulties with
      social interactions, obtaining and maintaining employment, and overall quality of life.
      Furthermore, we hypothesize that the data obtained in this study will contribute to the
      ongoing exploration of the role of inflammation in the brain of patients with schizophrenia
      and help understand and target the role of various inflammatory markers in the
      pathophysiology and treatment of treatment resistant schizophrenia.
