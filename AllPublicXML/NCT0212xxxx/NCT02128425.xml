    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if the exposure to all the three active cytotoxic
      agents (FOLFOXIRI regimen) is superior in terms of progression-free survival to conventional
      chemotherapy with the FOLFOX regimen as first-line treatment of chemo-naive metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients.

      A second primary aim is to evaluate the response rate, safety and tolerability of the
      chemotherapy of FOLFOXIRI regimen in this patient population.

      Patients will be randomized to two therapy groups:

      Experimental arm A: Chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI Standard arm B: Chemotherapy with FOLFOX

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is correlated with the proportion of
      patients who receive all the three active drugs , but not with the proportion of patients who
      receive any second-line therapy. A superior efficacy in PFS,ORR and OS of FOLFOXIRI has been
      reported with acceptable toxicity. Moreover,evidence suggests that continuous dosing
      metronomic chemotherapy may be more efficacious than interval-chemotherapy.

      Therefore, a way to improve the outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer patients could be to
      administer a maintenance first-line regimen containing the three active agents.
