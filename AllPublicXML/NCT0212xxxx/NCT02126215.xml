      Hypothesis: Patients with blue cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) regional maps during a
      hypercapnic CO2 challenge will be at greater risk of developing post-operative delirium (POD)
      and stroke following major surgery. The blue CVR map will be shown to be predictive of POD
      and stroke and ultimately represent a diagnostic test for patients at risk. These blue CVR
      maps will enable neurologic risk stratification for patients undergoing major surgery. A
      secondary hypothesis is that location and extent of the blue CVR maps will strongly indicate
      risk of neurologic sequelae after operative procedures. Background: Major surgery is
      associated with a significant risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. POD is a dreaded
      complication with such anesthesia and surgery. The prevalence of delirium after cardiac
      surgery has been reported to occur in up to 50% of patients. Using a definitive diagnostic
      tool such as the Confusion Assessment Method - Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) results in the
      higher proportion reported. Delirium is a serious complication that results in prolonged
      length of stay, increased health care costs, and higher mortality. As much as $6.9 billion of
      Medicare hospital expenditures can be attributed to delirium. At such a cost, better
      diagnosis and treatment is urgently needed. Pre-emptive diagnosis leading to better
      management of delirium post-operatively is clearly one of the fundamental problems
      confronting modern anesthesia and peri-operative medicine.

      Specific Objectives: The investigators seek to address (a) the identity of patients who have
      the greatest vulnerability to the surgery and (b) investigate the risks and test appropriate
      risk mitigations. Understanding POD is of immense import to help control a hospital's
      surgical and critical care costs. Patients with neurological consequences including POD often
      represent a choke point for optimized critical care utilization. At the very least, improved
      understanding and a diagnostic test to highlight patients at risk of POD would be most
      welcome. Such an advance would permit rational strategies to limit the problem and allow
      better designed therapeutic arcs for patients now known to be at risk. This is especially
      important for patients undergoing complicated major surgery and is the focus of this pilot
      project.

      Methods: Informed witnessed consent will be obtained from all participants. Patients will
      have a Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) prior to their MRI studies. This will take 10 - 15
      minutes. Patients will have CVR maps with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD-MRI) pulse
      sequences done with standard RespirAct (a computer-controlled gas blender) protocols in
      association with anatomic imaging in a 3.0 Tesla magnet. The clinical care team and patient
      will be blinded as to the CVR results. Patients will have standardized anesthesia and per
      usual approaches for their major surgery and have standard POD assessment tools (CAM-ICU).
      Storage of anesthesia hemodynamics will be to digital data acquisition systems for later
      collation. End-tidal CO2 will be targeted at 40 mmHg during the surgical procedure and if
      ventilated for any period post-operatively. Standard fast-track protocols and admission to
      the surgical special care unit (SSCU) will be undertaken to facilitate patient management.
      Any patient with obvious POD, post-op delirium or stroke will be managed per usual protocols.
      Prior to discharge a second 3.0T CVR imaging sequence will be done - and additional diffusion
      weighted imaging (DWI) pulse sequencing (a sensitive approach to identify low level
      ischemia). Multiple CVR maps (650 studies) have been done at University Health Network in
      Toronto. As well over 75 studies have been conducted at the Health Sciences Centre at the
      University of Manitoba in the past 2 years.

      Significance/Importance: This study has the potential to make an important contribution in
      the understanding of POD for all surgical procedures and specifically a window into the
      problem with major surgery. A positive study based on our hypothesis can fundamentally change
      our understanding of cognitive dysfunction after surgery. Large follow-up multicentre trials
      can be constructed based on initial findings from this pilot study if the study bears fruit.
      At the least, further elucidation into POD for major surgery is expected with this study.
