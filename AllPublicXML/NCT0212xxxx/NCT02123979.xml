  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narcotics are widely used as the mainstay of pain treatment, although increasing doses are
      required over time as the individual becomes tolerant to their effects. This can lead to the
      development of dependence and abuse of these drugs. Research has identified a new way to
      decrease the risk of developing tolerance to narcotics, by giving at the same time a drug
      called rotigotine (&quot;Neupro&quot;). Rotigotine interferes with the body's chemical dopamine and is
      FDA-approved for the management of Parkinson's Disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to look at side effects and pain control in healthy
      people after removal of wisdom teeth, which usually causes pain. It is thought that by giving
      the study drug rotigotine with the narcotic pain reliever, there will be pain control that
      will extend longer than when giving the narcotic alone.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Male and female patients aged 18 and over scheduled to undergo elective oral surgery for
           the removal of impacted third molars

        -  Indicated for the removal of 3-4 third molars, at least two of which are categorized as
           partial-boney or full-boney impactions

        -  Self-report of moderate or severe pain on a categorical scale with a minimum of 5 out of
           10 on the numerical rating scale following the offset of local anesthesia

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  History or intolerance to rotigotine

        -  Current or history of mental disorder or substance abuse

        -  Allergy or intolerance to opioids or local anesthetics

        -  Concurrent or recent use of agents that may confound the sedative effects of the study
           drug (opioids, benzodiazepines) over the previous 7 days or alcohol ingestion in the
           previous 24 hours

        -  Chronic or recent use of medications that might confound the effects of rotigotine,
           e.g., antihistamines, prescription or over-the-counter NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal
           anti-inflammatory drugs), acetaminophen, steroids, antidepressants, muscle relaxants.

        -  Concurrent or history of chronic diseases, e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, liver
           disease, cancer, hypertension or obesity (body mass index &gt;35).

    <description>assess the translational potential of what has been demonstrated in the lab to human subjects experiencing painful conditions that require control with morphine. We hope to provide proof of concept for a treatment strategy that will allow opiates to maintain their effectiveness at low doses without the emergence of tolerance and other side effects, even with prolonged use.</description>
