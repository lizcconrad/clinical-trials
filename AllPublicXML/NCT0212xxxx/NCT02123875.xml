      ATTEND Trial is based on early supported discharge- home based stroke rehabilitation model
      which proves to offer several advantages in low and mid income countries. The objectives of
      the pilot stude were to determine that with a randomized blinded outcome assessor, controlled
      trial, family- led caregiver- delivered home based rehabilitation is better than usual care
      for those with disabling stroke in India and the feasibility of this model.
