  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that cenicriviroc will improve cognition in HIV infected individuals
      with cognitive impairment. The investigators will study the effect of cenicriviroc on
      cognition in 24 subjects over a 24 week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-associated neurocognitive disease (HAND), particularly in its milder form, is estimated
      to occur in greater than 30% of HIV infected individuals in the era of potent antiretroviral
      therapy. As even mild disease leads to functional consequences with decreased ability to live
      independently, HAND is of substantial public health concern. HIV-induced immune
      activation/inflammation of monocytes (MO) may be primarily responsible for the development of
      HAND.

      Cenicriviroc is a combined CCR5 and CCR2 chemokine co-receptor antagonist. The investigators
      hypothesize that dual CCR5 and CCR2 blockade with the use of CVC will lead to measurable
      reductions in MO activation and lead to cognitive improvement by decreasing HIV infection of
      MO and by interrupting the trafficking of such MO into the central nervous system.

      The investigators propose a single arm, 24-week trial of CVC in 24 subjects with HIV-1
      infection suppressed on ART (plasma HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml) for 1 year or more with mild to
      moderate cognitive impairment.
