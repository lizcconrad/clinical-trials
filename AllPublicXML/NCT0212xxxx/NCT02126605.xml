  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though there is growing interest in and use of trained Diabetes Alert Dogs (DADs) as a
      way to monitor blood glucose in type 1 diabetes (T1D), no scientific studies have confirmed
      the ability of DADs to accurately detect extreme high and low blood sugar. The current
      project is the first preliminary investigation into the accuracy of DADs, using
      scientifically rigorous research methods similar to those required to demonstrate accuracy in
      blood glucose meters. The primary aim of the project is to test the hypotheses that DADs are
      accurate at detecting extreme blood sugar levels in adults and children with T1D. The
      proposed project has several other secondary aims, which include determining: 1) the glycemic
      thresholds and time course for hypo- and hyperglycemic DAD alerts, 2) the degree to which
      alert accuracy is consistent across different DADs, and 3) whether or not DAD owners appear
      to experience better psychosocial status and quality of life compared to other individuals
      with T1D.

      In the proposed project, DAD alerts will be compared to blood glucose (BG) readings from a
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, as well as a BG meter. CGM, BG meter, and DAD
      alert data will be collected over a 4-wk period. CGM devices will be &quot;blinded&quot; so that BG
      readings will not be shown. This will allow for a direct comparison between objective glucose
      readings generated by approved BG monitoring devices and DAD alerts. This study will also
      utilize two methods for measuring DAD alerts: (1) use of the event recorder mechanism of the
      CGM device, and (2) collection of more detailed and qualitative data on DAD alerts using
      diaries (Daily DAD Diaries) to collect information concerning the occurrence, timing, and
      type of DAD alerts.
