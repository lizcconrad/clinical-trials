      The aim of this study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Elevate® Apical
      and Posterior Prolapse Repair System for repair of apical/posterior pelvic organ prolapse in
      a controlled, post-market cohort study.

      The Harmony 522 study has been terminated due to the closing of the Astora Women's Health
      business. No other entity will be taking responsibility for this study. The study was
      terminated with partial subject enrollment complete and therefore no primary or secondary
      data analysis can be performed. The data from this study resides in a national data base
      which Astora no longer has access and therefore is another reason why no data analysis can be
      performed. The national database is owned and managed by the American Urogynecology Society
      (AUGS). AUGS has access to Astora's data and will at some time in the near future publish
      results to physicians who are active participants in the registry. Full public disclosure of
      this data may not occur for a number of years and will be aggregated with data from other
      study sponsors.

        multi-compartment posterior prolapse that includes the apical compartment)

        Subject reports a bothersome bulge they can see or feel per PFDI-20, question 3, response
        of 2 or higher (i.e., responses of &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot;, or &quot;quite a bit&quot;)

        Subject or subject's legally authorized representative is willing to provide written
        informed consent

        Subject has had prior or is currently undergoing radiation, laser therapy, or chemotherapy
        in the pelvic area

        Subject has taken systemic steroids (within the last month), or immunosuppressive or
        immunomodulatory treatment (within the last 3 months)

        erythematosus (SLE), Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers Danhlos, collagenosis, polymyositis or
        polymyalgia rheumatica)

        Subject has chronic systemic pain that includes the pelvic area or chronic focal pain that
        involves the pelvis

        Subject has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM)

        Subject has a known neurologic or medical condition affecting bladder function (e.g.,
        multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or stroke with residual neurologic deficit)

        Subject is seeking obliterative vaginal surgery as treatment for pelvic organ prolapse
        (colpocleisis)

        Subject is not able to conform to the modified dorsal lithotomy position

        Subject is currently participating in or plans to participate in another device or drug
        study during this study
