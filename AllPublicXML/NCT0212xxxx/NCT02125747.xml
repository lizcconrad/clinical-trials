    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine effectiveness, feasibility and safety/tolerance of
      Respiratory Therapy in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) is defined as an event
      in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's usual
      symptoms (dyspnea, cough and/or sputum) that may not be explained by the daily variations and
      requires a change in regular medication.

      Because AE-COPD result in impairment of both pulmonary and respiratory muscle functions, as
      well as an increasing impact on costs, priority should be given to interventions to slow the
      progression of the disease, prevention of exacerbations and reduce the risk of comorbidity.

      Chest physiotherapy is often used in hospitalized patients with AE-COPD with the aim of
      favoring the removal of secretions and thus to improve the ventilation perfusion (V/Q), and
      therefore the function lung. The limited scientific evidence has determined that their use is
      controversial and not routinely recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Current clinical
      guidelines in the treatment of COPD are unable to rule on the application of respiratory
      therapy during exacerbations, since there is little scientific evidence of its benefits in
      the short and long term.

    <description>Respiratory muscle strength is assessed through maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressures (MEP) using a pressure transducer connected to a digital register system. The MIP is measured at mouth during a maximum effort from residual volume against occluded airway. To determine the MEP, patients performed a maximum expiratory effort from total lung capacity in the face of the occluded airway.</description>

    <description>Respiratory Therapy consists of postural drainage, positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and vibropercussion (it is a postural drainage method, which uses chest clapping with a flexible wrist and cupped hands or a mechanical vibrator to loosen and mobilize retained secretions that can then be expectorated or drained). Postural drainage is an airways clearance technique in which patient's body is positioned so that the trachea is inclined downward and below the affected chest area.
The PEP consists of expiratory cycles through a system generating a positive pressure of 10-20 cc (cubic centimeter) water. Vibropercussion is applied by the use of a mechanical system following rib movement during expiration to enhance clearance of secretions.
Intervention group received 30-minute-sessions twice a day, 7 days per week, during hospitalization period.</description>
