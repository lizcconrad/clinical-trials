  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition with an unknown cause or causes.
      The condition is associated with raised pressure in the brain and can cause disabling daily
      headaches and loss of sight, which can be permanent. The raised brain pressure squashes the
      nerves supplying the eye (also known as papilloedema) and this can affect vision. Over 90% of
      patients with IIH are overweight and weight loss is the most effective treatment. Other
      treatments for IIH have very little current evidence to support their use.

      Weight loss is difficult to maintain. This trial aims to compare two methods of weight loss,
      bariatric surgery and the most effective dietary programme commonly available, Weight
      Watchers, to see which offers the most effective sustainable treatment for IIH. Bariatric
      surgery is recommended by the NICE clinical guidelines for patients with a Body Mass Index
      (BMI) of over 40, or over 35 with a co-morbidity. Women suffering from IIH have a BMI on
      average around 38 and IIH is not recognised as a co-morbidity for bariatric surgery.

      This trial will recruit 64 women with IIH from Neurology and Ophthalmology clinics in UK NHS
      Trusts. They will be randomised and 32 participants will be allocated to the dietetic
      intervention arm, and be enrolled in their local Weight Watchers group. 32 participants will
      be allocated to the bariatric surgery arm, and will be referred to their local bariatric
      surgery pathway to receive bariatric surgery. Both groups of participants will be allocated
      to a treatment arm which is proven to bring about weight loss.

      Participants will then be followed up for five years, with the most important measurement
      being their brain pressure after one year of being in the trial.

      A further 20 obese women who don't suffer from IIH will be recruited to compare the baseline
      symptoms and biomarkers of those with IIH; they will take no further part in the study. 5
      further healthy individuals will be scanned twice in an MRI test group to validate the MRI
      scan sequence to be used in the trial.

    <description>Change in Intracranial Pressure (ICP) between baseline and 12 months.
ICP will be assessed using lumbar puncture (LP). To avoid the LP affecting the visual measures it will be performed after the visual tests have been completed. ICP will be recorded to the nearest whole number in cmH2O. Both opening and closing ICP will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Visual function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in visual function from 0 to 12 months (and at 24 and 60 months).
Assessments to be undertaken are the LogMAR (log of the minimum angle of resolution) chart to assess visual acuity, automated perimetry (Humphrey 24-2 central threshold) to measure the visual field mean deviation, an evaluation of contrast sensitivity and an Ishihara book to assess colour vision. The pupils will then be dilated using 1% tropicamide. Papilloedema will then be measured using spectral optical coherence tomography. Papilloedema will be further graded following fundus photographs. This will be done after all participants have reached the primary endpoint by two neuro-ophthalmologists blinded to trial treatment arm. The assessors will score the paired papilloedema images as better/same/worse as per the methodology described in a previous study. They will also assign a Frisen score to the images.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in headache associated disability from 0 to 12 months (and at 24 and 60 months).
Headache will be assessed by participant completed questionnaires. Participants will complete a daily headache diary in the week before assessments, which will evaluate the Headache Index score and use of analgesia (days/week). Headache associated disability will be evaluated using the Headache Impact Test-6 score (HIT 6). Severity and frequency of headaches will be assessed retrospectively using the Headache Index. Headache phenotype (according to criteria from the International Headache Society) will also be assessed.</description>
