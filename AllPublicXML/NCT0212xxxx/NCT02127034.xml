      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady state solifenacin and
      mirabegron on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered steady state digoxin. This study will
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combined steady state administration of
      solifenacin, mirabegron and digoxin.

      This study is comprised of two study sequences with 2 investigational periods in each
      sequence. There will be a wash-out period between each investigational period. Patients will
      be admitted to the clinic until discharged after each investigational period.
