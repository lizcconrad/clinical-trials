  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clear cell carcinoma comprises 5-10% of surface epithelial ovarian cancers, and about 30-40%
      of the patients with clear cell carcinoma are diagnosed in the advanced stage. The
      investigators studied the response to chemotherapy and survival for either
      paclitaxel-platinum based chemotherapy or conventional platinum-based chemotherapy among all
      stages clear cell ovarian carcinoma. Prognostic factors for survival among the patients with
      pure, advanced, clear cell ovarian carcinoma were also evaluated.

      1. Several authors have reported frequent admixtures of clear cell ovarian carcinoma with
           serous, mucinous, and endometrioid tumors. However, few papers addressed the difference
           in response to chemotherapy and survival between patients with pure and mixed-type
           advanced clear cell carcinoma.

        2. Recent trends in the clinical management of advanced ovarian cancer include increased
           attention to maximal cytoreduction and general acceptance of paclitaxel-platinum-based
           adjuvant chemotherapy.

        3. The introduction of paclitaxel markedly changed the postoperative management of ovarian
           cancer patients, but the results and value of these newer efforts and therapies applied
           to clear cell carcinoma are as yet undetermined.

        4. Today, paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy is becoming the standard regimen for
           ovarian cancer worldwide. Previous research suggests a potential benefit of paclitaxel
           plus carboplatin regimens for stage I clear cell carcinoma. However, few papers
           specifically addressed the efficacy of paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy for
           advanced clear cell carcinoma because clear cell carcinoma occurs only rarely in Western
           countries.
