  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stent placement is now widely accepted to improve the results of angioplasty (an operation to
      widen the blood vessel) and decreasing the need for further surgery. Despite their worldwide
      acceptance, stent usage is still limited by renarrowing which occurs within the stent
      (restenosis) in some patients within the first six months. In addition there still exists a
      small risk of heart attacks soon after the stent is placed.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of trying to place the
      stents using a different strategy of using low pressure oversized balloon inflations as
      opposed to the usual high pressure balloon inflations. This may reduce injury to the artery
      and reduce the chance of renarrowing of the stent. In order to ensure this is a safe and
      effective way of performing the procedure the investigators intend to use an Intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS) catheter to look from inside the artery at the stents. IVUS has proven to
      be the best way of ensuring optimal stent placement.

      Primary hypothesis: Stents will be equally well expanded and apposed using a strategy of
      oversized stenting at normal inflation pressures ( &lt; 10 atmospheres ) as compared to high
      pressure inflation (≥14 atmospheres) as guided by intravascular ultrasound imaging.

      Secondary Hypothesis: There will be no difference in acute clinical endpoints (death,
      myocardial infarction, urgent revascularisation or stent thrombosis) using a strategy of
      oversized stenting at normal inflation pressure as compared to high pressure inflation.

      Tertiary Hypothesis: If the above is shown to be true the investigators would hope to expand
      the study in order to reveal a decrease in stent restenosis using a strategy of lower
      pressure balloon inflations. The investigators will assess the deployment characteristics of
      drug eluting versus bare metal stents

    <description>The criteria for optimal stent expansion are:
1. Complete apposition of the stent over its entire length against the vessel wall.
2a. In stent minimal luminal area (MLA) &gt;= 90% of the average reference luminal area or &gt;=100% of lumen area of the reference segment with the lowest lumen area.
In stent lumen area of proximal stent entrance &gt;= 90% of proximal lumen area. 2b. Where the instent luminal area is in excess of 9.0 mm2 , the following criteria apply: In stent MLA &gt; 80% of the average reference lumen area or &gt;=90% of lumen area of the reference segment with the lowest lumen area.
In stent lumen area of proximal stent entrance &gt;= 90% of proximal lumen area. 3. Symmetric stent expansion defined by lumen diameter (LD)min / LD max &gt;= 0.7
A less rigorous criteria for stent expansion will also be assessed:
In stent MLA &gt; 80% of the average reference lumen area; &amp;
Complete apposition of the stent over its entire length against the vessel wall</description>

    <description>Oversized stent deployed at low pressure:
A stent premounted on a balloon with a nominal diameter halfway between the lumen diameter and the true vessel diameter (approximated by external elastic lamina) as assessed by IVUS. This will be based on the smallest of the vessel reference diameters proximal and distal to the lesion. In addition the vessel diameter must be greater than this diameter throughout the length of the lesion. This stent will be implanted at an inflation pressure of 10 atmospheres or less for at least 15 seconds and a second IVUS will be performed to assess the end point.</description>

    <description>Stent deployed at high pressure:
A stent premounted on a balloon with a nominal diameter approximately equal to the vessel segment lumen reference diameter as previously assessed by IVUS will be used.
