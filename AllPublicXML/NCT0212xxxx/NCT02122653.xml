    <textblock>
      Muscle strength and endurance are important indexes of fitness. The muscle strength is the
      most important single predict factor of functional ability in aged frail individuals. Frailty
      related muscle weakness and fatigue are adapted from the pre-frail stage. Finding the
      contributions of the central and the peripheral factors to the deficits of muscle fitness and
      developing an effective muscle fitness training program for pre-frail individuals are very
      important.

      The muscle weakness and fatigue can be categorized into peripheral or central causes. The
      central fatigue and voluntary activation failure originate from the decrease in motivation or
      the reduction of the conduction within corticospinal tracts. Long term activation failure and
      central fatigue will cause disuse of muscle and result in peripheral weakness and peripheral
      fatigue. Studies found the selective type II fiber atrophy in aged people and this finding
      was different from the type I atrophy in conventional immobilization models. It is possible
      that the activation failure leads to the recruitment failure of high threshold type II fibers
      at the pre-frail stage. Quantifying the weighting of central versus peripheral factors
      contributing to the exercise limitation in pre-frail people is important.

      Most of the conventional strength and endurance training programs are based on the researches
      of young groups. These programs are not able to prevent people become frail. It is possibly
      that, due to the limitation of central fatigue, the pre-frail individuals stop exercise
      before the effective intensity being achieved. Almost no training program has been design for
      enhancing the voluntary activation level and relief the central fatigue. Seeking an
      appropriate training program to enhance central activation at the pre-frail stage is very
      important for preventing people become frail.

      Previous studies have shown that increasing afferent input by peripheral electrical
      stimulation (ES) at sensory threshold enhanced the plasticity of contralateral primary
      sensory cortex, the excitability of corticospinal tracts, and the functional performance in
      young adults. ES, which is easy to quantify the dose of afferent input, is a feasible method
      to be used in training. Combining afferent input with strength training might be able to
      overcome the central activation failure and help recruit high threshold motor unit in
      pre-frail individuals.
