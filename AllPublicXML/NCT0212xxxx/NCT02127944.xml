    <textblock>
      IN UNEXPLAINED INFERTILITY OVARIAN RESERVE TESTS WERE ASSESSED.

      IN THIS STUDY, A COMPARISON IS DONE BETWEEN 35 WOMEN WITH UNEXPLAINED FERTILITY(THE PATIENT)
      AND 35 WOMEN WHO DON'T HAVE ANY FERTILITY PROBLEMS AND HAVE AT LEAST A CHILD (THE CONTROL
      GROUP).

      THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA

      Inclusion Criteria:

      LESS THAN 35 YEARS OLD, MARRIED WOMEN SHOULD HAVE REGULAR MENSES SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST A YEAR
      OF UNPROTECTED SEX. THE HUSBAND'S SPERMOGRAM SHOULD HAVE NO ABNORMALITIES THE SUBJECT SHOULD
      HAVE A NORMAL HYSTEROSALPHINGOGRAPHY

      Exclusion Criteria:

      HAVING ANY SYSTEMIC DISEASE. LONG HISTORY OF ANY DRUG USAGE.

      FOR THE CONTROL GROUP

      Inclusion Criteria:

      LESS THAN 35 YEARS OLD, MARRIED WOMEN SHOULD HAVE REGULAR MENSES AT LEAST HAVE A CHILD THE
      HUSBAND'S SPERMOGRAM SHOULD HAVE NO ABNORMALITIES THE SUBJECT SHOULD HAVE A NORMAL
      HYSTEROSALPHINGOGRAPHY

      Exclusion Criteria:

      HAVING ANY SYSTEMIC DISEASE. LONG HISTORY OF ANY DRUG USAGE.

      THE STUDY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING TESTS BEING DONE ON THE PATIENTS:

      THE FOLLOWING HORMONES' LEVELS WERE STUDIED:AMH (ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE),FSH (FOLLICULAR
      STIMULATING HORMONE) , E2 (ESTRADIOL) AND INHIBIN B.THE FORMER THREE HORMONE LEVELS SHOULD BE
      ASSESSED ON THE THIRD DAY OF MENSES IN THE STUDY,TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASONOGRAPHIC OVARIAN VOLUME
      ,OVARIAN ANTRAL FOLLICULE NUMBER,OVARIAN STROMAL BLOODFLOW AND OVARIAN ARTERIAL RESISTANCE
      WAS MEASURED USING DOPPLER ULTRASONOGRAM.
