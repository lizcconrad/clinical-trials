  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a problem which affects up to 70-80% of people in their lifetime. In the
      United States, it is estimated that the total direct and indirect costs of low back pain
      combined ranges from $19.6 to $118.8 billion. Recent studies have shown the importance of the
      gluteal musculature in the treatment of low back pain. It was found that the gluteus maximus
      (Gmax) is significantly more active in a low back pain population compared to a healthy
      population, indicating the low back pain population relied on the Gmax to fire more to
      overcome the gluteal weakness. A new approach to treating musculoskeletal conditions is a
      taping technique designed to target muscles and lymphatic system. Limited research is
      available for the treatment of specific conditions, including low back pain, but it is
      theorized to inhibit or facilitate the muscle, improve blood flow, reduce pain, and improve
      joint alignment. Methods: The purpose of this study is to determine the immediate and delayed
      effectiveness of Cramer® Sports Motion Tape on Gmax and lumbar paraspinal activation in a
      chronic mechanical low back pain population. A convenience sample of 20 new patients with
      current, chronic low back pain, no current neurologic signs or symptoms, no previous spinal
      surgery, no corticosteroid treatment within the last two weeks, and who are not pregnant will
      be recruited for this study. Patients will sign an informed consent, complete all initial
      paperwork. Surface electromyography will be used to quantify the activity level of the Gmax
      and lumbar paraspinals (LP). The MVIC will be estimated for each muscle group and the patient
      will perform a series of 4 randomized exercises, 5 repetitions each; Clams with Resistance,
      Standing Hip Abduction with Resistance, Sidelying Hip Abduction, and a forward bend. After
      each exercise the patient will rate &quot;How hard they are working&quot; on the RISE scale. Following
      the initial test, Cramer® Sports Motion Tape will be applied to the gluteal and low back
      area. After the tape is applied, the EMG exercise protocol will be repeated. The tape will be
      left on until the patient returns for their next appointment, within 24 to 48 hours, where
      they will have a delayed post-test. Patients will rate their pain, surface electrodes will be
      applied to the previous testing sites, and MVIC will be retested for each muscle group. The
      patient will perform the same protocol that was performed in the initial testing session. The
      EMG signals will be smoothed, rectified and analyzed using a root-mean-square algorithm. The
      investigators will use visual onset and offset of the EMG signal amplitude to select the
      middle 3 trials. Average activation and peak activation will be determined and compared to
      the MVIC for each muscle group, and expressed as a %MVIC. This will allow %MVIC to be
      compared and rank order among groups and muscles.

    <description>3 muscles during 4 exercises (ClamsR, Sidelying, StandingAB, ForwardBend) at 3 time points (Baseline[T1], Immediate post[T2], 24hrs[T3]), were analyzed in 20 subjects, totaling 720 data points. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction(MVIC) was assessed using the standard manual muscle testing positions. For each subject, the EMG signals of the muscles during the exercises were smoothed, rectified and analyzed using a root-mean-square algorithm and the greatest activation of each muscle was used. After the peak activation(PA) for each muscle was determined, it was compared to the MVIC of the reference exercise for the respective muscle group, and expressed as a percent of MVIC (%MVIC). In some cases the %MVIC is greater than 100% because the MVIC was assessed during a manual muscle test position. During an exercise some muscles generated greater PA and therefore when calculated the %MVIC was greater than 100%. Due to the amount of data, we have provided the Gmax %MVIC results.</description>

    <description>The amount of perceived exertion was reported for each of the 4 exercises (ClamsR, Sidelying, StandingAB, ForwardBend) at 3 time points (Baseline[T1], Immediate post[T2], 24hrs[T3]), by 20 subjects, totaling 240 data points. This was measured using the TheraBand(R) Resistance Intensity Scale for Exercise (RISE Scale). Participants were asked to rate their perceived exertion on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no resistance and 10 being maximum resistance. The results of the 20 subjects were averaged for each exercise at each time point.</description>

        <title>Perceived Exertion</title>
        <description>The amount of perceived exertion was reported for each of the 4 exercises (ClamsR, Sidelying, StandingAB, ForwardBend) at 3 time points (Baseline[T1], Immediate post[T2], 24hrs[T3]), by 20 subjects, totaling 240 data points. This was measured using the TheraBand(R) Resistance Intensity Scale for Exercise (RISE Scale). Participants were asked to rate their perceived exertion on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no resistance and 10 being maximum resistance. The results of the 20 subjects were averaged for each exercise at each time point.</description>
