  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators expect an intervention that focuses on actual dialogue and familiarity with
      members of the other culture, discussion of empathy, generosity, and kindness, and focus on
      adaptive and reciprocal modes of conflict resolution will alter both physiological,
      behavioral, and mental response to the pain of the other, increase empathy, and reduce
      hostility.

      1. As a first hypothesis, the investigators expect the process to be meaningful to the
           participants as indicated by an interview after the last session about the experience
           and its meaning to them. Using narrative analysis techniques, the investigators will
           examine the effect of the intervention on (a) conception of the other, (b) understanding
           of the concept the investigators wish to endorse - empathy, generosity, kindness, and
           dialogue, (c) potential for conflict resolution between cultures, and (d) hopes, dreams,
           and ambition for future in the region.

        2. Hypotheses Related to the Conflict Discussion: The investigators expect that prior to
           intervention, the increase in &quot;affiliative hormones&quot; (Oxytocin and Vasopressin) will be
           minimal and the increase in stress hormones (Cortisol and Alpha Amylase) will be greater
           after the conflict discussion, particularly after the discussion with member of the
           out-group. Following the intervention, the investigators expect a greater increase in
           the &quot;affiliative hormones&quot; will be greater and there will be no stress response, and the
           difference between the hormonal response to member of own culture and other culture will
           decrease. The investigators expect that among controls, there will be no change.

        3. The investigators expect greater hostility, lower empathy, and lower reciprocity during
           conflict discussion with member of the same culture compared to member of the other
           culture. For the intervention group, the investigators expect the degree of empathy and
           reciprocity to members of the outgroup to increase and hostility to decrease following
           the intervention, while no change will be observed for controls

        4. Measures of autonomic arousal (heart rate and skin conductance) will show higher arousal
           and vigilance during discussion with member of out-group than in-group. This will
           decrease for adolescents who underwent intervention, but not for controls.

    <description>The eight sessions include (1) presentation of the self to others members (2) getting familiar with the other culture (3) what is a conflict - how do conflicts come about, what are adaptive and non-adaptive modes of resolving conflict (4) getting to know the &quot;Other&quot; - preconceived notions about the other side (5) on dialogue- what is dialogue, can dialogue offer means for conflict resolution, what are the benefits of dialogue to inter-cultural and inter-racial conflicts, (6) empathy, generosity, and kindness (7) wrapping up - hopes for the future at the personal and community levels, practical suggestions (8) goodbye and summary - what have we learned ,&quot;gift giving&quot;, summary of process by group leaders.</description>
