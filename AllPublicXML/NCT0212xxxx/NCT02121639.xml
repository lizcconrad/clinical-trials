      The aim of the ProCAID study is to determine if the addition of the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 to
      docetaxel and prednisolone (DP) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) in Metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer to a degree worthy of further investigation

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically proven mCRPC with documented metastases (measurable or
             evaluable disease is acceptable) now eligible for treatment with docetaxel
             chemotherapy

          2. Disease progression since the last change in therapy defined by one or more of the
             following according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) criteria (J Clin
             Oncol 2008;26:1148-1159):

             i. PSA progression as defined by the prostate cancer working group (2) (PCWG2)
             criteria (Scher et al. 2008 J Clin Oncol. 26; 1148). This must be based on a series of
             at least 3 readings at least 7 days apart. The 3rd reading must be &gt;= 2ng/ml. In the
             event where an intermediate reading is lower than a previous reading, then the patient
             will still be eligible (ie. the 3 readings do not need to be consecutive). The first
             of the three readings must have been obtained after commencing the previous systemic
             therapy, or, in the case of androgen receptor antagonists, after discontinuing.

             ii. Radiographic progression of nodal or visceral metastases as defined by RECIST
             version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228). See Appendix 5 iii. The appearance of two or
             more new bony metastases

          3. Serum testosterone &lt;1.7 nmol/L (ongoing LHRH analogue or antagonist therapy is
             permitted to maintain a castrate state)

          4. Discontinuation of prior therapies for prostate cancer ≥ 4 weeks prior to commencing
             study treatment (with the exception of an LHRH agonist or antagonist where required
             for ongoing testosterone suppression)

          5. No anti-androgen withdrawal response. Withdrawal responses typically occur following
             combined androgen blockade (LHRH analogue/antagonist or orchidectomy combined with an
             anti-androgen) as initial therapy for a prolonged period, or in patients who respond
             to an anti-androgen as second-line therapy. Consistent with PCWG2 guidelines,
             investigators should evaluate such patients for withdrawal response for 6 weeks and
             then confirm disease progression. Investigators need not wait to assess withdrawal
             response in patients who did not respond, or who showed a PSA decline for ≤ 3 months,
             after an anti-androgen was administered as a second-line or later intervention

          6. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          7. Hb ≥ 9g/dL; platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x109/L

          8. Bilirubin ≤ ULN ; ALT and AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          9. Sodium and potassium within the normal range for the site

         10. Able to swallow study drugs (without crushing/opening in the case of AZD5363)

         11. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

         12. Aged 18 years or over

         13. Provision of written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy (patients may have received previous or
             ongoing bisphosphonates or denosumab). There are no restrictions on prior use of
             second generation hormonal therapies e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide

          2. Prior malignancy with an estimated ≥ 30% chance of relapse within 2 years following
             curative treatment

          3. Previously identified brain metastases, or spinal cord compression unless treated with
             full functional recovery

          4. Prior radiotherapy to &gt; 30% of bone marrow

          5. Administration of an investigational agent within 30 days of first dose of study
             medication

          6. Type I or II diabetes mellitus requiring either insulin or oral hypoglycaemics for
             routine management. Patients with type II diabetes mellitus that is well controlled by
             dietary measures alone are eligible to participate. Patients found to have a fasting
             glucose ≥7 mmol/L (≥126 mg/dL) or glycosylated haemoglobin &gt;8% (64 mmol/mol) at
             screening should be assessed for appropriate management according to local policy.
             Those in whom dietary measures alone provide good diabetic control will be eligible
             for inclusion

          7. Malabsorption syndrome, previous gastrointestinal surgery, or other gastrointestinal
             condition that may affect drug absorption

          8. Coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, vascular stent, myocardial infarction,
             angina pectoris or congestive heart failure (NYHA ≥ grade 2) within the last 6 months

          9. Abnormal echocardiogram (LVEF &lt;LLN)

         10. Uncontrolled hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood
             pressure &lt;50 mmHg)

         11. QTc interval of &gt;480 msec at two or more time points within a 24 hour period

         12. Proteinuria (3+ on dipstick analysis or &gt;500 mg/24 hours) or creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN
             concurrent with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min

         13. Proteinuria (either 3+ on dipstick analysis or &gt;500 mg/24 hours) or creatinine &gt;1.5 x
             ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min (assessed as per local practice
             e.g. by Cockcroft and Gault estimation)

         14. Exposure to potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 or substrates of CYP3A4
             within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's Wort)

         15. Unresolved toxicity ≥ grade 2 (except alopecia) from previous cancer therapy

         16. Patients with a partner of child-bearing potential who are not using a highly
             effective method of contraception, who are unwilling to use condoms during the study
             and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug

         17. Known hypersensitivity to AZD5363, its excipients, or drugs in its class

         18. Previous exposure to agents with the following mechanisms of action:

               -  inhibition of AKT (e.g., MK2206, GDC0068, GSK2110183, GSK2141795)any inhibitor
                  with PI3K pharmacology (e.g., GDC0941, XL147, BKM120, PX866, BYL719, AMG319,
                  GDC0032, INK1117, INK119)

               -  any compound with mixed PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase

               -  or any mTOR kinase inhibitor (e.g., AZD8055, AZD2014, OSI027, INK128) Note: Do
                  not exclude patients previously treated with a rapalogue (allosteric inhibitor of
                  mTOR; mTORC1 complex inhibitor) - including temisirolimus (Torisel; Pfizer),
