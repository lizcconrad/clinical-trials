  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is a prophylactic approach that can reduce the
      incidence of falls and the resulting injuries among older adults at risk and thus reduce its
      escalating medical cost. This project explores perturbation training through the use of
      treadmill device and a motor learning approach, in which experience with slip-like
      perturbation generated by that treadmill is used to prepare the motor system to develop and
      then put to use fall-resisting skills outside of training environment (cross-environment
      transfer). The computer-controlled treadmill is portable, safe and easy to operate, thus
      conducive for use in clinics or community centers. The study logically builds on and
      complements the team's previous and current research programs, and will further test that
      after such a single session, older adults at risk can retain such cross-environment transfer
      and reduce their likelihood of falls in everyday living for the next 6 to 12 months. Finally,
      the study will explore that such reduction of falls does not come merely from these persons'
      familiarity with the training or testing setup, protocol and environments.

    <description>The dynamic stability will be evaluated based on the dynamic relationship of motion state (i.e., the combination of position and velocity) between the center of mass and the base of support. It will be calculated as the shortest distance from the instantaneous motion state of the center of mass to the threshold against backward fall. It is a dimensionless variable.</description>
