  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition during pregnancy is more common in poor women in the developing world due to
      inadequate dietary intake combined with increased nutrient requirements; pregnancy risk is
      more consequential than among other demographic groups with increased risk of maternal and
      infant mortality and the lifelong effects of fetal malnutrition. The benefits of treating
      moderate malnutrition during pregnancy remain largely undocumented. This study tests the
      hypothesis that providing either a fortified flour or fortified paste-based supplementary
      food designed to replete the nutrient deficits during pregnancy will result in improved
      maternal nutritional recovery rates and higher infant birth weights and lengths. This study
      is a randomized, controlled clinical trial of 3 supplementary foods in 1800 moderately
      malnourished Malawian women who are pregnant. Subjects will receive one of 3 food rations: 1)
      a ready-to-use supplementary food formulated to deliver about 200% of the recommended daily
      allowance (RDA) of most micronutrients in pregnancy (RUSF-P), 2) corn soy blend with a
      multiple micronutrient tablet chosen to deliver about 200% of the RDA of most micronutrients
      (CSB-P) or 3), the standard of care which is a corn soy blend with supplementary iron and
      folic acid (CSB), delivering between 0-350% of the RDA. Subjects will receive the
      supplementary food until they recover from MAM. The outcome of the pregnancy and maternal
      nutritional status will be followed until 3 months after delivery.

    <description>This is the control group for the study, which will receive the Malawi standard of care. The treatment provided to women randomized to this arm of the study includes daily iron (60 mg) and folic acid (400 mcg) supplementation, along with 4 kg/2 weeks corn-soy blend (~357 gm/d CSB).</description>

    <description>The treatment provided to women randomized to this arm of the study includes 200gm/d CSB along with a standard maternal multiple micronutrient tablet, which together provide a comparable amount of energy, protein and micronutrients to the ready-to-use supplemental food. The micronutrient supplement known as the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) / World Health Organization (WHO) / United Nations University (UNU) international multiple micronutrient preparation (UNIMMAP) is widely available and has been used in many settings worldwide in pregnant women.</description>
