  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer kills 160,000 patients annually; this represents 28% of all US cancer deaths. The
      overall year survival rate has only improved from 12% to 17% in 33 years. This failure
      reflects the innate lethality of lung cancer, but also reflects defects in patient care
      delivery. Care for the lung cancer patient starts with an abnormal radiologic scan, proceeds
      through a diagnostic biopsy, tests to determine the extent of spread of the disease (stage),
      selection of appropriate treatment, and finally ends with patient outcomes. At each step are
      multiple options and independent specialists, each one engaged by a process of sequential
      referrals in the serial care model. This process is often not user-friendly, is riddled with
      inefficiency, delays, and outcome variances.

      The coordinated multidisciplinary model, in which patients and their doctors collaborate to
      provide evidence-based care, is believed by experts to be superior, but has few examples of
      successful implementation. The implementation gap exists because of the paucity of good
      quality data, and lack of implementation know-how.

      Embedded in the highest US lung cancer mortality zone, the greater Memphis area has a
      racially, culturally, economically and geographically diverse population. The investigators
      research group has shown how poor quality care impairs patient survival in this region and in
      the greater US. The investigators have linked patient survival to compliance with
      multidisciplinary care plans. In this project, the investigators propose to rigorously test
      the impact of the multidisciplinary care model on patient outcomes in a community-based,
      private practice environment, similar to where 70% of lung cancer care is delivered in the
      US.

      The objective of this study is to provide high-level evidence of the impact of
      multidisciplinary care on lung cancer patient outcomes. Multidisciplinary care is defined as
      a model of care in which patients, their care-givers and key specialists concurrently and
      directly evaluate the same patients in the presence of the patients and their informal
      caregivers, in order to develop evidence-based consensus care plans

      Within the Baptist Memorial Health Care system, the Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology
      Program has two components: Primarily, the program is centered in a multidisciplinary clinic,
      wherein patients and their informal caregivers are seen by multiple specialists at a single
      appointment time; secondarily, the program includes a multidisciplinary conference, wherein
      all of the specialists potentially involved in lung cancer care discuss patients referred for
      presentation and make consensus recommendations for care. This study focuses primarily on the
      experience and outcomes of care delivered to patients evaluated in the multidisciplinary
      clinic. However, data from the conference will also be included in some aspects of the study.
      The goal is to improve the access and quality of thoracic oncologic care delivery within the
      Baptist Healthcare System The investigators specific aim is to perform a prospective, matched
      cohort comparative effectiveness study of patients receiving serial vs. multidisciplinary
      care, with key patient-centered endpoints (survival, stakeholder satisfaction with the care
      experience, timeliness and stage-appropriateness of care, quality of staging). Serial care is
      defined as the current system of linear, sequential, referral-based care delivery.
