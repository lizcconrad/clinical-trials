    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle dysfunction impairs exercise capacity, quality of life and prognosis in
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of this prospective randomized
      controlled study was to evaluate effects of Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) plus
      quadriceps muscle training (NMES group) and sham NMES plus quadriceps muscle training
      (control group) on muscle function, exercise capacity, health related quality of life,
      activities of daily living, and self-efficacy in patients with COPD who are eligible and able
      to participate in endurance training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle dysfunction is common and impaires exercise capacity in patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Exercise training is the main component of the treatment
      of COPD.

      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is successful in COPD patients who are unable to
      perform exercise training. The NMES has positive effect on peripheral muscle function,
      exercise capacity and breathlessness in activities of daily living in COPD patients who had
      an abnormal body composition or who were too dyspneic to leave their home. A nonrandomized
      uncontrolled study has shown that application of NMES at home for improved exercise capacity
      in patients with better-preserved muscle mass. Evidence from a preliminary study without
      applying sham NMES revealed that NMES applied as complementary to ambulatory respiratory
      rehabilitation program increased quadriceps strength, quality of life and six minute walk
      distance in severe to very severe patients.

      Despite documented benefits of NMES in COPD patients, the place of NMES as an adjunct to
      pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients who were able to do regular endurance and strength
      training on is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of
      NMES plus quadriceps muscle training (NMES group) and sham NMES plus quadriceps muscle
      training (control group) on muscle function, dyspnea, fatigue, exercise capacity, health
      related quality of life, activities of daily living, and self-efficacy in patients with COPD
      who are eligible and able to participate in endurance training.

    <description>The incremental shuttle walk test was performed in an enclosed corridor. Patients were required to walk back and forth, turning around two cones placed 9 meters apart making the shuttle distance 10 meters long. Patients followed the rhythm dictated by the audio signal.</description>
