  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether multimedia based health information presented
      in a pediatric acute ward to parents of children with breathing difficulties due to lower
      respiratory tract infections, is more effective than verbal information to reduce the
      parent's anxiety and to increase satisfaction with nursing care and health information.

      The intervention website www.syktbarn.no is an open Norwegian online resource for parents of
      small children, and the site contains videos, audio clips, animations, illustrations,
      pictures and text materials regarding children's illnesses and normal development. In
      addition, the parents can use an interactive symptom checker that will help them to decide
      what to do and when to seek medical advice when their child is sick. The uniqueness of the
      website is the authentic video clips of sick children with common childhood symptoms like
      breathing difficulties, signs of dehydration, rash, cough and fever.
