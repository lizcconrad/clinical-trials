    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop, refine and pilot a novel complex (HELP-COPD)
      assessment, undertaken during or immediately after a hospital admission, which addresses the
      holistic care needs of people with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) measurement system has a core of 27 validated questions in four domains: Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being. Scores range from 0 (worst quality of life) to 108, and are responsive to change with a minimum clinically important difference for improvement of 5.5. A sub-scale of 10 questions for use in lung cancer is considered to be appropriate in other respiratory conditions.</description>

    <description>The trial specialist nurse trained in palliative aspects of respiratory care will arrange a meeting to suit the patients' clinical condition and convenience. During the meeting the HELP-COPD action plan will be worked through by the patient and study nurse, and any areas of concern will be identified. Based on the findings of the assessment, a range of actions points may be generated. All referrals will be made through the usual channels. Issues that have arisen from the assessment will be clearly recorded on the HELP-COPD action plan and by ensuring that all agencies and the patient have copies of the plan it is hoped that the planned action points will be reviewed and implementation facilitated. The action plan will be reviewed by the study nurse who will contact the patient at 1, 3 and 6 months to check progress with action points.</description>
