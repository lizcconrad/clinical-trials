      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate safety and tolerability of 8-week oral administration of SAR100842 in patients
      with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of SAR100842 in patients with systemic sclerosis
           as measured by disease related biomarkers and Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor
           signaling markers in blood and skin;

        -  To explore the effect of SAR100842 on skin thickness in patients with systemic sclerosis
           as measured by the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS);

        -  To explore the effect of SAR100842 on quality of life as measured by the Scleroderma
           Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ);

        -  To document long term safety of SAR100842 during the extension part.

      Core part: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study - 8-week treatment Extension
      part for participants completing the core part: Open label non-controlled study - 16-week
      treatment

      Each patient's participation in the study will be approximately 13 or 33 weeks depending on
      their participation in the extension part: up to 2 weeks of screening, 8 weeks of treatment
      in the core part, 1 to 30 days wash-out between core part and extension part , 16 weeks of
      treatment in the extension part and 3 weeks of follow up.

        Inclusion criteria :

        - Patients who meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for systemic
        sclerosis with diffuse cutaneous involvement and &lt;36 months since the onset of the first
        systemic sclerosis manifestation other than Raynaud's phenomenon and have a Modified Rodnan
        Skin Score (mRSS) â‰¥ 15 and an area of definite involvement of the dorsal forearm that is
