      In the proposed study, the investigators will assess the brain response to medication probes
      the investigators have previously studied with SPECT. The brain response to ondansetron and
      lidocaine infusions will be measured Arterial Spin Labeling and functional connectivity MRI
      (fcMRI).

    <textblock>
      An extensive effort has been mounted to understand the neurobiologic mechanisms involved in
      the development and persistence of cocaine addiction and tendency to relapse. Although the
      last two decades have resulted in an explosion in our understanding of the biological
      mechanisms of reward, establishing the relevance of this knowledge to the addictive process
      has been problematic. Most importantly, this information has been of limited utility in
      offering new pharmacologic treatment approaches to addicted patients - particularly those
      with cocaine addiction. Over the past 15 years our laboratory has published multiple studies
      using pharmacologic probes to explore the biologic underpinnings of cocaine addiction using
      single photon emissions computerized tomography (SPECT) technology. More recently, however,
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has offered several advantages over SPECT and is
      now a favored approach, e.g. fMRI allows the continuous measurement of neural responses
      rather than a very limited time period with SPECT (1-3 minutes every 48 hours). Using fMRI
      [including both ASL (Arterial Spin Labeling) and fcMRI (functional connectivity], the neural
      response can be measured throughout the 60 min that follows infusion, allowing identification
      and capture of the maximal brain response period that may occur at any time during this 60
      min. In the proposed study, we will assess the brain response to two of the probes
      (scopolamine and lidocaine) we have previously studied with SPECT.
