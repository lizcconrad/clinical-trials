  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morphine is the gold standard for treatment of severe acute pain but it has a number of
      adverse effects.

      No study has so far managed to identify the morphine-induced adverse drug reactions. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine predictive factors of morphine-induced
      adverse drug reaction when it is used in emergency departments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We want to study a large cohort of morphine-induced adverse drug reactions patients, the
      consequences for patients, mainly in terms of severity, and predictive criteria. This will
      allow us to identify some patients most at risk of morphine-induced adverse drug reactions,
      and thus to adapt morphine titration and monitoring of these patients. Leading to a better
      understanding and a better prediction of adverse effects in patients, it is possible that
      part of the &quot;opiophobia&quot; which persists in emergency services disappear. Finally, it is
      toward a better security but also a better efficiency in the management of pain patients in
      emergencies that leads this study.

      The secondary objectives are:

      To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events related to morphine. To establish
      an inventory of morphine use in emergency departments in the different centres studied.
