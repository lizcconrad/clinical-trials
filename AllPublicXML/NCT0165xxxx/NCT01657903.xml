  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the ability of two European Union (EU)
      regulated gel to foam toothpaste formulations versus a non-fluoride toothpaste using a
      modified in-situ model of dental erosion and remineralization. A positive control i.e
      fluoride containing toothpaste marketed in EU will also be compared to non-fluoride
      toothpaste.

      The aim of this study is to assess the remineralization effects of two EU gel to foam
      toothpaste formulations with 1450 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride as sodium fluoride
      (NaF) and 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3) versus a non-fluoride (0 ppm F)/KNO3 toothpaste as a
      negative control. The two experimental gel to foam toothpaste formulations differ in their
      relative dentine abrasivity (RDA) values which is an in-vitro measure of a toothpaste
      abrasivity to the dentinal tissues. A marketed toothpaste containing NaF and KNO3 will serve
      as a positive control.

    <measure>Relative Erosion Resistance (RER) of Enamel Specimens Post 4 Hours of Treatment Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours post treatment in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Enamel specimens were exposed to dietary erosive challenge and set of five indentations within each specimen was measured. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine RER which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent RER was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Smaller the negative RER, better is treatment regimen in imparting resistance to enamel.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery of Enamel Specimens Post 4 Hours of Treatment Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours post treatment in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1- R)/ (E1-B)]*100. A higher percentage values indicate a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Relative Erosion Resistance (RER) of Enamel Specimens Post 4 Hours of Treatment Exposure</title>
        <description>Enamel specimens were exposed to dietary erosive challenge and set of five indentations within each specimen was measured. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine RER which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent RER was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Smaller the negative RER, better is treatment regimen in imparting resistance to enamel.</description>

          <title>Relative Erosion Resistance (RER) of Enamel Specimens Post 4 Hours of Treatment Exposure</title>
          <description>Enamel specimens were exposed to dietary erosive challenge and set of five indentations within each specimen was measured. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine RER which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent RER was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Smaller the negative RER, better is treatment regimen in imparting resistance to enamel.</description>

        <title>Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery of Enamel Specimens Post 4 Hours of Treatment Exposure</title>
        <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1- R)/ (E1-B)]*100. A higher percentage values indicate a better outcome.</description>

        <title>SMH Recovery of Enamel Specimens Post 2 Hours of Treatment Exposure</title>
        <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1- R)/ (E1-B)]*100. A higher percentage values indicate a better outcome.</description>
