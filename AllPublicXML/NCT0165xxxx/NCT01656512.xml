  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. It accounts for
      one fourth of all childhood cancers &amp; 74 % of childhood leukemia. Based upon drug registry
      data, children prescribed more than three courses of systemic glucocorticoids yearly faced a
      20% increase in age-adjusted fracture rates. Rapid recovery occurred once glucocorticoids
      were discontinued, and fracture rates returned to expected for age by 1 year after treatment
      (Journal Of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism 2009). The investigators will study the role
      of bisphosphonates in the prevention of secondary osteoporosis in children &amp; adolescents
      treated for ALL in the Children's Cancer Hospital -Egypt.

    <description>we will do the following for evaluation :
Bone densitometry using Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan analyzed using the Z-score. To be done :
At baseline ( not more than 48 hours of start of therapy with steroids)
At week 48
At end of treatment ( week 120 for girls ) &amp; ( week 146 for boys)
As required clinically eg: fractures .
Magnetic resonance imaging of both hips &amp; knees will be done at reinduction I &amp; II &amp; if symptomatic.</description>
