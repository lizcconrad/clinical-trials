  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approved dosing schedule of azacitidine for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is 75 mg/m^2/day
      subcutaneous for 7 consecutive days every 28 days, which is based on the data from standard
      chemotherapy regimen and a Phase I safety clinical trial. Since the optimal dosage of this
      drug has not been found yet, it remains as a subject of clinical study that needs to be
      examined. If initial toxicity is minimized by developing dosage/regimen that replaces the
      standard therapy, it will be possible to provide continuous treatment with increased
      convenience by patients and treating physicians as well as improvement for safety in elderly
      patients or those with serious cytopenia. In addition, it is expected to lead to a better
      response by strictly keeping a treatment schedule.

      Recent US study showed that 5-day regimen showed similar treatment results, but retrospective
      data from Spain showed lower response rate in 5-day regimen. Considering the recent
      circumstances around dosage and schedule of azacitidine in lower risk MDS, a Phase II
      clinical trial is planned in lower risk MDS patients in order to explore the efficacy in
      5-day treatment by comparing prospectively with 7-day standard regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Using block randomization, subjects of Low or intermediate (INT)-1 patients will be
           equally allocated to the following two types of regimens.

             1. Group A: azacitidine 75mg/m^2 subcutaneously for 7 days every 28 days + best
                supportive care

             2. Group B: azacitidine 75mg/m^2 subcutaneously for 5 days every 28 days + best
                supportive care

        -  The study drug, azacitidine, is provided free of charge by Celgene until disease
           progression or relapse after response, or intolerable toxicity occurs in clinical study
           subject, or informed consent is withdrawn.

        -  No crossover between arms is allowed.

        -  Dose escalation in this study is not allowed; on the contrary, dose reduction or dose
           delay is possible based on adverse events and hematologic recovery.

    <description>Overall response rate is evaluated by assessing the percentage of patients with response (complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), bone marrow CR, and hematologic improvement), response period, and transfusion requirement. Best response during at least 6 cycles of treatment will be assessed if there is no treatment failure or disease progression within 6 cycles of treatment. For patients who can keep the 4 week interval the Time Frame will be 25 weeks. The cycle interval can be extended up to 8 weeks which makes 49 weeks the maximum Time Frame.</description>
