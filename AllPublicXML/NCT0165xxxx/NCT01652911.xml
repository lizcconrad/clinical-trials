  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, non-randomized safety and efficacy study, where
      participants with Type-1 diabetes will receive the Sernova Cell Pouch™ implanted in the
      subcutaneous site, two to approximately twelve weeks prior to transplantation of islets into
      the Cell Pouch™.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of the Sernova Cell Pouch™ in
      adult participants with Type-1 diabetes receiving islet transplantation for the first time.

      Secondary objectives are the following:

        1. To determine the proportion of subjects implanted with the Cell Pouch™ and transplanted
           with islets into the Cell Pouch™ who achieve and maintain insulin independence after
           islet transplantation.

        2. To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the Cell Pouch™ to maintain adequate
           immunological protection against both allo- and autoimmunity of islet transplant
           recipients.

        3. To determine through retrospective analysis comparative metabolic function and
           engraftment efficiency using patients undergoing standard intraportal islet
           transplantation under the current alemtuzumab standard of care protocol.

    <description>A tracking log will document adverse events with grading classification as per protocol. For the primary objective endpoint, safety will be assessed following initial Cell Pouch implantation, at the time of islet transplantation, and approximately one month following the initial islet transplantation. Safety will further be assessed at approximately three, six, nine and twelve months and then yearly thereafter.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible the participant must have had T1DM for more than 5 years, complicated by at
        least 1 of the following situations that persist despite intensive insulin management
        efforts:

          1. Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic
             symptoms at plasma glucose levels &lt; 3.0 mmol/L, indicated by, 2 or more episodes of
             severe hypoglycemia requiring third party assistance within 12 months, a Clarke score
             ≥4, HYPO score ≥1,000, lability index (LI) ≥400 or combined Hypo/LI &gt;400/300

          2. Metabolic instability, characterized by erratic blood glucose levels that interfere
             with daily activities and or 2 or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis over
             the last 12 months.

        Participants must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and must
        sign a statement of informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe co-existing cardiac disease, characterized by any one of these conditions: (a)
             recent myocardial infarction (within past 6 months); (b) left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt;30%; or (c) evidence of ischemia on functional cardiac exam.
