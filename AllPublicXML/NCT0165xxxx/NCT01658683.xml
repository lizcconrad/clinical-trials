  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a new intervention to improve the transition of
      patients from structured, supervised exercise to self-managed home- or approved
      community-based exercise programs in an effort to increase maintenance of exercise behaviour
      post cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The goal of the study is that those receiving the
      intervention will engage in at least 30 minutes of physical activity at a moderate or
      vigorous intensity 5 or more days per week, 26, 52 and 78 weeks after CR compared to those in
      the usual care group. The new intervention will be delivered by trained exercise facilitators
      (physiotherapists or exercise specialists) and will make use of: small group counseling
      teleconferences (5 sessions); personal telephone contacts (3 sessions), and community program
      demonstrations that would facilitate linkages between patients and approved community
      programs known as Heart Wise Exercise programs available in Ottawa and Toronto. The trial
      will be conducted at the Minto Prevention and Rehabilitation Centre at the University of
      Ottawa Heart Institute and the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation and Prevention Centre at the
      University Health Network (Peter Munk Cardiac Centre [PMCC] and Toronto Rehabilitation
      Institute [TRI]) sites. The study has a target enrollment of 604 participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>9-day accelerometer-measured physical activity of moderate and vigorous intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured directly by having participants wear the Actigraph GT3X accelerometer (Actigraph, Pensacola, Florida) over the right hip for a 9-day recording period, excluding periods when they are sleeping, swimming, or bathing. The activity monitor provides measurements including activity counts, energy expenditure, and step counts, in addition to activity intensity levels. Participants will be considered to be maintaining exercise at guideline recommended levels if they undertake ≥ 30 minutes of moderate and/or vigorous intensity physical activity on ≥ five days.</description>

    <description>A random sub-sample of participants (N = 124) will complete a symptom limited graded exercise test with electrocardiographic monitoring using a ramp protocol on a treadmill at baseline and at 52 weeks. Exercise tolerance will also be assessed using the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), a self-administered questionnaire that measures a patient's functional capacity and is used as an estimate of an individual's peak oxygen uptake</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is the current gold standard measure of generic quality of life, has been used in numerous studies and has been validated in many languages. The EQ-5D consists of 2 pages - the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.</description>

    <description>Height and weight is measured for the determination of body mass index (BMI). Waist circumference is measured using a non-stretchable standard tape measure. Systolic blood pressure is measured in a seated position after a five-minute rest period using an automated, non-invasive blood pressure monitor (BPTru) that automatically performs six measurements</description>

    <description>Health effects are measured by overall survival time; event-free time from myocardial infarction, revascularization or death; and quality adjusted life years. Participants are linked to health administrative data to allow health care utilization to be tracked. Participants complete a monthly diary to record time for counseling and physical activities, out-of-pocket expenses, and items related to productivity, including lost work days, home care expenses due to reduced function or cardiac disability. Data is collected on the resources expended for each intervention.</description>

During the teleconferences and personal telephone calls, the facilitator discusses the importance of exercise. Participants review their activity diaries, identify barriers to exercise maintenance experienced to date and brainstorm solutions as a group. In addition, the facilitator conducts community program demonstrations at Heart Wise Exercise program locations in Ottawa and Toronto for interested participants.</description>
