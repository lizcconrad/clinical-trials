  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human being has shown that he can live and work in the space environment, but due to the
      lack of essential mechanical load on muscle and bone, the fluid-shift as well as alterations
      in the acid-base balance (mainly on account of nutritional factors), the exposure to
      microgravity results in a gradual degradation of muscle, bone and cartilage, deconditioning
      of the cardiovascular system and metabolic changes. Countermeasures to prevent all the
      deconditioning of the physiological systems are not yet fully effective and require further
      investigation.

      A commonly utilized model of simulating the physiological effects of microgravity on the
      human organism on ground is the 6° head-down-tilt bed rest. In the present study the model
      has been used to study potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated deconditioning.

      One of the most constrictive changes appearing during space flight as well as during bed
      rest, are disuse-induced muscle losses. These are associated with a decrease in muscle
      protein synthesis, rather then an increase in muscle protein breakdown. Besides an effective
      training countermeasure, nutritional countermeasures gain respect in this context:
      supplementing conventional diets with whey protein or essential amino acids has been shown to
      increase muscle protein synthesis. Due to these anabolic properties whey protein seems
      promising to counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting.

      Drawbacks of a high protein intake are calciuric effects, ascribed to the proton-release when
      metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids. The so called 'low grade metabolic acidosis' has
      also shown to activate osteoclastic bone resorption and muscle protein degradation.
      Therefore, to maximize the anabolic potential of a whey protein supplementation, the
      acidogenic properties need to be compensated. As previous works suggest, a shift of acid base
      balance into the acid direction and the resulting changes in bone and protein turnover may be
      hindered by supplementing alkaline mineral salts.

      In this regard, a mid-term bed rest study was performed in order to investigate the effect of
      a combined whey protein (0.6 g/kg body weight/day) and potassium bicarbonate (90 mmol/day)
      supplementation as a potential countermeasure to multiple physiological and metabolic
      alterations on the human body resulting from real and simulated microgravity.
