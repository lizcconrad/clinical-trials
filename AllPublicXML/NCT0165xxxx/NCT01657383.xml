      The collection of data regarding patient outcomes after surgical intervention creates
      imperative knowledge to include surgeon performance, cost analysis, base for surgical
      research and publication, which in turn assist surgeons to improve the standard of care
      utilizing evidence-based practice.

      The concept of disease management stems from a logical evolution in the field of outcomes
      applications by healthcare provides is the concept of disease management. The basic premise
      of disease management is that there is a more optimal way to manage patients in order to
      reduce costs and improve health outcomes. The data collected from patient-reported outcomes
      allows the physician and staff to screen for specific health conditions, monitor patients
      individually, evaluate outcomes for specific groups, assess quality of care, determine impact
      of intervention and predict outcomes. Most of the follow-up results from this study will be
      obtained directly from the patient during follow-up visits, but other information may be
      obtained from medical records.

      Evaluation of the surgical database Application will identify both patient and procedural
      variables that can predict adverse outcomes.
