    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of adding liraglutide to high dose
      insulin therapy compared to high dose insulin therapy alone in patients with insulin-treated
      Type 2 diabetes with insulin requirements of &gt; 100 units of insulin per day.

    <textblock>
      40 subjects with Type 2 diabetes using &gt; 100 units of insulin per day with or without
      metformin with HbA1c &gt; 6.5% will be randomized into 2 treatment groups: treatment group will
      have liraglutide added to insulin and control group will have insulin uptitration only for 6
      months. Primary endpoint to be compared between groups will be HbA1c at 6 months. Secondary
      endpoints will include weight, total daily insulin dose, percent time in euglycemic,
      hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic ranges by continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and effect on
      GlycoMark and hs-CRP. Safety endpoints will include incidence of hypoglycemia and incidence
      of gastrointestinal side effects.
