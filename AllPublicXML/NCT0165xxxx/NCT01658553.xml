      A multicenter, non-randomized, placebo-controlled, single dosing schedule, subject-blinded
      study to evaluate the effect of GSK1120212 on the electrical activity of the heart as
      compared to placebo in subjects with solid tumor cancers. All subjects will undergo Screening
      assessments within 21 days prior to the start of the study treatment to determine their
      eligibility for enrollment in the study. Eligible subjects will receive study treatment
      administered over a period of 15 days followed by a post-treatment follow-up visit. Study
      treatment (GSK1120212-matched placebo) will be blinded to subjects. Subjects will receive
      GSK1120212-matched placebo on one day during the first 14 days of dosing. On all other days
      the subject will receive a once-daily 2 mg dose of GSK1120212 except for Day 15 when the
      subject will receive 3mg dose of GSK1120212 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained from
      continuous ECG recordings obtained via a 12-lead Holter monitor on Study Days 1 and 15 while
      subjects are in the clinical research unit. The effect of GSK1120212 on the electrical
      activity of the heart will be determined by time-matched ECGs obtained at the same time
      points relative to dosing on these days. Ambulatory blood pressure readings will be obtained
      from continuous 24-hour recordings via an ambulatory blood pressure monitor The effect of
      GSK1120212 on blood pressure parameters will be determined by blood pressure readings
      obtained at the same time points relative to dosing on Study Days 1 and 15. Serial blood
      samples to analyze the concentration of study drug in the subject's blood will be obtained at
      the same time points relative to dosing on Study Days 1 and 15. Subjects who are eligible for
      continued treatment with GSK1120212 may continue treatment under the rollover study MEK114375
      (drug study number). A post-treatment follow-up visit will be conducted within 28 days of the
      last dose of study treatment for all subjects who do not continue treatment in the rollover
      study MEK114375.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK1120212 is an orally administered, potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of
      MEK1(mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1)/MEK2 (mitogen-activated
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2) activation and kinase activity. As monotherapy,
      GSK1120212 has shown an acceptable risk-benefit profile with encouraging efficacy in various
      oncologic settings. This Phase I, single-sequence, placebo-controlled, singleblind,
      multicenter study is designed to evaluate the effects of repeat oral dosing of GSK1120212 on
      electrocardiographic parameters with a particular focus on its effect on cardiac
      repolarization (Corrected QT interval [QTc] duration) as compared to placebo in subjects with
      solid tumor cancers. A single dose of placebo will be administered on Study Day 1 followed by
      administration of a once-daily 2 mg dose of GSK1120212 for 13 days (Study Days 2 through 14)
      and on Study Day 15 a dose of 3 mg of GSK1120212 will be given. Digital 12-lead
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be extracted from continuous ECG recordings obtained via
      Holter monitor on Study Days 1 and 2 after the administration of placebo and on Study Days 15
      and 16 after the administration of GSK1120212. Pharmacokinetic samples will be time-matched
      with the Holter ECGs. This study will also assess the exposure-QTc relationship between
      plasma concentrations of GSK1120212 and its effect, if any, on cardiac repolarization,
      specifically on the QTc interval. Continuous 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      will be conducted to assess the effect of GSK1120212 on blood pressure parameters on Study
      Days 1 and 15. Safety assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) and vital signs, will be performed
      throughout the study. Following completion of study treatment, eligible subjects may
      transition to the open-label, rollover study MEK114375 to continue treatment with GSK1120212.

             laboratory values: greater than and equal to 50 mL/min; System: Cardiac-LVEF,
             laboratory values: greater than and equal to LLN (Lower limit of normal) by ECHO or
             MUGA(Multigated acquisition scan). Abbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST,

             LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MUGA; PT, prothrombin time; PTT, partial
             thromboplastin time; ULN, upper limit of normal. INR greater than 1.5 times ULN will
             be acceptable in case of subjects receiving therapeutic anticoagulants such as
             warfarin as long as INR is monitored during the study according to clinical practice;
             Calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula; If LLN is not defined for a given
             institution, then ejection fraction must be greater than and equal to 50%. NOTE:
             Subjects with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT or bilirubin values outside the
             range(s) in the table due to Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones are not
             excluded. Laboratory results obtained during Screening should be used to determine
             eligibility criteria. In situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted
             range, the investigator may opt to retest the subject and the subsequent within-range
             screening result may be used to confirm eligibility.

          -  Have serum potassium, serum magnesium, and total serum calcium levels within normal
             limits. NOTE: If total serum calcium is below the LLN, then it will be necessary to
             determine the albumin-corrected total serum calcium level. Use the following
             calculation: Calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 - serum
             albumin [g/dL]) NOTE: If serum potassium or magnesium level is below the LLN,
             supplementation is permitted in order to meet the inclusion criterion. Subject should
             be retested following supplementation. In order to avoid a situation where the subject
             cannot be dosed during the study due to electrolyte levels falling below the LLN, it
             is strongly recommended to maintain serum potassium levels greater than 4
             mEq(Milliequivalent )/L and serum magnesium levels greater than 2.2 mg/dL whenever
             possible. Slight elevations of potassium or magnesium above the upper limit of normal
             may be seen during supplementation and will not exclude subjects from study entry.

          -  If a female subject of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 14 days of first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective
