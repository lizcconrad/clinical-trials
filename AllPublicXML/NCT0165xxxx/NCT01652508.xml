    <textblock>
      The program is preventive and corrective, and carries brief messages by approaching and
      influencing services attendees who may not be able to reach in traditional reactive approach
      method of service users. Those traditional approaches are, for example, quitline and smoking
      cessation clinic. It can therefore benefit a larger population at low cost.
