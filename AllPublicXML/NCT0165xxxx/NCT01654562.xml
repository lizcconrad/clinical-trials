    <textblock>
      Primary objective: To examine the short-term effects of of simvastatin on the vision on males
      with choroideremia, evaluated by full-field scotopic threshold testing. The investigators
      hypothesize that they will see a reversible decrease in the dark-adapted vision in
      participants taking simvastatin.
