  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related sleep-disorders with the
      aging of the population is a major issue of public health. The prevalence of sleep
      disturbances is about 50% in dementia patients. Sleep in dementia is mainly characterized by
      prolonged night-time awakenings, sometimes with longer sleep latency and/or early awakening.
      The presence of these sleep disturbances is the main reason for the institutionalization of
      AD patients, as well as a major cause of the deterioration of the caregivers' sleep. The
      MEMENTO cohort is composed of patients with isolated memory complaints or mild cognitive
      impairment, at high risk to develop dementia. All voluntary patients from the CMRR (Center of
      Memory, resources and Research) of Bordeaux (MEMENTO cohort) will be tested at inclusion and
      followed-up 1 year later. For these two evaluations, actigraphic monitoring at home, 2-night
      polysomnography (PSG) monitoring at hospital including a 24-hour period of urinary melatonin
      dosage, neuropsychological tests battery, a virtual reality tool and questionnaires will be
      used.
