      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of an early palliative care
      intervention (PRESENCE: Providing Resources Education, Support, and Enabling New brain tumor
      patients to Cope Effectively) and the effect of the intervention on patient and caregiver
      distress.

      Patients and caregivers will be enrolled in two phases. Phase I is a qualitative study
      exploring the experience of primary caregivers of patients with a new diagnosis of malignant
      brain tumor during the first 10 weeks of the diagnosis and beginning treatment process.
      During Phase I, only caregivers patients with a malignant brain tumor who are at least two
      months and not more than six months into treatment at the Seidman Cancer Center (SCC)will be
      enrolled. They will be asked to participate in a qualitative interview to describe the newly
      diagnosed experience (diagnosis through first 10 weeks of treatment) of having a loved one
      with a malignant brain tumor.

      A convenience sample of 20 patients and their primary caregivers will be enrolled for Phase
      II of this pilot project. The first ten patients and caregivers enrolled will receive usual
      care (Phase II, Arm A). Usual care is defined as standard post-operative care on a surgical
      unit in University Hospitals Case Medical Center. Discharge planning will be provided by the
      assigned in-patient social worker. Referrals to the assigned outpatient social worker will be
      made as appropriate. Patients and caregivers will be seen in the ambulatory medical oncology
      setting about three to six weeks after surgery, depending on post-operative recovery time.

      The second ten patients and caregivers enrolled will receiving the intervention (Phase II,
      Arm B). The unique features of the PRESENCE Project (PP) Intervention are 1) the early
      palliative care intervention (immediately post-op) provided by the new palliative care brain
      tumor team (Social worker, advanced practice nurse (APN), medical oncology registered nurse);
      2) an educational information session for patients and caregivers; and 3) frequent (every two
      week and as needed) telephone or clinic visits during the first ten weeks post operatively.
      In usual care, the patient and caregiver receive little supportive care until they begin
      cancer treatment. The intervention provides aggressive supportive care from the time of
      diagnosis.

      RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

        1. To investigate the feasibility of an early palliative care intervention (PRESENCE:
           Providing Resources Education, Support, and Enabling New brain tumor patients to Cope
           Effectively) for patients newly diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and their primary
           caregivers.

        2. To explore the experience of being a caregiver of a patient newly diagnosed with a
           malignant brain tumor.

        3. To determine the effect of the PRESENCE Intervention on patient and caregiver distress,
           anxiety, and depression.

        4. To determine the effect of the PRESENCE Intervention on caregiver reaction (benefit and
           burden) and caregiver mastery.

    <description>Distress: Psychological distress is defined as &quot;the general concept of maladaptive psychological functioning in the face of stressful life events&quot; (Abeloff et al., 2000, p. 556). Distress is being measured as a global construct, using a distress thermometer as described by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines (Holland &amp; Alici, 2010; nccn.org). Participants will rate their present level of distress (on a 0-10 scale, with 0 being no distress, to 10 being the most distressed) and then identify particular stressors in the area of practical problems, family problems, emotional problems, spiritual/religious concerns, physical problems, and any additional stressor as identified by the participant.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depression level</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression are two psychological outcomes commonly reported in caregiving research. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983) will be used to measure both concepts reflective of psychological wellbeing in patients and caregivers. The HADS is a reliable and valid instrument, with strong internal consistency for cancer populations. It has been used for patients who are hospitalized or ambulatory patients and for caregivers. It consists of 14 items which are scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3). Items are recoded and summarized into subscales of anxiety and depression (range 0-21). Participants scoring 11 or higher are considered anxious or depressed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Response to the Caregiving Experience</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The reaction is either positive (caregiver benefit) or negative (caregiver burden). The caregiver reaction will be assessed using the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA). This 24-item instrument will be used to measure the burden of informal caregiving using a 5-point Likert scale. The CRA consists of five subscales that represent positive and negative burden aspects of caregiving. They include 1) impact on schedule; 2) caregiver's esteem; 3) lack of family support; 4) impact on health; and 5) impact on finances. Positive items are reversed scored. Higher scores indicate greater levels of perceived burden.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Mastery</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pearlin &amp; Schooler Mastery Instrument (1978) will be used to assess caregiver mastery. Caregiver mastery refers to the caregivers' perceptions of their ability to meet the challenges of caregiving, to feel in control of the situation, and to use effective problem solving skills. The Pearlin &amp; Schooler Master Instrument is a seven item, five-point Likert scale instrument with a Crohnbach's alpha = 0.73. Scoring is done by summing item scores for a total score (possible range 7-35) with higher scores indicating higher levels of mastery. Examples of items include, &quot;I have little control over the things that happen to me&quot;, and &quot;There is little I can do to change many of the important things in my life&quot;.</description>
