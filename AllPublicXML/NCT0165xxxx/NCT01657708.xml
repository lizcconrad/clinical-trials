      Background:

      Shared Decision Making (SDM) refers to a process of health care delivery in which
      practitioners and clients seeking help with decisions, collaborate to access relevant
      information and enable client-centered selections of health care resources (1, 2). SDM leads
      to better treatment adherence and outcomes for people with a medical problem (3). SDM
      principles have previously been used in psychiatry to improve antipsychotic and
      antidepressant medication adherence (4, 5); however, these principles have yet to be applied
      to psychiatric rehabilitation (6).

      The current research uniquely aims to test the development and implementation of a SDM
      intervention for people with psychotic spectrum disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and affective
      disorder) during the referral process to psychiatric rehabilitation services. The study will
      be conducted this year using a randomly selected sample from the population of people with
      psychotic spectrum disorders hospitalized in SHALVATA psychiatric hospital in Israel. It aims
      to facilitate better treatment and rehabilitation outcomes. It has received the support and
      approval of the Mental Health Division of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Israel, the
      institutional review board (IRB) by the university of Haifa, Israel and a Helsinki committee
      approval by SHALVATA psychiatric hospital and the MOH in Israel.
