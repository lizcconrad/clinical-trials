    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare pharmacokinetics after single oral administration
      of 2 capsules of YH14659, a fixed-dose combination of clopidogrel and aspirin developed by
      Yuhan Corporation versus co-administration of Plavix (clopidogrel) and Astrix (aspirin) in
      healthy male volunteers.
