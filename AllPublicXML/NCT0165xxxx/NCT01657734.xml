  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are aggressive tumours with poor prognosis despite the current multimodal
      treatment. Hence, there is a clear need for new, effective therapies, among which immune
      therapy has emerged as a promising treatment option.

      When interpreting follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, the radiologist is often
      confronted with images that are difficult to interpret with the conventional anatomical
      imaging techniques. The difference between tumour relapse and therapy-mediated changes is not
      always distinctive.

      In this project, the investigators attempt to characterize the inflammatory response with
      parameters from advanced MRI techniques like MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion imaging and
      MR-diffusion imaging. These techniques allow characterization of cellular properties like
      metabolism and tissue structure respectively. Doing so, the investigators will monitor
      disease evolution in order to timely detect treatment failure, thereby allowing appropriate
      switch in patient management.
