  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in children has become a significant social problem considering that nowadays 4 to 5
      % of all children are obese in the industrialized countries with increased incidence in
      Europe by 10 to 50% over the past 10 years. Obesity is associated with the metabolic syndrome
      in 30% of the children and is considered as a state of chronic inflammation inducing the
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which determine metabolic and endocrine alterations
      on the organism. It has been observed that obesity is also linked to a change in the
      intestinal microflora with a reduction of Bacterioides and bifidobacteria and a decrease of
      Firmicutes and Staphylococcus aureus. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the
      metabolites may provide us with a characterization of the existing phenotypes and variations
      in relation to the changes of the physiological state, in particular when supplemented or not
      with a probiotic preparation.
