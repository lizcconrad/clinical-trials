  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 safety study will
      assess the effect of bardoxolone methyl relative to placebo on body weight and fat mass in
      approximately 60 patients with stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus (T2DM).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Screening eGFR ≥ 15.0 and &lt; 30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2; screening eGFR will be the average of
             the eGFR values collected during screening;

          2. A history of type 2 diabetes mellitus; diagnosis must have been made at ≥ 30 years of

          3. Male or female patients at least 30 years of age;

          4. Treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and/or an angiotensin
             II receptor blocker (ARB) for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening Visit A and during
             screening. The dosage of ACE inhibitor and/or ARB must be at KDOQI goal dose (Appendix
             13.4) and stable for 2 weeks prior to Screening Visit A and during screening (i.e., no
             change in dosage or medication);

          5. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) must be ≤ 160 mmHg and ≥ 105 mmHg and mean
             diastolic blood pressure (DBP) must be &lt; 90 mmHg during screening visits A and B;

          6. Willing to practice methods of birth control (both males who have partners of
             childbearing potential and females of childbearing potential) during screening, while
             taking study drug and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug is
             ingested;

          7. Serum magnesium level must be greater than or equal to 1.3 mEq/L at Screening Visit B
             or during a subsequent unscheduled visit during screening (serum magnesium level may
             be re-evaluated once during an unscheduled visit);

          8. Willing and able to give written informed consent for study participation and
             cooperate with all aspects of the protocol including tolerating being in a closed MRI.

        level must confirm type 2 diabetes; 2. Known non-diabetic renal disease (e.g., polycystic
        kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) [nephrosclerosis superimposed on
        diabetic kidney disease is acceptable]; Ongoing clinical investigation with evidence (e.g.,
        unexplained hematuria or red blood cell or white blood cell casts) suggesting non-diabetic
        renal disease other than nephrosclerosis; 4. History of a renal transplant or a planned
        transplant from a living donor during the study; 5. Urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR)
        at Screening Visit B greater than 3500 mg/g; 6. Hemoglobin A1c level &gt; 11.0% during
        screening; 7. Acute dialysis or acute kidney injury within 12 weeks prior to screening or
        during screening; 8. Clinical signs and/or symptoms of uremia and expected need for renal
        replacement therapy within 12 weeks following randomization, as assessed by the
        investigator; 9. Recently active cardiovascular disease defined as:

          -  Unstable angina pectoris within 12 weeks before study randomization;

          -  Myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous
             transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent within 12 weeks before study randomization;

             or planned during the study; 14. Systemic immunosuppression for more than 2 weeks,
             cumulatively, within the 12 weeks prior to randomization or anticipated need for
             immunosuppression during the study; 15. Total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST),
             or alanine transaminase (ALT) level greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) or
             alkaline phosphatase level greater than two times the ULN on ANY screening laboratory
             test result; 16. Female patients who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant during
             the study, or are nursing; 17. BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2; 18. Weight ≥ 300 pounds; 19. Height &gt;

             or alcohol abuse, as assessed by the investigator; 23. Clinically significant
             infection requiring intravenous administration of antibiotics or hospitalization

             History of bariatric surgery or planned bariatric surgery during the course of the

             potentially pose a health risk to the patient while involved in the study; 28.
             Participation in a clinical study involving any intervention within 30 days prior to
