  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the contraceptive efficacy of a nomegestrol acetate +
      17ß-estradiol (NOMAC-E2) combined oral contraceptive (COC) in healthy, sexually-active
      American women at risk for pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding patterns of women taking NOMAC-E2 were
      assessed and compared to those of women taking a norethisterone acetate + ethinyl estradiol
      (NETA-EE) COC. The safety of NOMAC-E2 was also assessed.

      Participants were randomized to receive either NOMAC-E2 or NETA-EE in a 3:1 ratio. As of
      Amendment 1 (which increased the sample size of the NOMAC-E2 group), the randomization ratio
      was adapted accordingly for participants randomized after the sample size increase.

      This study was terminated early. The decision to terminate the study was based upon
      difficulties encountered with data collection (related to incomplete e-Diary entries) in
      concert with business considerations. The decision was not related to any new or unexpected
      safety or efficacy findings with NOMAC-E2. As a result of this early termination, none of the
      pre-specified efficacy endpoints were analyzed.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year (13 cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Efficacy Outcome measure for this study was contraceptive efficacy, or the prevention of in-treatment pregnancy. The total incidence of in-treatment pregnancies was expressed as the Pearl Index, which is defined as the number of in-treatment pregnancies per 100 woman-years of exposure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Occurrence of Breakthrough Bleeding/Spotting</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year (13 cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants kept e-diaries to record their vaginal bleeding events. They were asked to record, on a daily basis, whether they experienced vaginal bleeding, which included BLEEDING or SPOTTING, at any time during a cycle other than normal menstruation while in the study. (This is also known as &quot;breakthough&quot; bleeding.) Vaginal bleeding that required &gt;=1 pad/tampon per day was classified as BLEEDING. Vaginal bleeding that did not require a pad/tampon per day was classified as SPOTTING.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Absence of Withdrawal Bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year (13 cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants kept e-diaries to record vaginal bleeding events. They were asked to record, on a daily basis, whether vaginal bleeding was present. Absence of withdrawal bleeding was defined as no bleeding/spotting during the expected bleeding period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 54 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not it is considered related to the study drug.</description>

    <description>Participants' body weights were measured in a consistent manner throughout the trial, using standardized equirpment. Last In-Treatment Measurement refers to a participant's end of trial visit, the timing of which differed among participants.</description>
