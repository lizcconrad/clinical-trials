        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the elderly cohort, nonsmoking 65 to 85 years, inclusive. For the young cohort,
             nonsmoking 18 to 45 years, inclusive.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) should be 18 to 36 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  At screening, sitting or supine heart rate of 50 to 100 beats per minute and sitting
             or supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 150 mm Hg and 50 to 90 mm Hg,
             respectively (2 of 3 measurements)

          -  Subjects with mild, chronic, stable disease (e.g., controlled hypertension,
             non-insulin-dependent diabetes, arthritis) may be enrolled if deemed medically
             acceptable by the investigator

          -  Negative for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus
             antibody within the last 3 months

          -  No clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of clinically significant respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal,
             hepatic, endocrine, hematological, neurological (including chronic headache, current
             or prior psychiatric disease/condition, stroke), cardiovascular, psychiatric,
             musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, or dermatological disorders. Subjects
             with mild, chronic, stable disease (e.g., controlled hypertension, controlled
             hypercholesterolemia, non insulin-dependent diabetes, osteoarthritis) may be enrolled
             if condition is well controlled and not anticipated to interfere with the objectives
             of the study.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal ECG (electrocardiogram).

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational drug or medical device
             within 60 days.

          -  Donation of â‰¥500 mL blood, or equivalent, within 8 weeks prior to admission day.

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would confound or
             interfere with evaluation of safety, tolerability, or PK of the investigational drug
             or prevent compliance with the study protocol.
