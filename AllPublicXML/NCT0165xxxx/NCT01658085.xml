      Study Design Multinodular Goiter (MNG) patients requiring surgery were referred to the
      Endocrine Surgery Unit.

      Indirect laryngoscopy was routinely performed preoperatively to assess normal motility in
      vocal folds (VF). Ultrasounds (US) study was performed the month previous to surgery to
      evaluate thyroid volume. Eligible patients met the following criteria: to have MNG, age
      between 18 and 80 and consent to be included in the study. Exclusion criteria included
      previous neck surgery, vocal fold impairment, permanent or transitory NSAID or analgesic
      treatment, coagulation disorders and any cognitive impairment.

      Eligible patients were proposed to enter a randomized study with 2 arms in which we compared
      the use of two harmonic scalpel devices: ACE14S and Harmonic Focus (Ethicon Endo-Surgery,
      Cincinnati, OH, USA).

      The main endpoint was operative time. Secondary endpoints were total and relative (%) time of
      use of the device along thyroidectomy, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury and
      hypocalcaemia (both persistent or temporary), number of ligatures, length of skin incision,
      postoperative pain according to a visual scale of pain, QOL after thyroidectomy (EuroQOL) and
      budget impact analysis.

      All patients were operated on by 2 surgeons, one senior (responsible for the Endocrine
      Surgery Unit) and one junior under supervision.

      Randomization Randomization was performed the same day of surgery at the OR by using a closed
      envelope. Patients were randomized to Group I (ACE14S) or Group II (HF) and allocated in a
      1:1 proportion; they reminded blinded until the end of the study about the device used.

      The haemostasis device was communicated to the surgeon previous to start surgery. Medical
      staff of the Endocrine Surgery Unit collected clinical data.

      Surgical Technique Total thyroidectomy (TT), defined as total bilateral extracapsular
      lobectomy 9, was performed using HF or ACE14S for vessel division. Monopolar and bipolar
      forceps for cutting and coagulation were routinely used. Ties were used under surgeon's
      criteria according to size of the vessels and/or the need to obtain haemostasis in the
      vicinity of the RLN when bipolar forceps were not considered safe enough.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To disclose the potential advantages and outcomes of the new Harmonic Focus (HF) device
      compared to Harmonic Scalpel ACE14S (ACE-14S) in benign thyroid surgery.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Controlled randomized study.

      METHODS:

      Harmonic Focus was compared to former ACE14S device in patients undergoing total
      thyroidectomy for Multinodular Goiter. The primary endpoint was time of surgery. Secondary
      endpoints were time of use of the device, % of use along the procedure, number of ligatures,
      blood loss, hypocalcaemia, recurrent laryngeal nerve impairment, postoperative pain and
      quality of life.

    <measure>Operative time</measure>
    <time_frame>Surgical time from skin incision to closure (about 70 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Operative time was measured from skin incision to removal of thyroid gland. The percentage of time using the device along TT was calculated as follows: time of use of the device x 100/ operative time.</description>

    <time_frame>From skin incision to removal of thyroid gland (about 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of time using the device along surgery was calculated as follows: time of use of the device x 100/ operative time.</description>

    <measure>Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury</measure>
    <time_frame>From surgery to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with laryngeal nerve injury were controlled monthly by indirect laryngoscopy till 6 months or healing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>hypocalcemia (both persistent or temporary)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily, from surgery to discharge (24h), or up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Temporary hypocalcemia was measured daily, from surgery to discharge.
Persistent hypocalcemia was followed up as follows:
Non-complicated patients: one week and six months after the operation date.
Complicated patients: every month until cure or up to 6 months after surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>postoperative pain according to a visual scale of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>From surgery to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pain evaluation was obtained at 24h and 7 days after surgery during postoperative control by using an analogue-visual scale reporting also the type of analgesic and the number of doses. If there was any complication (including reoperation) that increased hospital stay, pain evaluation was performed each 24h until discharge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QOL after thyroidectomy (EuroQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1st and 7th postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>QOL was evaluated by completing EQ-5D questionnaire when patients were scheduled for the study (1st and 7th postoperative day)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of ligatures</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Number of ligatures during the procedure was measured to determine if its reduction would imply less surgical time consumption</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of skin incision</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measured at the end of the operation, once the skin was closured.</description>

    <description>costs of total thyroidectomy (all of them according to the prices of our center) and deducting those time-dependent costs saved with the reduction of OR time. The following concepts were considered: personnel (with the same surgical team composition for both alternatives), anesthesia drugs, medical devices, overheads, repayment of the Harmonic generator, hospital stay and admission/discharge fees.</description>
