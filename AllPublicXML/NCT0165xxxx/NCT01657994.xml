    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the usefulness of a physical
      therapy treatment that combines robot-assisted walking with electrical impulses that help to
      make muscles contract. This treatment is intended for children with cerebral palsy. Up to
      eleven children with cerebral palsy will receive up to 18 treatments and will have several
      evaluations before and after treatment.
