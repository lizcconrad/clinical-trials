  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the effects of an 8-week supervised, site-based, group yoga
      intervention on cognition and functional fitness in older adults. The SAY Exercise study will
      compare the yoga group to a stretching group to determine if the program improves attention
      and cognition, reduces functional limitations, enhances functional performance in everyday
      activities, as well as psychological health in sedentary older adults between 55-80 years of
      age. The investigators also propose to assess heart rate variability using a 3-lead EKG and
      salivary cortisol levels to understand the moderators of the yoga-cognition relationship.

    <measure>Change in salivary cortisol from baseline to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be providing a small saliva sample via a passive drool into a vial. The compound of interest is cortisol (an indicator of body stress).</description>
