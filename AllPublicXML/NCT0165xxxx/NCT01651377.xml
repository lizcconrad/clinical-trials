    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are as follows: 1. To assess the cardiovascular and subjective
      effects of cocaine during treatment with pramipexole and placebo. 2. To assess the
      reinforcing effects of cocaine, measured using choice procedures, during treatment with
      pramipexole and placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol we propose to assess the impact of treatment with higher doses of the potent
      D2/3 agonist pramipexole, using the extended release preparation that has been shown to
      produce continuous DA receptor stimulation. Pramipexole is a non-ergot DA 3
      receptor-preferring agonist. In contrast to pergolide, bromocriptine and cabergoline, it does
      not stimulate 5-HT2B receptors and therefore does not cause cardiac valvulopathy. It can
      therefore be safely used chronically at higher doses, whereas pergolide has been withdrawn
      from the market for causing cardiac valvulopathy.

    <description>Before and after each cocaine infusion, physiologic responses will be closely monitored using repeated HR, BP, and ECG readings. To evaluate safety, a DSMB will meet annually and following any serious AE to examine data as well as any new published information on pramipexole relevant to the project. The number of AEs (including arrhythmias and ECG changes), changes in BP and HR, and changes in mood and psychiatric symptoms (using the BSI, BDI, POMS, and BPRS) will also be assessed throughout the study.</description>

    <time_frame>16 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ability of pramipexole, as compared to placebo, to reduce cocaine-induced craving and to reduce reinforcing effects produced by cocaine will be measured by: 1. VAS, Adjective Scales, and MCQ; 2. Choices for cocaine vs. money in the self-administration assay.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be English-speaking volunteers who are not seeking treatment at the time of the study.
             We require proficiency in English to ensure good communication with staff.

          -  Be aged between 18 and 55 years.

          -  Meet DSM-IV TR criteria for cocaine dependence.

          -  Have a self-reported history of using cocaine by the IV or smoked route.

          -  Have vital signs as follows: supine blood pressure &gt; 100/65 mm Hg, a seated blood
             pressure of &gt; 90/60 mm Hg, and an orthostatic change &lt; 20 mm Hg systolic or &lt;10 mm Hg
             diastolic on standing. To ensure that subjects will not be at risk from cocaine, the
             resting pulse must be &lt; 90 bpm and the blood pressure must be &lt; 150 mmHg systolic and
             &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic.

          -  Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within reference limits
             (±10%), with the following exceptions: (a) total bilirubin must be &lt; 2x upper limit of
             normal and ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase &lt;3× the upper limit of normal and (b)
             kidney function tests (creatinine and BUN) within normal limits.

          -  Have a baseline ECG that demonstrates clinically normal sinus rhythm, clinically
             normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias.

          -  Have a medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no clinically
             significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of the
             admitting physician and the principal investigator.

          -  Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as: psychosis, bipolar illness or
             major depression as assessed by SCID; organic brain disease or dementia assessed by
             clinical interview; history of any psychiatric disorder that would require ongoing
             treatment or that would make study compliance difficult; and history of suicide
             attempts within the past year and/or current suicidal ideation/plan.

          -  Have evidence of clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined

             unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or postmenopausal) or be
             using a reliable form of contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills,
             intrauterine device, or condoms with spermicide).

          -  Have asthma or currently use theophylline or other sympathomimetics.

          -  Have any other illness, condition, or use of psychotropic medications, which in the
             opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or successful
