      This study is being conducted this study to determine whether injections of Xeomin®, a type
      of botulinum toxin into the glands that produce saliva (one pair just below and in front of
      the ear and the other just under the jaw line) are safe and effective to treat excessive
      saliva, or drooling in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD)/parkinsonism.

      Participants will be recruited if they have Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism. Inclusion and
      exclusion criteria are summarized below. Participants will be screened at the first visit to
      make sure they are eligible for the trial. They will then undergo baseline testing including
      neurologic evaluation, questions to assess their memory and cognitive status and evaluation
      of their disease status using parts of the Unified Parkinsons's Disease Ratings Scale (UPDRS)
      that are routinely used to follow disease progression. They will be given a questionnaire to
      evaluate the severity of their drooling. Their saliva production will be measured by having
      them spit into a cup for 5 minutes, twice.

      At the first visit, after making sure they are eligible for the study and performing the
      baseline testing and procedures, they will be given either Xeomin or placebo (saline
      injections without medication) injections in the 4 glands that produce saliva. They will not
      know which injection they received. This visit will take about 2 hours. They will be followed
      up every month and asked about side effects, have neurologic evaluation and UPDRS testing and
      fill-in the questionnaire for drooling severity. Saliva volume will be measured as done at
      the first visit. At either Month 4 or 5, participants will receive the second injection. This
      will be a &quot;cross-over&quot; injection, i.e., if they received Xeomin at the first injection they
      will receive saline at the second and vice versa. Thus, all participants will receive the
      study medication Xeomin, either as the first injection or the second injection at 4 months or
      5 months. The follow up after the second injection will be one monthly visit for 3 months,
      with similar evaluations as described above. The follow-up visit will take about 1 hour each.

= Never drools, dry
= Mild-drooling, only lips wet

= Severe- drool drips off chin &amp; onto clothing
= Profuse- drooling off the body and onto objects (furniture, books) Drooling Frequency Scale
1. = No drooling 2. = Occasionally drools 3. = Frequently drools 4. = Constant drooling</description>

      <recruitment_details>Subjects with Parkinson's disease/ parkinsonism with troublesome sialorrhea were recruited from the Movement Disorders clinic at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, and by providing information to neurologists around the Boston area. Ten subjects were recruited between 9/5/2012 and 2/26/2014. The last study visit was completed on 9/5/14</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>17 subjects were assessed; 7 were excluded because they did not meet study criteria. This was a cross over study; all subjects received both placebo and Incobotulinum toxin injections and were followed up for 3 months after each injection. Washout period was 1-2 months, saliva weight had to be ≥ (baseline- 0.5 SD), to receive the second injection</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale. The UPDRS is a rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's Disease. It is made up of the 1) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood, 2) Activities of Daily Living and 3) Motor sections. These are evaluated by interview. We used UPDRS, Part 2 Questions 5,6,7 evaluating speech, salivation and swallowing and Part 3 questions 18 and 19 for motor examination of speech and facial expression. The scores for these sections were summed to obtain the total score. The range possible is 0- 20, with 20 reflecting worse disability</description>

          <description>Drooling Frequency and Severity Score:
The Drooling Score equals the sum of the Severity and Frequency sub-scores.The total score ranges from 2 to 9, with higher scores indicating more severe and frequent drooling
Drooling Severity Scale
= Never drools, dry
= Mild-drooling, only lips wet
= Moderate- drool reaches the lips and chin
= Severe- drool drips off chin &amp; onto clothing
= Profuse- drooling off the body and onto objects (furniture, books)
Drooling Frequency Scale
= No drooling
= Occasionally drools
= Frequently drools
= Constant drooling</description>
