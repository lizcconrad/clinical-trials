    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women are at increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. Components of a
      Mediterranean style diet (MedSD) are associated with reduced bone loss and fracture risk;
      however, the MedSD has not been tested in this population in the U.S. Therefore, fhe
      investigators propose a 24 week clinical research trial (12 week observational period
      followed by 12 week MedSD intervention) with feasibility of diet adoption and markers of bone
      turnover as the primary outcomes. The 12 week intervention will include provision of olive
      oil, walnuts and high n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) fish to replace other fats and
      oils, processed snacks and red meat, respectively; accompanied with fruit, vegetable, whole
      grain and legumes intake recommendations. The investigators hypothesize the MedSD
      intervention will increase serum n-3 PUFA and decrease saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA and
      this will result in an improvement in bone turnover markers. The outcomes of the proposed
      intervention trial will promote further study of the benefits of a MedSD in the US. the
      investigators envision the research team to expand to other systems such as cardiovascular,
      metabolic, and inflammatory mechanisms in which less risk of disease is associated with a
      MedSD.

    <description>Subjects will receive key foods (olive oil, walnuts, frozen portions of high n-3 LCPUFA fish) and instructed in the quantity to consume each week. Olive oil : minimum of 3 tablespoons per day. Walnuts:10.5 oz/week (1.5 oz/day). High n-3 LCPUFA fish: 3 or more fish meals per week. Additional guidelines for altering diet include incorporation of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains to replace sweets, white bread and starches, red meat and highly processed foods.</description>
