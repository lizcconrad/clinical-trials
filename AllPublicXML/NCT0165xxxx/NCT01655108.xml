    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of mesotherapy for the treatment
      of female pattern alopecia.

        -  Sixty female subjects between 18 and 65 years diagnosed with female pattern hair loss
           will undergo mesotherapy sessions weekly for ten weeks.

        -  One group will receive 0.5%/2ml minoxidil application and a control group will receive
           application of placebo (saline 0.9%).

        -  Biopsy of the scalp, trichogram and trichoscopy (Fotofinder) will be performed before
           and 08 weeks after treatment as a method objective evaluation of the response

      This is a trial that aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of mesotherapy with minoxidil
      0,5% versus placebo for androgenetic alopecia in female patients.

      The patients and the investigators who analyzes complementary exams are blind.

        -  Clinical criteria, photo, 4mm biopsia, trichogram and trichoscopy are perfomed before
           patients are randomized into two arms :

             1. Group 1 (Placebo):

                30 patients who will have intradermal injections in the scalp of saline 0.9%

             2. Group 2 (Active Drug):

                30 patients who will receive intradermal injections in the scalp with minoxidil
                0.5%/2ml

                Eight weeks after the last session patients will be recruited for repeat the exams
                and perform a self-assessment of both the effect on hair growth and the effect on
                hair loss.

    <description>Six weeks after the last session of mesotherapy patients will be subjected to control examinations to evaluation of results. Scalp biopsy to determine the terminal-vellus ratio, trichogram to assess the percentage of anagen hair, telogen and dystrophic and Trichoscan will be performed to see if there was improvement in hair density</description>

    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>In each session of mesotherapy, blood pressure and cardiac frequency at baseline and 10 min after application of the drug will be measured to assess the safety profile of the solution of minoxidil to 0.5% when injected intradermally.
Any adverse effect reported will be recorded on specific clinical form</description>
