  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial in which the combination of 4 different CAM
      modalities (Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine) will be applied during the postoperative
      period to patients undergoing open heart- or lung surgery and expected to be hospitalized for
      more than 5 days.

      Elective and Urgent surgical patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment - and to a
      control group. The treatment group will be treated with a combination of 4 different CAM
      modalities (Homeopathy, Osteopathy, and Acupuncture &amp; Reflexology) . The control group will
      be treated with Homeopathic placebo medication.

      The main Outcome measurement in the study will be the Quality of recovery 40 questionnaire
      (QoR- 40) that will be filled out on postoperative days: 3, 5, and 7 respectively. Secondary
      outcome measurements will be Blood &amp;Saliva Cortisol levels, DHES levels in the blood as
      surrogates of stress, IL-2 levels as measures of the immune system. Further parameters to be
      measured include: LOS (length of stay), Level of Pain, mobility, level of satisfaction, GI
      symptoms (nausea, first bowel movement), post-operative complications&amp; side effects.

      All patients participating in the trial will sign an informed consent form . The trial is
      expected to be conducted over a period of 12 months. Prior to the trial a pilot study will be
      conducted on a group of 30 patients in order to determine the needed sample size for the
      trial.
