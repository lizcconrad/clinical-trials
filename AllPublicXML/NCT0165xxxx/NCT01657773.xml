    <textblock>
      The aim of this sudy is to investigate the prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients
      with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and evaluate whether NAFLD is a risk factor for
      CRC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As one of the most common cancer worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of
      cancer death in Asian countries. And during the past three decades, the incidence of CRC has
      been increasing rapidly in china. Many studies supported that cigarette smoking, obesity and
      insulin resistance were associated with CRC. In recent years, metabolic syndrome (MetS) -
      Including glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension and chronic inﬂammation -
      and its individual components have been proven to be the risk for colorectal neoplasm.
      Colonoscopy is the most accurate technique for diagnosis, surveillance and exclusion of
      colorectal neoplasm for high-risk CRC groups. Therefore, improved risk stratiﬁcation
      knowledge of the target population is necessary to improve CRC patients' prognosis.

      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease
      worldwide and cause a wide spectrum of liver damage, such as steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, even
      end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD has been found to be associated
      with obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidemia, and is considered as a liver
      manifestation of MetS. Although it has been also well established that MetS and its
      individual components are risk factors for colorectal neoplasm, as above, there is paucity of
      research looking at the relation between NAFLD and CRC. Therefore, the investigators aimed to
      investigate the prevalence of CRC in patients with NAFLD and evaluate whether NAFLD is an
      independent risk factor for CRC.

    <description>Hepatic ultrasonography scanning was performed on all patients by experienced radiologists who were blinded to the aims of the study and clinical details of the patients. NAFLD was diagnosed by the following criterion: hepatomegaly, the echogenicity of liver parenchyma increased diffusely, and vascular blurring.</description>

The colonoscopic features include the types, location, size, number of lesions and differentiation of neoplasm.</description>

    <description>Patients' baseline characteristics were collected before colonoscopy examination.

    <time_frame>Up to 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete blood count, liver function, blood glucose , blood lipids, Cancer Embryo Antigen (CEA) and other related test were performed when underwent colonoscopy examination. The liver function test included alanine aminotranferase, aspartate aminotranferase, albumin, serum sodium, serum chloride, serum chloride and creatinine. Complete blood count was made up of platelet and hemoglobin (Hb). Blood lipids test contains, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Additionally, CEA was detected by conventional serological assays.</description>

        The study population consisted entirely of outpatients. Patients were offered to perform
        colonoscopy for CRC screening according to the American College of Gastroenterology
        recommendations. Based on blood tests and abdomen B ultrasonography, patients without NAFLD
        were regarded as healthy controls and those with NAFLD constituted the community NAFLD
        cohort. Patients were included only if they had colonoscopy and conventional inspections
        (blood routine, liver function test and abdomen B ultrasonography). Among them who with
        history of colorectal cancers or polyps, other extraintestinal malignancies and
        contraindications to colonoscopy were excluded. Besides, we excluded patients who had viral
        hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer or other liver disease.Patients who drank more than 20g
        alcohol per day were also excluded.
