      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of administering a probiotic in
      adult human subjects suffering from allergic rhinitis during seasonal grass pollen exposure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult subjects with documented seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to grass pollen will be
      assigned to placebo or probiotic groups and take either placebo or probiotic dietary
      intervention for 8 weeks during the grass pollen allergy season. Total nasal symptom score
      (TNSS) will be compared over 8 weeks between the two treatment groups.
