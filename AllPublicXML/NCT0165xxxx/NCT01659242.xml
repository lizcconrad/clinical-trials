  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In rheumatoid arthritis patients with active disease despite optimal treatment with
      methotrexate, the main objective of this pilot study is to use advance imaging tools such as
      magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound to evaluate which treatment option is more
      efficacious: initiating methotrexate/sulfasalazine combination therapy, or switching to
      leflunomide monotherapy
