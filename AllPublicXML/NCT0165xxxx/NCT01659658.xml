  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dexamethasone plus IXAZOMIB improves
      hematologic response, 2-year vital organ (that is, heart or kidney) deterioration and
      mortality rate versus a physician's choice of a chemotherapy regimen in participants
      diagnosed with relapsed or refractory systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called IXAZOMIB. IXAZOMIB was being tested to treat
      people who have relapsed or Refractory Systemic Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis.

      The study will enroll approximately 248 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  IXAZOMIB 4 mg plus Dexamethasone 20 mg

        -  Physician's choice: Participants will receive one of the following treatment options as
           selected by the physician:

             1. Dexamethasone 20 mg

             2. Dexamethasone 20 mg + Melphalan 0.22 mg/kg

             3. Dexamethasone 20 mg + Cyclophosphamide 500 mg

             4. Dexamethasone 20 mg + Thalidomide 200 mg

             5. Dexamethasone 20 mg + Lenalidomide 15 mg

             6. All participants will be asked to take oral formulation of the drugs. In both
                treatment arms, each participant will continue to receive sequential cycles of
                therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the study is
                terminated, whichever occurs first. Participants in Arm B receiving melphalan and
                dexamethasone will be treated to best response plus 2 additional cycles.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 112 months (9.3 years), including 84 months of enrollment and 28 months of follow-up
      after the last participant is enrolled.

                  red staining with exhibition of an apple-green birefringence

               2. If clinical and laboratory parameters insufficient to establish AL amyloidosis or
                  in cases of doubt, amyloid typing may be necessary.

          3. Measurable disease as defined by serum differential free light chain concentration
             (dFLC, difference between amyloid forming [involved] and nonamyloid forming
             [uninvolved] free light chain [FLC]) ≥ 50 mg/L.

          4. Objective, measurable major (cardiac or renal) organ amyloid involvement as defined as
             follows (amyloid involvement of at least 1 required):

                  thickness on echocardiogram greater than 12 mm in the absence of other potential
                  causes of left ventricular hypertrophy (controlled hypertension is allowed) with
                  a noncardiac biopsy showing amyloid, or a positive cardiac biopsy in the presence
                  of clinical or laboratory evidence of involvement. If there is isolated cardiac
                  involvement, then typing of amyloid deposits is recommended.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Amyloidosis due to mutations of the transthyretin gene or presence of other non-AL
             amyloidosis.

          2. Female participants who are lactating, breast feeding, or pregnant.

          3. Medically documented cardiac syncope, uncompensated New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous 6
             months, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant repetitive ventricular
             arrhythmias despite antiarrhythmic treatment, or severe orthostatic hypotension or
             clinically important autonomic disease.

          4. Clinically overt multiple myeloma, according to the International Myeloma Working
             Group (IMWG) criteria with at least 1 of the following:

               1. Bone lesions

               2. Hypercalcemia, defined as a calcium of &gt; 11 mg/dL

          5. Inability to swallow oral medication, inability or unwillingness to comply with the
             drug administration requirements, or gastrointestinal (GI) procedure that could
             interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of treatment.

          6. Requirement for other concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any
             ancillary therapy considered to be investigational or which would be considered as a
             treatment of AL amyloidosis. However, participants may be on chronic steroids (maximum
             dose 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) if they are being given for disorders other
             than amyloidosis (eg, adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.).

          7. Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this
             study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of
             the prescribed regimens.

          8. Ongoing or active infection, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, active
             hepatitis B or C infection.

             excipients.

         11. Systemic treatment with strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort
             within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment.

         12. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years (5 years for sites in
             France) before study enrollment or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and
             have any evidence of residual disease. Participants with nonmelanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete
             resection.
