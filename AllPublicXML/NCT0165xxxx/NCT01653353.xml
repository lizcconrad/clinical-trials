    <textblock>
      Residents of nursing homes are endangered by malnutrition and vitamin D deficiency. Our study
      checks compliance with Swiss federal recommendations on vitamin D and calcium supplementation
      among residents of a Swiss nursing home. A peer physician-applied recommendation on
      compliance with the federal recommendations with individual evaluation of the residents will
      be sent to the physicians in care. After one year, data will be collected again.

      The investigators plan to get a complete sample of all inhabitants, so the only inclusion
      criterion is to get an informed consent either from the residents or from their relatives.
      The following data will be recorded: Year of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure
      and heart rate, daily calcium intake from diet, nursing home scales on pain, depression,
      dementia and activities of daily life, date of entry to the home, diagnosis and medication
      lists. From a venous blood sample the investigators get: calcium, phosphate, albumin,
      creatinin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathormone (intact).

      Primary endpoint: Proportion of medication lists of residents complying with federal
      recommendation on vitamin D and calcium supplementation.

      Secondary endpoints: 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, effect of an intervention with a nursing
      home-applied recommendation to the physicians.
