      Objective: To assess the impact of a nutritional intervention aimed at reducing childhood
      overweight in German preschoolers.

      Design: Using a cluster-randomized study design with waiting-list controls, we test a
      six-month intervention administered once weekly by a nutritional expert consisting of joint
      meal preparation and activities for children and parents like tasting and preparing
      nutritious, fresh foods. At baseline, six and twelve months, a parent-completed questionnaire
      assesses fruit and vegetable intake (primary outcomes) and water and sugared drink
      consumption (other outcomes). Direct measurement assessed BMI, percentage body fat (skin fold
      thicknesses) and waist-to-height-ratio. An intention-to-treat analysis used random effects
      panel regression models to assess the intervention effect, adjusted for each child's age,
      gender, immigrant background and maternal education.

      Setting: 18 Preschools from three south German regions. Subjects: Healthy children from three
      to seven years of age.
