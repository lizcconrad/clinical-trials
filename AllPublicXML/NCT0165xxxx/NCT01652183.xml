  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The insertion of an urinary catheter in a patient undergoing a surgical procedure, especially
      in urinary interventions, may lead to catheter-related bladder discomfort with varying
      degrees of severity during the postoperative period. Catheter-related bladder discomfort
      (CRBD) symptoms associated with indwelling urinary catheter are similar to overactive bladder
      symptoms such as discomfort in the suprapubic region, urinary urgency, frequency, burning
      sensation with or without urge incontinence. Paracetamol is a drug with proven efficiency for
      the management of mild and moderate postoperative pain. In this study, the investigators
      hypothesized to address the effect of single-dose intravenous paracetamol on postoperative
      CRBD following percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery (PNL).

    <description>The patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group P (Paracetamol group, n=32) received intravenous 15mg/kg paracetamol during the surgery and Group C (Control Group, n=32) received intravenous 1.5 ml/kg 0.9% NaCl solution 30 minutes before the of surgery.At the end of the surgery, all patients had an nephrostomy catheter and the insertion site was infiltrated with 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine infiltration for postoperative analgesia. Each patient received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia by meperidine (10 mg bolus, 20-minute lock-out, no infusion dose and 4 hour limit) for postoperative analgesia. All patients were planned to receive tenoxicam 20 mg intravenously as a rescue analgesic when visual analogue scale (VAS) was &gt;3.</description>
