      The purpose of this study is to assese esophageal motor function by simplified transnasal
      endoscopy compared with esophageal manometry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal manometry is a gold standard for diagnosis of esophageal motility disorder.
      However, esophageal manometry can not detect non-occulsive contraction. Endoscopic evaulation
      of esophageal motility is difficult becausea swallowing is nearly impossible during
      endoscopy. Simplified trans nasal endoscopy (E.G. ScanTM, IntroMedic Co.,Ltd.)composed with
      dysplay system,controller,and disposable probe with compact size.

      The esophageal motor function will be assessed with both esophageal manometry and simplifed
      trnasnasal endoscopy in patients with esophageal motility disorder (such as achalasia) and
      healthy volunteer. The results of simplifed trnasnasal endoscopy is compared with the results
      of esophageal manometry.
