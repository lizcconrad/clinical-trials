      Phase IIa, single-centre, open-label, single-arm study, to evaluate the inspiration profile
      through the NEXThaler® device in adult asthmatic patients with varying degrees of disease
      control.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the inspiratory flow profile through the
      NEXThaler® device in adult asthmatics with varying degrees of disease control.

      The study plan foresees one visit at clinic. At Visit 1, after the signature of the informed
      consent form, the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be checked and the lung function
      parameters will be evaluated. If the subjects meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, they
      will be instructed to use the NEXThaler®. The patients will subsequently inhale through the
      device and the inspiration profile will be measured.

      A total of 40 asthmatic adults (≥18 years), 20 with controlled stable disease and 20 with
      partly controlled or uncontrolled disease according to GINA guidelines (2011), will be
      enrolled.

    <time_frame>One visit per patient (visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The study duration per patient is only one visit. At visit 1 the patient after having signed off the ICF and after having assessed the Eligibility Criteria should perform two evaluable inhalatory manoeuvres. Each manoeuvre lasts few seconds. After having completed the manoeuvres and have the same assessed as good by the Investigator, the study is completed. All the procedures are expected to be performed within a couple of hours for each patient.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of controlled, partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma according
             to GINA guidelines (2011)

          -  A cooperative attitude and ability to use DPIs and to be trained in the proper use of
             the NEXThaler® as confirmed by the activation of the training device BAM

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant seasonal variation in asthma or asthma occurring only during episodic
             exposure to an allergen or a chemical sensitizer

          -  History of near fatal asthma (e.g. brittle asthma, hospitalisation for asthma
             exacerbation in Intensive Care Unit)

          -  Diagnosis of restrictive lung disease

          -  Significant unstable medical history of and/or treatments for cardiac, renal,
             neurological, hepatic, endocrine diseases, or any laboratory abnormality indicative of
             a significant underlying condition, that may interfere with patient's safety,
             compliance, or study evaluations, according to the investigator's opinion.
