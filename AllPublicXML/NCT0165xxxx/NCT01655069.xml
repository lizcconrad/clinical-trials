  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 40-week study to investigate how safe and effective solifenacin solution was in
      treating children or adolescents with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), who completed
      study 905-CL-076 (NCT01565707).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There was a titration period of up to 12 weeks during which the participants would be up or
      down-titrated based on a combination of efficacy and safety parameters followed by a fixed
      dose period during which no dose adjustments were allowed. Participants completed a 7-day
      patient diary prior to every visit (start of 905-CL-076 to end of 905-CL-077, 14 visits). The
      first visit of this study (905-CL-077) was combined with the last visit of the 4-month study
      905-CL-076. At each visit, the participant was required to undertake a number of assessments
      or examinations to determine whether it is safe for him/her to take part or to continue to
      take part in the study.

    <measure>Number of Participants With and Severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of solifenacin (in Study 905-CL-076 or in current study) up to 7 days after last dose of open-label solifenacin (41 weeks for participants who received placebo in 076 and 53 weeks for those who received solifenacin in 076).</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assessed the severity of AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, as follows:
Mild: No disruption of normal daily activities; Moderate: Affect normal daily activities; Severe: Inability to perform daily activities. In participants treated with placebo in Study 905-CL-076, a TEAE was defined as an AE that started/worsened after the first dose of open-label solifenacin in Study 905-CL-077 up to 7 days after the last dose of solifenacin. In participants treated with solifenacin in Study 905-CL-076, a TEAE was defined as an AE that started/worsened after the first dose of double-blind solifenacin in Study 905-CL-076 up to 7 days after last dose of open-label solifenacin in Study 905-CL-077.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (of 905-CL-076 study) and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 40, and 52 weeks of solifenacin treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of incontinence episodes was based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from the start of 905-CL-076 to the end of 905-CL-077. An Incontinence episode is defined as an episode with any involuntary loss of urine. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Dry (Incontinence-Free) Days Per 7 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (of 905-CL-076 study) and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 40, and 52 weeks of solifenacin treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of dry (incontinence-free) days was based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from start of 905-C L-076 to end of 905-C L-077. An incontinence-free day is a day without any incontinence episodes. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (of 905-CL-076 study) and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 40, and 52 weeks of solifenacin treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of micturitions (urinations) was based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from start of 905-CL-076 to end of 905-CL-077. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Grade 3 or 4 Urgency Episodes Per 24 Hours in Adolescents</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (of 905-CL-076 study) and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 40, and 52 weeks of solifenacin treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent participants were also asked to record urgencies for at least 2 of the 7 diary days using the Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS): (0 - no urgency, 1 - mild urgency, 2 - moderate urgency, 3 - severe urgency, 4 - urge incontinence). This data is based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from the start of 905-CL-076 to the end of 905-CL-077. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in Postvoid Residual (PVR) Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (of 905-CL-076 study) to final Visit (the most recent value after first dose of solifenacin up to 40 weeks for participants who received placebo in 076 and 52 weeks for those who received solifenacin in 076.)</time_frame>
    <description>PVR volume was assessed by ultrasonography or bladder scan during 905-CL-076 and 905-CL-077. The value reported is the last PVR volume value after first dose of solifenacin up to 52 weeks.</description>

        <description>The investigator assessed the severity of AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, as follows:
Mild: No disruption of normal daily activities; Moderate: Affect normal daily activities; Severe: Inability to perform daily activities. In participants treated with placebo in Study 905-CL-076, a TEAE was defined as an AE that started/worsened after the first dose of open-label solifenacin in Study 905-CL-077 up to 7 days after the last dose of solifenacin. In participants treated with solifenacin in Study 905-CL-076, a TEAE was defined as an AE that started/worsened after the first dose of double-blind solifenacin in Study 905-CL-076 up to 7 days after last dose of open-label solifenacin in Study 905-CL-077.</description>
        <time_frame>From first dose of solifenacin (in Study 905-CL-076 or in current study) up to 7 days after last dose of open-label solifenacin (41 weeks for participants who received placebo in 076 and 53 weeks for those who received solifenacin in 076).</time_frame>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>The mean number of incontinence episodes was based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from the start of 905-CL-076 to the end of 905-CL-077. An Incontinence episode is defined as an episode with any involuntary loss of urine. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Dry (Incontinence-Free) Days Per 7 Days</title>
        <description>The number of dry (incontinence-free) days was based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from start of 905-C L-076 to end of 905-C L-077. An incontinence-free day is a day without any incontinence episodes. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>The mean number of micturitions (urinations) was based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from start of 905-CL-076 to end of 905-CL-077. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (of 905-CL-076 study) and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 40, and 52 weeks of solifenacin treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of participants received at least one dose of open-label solifenacin and at least one of the efficacy variables with a valid baseline value and valid post-baseline data from diary completed after first dose of open-label solifencacin. Participants with available data at each time point are included in the analysis.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours</title>
          <description>The mean number of micturitions (urinations) was based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from start of 905-CL-076 to end of 905-CL-077. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of participants received at least one dose of open-label solifenacin and at least one of the efficacy variables with a valid baseline value and valid post-baseline data from diary completed after first dose of open-label solifencacin. Participants with available data at each time point are included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>Adolescent participants were also asked to record urgencies for at least 2 of the 7 diary days using the Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS): (0 - no urgency, 1 - mild urgency, 2 - moderate urgency, 3 - severe urgency, 4 - urge incontinence). This data is based on 7-day diary data completed by participants prior to each visit from the start of 905-CL-076 to the end of 905-CL-077. Data are reported by duration of solifenacin treatment based on the number of days from the date of first dose of solifenacin in either study 905-CL-076 or 905-CL-077 up to and including the study visit. Using equivalent treatment duration periods, data were combined for participants who received placebo and solifenacin in study 905-CL-076 within each age group.</description>

At the start of the 12-week titration period, the dose was adjusted according to the weight of the participant in order to deliver a plasma drug exposure equivalent to the 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg and 10 mg once daily oral tablet dose of solifenacin in adults.</description>
