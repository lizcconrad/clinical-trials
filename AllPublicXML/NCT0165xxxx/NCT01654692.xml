      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination of ipilimumab and
      fotemustine in Patients with Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Malignant Melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy, chemotherapy and chemotherapy combinations are currently the most effective
      accepted systemic treatments for metastatic melanoma. However, significant and prolonged
      responses are rare.

      The trial will determine the additional benefit achieved from adding fotemustine to the
      anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody,ipilimumab .

      It is assumed that the mechanism by which ipilimumab augments the effects of chemotherapy in
      animal models relies on the ability of the cytotoxic agent to induce apoptosis of tumor
      cells. These apoptotic cells then can function as potent inducers of an immune response
      against any non-tolerized antigen that they contain. Thus, the chemotherapy may be creating
      an in vivo autologous tumor vaccine. Ipilimumab prevents the down regulation of this immune
      response, allowing for tumor rejection. Animal models evaluating the combination of
      anti-CTLA4 antibody and chemotherapy have given only a brief acute treatment with
      chemotherapy - presumably adequate to induce some tumor apoptosis, but inadequate to induce
      significant prolonged tumor rejection.

      Since patients with metastatic melanoma generally require therapy within a relatively short
      period of time, this protocol will allow for the use of fotemustine. Standard dosing of
      fotemustine will be used to optimize the chance for tumor control.

OS will be further described using the survival rate at one year, defined as the probability that a subject is alive at 1 and 2 years following first dose of study therapy and estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
