      This is an exploratory study to evaluate changes in glycosphingolipid levels and other
      (exploratory) Fabry disease parameters in male Fabry disease participants who were previously
      treated with agalsidase alfa (Replagal®) 0.2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) every two weeks
      (q2w) and who are being switched to agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme®) 1.0 mg/kg q2w.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Plasma Deacylated Globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-GL-3) at Month 2, 4 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, 4, 6</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline = ([post-baseline value minus baseline value] divided by [baseline value]) multiplied by 100. For levels reported as below quantitative limit (BQL), the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) value was divided by 2 and used in the calculation to estimate values in samples that were BQL. The LLOQ for plasma lyso-GL-3 was 5.0 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL). This study is exploratory because little is known about the dose-response of these biomarkers to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or about the clinical significance of the biomarkers.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Plasma Globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) at Month 2, 4 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, 4, 6</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline = ([post-baseline value minus baseline value] divided by [baseline value]) multiplied by 100. For levels reported as BQL, the LLOQ value was divided by 2 and used in the calculation to estimate values in samples that were BQL. The LLOQ for plasma GL-3 was 2.0 microgram per milliliter (mcg/mL). This study is exploratory because little is known about the dose-response of these biomarkers to ERT or about the clinical significance of the biomarkers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Urine GL-3 at Month 2, 4, and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, 4, 6</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline = ([post-baseline value minus baseline value] divided by [baseline value]) multiplied by 100. For levels reported as BQL, the LLOQ value was divided by 2 and used in the calculation to estimate values in samples that were BQL. The LLOQ for urine GL-3 was 0.2 mcg/mL. The absolute values were calculated in microgram per millimole (mcg/mmol) of creatinine by dividing GL-3 (mcg/mL) by creatinine (mg/mL) and multiplying by 113.13 (mg/mmol), the molecular weight of creatinine. For levels reported BQL, the absolute values were calculated in microgram per millimole (mcg/mmol) of creatinine by dividing 0.1 (mcg/mL) by creatinine (mg/mL) and multiplying by 133.13 (mg/mmol). This study is exploratory because little is known about the dose-response of these biomarkers to ERT or about the clinical significance of the biomarkers.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms (Abdominal Pain, Abdominal Distention, and Bowel Irregularities) at Month 2, 4, and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, 4, 6</time_frame>
    <description>Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and irregular bowel movements) were to be assessed by a modified version of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Severity Scoring System. The modified IBS Severity Scoring System is a 7-item questionnaire. The severity score calculated by summing the scores of 5 of the 7 questions. Each of the 5 questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 100, leading to a total possible score range of 0 to 500, where higher scores indicate more severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The data for this outcome measure was exploratory and to be collected in individual participant listing only.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Plasma Deacylated Globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-GL-3) at Month 2, 4 and 6</title>
        <description>Percent change from baseline = ([post-baseline value minus baseline value] divided by [baseline value]) multiplied by 100. For levels reported as below quantitative limit (BQL), the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) value was divided by 2 and used in the calculation to estimate values in samples that were BQL. The LLOQ for plasma lyso-GL-3 was 5.0 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL). This study is exploratory because little is known about the dose-response of these biomarkers to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or about the clinical significance of the biomarkers.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms (Abdominal Pain, Abdominal Distention, and Bowel Irregularities) at Month 2, 4, and 6</title>
        <description>Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and irregular bowel movements) were to be assessed by a modified version of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Severity Scoring System. The modified IBS Severity Scoring System is a 7-item questionnaire. The severity score calculated by summing the scores of 5 of the 7 questions. Each of the 5 questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 100, leading to a total possible score range of 0 to 500, where higher scores indicate more severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The data for this outcome measure was exploratory and to be collected in individual participant listing only.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, 4, 6</time_frame>
        <population>The data for this outcome measure was exploratory and to be collected in individual participant listing only. Analysis of this data was planned only if baseline data was collected on a large number of enrolled participants. This was not the case and therefore interpretation of these results were not possible.</population>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms (Abdominal Pain, Abdominal Distention, and Bowel Irregularities) at Month 2, 4, and 6</title>
          <description>Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and irregular bowel movements) were to be assessed by a modified version of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Severity Scoring System. The modified IBS Severity Scoring System is a 7-item questionnaire. The severity score calculated by summing the scores of 5 of the 7 questions. Each of the 5 questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 100, leading to a total possible score range of 0 to 500, where higher scores indicate more severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The data for this outcome measure was exploratory and to be collected in individual participant listing only.</description>
          <population>The data for this outcome measure was exploratory and to be collected in individual participant listing only. Analysis of this data was planned only if baseline data was collected on a large number of enrolled participants. This was not the case and therefore interpretation of these results were not possible.</population>
