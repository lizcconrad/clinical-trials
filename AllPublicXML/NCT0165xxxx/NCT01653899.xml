    <textblock>
      This is an Investigator Initiated, Phase I/II study, where Type 1 diabetic participants will
      receive a 14 day oral treatment of the investigational caspase inhibitor drug IDN-6556
      following their first islet transplant. Two pilot studies are proposed to establish the
      optimal safety and efficacy dose of IDN-6556 (25 mg twice daily (Pilot 1) or a loading dose
      of 100 mg two hours prior to transplantation, then two 50 mg doses following transplant (Day
      0) (Pilot 2). This will be followed by 50 mg three times daily). Participants of both pilot
      studies will receive islet cell transplants under the University of Alberta's
      standard-of-care therapy.

      Secondary objectives include:

        1. To determine the proportion of subjects treated with IDN-6556 who achieve and maintain
           insulin independence after the first or subsequent islet transplant.

        2. To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of IDN-6556 to maintain adequate
           immunological protection against both allo- and autoimmunity of islet transplant
           recipients.

    <description>The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of the IDN-6556 caspase inhibitor in adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet transplant. A tracking log will document adverse events and unexpected complications associated with IDN-6556 using a grading classification as per protocol.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible the participant must have had T1DM for more than 5 years, complicated by at
        least 1 of the following situations that persist despite intensive insulin management
        efforts:

          -  Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic
             symptoms at plasma glucose levels &lt; 3.0 mmol/L, indicated by, 1 or more episodes of
             severe hypoglycemia requiring third party assistance within 12 months, a Clarke score
             ≥ 4, HYPO score ≥ 1,000, lability index (LI) ≥ 400 or combined Hypo/LI &gt; 400/300

          -  Metabolic instability, characterized by erratic blood glucose levels that interfere
             with daily activities and or 1 or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis over
             the last 12 months.

        Participants must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and must
        sign a statement of informed consent.

          1. Severe co-existing cardiac disease, characterized by any one of these conditions: (a)
             recent myocardial infarction (within past 6 months); (b) left ventricular ejection
