             laboratory assessment before entering into the study.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccines
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccines, or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine/product not foreseen by the study
             protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first vaccine dose and ending 30
             days after the last dose of vaccines.

          -  Previous vaccination with a vaccine containing NTHi antigens.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the first vaccine dose, or equivalent. Topical steroids are
             allowed.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the first dose of study vaccines or planned administration during the study
             period.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Laboratory evidence of clinically significant haematological (complete blood cell
             count [Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood Cells (WBC)], WBC differential count,
             platelets count and haemoglobin level) and biochemical (Alanine Aminotransferase
             [ALT], Aspartate Aminotransferase [AST], creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH])
             abnormalities as per the opinion of the investigator based on the local laboratory
             normative data.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening
             tests.

          -  History of or current condition preventing intramuscular injection as bleeding or
             coagulation disorder.

          -  Malignancies within previous 5 years (excluding non-melanic skin cancer) and

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
