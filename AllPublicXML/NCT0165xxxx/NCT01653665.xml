  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the introduction of multiple preventative measures rates of hospital acquired
      infection in the intensive care unit remain high. New approaches to tackling this problem are
      required. The neutrophil (a type of white blood cell) is the key cell fighting bacterial and
      fungal infection in the body. This research group has already shown that the majority of
      patients on intensive care have neutrophils which don't ingest germs effectively and are
      therefore less able to fight infection. These patients, whose white blood cells don't work
      properly, are much more likely to develop a second infection whilst in hospital (hospital
      acquired infection).

      Previous work done by this group has shown that by adding a drug called granulocyte
      macrophagecolony stimulating

      factor (GM-CSF) to a sample of blood from these patients in the lab, it is possible to
      restore the ability of the white blood cells to ingest bacteria and fight infection.

      This study will test whether it is possible to restore the capacity of patients' white blood
      cells to eat germs by giving them GM-CSF as an injection while they are on intensive care.

      The study will involve identifying adult patients on intensive care whose white blood cells
      don't work properly in this way. Patients taking part in the study will receive an injection,
      under the skin, of either the drug, GM-CSF, or a solution which will have no effect
      (placebo). The investigators will compare whether those patients who have received the GM-CSF
      injection have an improvement in the function of the white blood cells compared to those who
      don't.

      As well as looking at the function of the white blood cells the investigators will also study
      whether there is a difference in the rates of infection picked up in hospital between the two
      groups.

      This study is funded by the Medical Research Council.
