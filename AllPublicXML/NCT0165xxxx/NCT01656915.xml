  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ex vivo LPS stimulation of whole blood will be a good alternative challenge to induce an
      inflammatory response and examine differences in the inflammatory response between healthy
      and compromised subjects.

      The purpose of the current study is to examine the inflammatory response in a younger
      population (35-45 yrs old) to see whether in this population also differences in the ex vivo
      LPS induced cytokine response exists between healthy and compromised subjects, as is seen in
      elderly subjects. Overweight subjects showing a state of disturbed blood glucose control will
      be included as subjects with compromised health and compared to healthy lean subjects with
      the same age (shifting from healthy towards unhealthy, not diseased).

      Hypothesis Ex vivo LPS stimulation of whole blood will induce a measurable inflammatory
      cytokine response in a healthy population that is different from a response of the
      compromised population. The investigators will include subjects aged 35-45 years that differ
      in health characteristics, especially blood HbA1c, fat% and waist circumference.

        In total, 36 male subjects will participate in the study. The study will be conducted in
        two different subject groups (one healthy and one compromised group), each consisting of 18
        subjects.

         10. Not willing to accept information transfer which concerns participation in the study,
             or information regarding health, like laboratory results, findings at anamnesis or
             physical examination and eventual adverse events to and from his general practitioner;

         11. Not willing to give permission to have the general practitioner to be notified upon
             participation in this study.
