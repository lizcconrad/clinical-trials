      Primary Objective:

      To assess the efficacy of SAR339658

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the safety of SAR339658
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study period per patient will include up to 4 weeks screening, 8 weeks treatment, 6 weeks
      post treatment safety follow-up, followed by a long term safety follow-up performed in the
      form of a phone interview at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months from the last administration of the
      study medication.

      After completion of the 8-week treatment phase, patients may be eligible to enter a long term
      safety study (LTS12593) for active treatment with SAR339658.
