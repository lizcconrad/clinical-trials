  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease of the liver caused by an alteration of the immune
      response that attacks the body's own hepatocytes, progressively, leading to cirrhosis and
      liver failure.

      There are few studies on dietary management in hepatitis and most of theme have focused on
      micronutrients specifically vitamin D to prevent osteoporosis, and decreased symptoms of
      other diseases associated, but few recommendations have been made regarding a complete
      dietary approach. Fiber has been proven to increase the excretion of nitrogen products and
      consequently reduce its blood levels and an adequate protein intake (1.2g/kg) has shown to
      decrease endogenous catabolism in cirrhotics patients.

      The implementation of a high protein high fiber nutrition plan and improves nutritional
      status of patients with autoimmune cirrhosis.

    <textblock>
      Each participant will receive a high protein (1.2g/kg/day) and high fiber (30g/day) dietary
      plan. The monitoring of adherence to the diet will be once a month for the duration of the
      study period.

      There will be an nutritional assessment by anthropometric techniques: arm circumference,
      triceps skinfold, weight, height and body mass index as parameters of malnutrition by taking
      the standard for cirrhotic patients. Body composition was measured by bioelectric impedance
      to obtain fat mass, lean and total fluid content.

      The presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy will be assessed by PHES and CFF and applied
      three times during the study and the quality of life questionnaire SF-36 CLDQ and will be
      held in direct interview at the first visit and at study end.

      Were also measured serum concentrations of ammonium, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, renin,
      angiotensin and aldosterone.
