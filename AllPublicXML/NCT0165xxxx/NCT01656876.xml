  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment efficacy of mirror therapy (MT), mirror
      therapy combining mesh glove (MG+MT) stimulation, and controlled treatment (CT) in people
      with stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      55% to 75% of people after stroke have a paretic arm that causes motor impairment. Among
      novel rehabilitation interventions, MT was found to be beneficial and comparatively low-cost.
      MT reduced motor impairment possibly in part of recruiting the premotor cortex or balancing
      the neural activation within the primary motor cortex toward the affected hemisphere.
      However, the benefits in certain aspects of outcomes are under debate. Another treatment, MG,
      can be used to normalize muscle tone, suppress muscle spasticity, enhance residual volitional
      activity of hand and arm, or even increasing walking speed. In addition, providing MG
      stimulation might result in plastic changes in the primary motor cortex, and induced a
      long-lasting modulated effect on motor cortical excitability. The possible mechanism of brain
      plasticity underlying MG is collective with the mechanism behind the MT. Adding MG to MT
      might augment the cortical reorganization. In sum, combining MT with MG may supplement the
      disadvantage or uncertain effects of MT and broaden the benefited outcomes.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in FMA at 4 weeks, change from baseline in FMA at 16 weeks, change from baseline in FMA at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The upper-extremity subscale of the FMA contains 33 items to assess motor impairment. Each item is scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0-cannot perform, 1-performs partially, 2-performs fully and correctly). The sub-score of a proximal shoulder/elbow (0-42) and a distal hand/wrist (0-24) will be also calculated to investigate the treatment effects on separate upper extremity elements.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in WMFT at 4 weeks, change from baseline in WMFT at 16 weeks, change from baseline in WMFT at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT composed of 3 parts: Time, Functional ability, and Strength
Includes 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength based tasks
Performance time is referred to as WMFT-TIME
Functional ability is referred to as WMFT-FAS
Items 1-6 involve timed functional tasks, items 7-14 are measures of strength, and the remaining 9 items consist of analyzing movement quality when completing various tasks.
Examiner should test the less affected upper extremity followed by the most affected side.
Uses a 6-point ordinal scale
&quot;0&quot; = &quot;does not attempt with the involved arm&quot; to
&quot;5&quot; = &quot;arm does participate; movement appears to be normal.&quot;
Maximum score is 75
Lower scores are indicative of lower functioning levels
WMFT-TIME allows 120 seconds per task</description>

    <measure>Accelerometers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in accelerometers at 4 weeks, change from baseline in accelerometers at 16 weeks, change from baseline in accelerometers at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The accelerometers are used to provide a direct and objective measure of the amount of the impaired arm movement outside the laboratory. Acceleration is sampled at 10 Hz and summed over a user- specified epoch. The recording epoch in this study is 2 seconds; recording capacity is approximately 72 hours. A &quot;threshold-filter&quot; will be applied to the raw recordings to obtain an accurate measure of the duration of arm movement.</description>

    <measure>revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (rNSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in rNSA at 4 weeks, change from baseline in rNSA at 16 weeks, change from baseline in rNSA at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The rNSA examines the sensory function of the affected arm and includes tactile sensation (0=Absent, 1=Impaired, 2=Normal), proprioception (0=Absent, 1=Appreciation of movement sense, 2=Direction of movement sense, 3=Joint position sense), and stereognosis (0=Absent, 1=Impaired, 2=Normal) subtests.</description>

    <measure>Kinematic analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in kinematic parameters at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-camera motion-analysis system (VICON MX, Oxford Metrics Inc., Oxford, UK) was used. The variables of reaction time (second), movement time (second), total displacement (mm), peak velocity (mm/second), percentage of peak velocity, joint recruitments (degree), and maximum shoulder and elbow cross-correlation were collected.</description>

    <measure>Motor Activity Log (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in MAL at 4 weeks, change from baseline in MAL at 16 weeks, change from baseline in MAL at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL is a semi-structured interview of patients to assess the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) of the affected upper extremity in 30 important daily activities using a 6-point ordinal scale. Higher scores indicate superior amount and quality of use in affected upper extremity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in Semmes-Weistein monofilaments at 4 weeks, change from baseline in Semmes-Weistein monofilaments at 16 weeks, change from baseline in Semmes-Weistein monofilaments at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments is used for measuring diminishing and returning cutaneous sensation.A nylon 'string' is specifically calibrated in stiffness to represent a baseline level of sensation that can be considered 'the line' between having neuropathy and having normal sensation.</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in FIM at 4 weeks, change from baseline in FIM at 16 weeks, change from baseline in FIM at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM consists of 18 items grouped into 6 subscales. Each item is rated from 1 to 7 (max. score 126) based on the required level of assistance to perform the tasks.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale version 3.0 (SIS 3.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in SIS at 4 weeks, change from baseline in SIS at 16 weeks, change from baseline in SIS at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS is a stroke-specific instrument of health related quality of life and contains 59 items measuring 8 domains. Items are rated on a 5- point Likert scale with lower scores indicate greater difficulty in task completion during the past week. Aggregate scores, ranges from 0 to 100, are generated for each domain.</description>

    <measure>8-OHdG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in 8-OHDG at 4 weeks, change from baseline in 8-OHDG at 16 weeks, change from baseline in 8-OHDG at 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary 8-OHdG is a stable and integral biomarker of oxidative DNA damage.About 10 mL to 15 mL urine samples of the patients will be collected in the centrifugal tubes before and after rehabilitation interventions. The samples will be transported with dry ice under 4°C and preserved in a -80°C refrigerator before analysis. A highly sensitive and selective method, using isotope- dilution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), will be used to determine the urinary 8-OHdG levels.</description>
