    <textblock>
      Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common recurrent oral disorder with no curative
      treatment available to date. The challenge remains in patients that do develop drug
      resistance and/or secondary infection, although topical corticosteroids and antimicrobials
      are the first therapeutic choice. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of an herbal extract of Yunnan Baiyao formulated in toothpaste as an alternative
      therapy for minor RAS.

      Yunnan Baiyao is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, formulated in a powder or capsule
      form. It was initially and widely used in wounds for its anti-hemorrhagic hemostatic
      function, and further in gastrointestinal bleeding. Yunnan Baiyao powder has been generally
      applied on RAS among Chinese population.

      In this study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (from March 2010
      to March 2011) was conducted on a cohort of 227 minor RAS patients. The toothpaste containing
      Yunnan Baiyao was used twice daily as part of the patient's routine oral hygiene for 5 days.
      An assessment of ulcerative size and pain was recorded on Day 0 (baseline), Day 3 and Day 5.
      Any noted adverse reactions were recorded.

    <description>Pain intensity was measured using a VAS, where the amount of pain recorded ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain). Pain was assessed by irritating the ulcer with the periodontal probe. The values were collected by the assigned investigators.</description>
