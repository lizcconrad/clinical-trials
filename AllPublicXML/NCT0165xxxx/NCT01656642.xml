  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion study of
      atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) in combination with
      vemurafenib or vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in participants with BRAFV600-mutation positive
      metastatic melanoma. Enrolled participants may continue treatment until they are no longer
      experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator and in alignment with the
      protocol.
