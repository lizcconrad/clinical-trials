  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an independent sub-study of the protocol titled PKU-016: A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized study to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effects of
      sapropterin dihydrochloride on neuro-psychiatric symptoms in subjects with phenylketonuria
      (PKU ASCEND).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine oxidative stress in patients with
      classical phenylketonuria (PKU) enrolled in PKU-016, using a brain scan (called an HMPAO
      SPECT) at baseline and 26 weeks, and blood redox biomarkers.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine in vivo redox status in patients with classical phenylketonuria enrolled in PKU-016, compared to historical normal controls, using:
Serial Tc99m-HMPAO SPECT brain imaging (baseline and 26 weeks); and
Blood redox biomarkers, including oxidized and reduced glutathione, tetrahydrobiopterin, ascorbate, alpha-tocotrienol, selenium, etc.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:Sub-study Inclusion criteria same as main study:

          -  ≥ 8 years of age

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of PKU

          -  Willing to continue current diet (typical diet for the 3 months prior to study
             entry)unchanged while participating in the study

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent or in the case of
             subjects under the age of 18, provide written assent (if required) and written
             informed consent by a legally authorized representative after the nature of the study
             has been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures

          -  Sexually active subjects must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception
             while participating in the study and for at least 30 days following the last dose of
             sapropterin dihydrochloride

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not
             of childbearing potential include those who have been in menopause at least 2 years,
             or had tubal ligation at least 1 year prior to screening, or have had total
             hysterectomy

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:All other sub-study Exclusion criteria same as main study:

          -  Has known hypersensitivity to sapropterin dihydrochloride or its excipients

          -  Subject breastfeeding at screening or planning to become pregnant (subject or partner)
             at any time during the study

          -  Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 30 days
             prior to screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to the
             completion of all scheduled study assessments

          -  Received sapropterin dihydrochloride within 16 weeks of randomization • Have initiated
             or adjusted medication for treatment of ADHD, depression, or anxiety ≤ 8 weeks prior
             to randomization

          -  Taking medication known to inhibit folate synthesis (eg, methotrexate)

          -  Any condition requiring treatment with levodopa or any PDE-5 inhibitor

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study participation,
             compliance or safety as determined by the Investigator

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at high risk
             of poor treatment compliance or not completing the study
