    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adults with autism spectrum disorder and with
      normal intelligence improve from 36 sessions (1 calendar year) of group treatment with
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or recreational activity in groups with 6-8 participants.

      The purpose of this study was to compare two group interventions for psychiatric patients
      with Autism spectrum disorder and normal intelligence: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
      developed to suit adults with Autism spectrum disorder, and recreational activity, enabling
      social interaction. The recreational activity intervention served as a low-impact option,
      easily organised within the community. It is not a placebo; rather it controls for the
      positive effects that come out of a structured social environment and group setting. The
      investigators hypothesized that both interventions would lead to improvement in quality of
      life, well-being and relief in psychiatric symptoms, with a greater effect in the Cognitive
      Behavioural Therapy intervention compared to recreational activity. A cumulative follow-up
      was made, within 5 1/2 years after the start of the treatments. Additional questions adapted
      to the patient group were added at this 5 1/2 year time point.

    <description>The CBT intervention consisted of five elements: (a) structure, (b) group setting, (c) psycho-education, (d) social training and (e) CBT.
The participants were presented with the session plan for the whole year and given a binder in which they kept all materials. In addition, each session followed a strict agenda: (1) introduction and presentation of the agenda of the day, (2) resume of homework assignments from the previous session, (3) psycho-educative lecture and discussions on the session topic, (4) coffee break with buns or sandwiches, and social interaction, (5) relaxation or mindfulness exercise, (6) discussions and exercises on the session topic, (7) distribution of homework and (8) evaluation and end of session.</description>

    <description>The therapists did not provide any deliberate interventions, such as psychoeducation, social training or CBT. Instead, the intervention relied on structure and group setting only. During the first session the participants were asked to write down group activities they would like to engage in. The therapists created a list of the suggested activities, such as visiting museums, board game playing, cooking, restaurant visits, boating, cinema and taking walks. The participants voted for the activity of the next session.</description>
