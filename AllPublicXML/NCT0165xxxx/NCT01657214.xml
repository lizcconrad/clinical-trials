      Primary Objective:

      In the dose escalation: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR125844.

      In the expansion cohort: to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumoral effect of SAR125844 in
      patients with measurable and MET gene amplification (including gastric cancer patients).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To characterize and confirm the global safety profile of SAR125844 including cumulative
      toxicities.

      To assess preliminary antitumor activity of SAR125844. To explore the pharmacodynamic effects
      (PDy) of SAR125844. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR125844. To explore the
      relationship of MET gene amplification status with antitumor effects.

      To evaluate other pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      For both cohorts, escalation and expansion, the duration of the study for one patient will
      include a period for inclusion of up to 3 weeks and a 4-week treatment cycle(s).The patient
      may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or willingness to
      stop, followed by a minimum of 30-days follow-up.

      If a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohort, continues to benefit
      from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study
      treatment for a maximum of 1 year and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the
      study flowchart. Such patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP
      administration.

    <description>SAR125844 will be administered as weekly IV infusion. Four weekly administrations are considered as 1 cycle. The starting dose will be either 1 dose level (DL) below the highest cleared dose level in a European TED11449 ongoing study or DL4 (260 mg/m^2), if the highest cleared dose in TED11449 is &gt;340 mg/m^2.</description>
