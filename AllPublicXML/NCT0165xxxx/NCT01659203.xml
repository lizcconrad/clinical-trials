  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of
      an investigational intervention. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of
      the investigational therapy to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the
      intervention is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more
      about it.

      Retroperitoneal sarcomas are soft tissue tumors located at the far back of the abdomen.
      Typically, patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas either have surgery for the removal of
      their tumors alone, or have their tumors removed, followed by standard radiation therapy, or
      have pre-operative radiation followed by surgery. When conventional radiation therapy is
      delivered after surgery, it can damage normal tissue. In this study, you will undergo proton
      beam radiation therapy or IMRT before undergoing surgery for the removal of your tumor.

      Proton radiation and IMRT are FDA approved radiation delivery systems. Protons are tiny
      particles with positive charge that can be controlled to travel a certain distance and stop
      inside the body. In theory, this allows better control of where the radiation dose is
      delivered as compared to photons. Since proton radiation is more targeted, it may help to
      reduce unwanted side effects from radiation.

      In this study, a standard dose of radiation will be given to the majority of the tumor, while
      a simultaneously integrated boost of additional radiation will be given to certain areas of
      the tumor identified as higher risk. This means that a higher radiation dose will be given to
      the higher risk areas of the tumor.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of radiation therapy with protons
      or IMRT that can be delivered safely in patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas and the
      effectiveness of proton beam radiation therapy as an intervention for patients with
      retroperitoneal sarcomas.

      While being screened to determine eligibility for this study you may choose to participate in
      an additional blood sample for circulating DNA and a genomic DNA sample.

      Since we are looking for the highest dose of Radiation Therapy that can be administered
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have retroperitoneal
      sarcomas, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of
      study therapy. The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been
      enrolled in the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses. Your study
      doctor will tell you which dose you will get.

      Radiation planning is standard of care for all patients undergoing radiation therapy. Before
      you begin radiation therapy you will have a radiation planning CT scan of the tumor site.
      This scan will be in addition to the scans done in order to confirm your eligibility for this
      study. Doctors will use teh images from this scan to plan your radiation treatment.

      You will receive radiation therapy every day Monday through Friday for about six weeks. You
      will receive study therapy as an outpatient. During radiation therapy, you will be seen by
      the study doctor once a week. Each visit will take about 15 minutes, and the following
      assessments will be completed: medical history, vital signs, body weight and assessments for
      any side effects you may be experiencing.

      After the final dose of radiation therapy you will be assessed for side effects of radiation
      following your last dose and before surgery. The following assessments will be completed
      before your surgery at this visit: Chest CT, CT/MRI of the abdomen/pelvis and routine blood
      tests to check for overall health.

      You will be seen for a follow-up visit within one month of discharge following surgery and
      again four months after the surgery. At the first follow-up visit, the following assessment
      will be completed: medical history, vital signs and body weight, questions about side effects
      and routine blood tests to check for overall health. At the four month follow up visit the
      following assessment will be completed: medical history, vital signs and body weight, chest
      CT and abdominal/pelvic CT.

      After your four month follow-up visit, you will be seen twice yearly following radiation for
      the first five years and then once a year for the rest of your life.
