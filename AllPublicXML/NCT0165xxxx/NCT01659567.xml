  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will investigate predictive values of virological
      response in pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys)/ribavirin (Copegus) treatment-naive
      participants with chronic hepatitis C. Participants will be treated with pegylated interferon
      alfa-2a and ribavirin as prescribed by the physician. Data will be collected for a maximum of
      96 weeks.
