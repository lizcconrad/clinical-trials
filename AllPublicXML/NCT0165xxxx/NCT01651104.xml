      To evaluate the safety of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of trivalent adjuvanted
      influenza study vaccine, formulation 2012/2013, in elderly subjects and the antibody response
      to each influenza vaccine antigen, as measured by single radial hemolysis (SRH) and
      hemagglutination inhibition (HI) at approximately 21 days postimmunization in elderly
      subjects in compliance with the requirements of the current EU recommendations for clinical
      trials related to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines.

    <measure>Percentages of Subjects Who Achieved Seroconversion or Significant Increase in SRH Area Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of aTIV</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in single radial hemolysis (SRH) area, against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using SRH assay.
Seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area was defined as the percentage of subjects with a negative prevaccination serum (SRH area ≤4 mm2) to a postvaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2; or a significant increase in antibody titer from a non-negative prevaccination serum, i.e., at least a 50% increase in area.
The European (CHMP) criterion is met if percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area is 30% (≥65 years).</description>

        <description>Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of subjects was calculated as the ratio of postvaccination to prevaccination SRH geometric mean areas (GMAs), directed against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22).
The CHMP criterion was met if the geometric mean increase (GMR, day 22/day 1) in SRH antibody area is &gt;2.0 (≥65 years).</description>
