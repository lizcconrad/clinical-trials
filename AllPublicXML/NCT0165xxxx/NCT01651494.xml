    <textblock>
      This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of a single dose
      (20mg) of Influenza Antiviral DAS181-F04 for 3 days. The group of nine subjects will be
      randomly assigned to DAS181 or placebo at 2:1 ratios. Subjects will be admitted to the
      inpatient clinic at a minimum of the night prior to first dose. The subjects will stay in the
      inpatient clinic for the duration of dosing and one day after dosing, they will be required
      to come back for follow-up visits on study days 4, 6, 9, 16 (+/-1 day), 32 (+/-3 days), and
      90 (+/-10 days). The safety parameters will include abnormal laboratory values, adverse
      events and clinical observations.

      This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The subjects will
      receive a single-dose treatment of DAS181-F04 or placebo at a targeted delivered dose of 20mg
      each day for three days. The subjects will be evaluated on the day before the initial dose
      (Day -1) and randomly assigned to DAS181-F04 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Subjects will be
      evaluated prior to dosing on Days 0, 1 and 2. Additional follow-up evaluations will occur one
      day after completion of dosing (Day 3) and on Days 4, 6, 9, 16 (+/-1 day), 32 (+/-3 days) and
      90 (+/-10 days). The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      DAS181-F04 encapsulated dry powder compared to placebo when administered by oral inhalation
      using a dry powder inhaler (DPI) in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to investigate
      the pharmacokinetic and immunologic profile of DAS181 encapsulated dry powder dose to dose
      and compared to placebo when administered by oral inhalation using a DPI in healthy adults. A
      total of 9 subjects, healthy male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45 years will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be randomized 2:1 ratio, wherein 6 subjects will receive the active drug and 3
      subjects will receive placebo. Subjects may be replaced if a subject withdraws within 7 days
      (Day 9) after receipt of the final study drug dose.
