    <textblock>
      This is an observational study designed to determine whether veterans with PTSD have a higher
      risk of heart disease than those without PTSD. Cardiovascular risk will be assessed by
      interview and review of medical records, carotid artery ultrasound, and blood tests measuring
      markers of inflammation. Study participation is approximately 6 months. The eligible study
      population is veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),
      age 28 through 38 years.

      For the assessment of CVD risk, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurements will be used.
      Standard assays detect 1,000 fold increases in CRP in response to infection or inflammation;
      these high levels cannot be used to stratify with respect to CVD risk. Hs-CRP, however,
      measurement can detect CRP levels as low as 0.5 mg/L. Though mainly used for research
      purposes, high-sensitivity IL-6 assays are also able to discriminate IL-6 levels within the
      normal range for CVD risk stratification. Both CRP and IL-6 levels will be analyzed as
      continuous quantitative traits.

      Though no DNA analysis is planned for this study, subjects are asked if they are willing to
      have their samples banked for future research.
