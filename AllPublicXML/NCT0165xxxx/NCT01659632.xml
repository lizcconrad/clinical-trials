    <textblock>
      Most of the early gastric cancer are asymptomatic. Symptoms of advanced gastric cancer are
      weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia dysphagia, gastrointestinal bleeding.
      Gastric cancer found according to warning symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding, weight
      loss usually can not be cured. Therefore, early gastric cancer can not be detected and
      impossible to treatment if endoscopy is performed according to the warning signs. National
      gastric cancer screening is conducted in men and women of more than 40 years old. The purpose
      of screening for gastric cancer is discovering a case of possible cure, so increasing the
      survival rate. The purpose of this study is review of the feasibility of screening for
      gastric cancer.
