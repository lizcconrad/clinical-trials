    <measure>Number of Participants With a Positive Response on The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>53 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidality was assessed by using the C-SSRS, a semi-structured interview designed to capture the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview and rating for the C-SSRS was completed by a clinician who had been successfully trained by the sponsor or designee. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answers to the first 2 ideation questions were &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;no,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Improved Response on The Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 4, 24, and 52, and end of treatment (either Visit 16 [Week 52] or Early Termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI rating scales permitted the global evaluation of a participant's condition severity and improvement over time. The CGI-I was performed to rate the improvement of a participant's condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) and included a 'not assessed' option. The responses were dichotomized into 2 categories (improved or not improved). Improved included very much improved and much improved; not improved included minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse. Not assessed and missing values were excluded from the percentage calculation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in The Global Score for The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 24, and 52, and end of treatment (either Visit 16 [Week 52] or Early Termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE-Q is a 28-item questionnaire measuring eating pathology and is derived directly from the Eating Disorder Examination Interview. The EDE-Q focuses on the past 28 days to assess the main behavioral (eating and purging) and attitudinal features of eating disorders. The 28 items are rated by the participant on a 7-point scale (ranging from 0 to 6), with higher scores indicating increased pathology. The EDE-Q includes 4 subscales: Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern, and Shape Concern. The global score is the average of all 28 items, with a range of 0 to 6. A negative value indicates a favorable result. The values presented are the mean change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Response to The EuroQoL Group 5 Dimension 5-Level Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) For Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (ET; either Visit 16 [Week 52] or Early Termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is one of the most widely used generic index measures of health-related quality of life. It consists of a 5-item descriptive system that measures 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is represented by a single item with 5 levels of responses, from poor health to good health. The percentages of participants with various responses to the mobility questionnaire are reported. Percentages are based on all participants in the Full Analysis Set with a valid result at the given visit.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was an open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety of SPD489 in adults aged 18-55 years with binge eating disorder (BED) who completed 1 of 3 antecedent studies, all of which tested SPD489 for BED (SPD489-208, SPD489-343, or SPD489-344).</recruitment_details>

          <description>Participants initially received lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 30 mg administered orally, once daily during the dose optimization phase, regardless of their treatment assignment in the antecedent study. The dose was increased to an optimal dose of either 50 or 70 mg administered orally, once daily. Participants received treatment for a total of 52 weeks, then were followed for 1 week.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Positive Response on The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>Suicidality was assessed by using the C-SSRS, a semi-structured interview designed to capture the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview and rating for the C-SSRS was completed by a clinician who had been successfully trained by the sponsor or designee. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answers to the first 2 ideation questions were “yes,” the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were “no,” then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

        <description>The CGI rating scales permitted the global evaluation of a participant’s condition severity and improvement over time. The CGI-I was performed to rate the improvement of a participant’s condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) and included a ‘not assessed’ option. The responses were dichotomized into 2 categories (improved or not improved). Improved included very much improved and much improved; not improved included minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse. Not assessed and missing values were excluded from the percentage calculation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Global Score for The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)</title>
        <description>The EDE-Q is a 28-item questionnaire measuring eating pathology and is derived directly from the Eating Disorder Examination Interview. The EDE-Q focuses on the past 28 days to assess the main behavioral (eating and purging) and attitudinal features of eating disorders. The 28 items are rated by the participant on a 7-point scale (ranging from 0 to 6), with higher scores indicating increased pathology. The EDE-Q includes 4 subscales: Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern, and Shape Concern. The global score is the average of all 28 items, with a range of 0 to 6. A negative value indicates a favorable result. The values presented are the mean change from baseline.</description>

It consists of a 5-item descriptive system that measures 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is represented by a single item with 5 levels of responses, from poor health to good health. The percentages of participants with various responses to the mobility questionnaire are reported. Percentages are based on all participants in the Full Analysis Set with a valid result at the given visit.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is one of the most widely used generic index measures of health-related quality of life. It consists of a 5-item descriptive system that measures 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is represented by a single item with 5 levels of responses, from poor health to good health. The percentages of participants with various responses to the pain/discomfort questionnaire are reported. Percentages are based on all participants in the Full Analysis Set with a valid result at the given visit.</description>
