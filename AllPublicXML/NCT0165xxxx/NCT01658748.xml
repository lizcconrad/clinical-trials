  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether deep brain stimulation of the basolateral
      nucleus (BLn) of the amygdala, on both sides of the brain, can safely reduce symptoms of
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans whose condition has not improved
      despite extensive treatment with currently available medication and psychotherapy
      interventions.

    <textblock>
      For this pilot feasibility study, combat veterans whose PTSD has been associated with severe
      symptomatic suffering and functional impairment, despite treatment with all currently
      available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, will be recruited from clinics at
      a large, academically affiliated VA facility. An extensive screening over an extended
      baseline by the study psychiatrist and neurosurgeon will be conducted using standard
      interviews and clinical rating scales. Eligible subjects are required to have a cohabiting
      significant other willing to participate in safety and function monitoring throughout the
      study.

      After successful completion of baseline eligibility requirements, comprehensive
      neuropsychological testing will be performed, as will structural MRI and FDG PET/CT of the
      amygdala, insula and medial Prefrontal cortex. PET/CT will be performed and analyzed by a
      nuclear medicine specialist collaborator familiar with this type of imaging research. Six
      consenting subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will then receive bilateral basolateral
      nucleus of the amygdala (BlnA) implantation of Medtronic Activa Primary Cell (PC) implantable
      deep brain stimulator systems (purchased through the VA Merit Review Grant) by functional
      neurosurgeons specialized in the procedure. This will be done during a 3-4 day inpatient stay
      on the VA Greater Los Angeles Neurosurgical Service. After a month of weekly safety
      monitoring with stimulators off, subjects will be will be hospitalized for 1 day on the
      Neurology Service's electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry unit, under the care and
      supervision of an epilepsy specialist neurologist who is a co-investigator in the study, for
      stimulator initiation. Stimulator settings will be adjusted by the study clinical
      neurophysiologist while patients are monitored by the study neurologist and psychiatrist.
      Only stimulator settings that do not cause epileptiform discharges, or potentially
      significant adverse psychiatric or medical (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate) changes will be
      used over the subsequent long-term follow-up.

      After the EEG telemetry safety check, subjects will be randomized (3/3) to either have their
      stimulators turned on then (Week 0), or 3 months later (week 12). This staggered onset
      double-blind design has been used in other DBS trials in psychiatry. After week 0, for the
      next 2 years, subjects will be followed at regular intervals (weekly for 5 months, then
      monthly for 7 months, then quarterly for 12 months) by a psychiatrist, neurosurgeon,
      neurologist and neurophysiologist who will conduct an extensive battery of psychiatric and
      neurological testing (including periodic EEG recordings), as well as significant other
      interviews, while stimulator settings are adjusted based on standardized rating scale
      outcomes and adverse effects so as to optimize treatment outcome. The principal study
      hypothesis is that the symptomatic and functional benefits of chronic stimulation will
      outweigh the risks and adverse-effects, and that symptomatic improvement will be greater,
      without unacceptable adverse effects, in subjects with week 0, compared to week 12 stimulator
      initiation. Neuropsychological testing will be repeated after 6 months of stimulation to
      assess changes in cognitive function. Functional neuroimaging with PET/CT will be repeated
      after a year of stimulation to assess changes in the activity of brain regions known to
      function abnormally in PTSD.

    <description>This test is a measure of reaction time, selective attention, cognitive flexibility in terms of shifting perception to changing demands, and the ability to suppress a habitual response in favor of an unusual one. It is based upon the fact that we can read words faster than we can name colors. There are 3 parts to the test. In Part 1 (Color Reading), the subject has to read the word of the colors, (red, green, blue) which are printed either in black ink or in the color that corresponds to the printed word. In the Part 2 (Color Naming), the print color of the words does not correspond to the color name and the subject must name the printed word. In Part 3, the subject must name the color in which the color names are printed and disregard reading the word. An increased interference effect can occur in a variety of disorders which include mental disease. The entire test can be completed in about 5 minutes.

    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-operatively, patients will undergo a provocative PET CT scan using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) assessing activity of the amygdalae, insulae and medial PFC regions. The provocation will consist of re-exposure of the patient to the initial trauma that caused PTSD using script-driven imagery as in prolonged exposure therapy. Baseline and 15 month scans will be compared both for resting and post-provocation metabolism. The hypothesis is that DBS reduces amygdala hyperactivity in PTSD patients. The PET CT scan data will be processed with a statistical parametric mapping method using SPM99 (Wellcome Department of Neurology, London, England). PET data in each voxel will be normalized and fitted in a linear statistical model. Hypotheses will be evaluated as contrasts where the linear compounds of the model parameters will be evaluated with t-tests transformed into a z-score. We will consider z&gt;3.09 (P&lt;0.001 one tail, uncorrected) as statistically significant.</description>

    <description>Before initiation of experimental stimulation, subjects will be admitted to the Neurology EEG Telemetry Unit to test stimulus parameters for 1) after-discharges placing patients at high risk of seizures; 2) changes in vital signs posing risk of adverse health outcomes; 3) Changes in cardiac rhythm on electrocardiogram (ECG); and 4) changes in behavior portending significant safety risk if they were to occur at home in an unsupervised setting. Initial stimulation will be at 2.5 V, 120 μs pulse width and 160 Hz frequency. Amplitude will then be increased progressively to a maximum of 7 V. Pulse width will then be increased to a maximum of 210 μs pulse width. Finally, frequency will then be increased to a maximum of 200 Hz. Side effects will be specifically noted throughout. If a serious side effect occurs, the last parameter changed will be kept at a maximum of 60 % of the threshold value during subsequent experimental stimulation, and other parameters will not be increased.</description>

    <description>Subjects undergo the placement of a Leksell (Elekta, Atlanta, GE) stereotactic frame. Electrode trajectory planned using stereotactic software (BrainLab, Germany). Traditional trans-frontal trajectory used to implant Medtronic #3387 DBS electrodes bilaterally in the BLn. A curvilinear incision will be made 3 cm lateral to midline and 1 cm in front of the coronal suture. A burr hole will be placed with a high-speed drill for placement of a Stimloc device to hold the electrode in place. The dura will be opened, coagulated back and the cortex exposed, coagulated, and pierced. The electrode will be introduced using a cannula. Each electrode contact will be stimulated up to 7 V to confirm the absence of immediate side effects; first left, then right. Electrode wires will be tunneled under skin to upper chest and connected to Medtronic Activa PC dual channel pulse generator. Both groups keep stimulators off until week 0, then this group has stimulators turned on.</description>
