      Investigators presumed that low energy density (LED) diet consumers will have lower risk of
      cardiovascular disease and are able to maintain their weight longer .

    <textblock>
      Previous studies introduced different dietary interventions for weight loss maintenance.
      Besides the debate on low fat or low carbohydrate diets, focusing on some food groups
      including fruits, vegetables and low fat dairies in the diet may be helpful for weight
      maintenance. However, energy intake is the key factor of weight maintenance. Energy intake
      will decrease by reducing energy density (ED) of a diet without producing short-term calorie
      restriction or feeling hunger. There are several studies which showed the beneficial effects
      of low energy density diets on weight reduction. However, few studies discuses regarding the
      effects of such diets on weight maintenance.

    <description>Diet of the LED group contained 30%fat, 15% protein and 55% carbohydrate. Most of the consumed carbohydrates in the LED diet group were fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In addition, this group received more servings of vegetables groups daily in the form of liquid diets or some menus contain more vegetables</description>
