  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major dose-limiting side effect of
      many chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, oxaliplatin,
      bortezomib and ixabepilone. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy commonly occurs in
      greater than 40% of patients. To improve the peripheral neuropathy, the chemotherapy dosing
      is often either decreased or discontinued potentially affecting tumor responsiveness,
      prognosis, and survival.

      There is an unmet medical need for treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy induced
      neuropathic pain (CINP) and the proposed study will investigate the efficacy and safety of
      multiple dose levels of tetrodotoxin (TTX) versus placebo in moderate to severe neuropathic
      pain caused by chemotherapy.
