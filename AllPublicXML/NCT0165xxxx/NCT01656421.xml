  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease,osteoporosis, muscle wasting and diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular
      disease is a major cause of death in such patients and it may be related to excess stiffening
      of the walls of major arteries, such as the aorta, and it has been suggested to represent
      premature aging. However, there is little known of the development of these problems, which
      were previously considered to be due to smoking and which is now known not to be the only
      factor. The investigators will study a large group of patients with mild to very severe
      airflow obstruction based on the NICE 2010 classification of severity and a matched
      comparator group free of COPD. This study involves three assessments of the development of
      the complications of COPD over a five year period. The key measure will be the rate of change
      in the aortic wall stiffness, an accepted indicator of the risk of heart disease. Changes in
      wall stiffness will be related to the severity of lung disease; other known cardiovascular
      risk factors, such as high blood pressure, increased blood cholesterol and to cardiovascular
      events including heart attacks and death; and to the presence of other complications, such as
      osteoporosis, muscle wasting and diabetes mellitus. These measures will be analysed in the
      context of changes in bodywide inflammation and metabolic function and the changes in the
      rate of ageing. This increased knowledge of interacting factors in the complications of COPD
      is likely to lead to studies of treatments to avoid their development.
