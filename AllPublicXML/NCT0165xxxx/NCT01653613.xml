      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking into genes in samples from younger patients with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify somatically acquired genetic copy number and sequence alterations at the
           time of diagnosis in adolescent and young adults (AYA) acute lymphoblastic leukemia
           (ALL) samples and to correlate them with clinical and laboratory characteristics and
           outcome.

        -  To identify specific microarray multi-gene and multi-exon expression signatures at the
           time of diagnosis and to correlate them with clinical and laboratory characteristics and
           outcome.

        -  To gain insights into the genetic events that contribute to the formation, development
           and relapse of AYA ALL by integrating the copy number and sequence alterations with the
           multi-gene signatures and by comparing these with data already generated in pediatric
           ALL.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved samples are analyzed for DNA copy number alterations and
      loss-of-heterozygosity, gene expression profiling, and mutation analysis by single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, Affymetrix Exon arrays, and whole genome amplification (WGA,
      Repli-G Qiagen). Confirmation studies are then done by fluorescence in situ hybridization
      (FISH), reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and rapid amplification
      of cDNA ends (RACE).
