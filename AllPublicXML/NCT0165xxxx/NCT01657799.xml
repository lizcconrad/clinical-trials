  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of veliparib and
      whole brain radiation therapy in adults with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of death. All events of death were included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the participant was still taking study treatment or after treatment was discontinued. If a participant had not died, the data were censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Tumor Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Best tumor response rate was calculated as the percentage of participants with a complete response or partial response, as determined by brain scan imaging (magnetic resonance image or computed tomography) by a central imaging vendor. Response was assessed according to the modified bidimensional criteria:
Complete response required all of the following: complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions, including no new leptomeningeal disease; no systemic corticosteroid dose.
Partial response required all of the following: ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the size of all target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions, including no new leptomeningeal disease and no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, which, even in presence of stable disease or progressive disease in target lesions, was significant enough to qualify as progression; stable or reduced daily total systemic corticosteroid dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Intracranial Progression (Radiographic)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to intracranial progression (radiographic) was defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of the first intracranial progression, as determined by brain scan imaging (magnetic resonance image [MRI]/ computed tomography [CT] scan) by a central imaging vendor. All confirmed events of intracranial progression were included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the participant was still taking study treatment or had previously discontinued study treatment. If the participant did not have a confirmed event of intracranial progression, their data were censored at the date of the last available intracranial progression assessment. Time to intracranial progression (radiographic) was estimated for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Clinical Brain Metastasis Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to clinical brain metastases progression was defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of the first experience of clinical brain metastases progression, as assessed by a team of neuro-oncology experts (Event Review Board). All events of clinical brain metastasis progression were included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the participant was still receiving study treatment or had previously discontinued study treatment. If a participant did not have an event of clinical brain metastases progression, their data were censored at the date of the last available clinical disease progression assessment. Time to clinical brain metastasis progression was estimated for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</description>

          <description>A participant's GPA score was the sum total of each of the following prognostic factors, scored as 0, 0.5, or 1:
Age, years &gt; 60 years, 50 - 59 years, or &lt; 50 years)
Karnofsky Performance Status (&lt; 70, 70 - 80, or 90 - 100)
No. of brain metastases (&gt; 3, 2 - 3, or 1)
Extracranial metastases (present or absent) The total GPA score could range from 0 to 4 where lower scores indicate a worse prognosis.</description>

        <title>Best Tumor Response Rate</title>
        <description>Best tumor response rate was calculated as the percentage of participants with a complete response or partial response, as determined by brain scan imaging (magnetic resonance image or computed tomography) by a central imaging vendor. Response was assessed according to the modified bidimensional criteria:
Complete response required all of the following: complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions, including no new leptomeningeal disease; no systemic corticosteroid dose.
Partial response required all of the following: ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the size of all target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions, including no new leptomeningeal disease and no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, which, even in presence of stable disease or progressive disease in target lesions, was significant enough to qualify as progression; stable or reduced daily total systemic corticosteroid dose.</description>

All confirmed events of intracranial progression were included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the participant was still taking study treatment or had previously discontinued study treatment. If the participant did not have a confirmed event of intracranial progression, their data were censored at the date of the last available intracranial progression assessment.
