      Randomized clinical trial of two preoperative diets before bariatric surgery (gastric
      bypass)comparing standard diet and Prodimed (VLCD) in 100 morbidly obese patients selected
      for a gastric bypass procedure

      Morbid obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of &gt; 40 kg/m² or &gt; 35 kg/m² with
      obesity-related comorbidities, is a rapidly growing problem in the western society. In the
      United States, about 6 million people currently have a BMI of &gt; 40 kg/m² and another 10
      million people have a BMI of &gt; 35 kg/m² with comorbidities. Worldwide, the incidence of
      morbid obesity has doubled and about 300 million people are now obese. In the Netherlands the
      prevalence is less disturbing but the incidence of morbid obesity is rising progressively to
      1.5% of the total population. At this moment surgical therapy is the only treatment option
      for these patients that results in sufficient long-term weight loss. Non-surgical approaches,
      like low energy diets and behavior modification, are not successful in the long-term with
      respect to maintaining weight loss and decreasing obesity-related comorbidities.

      In order to increase weight loss and minimize complications a preoperative diet before
      bariatric has been advocated. However, the usual VLCD's are poorly tolerated by patients. In
      this study we aim to compare two preoperative diets in order to find the most suitable for
      this patient population.
