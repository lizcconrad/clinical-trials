  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For HIV-infected patients who have access to treatment, liver diseases are a major cause of
      morbidity and mortality. Hepatitis C is the most frequently encountered liver condition in
      this population. Both diseases allow a higher level of poisonous substances (toxins) normally
      produced by the bacteria present in the gut to enter the bloodstream. This leads to a chronic
      inflammatory state, which results in faster development of liver scars (fibrosis) and
      ultimately, end stage disease (cirrhosis). To prevent this from happening, the use of
      antibiotics has been attempted to reduce the quantity of gut flora in the hopes of lowering
      the amount of toxins produced. These trials have shown promising results, but the antibiotics
      studied had major side effects and were not designed for continuous use. Rifaximin is a non
      absorbable antibiotic with very few side effects. It is already used for long periods of time
      in cirrhotic patients to treat the effects of cirrhosis on the brain (encephalopathy). This
      project will try to determine if rifaximin, by reducing the level of toxins produced by the
      bacteria in the gut, can improve the evolution of liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients
      with hepatitis C. In this pilot study, ten patients with HIV and HCV infection will be
      followed for one year. In addition, 10 patients with HCV mono infection will also be
      followed. Both populations will be included if they are starting on rifaximin, for its
      currently approved FDA indication (hepatic encephalopathy).

      Many studies have already proved the deleterious effects of LPS on HIV and hepatic diseases
      evolution. There has never been a concerted effort to prevent the progression of liver
      disease in these patients. To date, the only treatment is initiation of antiretroviral
      therapy. Rifaximin could be an easy and well tolerated way to improve the outcome of liver
      disease in HIV-infected patients. We hypothesize that it could help to slow down the
      progression of liver disease at any stage in these patients. This is a pilot study. A total
      of twenty patients placed on rifaximin by their physician for a mild hepatic encephalopathy
      will be monitored over a period of one year. The evaluation of the fibrosis will be done
      through transient elastography every 3 months. Bacterial translocation will be evaluated
      through the dosing of soluble CD14. The safety of the prolonged use of rifaximin in patients
      will also be assessed.
