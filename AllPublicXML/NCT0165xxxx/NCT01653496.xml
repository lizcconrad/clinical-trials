      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the overall compliance to the enhanced
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) program in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery.

      The feasibility and effectiveness of ERAS program for various major surgical procedures have
      been well studies in the literature. However, ERAS program has not been widely accepted for
      patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery because of the paucity of evidence about its
      feasibility and efficacy. In this study, we developed ERAS program for gastric cancer
      surgery, based on the systemic review about perioperative cares. The main elements of ERAS
      program includes: 1preoperative patient education, 2)no preoperative bowel preparation, 3)
      provision of normal diet until the night before surgery, 4)carbohydrate rich drink 2 hrs
      before surgery, 5)epidural anesthesia for pain control, 6) local wound anesthetic
      infiltration for pain control, 7)no routine abdominal drain, 8)no naso-gastric tube
      insertion, 9)intraoperative antibiotics, 10)thromboprophylaxis using intermittent pneumatic
      compression device, 11)intraoperative normothermia using warm air blanket, 12)low oxygen
      supply during immediate postoperative period, 13)restrictive postoperative fluid
      administration, 14)early postoperative oral diet, 15)early active ambulation, 16)early
      removal of the urinary catheter, 17)patient education before discharge, and 18)hospital
      discharge based on discharge criteria.

      The aim of study is to evaluate the compliance to these main elements of ERAS program in
      patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery.

      Previously reported data about ERAS program for colon surgery reported overall compliance as
      about 65%. Considering that this is a single center study, we expected overall compliance
      rate of 70%. Therefore, the sample size of 173 patients was calculated based on this expected
      compliance rate, with permitted error of 95% confidence interval of 14%.
