      This study will determine the safety and applicability of experimental forms of umbilical
      cord blood (UCB) transplantation for patients with high risk hematologic malignancies who
      might benefit from a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) but who do not have a standard
      donor option (no available HLA-matched related donor (MRD), HLA-matched unrelated donor
      (MUD)), or single UCB unit with adequate cell number and HLA-match).

             generally not considered candidates for experimental unrelated allogeneic HSCT, as
             utilized in this study by virtue of the anticipated delayed immune reconstitution,
