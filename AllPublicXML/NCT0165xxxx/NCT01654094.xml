      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the P6 Low Adherent Study Dressing relative to the
      Standard of Care (SOC, Mafenide Acetate 5% Solution) for the management of skin grafts in
      burn wounds resulting from thermal burn injuries.

             (PBD) 14.

          -  Patients' study burn sites will be treated with skin grafts with a mesh ratio up to
             3:1, at the surgeon's discretion.

          -  Patients expected to be available for assessment of study burn sites at least until
             POD 6 Â±1 day.

          -  Males or females at least 18 years of age but no older than 65 years of age at the
             time of informed consent.

             the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with electrical or chemical burns.

          -  Patients with a study burn site excised and &quot;grafted&quot; with Integra.

          -  Patients taking vasopressors or inotropes.

          -  Patients using systemic immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids and anti-neoplastic
             agents, etc.).

             or AKIN score greater than or equal to 2 or estimated GFR &lt; 30, if the assessment is
             conducted as part of the patient's routine clinical care.

          -  Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), if the assessment is

          -  Patients with any concurrent medical condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, may compromise their safety or the objectives of the study.

          -  Patients who are breastfeeding, pregnant or expecting to become pregnant during the
