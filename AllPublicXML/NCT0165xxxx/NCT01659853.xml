      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and assess the safety of CD07805/47 gel
      0.5% applied topically once daily versus azelaic acid gel 15% applied topically twice daily
      in subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized at Baseline/Visit 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either CD07805/47 gel 0.5% once daily or azelaic acid gel 15% twice daily for 15 days.
      Following an appropriate washout period, subjects will then switch treatments and use the
      second investigational product as instructed for 15 days (according to the subject's
      randomization scheme). Subjects will re-qualify based upon inclusion/exclusion prior to
      Period 2 treatment.

    <description>In this crossover study of CD07805/47 gel 0.5%/CD07805/47 Vehicle and azelaic acid gel 15%, 70 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment sequence.
During Period 1 (15 days), 35 subjects received topical CD07805/47 gel 0.5% in the morning and topical CD07805/47 gel vehicle in the evening, and 35 received topical azelaic acid gel twice daily according to FDA approved prescribing information. Subjects crossed over to the other treatment in Period 2 (15 days).</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>A significant period effect was observed for CEA indicating there was carryover from period 1 to period 2. Therefore, as stated a priori in the protocol, only data from period 1 were used to analyze efficacy. All safety data are reported.</limitations_and_caveats>
