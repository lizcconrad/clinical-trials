  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel-group, randomized, multicenter Phase III trial to compare the
      efficacy and safety of a single 250 microgram (mcg) subcutaneous dose of MSJ-0011 to a single
      5,000 international units (IU) intramuscular dose of urinary human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG) in inducing ovulation in Japanese women diagnosed with anovulation or oligo-ovulation.
      Ovulation induction therapy will be undertaken with follitropin alfa. The primary objective
      is to show that MSJ-0011 is non-inferior to urinary hCG, as assessed by the ovulation rate.
