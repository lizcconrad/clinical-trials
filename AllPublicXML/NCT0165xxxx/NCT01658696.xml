  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria transmission is falling in some parts of Africa as bed nets and anti-malarials become
      more widely available. However, transmission still persists and it appears that additional
      control measures are required. The leading malaria vaccine candidate in development is RTS,S
      which has efficacy against clinical malaria measured at 30-50% in the field. This partial
      protection might be enhanced by combination with other components. The other vaccination
      approach that has produced repeatable efficacy in humans is the use of viral vectors to
      induce T cell responses. Previous attempts with this vaccine approach have been effective in
      challenge studies in Oxford, but ineffective in the field, probably because of reduced
      immunogenicity with previous vector platforms.

      Recently, studies in Oxford, Kenya and the Gambia have shown higher levels of immunogenicity
      by using a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) followed by an attenuated vaccinia virus (modified
      vaccinia Ankara) to deliver the pre-erythrocytic antigen, multiple epitope string with
      thrombospondin- related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP).

      The increase in immunogenicity has lead to sterile protection in 3 out of 14 volunteers and
      partial protection in 5 out of 14 volunteers in challenge studies.

      The investigators propose a Phase 2b study of 120 healthy adult men in Senegal. The
      investigators will assess the efficacy and further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety
      profile of the vaccine regimen. The investigators also intend to assess the correlates of
      efficacy and natural immunity.
