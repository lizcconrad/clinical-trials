  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the
      implementation of revised standards of care for oral hygiene (SAGE Q-care q2 Oral Cleansing
      and Suctioning System with and without chlorhexidine gluconate) relative to the current
      routine standard of care in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the adult Intensive
      Care Units in Alberta Health Services Calgary Zone. This pilot study will evaluate the
      feasibility of performing a larger definitive study. The primary assessment of effectiveness
      for the definitive study will be the proportion of patients who develop ventilator-associated
      pneumonia.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the
      implementation of revised standards of care for oral hygiene (SAGE Q-care q2 Oral Cleansing
      and Suctioning System with and without chlorhexidine gluconate) relative to the current
      routine standard of care in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the adult Intensive
      Care Units in Alberta Health Services Calgary Zone. This pilot study will evaluate the
      feasibility of performing a larger definitive study. The primary assessment of effectiveness
      for the definitive study will be the proportion of patients who develop ventilator-associated
      pneumonia.

      150 subjects will be randomly assigned using sealed opaque envelopes to one of three groups
      (Oral hygiene provided via the current local standard of care; Oral hygiene provided with a
      commercial packaged product (SAGE Q-care q2 Oral Cleansing and Suctioning System); Oral
      hygiene provided with a similar commercial packaged product with added chlorhexidine rinses
      twice daily (SAGE 24-Hour Suction Systems with chlorhexidine gluconate). Subjects will be
      provided the assigned method of oral hygiene by the bedside nurses from the time of ICU
      admission to the time of ICU discharge.

      Key measurements include the acquisition of ventilator-associated pneumonia; the documented
      frequency of provision of oral care; the state of oral hygiene evaluated by recorded oral
      hygiene scores; duration of mechanical ventilation; ICU and hospital lengths of stay; ICU and
      hospital survival; Antimicrobial utilization; and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistant
      microbes.

      For comparison of outcomes, means (with standard deviations) and medians (with interquartile
      ranges) will be reported for normally distributed and skewed variables respectively, and will
      be compared among the three groups using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively. Only
      the first episode of VAP in a patient will be evaluated. Given the small size of this pilot
      study, no interim or subgroup analyses are planned.
