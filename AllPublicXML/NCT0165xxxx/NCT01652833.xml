    <textblock>
      To ensure the appropriate administration of Vectibix for the treatment of mCRC with wild-type
      KRAS in real-world practice, it is important to understand the awareness of practicing
      oncologists regarding the correct indication and appropriate administration of Vectibix. It
      is also critical to monitor changes in oncologists' awareness and practice between the
      different rounds of the study.

      The survey will be conducted for 3 rounds in months 0, 12, and 24 after the first interview.

      Before the beginning of each round, a sampling list will be created by Amgen.

      In each round of the survey, potential participating oncologists will be sampled from each
      country's sampling list through random sampling and reached through telephone, letter or
      email. During the initial contact, the oncologists will be assessed for their eligibility to
      participate in the study by using a standardized screening questionnaire.

      The initial contact and screening of potential participating oncologists will continue until
      a total of 150 eligible oncologists agree to participate in each round. The number of
      oncologists sampled in each country will be proportional to the use of Vectibix in each
      country and the number of oncology physicians estimated to prescribe Vectibix. Each eligible
      oncologist can only participate in 1 of the 3 rounds of survey.

      Study staff will then conduct the survey with each of the identified eligible oncologists
      over the telephone, using a standardized questionnaire. Information about their awareness of
      the correct indication and appropriate administration of Vectibix and their experience in the
      administration of Vectibix treatment in the previous 6 months will be collected. We will make
      every attempt to collect the correct information from participating oncologists. This may
      require at least two phone calls to allow an oncologist to review their notes in order to
      report the correct data.
