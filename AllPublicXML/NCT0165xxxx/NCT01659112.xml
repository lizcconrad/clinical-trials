  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of the addition of core stabilization
      exercises to a traditional upper extremity rehabilitation program in upper extremity
      injuries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal movement patterns are one of the most challenging problems during rehabilitation of
      the patients with upper extremity injuries. They usually decrease the functional status of
      the upper extremity and prevent isolated muscle activations. Dysfunction of the kinetic chain
      system plays an important role in the development of these movement patterns. Thus,
      multi-segmental rehabilitation strategies has recently gained considerable importance in
      upper extremity rehabilitation. Core stabilization is one of the most popular rehabilitation
      approaches preferred to enhance functional stability of the kinetic chain system and dynamic
      postural alignment during activities. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects
      of core stabilization approach on functional status of the upper extremity and the amount of
      abnormal movement patterns. In addition, the factors affecting the abnormal movement patterns
      will be determined.
