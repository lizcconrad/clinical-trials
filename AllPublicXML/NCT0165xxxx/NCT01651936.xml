  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MK-8457 + Methotrexate
      (MTX) in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response or
      intolerance to anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) therapy. The primary hypothesis of
      this study is that among participants with active RA, MK-8457 100 mg twice daily (BID) + MTX
      will be superior to placebo + MTX as measured by the change in Disease Activity Score 28
      C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      In the Base Study, participants were to receive blinded MK-8457 100 mg + MTX or matched
      placebo + MTX for up to 24 weeks. At Week 12 and 18, efficacy evaluation was conducted to
      assess eligibility for early escape, defined as &lt;20% improvement in tender and swollen joint
      counts. Participants who completed the Base Study and those eligible for early escape could
      enroll in the 76-week Safety Extension in which participants were to receive open-label
      MK-8457 100 mg BID + MTX.

      All participants must have been treated with MTX for at least 3 months prior to Screening and
      have been receiving a stable dose of MTX for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. In
      addition, each participant must have either failed treatment with 1 or 2 anti-TNF-α therapies
      or was intolerant to anti-TNF-α therapy prior to Screening. For participants who failed
      therapy, the treatment with anti-TNF-α therapies must have been for at least 3 months.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS28) as Measured by C-Reactive Protein (CRP) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-CRP is a continuous parameter based upon a statistically-derived index combining tender joints (28 joints; 0=absent, 1=present; TEN28), swollen joints (28 joints; 0=absent, 1=present; SW28), CRP (an inflammatory marker, decrease indicates improvement), and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0=doing very well to 100=doing very poor; GH). It is defined as follows: DAS28-CRP = 0.56 × SQRT(TEN28) + 0.28 × SQRT(SW28) + 0.36 × ln (CRP+1) + 0.014 × GH + 0.96. The DAS28-CRP is a scale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating greater RA disease activity. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

    <description>ACR responses are numerical measurements of improvement in multiple disease assessment criteria. An ACR20 response is defined as a ≥20% improvement in 1) swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) (0 = Absent; 1 = Present) and 2) ≥20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: a) a participant's overall assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS, no pain =0 to extreme pain =100); b) Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (doing very well =0 to doing very poor =100); c) Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (doing very well =0 to doing very poor =100 ; d) participant's assessment of function across 8 functional areas as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), total scores ranging from no difficulty =0 to inability to perform tasks =24; and e) serum C-Reactive Protein (decrease indicates improvement).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability (HAQ Disability Index) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The functional status of the participant was assessed using the Disability Index of the HAQ on a Likert scale. This 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. The overall score for the Disability Index is the mean of the 8 functional area scores and also ranges from 0 to 3, with a lower score indicating less disability. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS28) as Measured by C-Reactive Protein (CRP) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a continuous parameter based upon a statistically-derived index combining tender joints (28 joints; 0=absent, 1=present; TEN28), swollen joints (28 joints; 0=absent, 1=present; SW28), CRP (an inflammatory marker, decrease indicates improvement), and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0=doing very well to 100=doing very poor; GH). It is defined as follows: DAS28-CRP = 0.56 × SQRT(TEN28) + 0.28 × SQRT(SW28) + 0.36 × ln (CRP+1) + 0.014 × GH + 0.96. The DAS28-CRP is a scale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating greater RA disease activity. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

An ACR20 response is defined as a ≥20% improvement in 1) swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) (0 = Absent; 1 = Present) and 2) ≥20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: a) a participant’s overall assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS, no pain =0 to extreme pain =100); b) Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (doing very well =0 to doing very poor =100); c) Investigator’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (doing very well =0 to doing very poor =100 ; d) participant’s assessment of function across 8 functional areas as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), total scores ranging from no difficulty =0 to inability to perform tasks =24; and e) serum C-Reactive Protein (decrease indicates improvement).

        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a continuous parameter based upon a statistically-derived index combining tender joints (28 joints; 0=absent, 1=present; TEN28), swollen joints (28 joints; 0=absent, 1=present; SW28), CRP (decrease indicates improvement), and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0=doing very well to 100=doing very poor; GH, ). It is defined as follows: DAS28-CRP = 0.56 × SQRT(TEN28) + 0.28 × SQRT(SW28) + 0.36 × ln (CRP+1) + 0.014 × GH + 0.96. The DAS28-CRP is a scale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating greater RA disease activity. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability (HAQ Disability Index) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The functional status of the participant was assessed using the Disability Index of the HAQ on a Likert scale. This 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. The overall score for the Disability Index is the mean of the 8 functional area scores and also ranges from 0 to 3, with a lower score indicating less disability. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>
