      The aim of the study is to create and validate a specific test named Intermittent
      Catheterization Acceptance Test (I-CAT), assessing &quot;the acceptance&quot; of clean intermittent
      self catheterization (CISC) in a neurological and no neurological population with indication
      to self catheterization.

      CISC avoids urological complications in bladder with chronic and improves quality of life.
      Despite theses challenges, the learning of CISC can face some physical, cognitive and
      psychological difficulties. Recently, we have validate a new test for predicting the physical
      and cognitive abilities to practice CISC named &quot;PP-Test&quot;. Meanwhile, psychological factors
      are not explored in this test. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted in order to
      demonstrate in a prospective trial, which kind of psychological barriers can exist. Likewise
      it would be interesting to create a new test assessing the psychological &quot;acceptance&quot; of the
      patients to CISC before learning (I-CAT). Based on the results of this self-assessment test,
      the specific nurse could then change her speech by playing down the importance of some fear
      and anxiety described by the patients. The learning of CISC would be facilitated.

      The first version of the questionnaire (I-CAT) has already been elaborated from some
      neuro-urology experts and patients's comments.

      The final version will be validated after a feasibility study. The psychometric criteria will
      be validated.
