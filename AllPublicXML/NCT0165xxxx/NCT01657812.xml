  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, combining epidural with general anaesthesia may confer many advantages to
      patients undergoing major thoracic, abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. Epidural anaesthesia
      can attenuate sympathetic hyperactivity and the stress response, maintain bowel peristalsis,
      spare the use of opioids, and facilitate postoperative feeding and physiotherapy. However,
      establishing epidural anesthesia is not without risks and contraindications, including
      refusal by the patient, technical failure, unintentional dural puncture, waist and back pain
      and local anaesthetic toxicity. When neurologic complications do occur, the resulting
      morbidity and mortality is considerable. Dexmedetomidine is a potent α2-adrenoceptor agonist
      with an 8 times greater affinity for α2-adrenoceptors than clonidine. This class of agent is
      known to have sedative, anxiolytic, anti-shivering, analgesic, and anaesthetic sparing
      effect. In addition α2-adrenoceptor agonists reduce central sympathetic outflow and attenuate
      the stress response associated with surgery.1 Unlike epidural anaesthesia, dexmedetomidine is
      easy to administer and no potential for neurological damage. The investigators hypothesize
      that the dexmedetomidine reduces the stress response of surgery to the similar extent to
      epidural anaesthesia when used in conjunction with a standard general anaesthesia for
      abdominal surgery.
