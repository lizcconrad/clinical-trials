  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soluble, viscous fibre has been established as an effective dietary component for lowering
      postprandial glycemia and promoting satiety. The effectiveness of viscous fibre has been
      related to its ability to increase the viscosity of the intra-luminal contents of the small
      intestine. Hence, the proposed mechanism with which soluble fibre affects the glycemic
      response, dependent on the viscosity development in the gut, would require that soluble fibre
      be extractable from the food matrix. This, in part, may be dependent on the food matrix that
      the soluble fibre is incorporated in. While properties of soluble fibre and their
      physiological effects have been studied extensively, limited data exists on the most
      effective mode of administration of fibre to optimize benefits. Furthermore, there are no
      studies to date that have evaluated how different modes of highly viscous soluble fibre would
      affect the subsequent meal. Hence, we propose a research study to determine whether the form
      of administration, taking into consideration the carbohydrate availability of a viscous fibre
      blend supplement, has a significant impact on postprandial and second meal glycemic response
      and subjective satiety in healthy individuals.

      Following a 10-12 hr overnight fast, subjects will visit the Risk Factor Modification Centre
      between 8:00 am and 1:00 pm. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, including body
      weight, height, and % body fat will be taken. An initial finger prick fasting blood sample
      will be taken and a subjective appetite questionnaire in the form of a 100 mm visual analog
      scale will be completed. Subsequently, one of the 5 study meals will be administered to the
      subject to consume over a 10-15 minute duration accompanied by 300ml of water. Subjects will
      then be asked to complete a palatability questionnaire. Over the following 3 hours capillary
      blood samples will be taken by finger pricks at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes post
      treatment. Appetite and symptoms questionnaires will be completed at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90,
      and 120. At 180 min, a second standardized meal will be administered, consisting of 400kcal
      of pizza and 200ml of water. Further finger pick blood samples will be taken at 15, 30, 45,
      60 and 120 min post pizza consumption. Upon completion of the visit, subjects will be given a
      24-hour symptoms questionnaire to complete at home as an additional safety measure for a
      24-hour period.
