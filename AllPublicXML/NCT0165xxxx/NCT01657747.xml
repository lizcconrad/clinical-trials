      The aim of this study is to assess whole body diffusion weighted imaging (WB-DWI) as a
      non-invasive method for

        -  accurate staging of patient suspected having ovarian cancer

        -  early treatment assessment

        -  detecting tumor recurrence

      1. Staging --- (PET-)CT is used nowadays to provide imaging information about the disease
           burden of ovarian cancer patients and a diagnostic staging laparoscopy under general
           anesthesia is often necessary to allow correct and accurate staging. The applicant
           propose an &quot;all-in-one&quot; imaging modality providing high quality thoracic-abdominal
           images without using ionizing radiation and/or radioactive material. This allows
           accurate assessment of operability in a minimally invasive manner.

        2. Early treatment assessment --- Although response to the first administration of
           chemotherapy is quite reasonable, most patients show tumor recurrence and achieve
           increasingly poorer response rates to second- or third-line regimes. Therefore it is of
           major concern that a individualized prediction of chemosensitivity can be performed
           avoiding unnecessary toxicity from inefficient chemotherapeutic agents. A promising
           perspective is that the predictive data to be generated might prove to be sufficiently
           powerful to predict chemosensitivity early in the course of the treatment, facilitating
           a timely change of treatment in nonresponders. This could avoid unnecessary toxicity for
           patients, improving quality of life and moreover implicate considerable savings for the
           healthcare sector.

        3. Identifying tumor recurrence --- Identifying tumor recurrence at an early stage could
           translate into reduction of unnecessary biopsies, cost savings and reduced morbidity
           associated with the biopsy procedure. But the most important issue is that early
           diagnosis can be life saving with respect to tumor recurrence.

    <description>MRI is a technique based on magnetic fields and does not require the use of ionizing radiation. Although there are no known side effects associated with MRI, a few precautions should be taken because of the 3T magnetic field. This implicates that all metal and magnetized objects must be removed from the patient before entering the MRI room. Patients with a pacemaker, a cardiac defibrillator or other implanted conductors/prostheses are for this reason not eligible for the study.
During the whole body MRI examination, an intravenous contrast agent will be administered. In most cases, patients do not experience any discomfort and the use of this contrast agent is part of the clinical routine.
During the whole body MRI examinations, a bowel relaxing injection (Buscopan) is also needed to reduce movement of the intestines.</description>
