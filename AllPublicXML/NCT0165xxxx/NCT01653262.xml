  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trial N01395 is to evaluate the reduction of nonpsychotic behavioral side effects in subjects
      with Epilepsy who switched to BRV 200 mg/day after discontinuing LEV due to such side
      effects; as well as the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BRV. No statistical hypothesis
      testing will be performed.

    <description>The POS frequency is standardized to a 28-day duration and changes in POS frequency are measured relative to the reported seizure counts for the 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Week 0).
Partial seizures can be classified into one of the following three groups:
Simple partial seizures (IA)
Complex partial seizures (IB)
Partial seizures evolving to secondarily generalized seizures (IC)</description>

Absence (IIA1)
Atypical absence (IIA2)
Myoclonic (IIB)
Clonic (IIC)

Based on the Investigator's judgement, at any time, the dose can be decreased to BRV 150 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or 50 mg/day. Flexible dosing, can be up- and down-titrated as needed.

          -  Subject with Epilepsy who the investigator expects will benefit from Levetiracetam
             (LEV) but for whom the investigator has decided to discontinue due to nonpsychotic
             behavioral side effects following the introduction of LEV

          -  Subject is currently receiving LEV at the recommended therapeutic dose (dose ranging

             concomitant AED

          -  Female subjects without childbearing potential (postmenopausal for at least 2 years,
             bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation, complete hysterectomy) are eligible. Female

             positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;) to either Question 4 or Question 5 of the Columbia-Suicide
             Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Visit 1

          -  Subject whose seizures could not be reliably counted on a regular basis due to their
             fast and repetitive occurrence (clusters or flurries)

          -  Subject has history or presence of status epilepticus during the year preceding Visit
             1 or during Baseline

          -  Subject has history or presence of known psychogenic nonepileptic seizures

          -  Subject has any clinical conditions (eg, bone marrow depression, chronic hepatic
             disease, and/or severe renal impairment) which impair reliable participation in the
             study or necessitate the use of medication not allowed by protocol

          -  Subject is pregnant or lactating

      <recruitment_details>This study started to enroll subjects in July 2012. In Oct 2013, the Sponsor evaluated the study in light of the recruitment rate. Given the unanticipated lack of recruitment during the prior 8 weeks, a decision was made to stop recruitment as of 16 Oct 2013.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participant Flow refers to the Enrolled Set. In total, 32 subjects were screened and 29 subjects were enrolled instead of 30 subjects as per protocol amendment 2. This difference was considered as insignificant and not affecting the planned analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Nonpsychotic behavioral side effects include (but are not limited to) such symptoms as aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, irritability, etc.
The Investigator completed the assessment by answering the following:

- Yes/No</description>
