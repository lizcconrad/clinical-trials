  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a modified regadenoson nuclear stress test of the heart that
      incorporates an aminophylline injection following regadenoson (The ASSUAGE protocol). The
      modified (ASSUAGE) protocol has been associated with fewer side effects and was better
      tolerated by patients.

      This study will investigate whether the modified regadenoson stress protocol (ASSUAGE)
      produces blood flow pattern to the heart similar to that of a standard regadenoson stress
      protocol. In proven to be the case, the ASSUAGE protocol has the potential to be used on a
      wide scale instead of the current standard protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who had regadenoson stress nuclear stress test of the heart will be invited to
      return to undergo a modified nuclear stress using the modified (ASSUAGE) protocol. Images
      from the original scan will be compared to those from the second scan to determine whether
      the blood flow pattern is similar between the two scans.

    <time_frame>The second (investigational) stress will be performed within 4 weeks from the intial one.</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS produced with standard protocol will be compared to SDS produced with the modified (ASSUAGE) protocol. The study is set out to demonstrate that there is no significant difference in SDS between the two protocols within the same patients.</description>

    <description>Agreement rate in the SDS burden category (normal/mild, moderate or severe)between scan 1 and scan 2 will be compared to the agreement rate between 2 sets of images from scan 1. The study is set out to demonstrate that these agreement rates are not significantly different.</description>

All enrolled subjects will undergo an investigational (ASSUAGE) regadenoson stress test. Imaging scans from the same patients (scan 1 and scan 2) will be compared.</description>
