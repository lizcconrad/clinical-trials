  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that there will be a variety of factors influencing the
      musculoskeletal complaints among workers of different sectors.

      Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) account for more than 30% of occupational
      diseases in the world. In order to organize the strategic actions that will be developed for
      the prevention of MSDs, it is essential to analyze in advance the peculiar situations of the
      different sectors of a workplace. The objectives of this study were to determine the
      prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints among workers in a medium-sized industry by
      comparing its sectors and to investigate the influence of occupational and non-occupational
      factors in the increase of complaints.
