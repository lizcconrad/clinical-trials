  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With age, a human crystalline lens opacifies (cataract) disabling the eye in generating a
      clear, well contrasted image. The only therapeutic solution to this problem is surgical
      replacement of the crystalline lens with an intraocular lens (cataract surgery).

      In addition to the cataract, the person might suffer from pre-existing cormeal astigmatism.
      In cases of severe corneal astigmatism, the standard IOL might not provide the optimal
      result, and additional surgical procedures as Incisional Keratotomy or Limbal Relaxing
      Incisions might be required.

      BunnyLens TR IOL is an Aspheric Toric intraocular lens providing a precise, superior
      alternative to surgical treatment of pre-existing corneal astigmatism.

      The BunnyLens TR IOL is designed for micro-incision cataract surgery (MICS), through 1.8mm
      incisions.

      The aims of this study are to:

        -  Demonstrate a reduction in refractive cylinder compared to pre-operative corneal
           astigmatism

        -  Exceed monocular best corrected distance visual acuity results provided in ISO
           guidelines.

      The reduction in refractive cylinder compared to pre-operative corneal astigmatism will be
      assessed using pre- and postoperative subjective refraction evaluation. Units of the
      measurement: diopters.

      Monocular best corrected distance visual acuity will be assessed using ETDRS charts. Units of
      the measurement: logMAR.

      There are no complications related to the BunnyLens TR implantation beyond those that might
      be expected in standard cataract surgery. The complications will be reported using Ocular
      condition forms included in the CRFs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 40 and 80 years of age, of either gender and any race;

          -  Have preoperative corneal astigmatism of &gt;= 2 Dpt as determined by IOL Master
             keratometry;

          -  Have regular, bowtie shaped corneal astigmatism. Corneal topography printout should be
             approved and signed by cornea specialist.

          -  Anterior chamber depth is between 2.5 to 3.8 mm

          -  Axial length is between 22 to 26 mm

          -  are willing and able to understand and sign an informed consent;

          -  have age related cataracts that require extraction followed by implantation of a
             posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) and used as an on-label procedure;

          -  are able to obtain pupil dilation &gt;=4.0 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Following disease(s)/condition(s): choroidal hemorrhage, chronic severe uveitis,
             concomitant severe eye disease, microphthalmos, proliferative diabetic retinopathy,
             corneal dystrophy, optic nerve atrophy, uncontrolled glaucoma or glaucoma treated by 3
             or more medications, uncontrolled systemic disease or any ocular condition, that by
             opinion of investigator would compromise the refractive outcome or potential of the
             eye to achieve good vision.

          -  High intraocular pressure (above 25mmHg)

          -  Previous intraocular or corneal surgery;

          -  Corneal abnormality that would prevent stable and reliable visual acuity and
             refractive measures;

          -  Current rigid contact lens usage (within 3 months prior to the preoperative biometry
             reading)
