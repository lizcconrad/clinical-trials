    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the responsiveness and utility of several
      clinical outcome assessments in the setting of copperhead snakebite. The secondary objective
      is to characterize the clinical course of signs, symptoms and impairment during the recovery
      phase of copperhead snakebite.

      This observational study will document the patient's recovery from copperhead snakebite. All
      care provided will be at the discretion of the treating physician in accordance with the
      local standard of care.
