  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test how well the investigational treatment,
      Engineered Skin Substitutes (ESS-W), works for covering and treating burn wounds.

      The areas of the body that are treated with ESS-W will be compared to similar areas treated
      with the patient's own skin (split-thickness skin autograft (AG)). A skin autograft (AG) will
      be performed by taking healthy skin from one area of the body and placing it on the burned
      area.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous engineered skin
      substitute (ESS-W) compared to conventional split-thickness AG for the treatment of
      extensive, deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns. A matched and randomized burn site
      format will be used to evaluate the successful graft take on excised deep partial- and
      full-thickness burns when grafted with either 1) unmeshed ESS-W or 2) meshed AG (the current
      standard treatment of split thickness AG).

      This research study is divided into five study periods: (1) Screening Period of up to one
      week and (2) Pre-Grafting Period, which will last approximately 35-45 days, (3) Grafting
      Day(s), which are the day(s) on which grafts are applied (i.e., First Graft: Day 0 and the
      optional subsequent Grafting Day i.e., Second Graft: Day 0), (4) Post Grafting Observation
      Period, which begins with 28 days follow-up after each Grafting Day(s), and continues till
      Post-Operative Month (POM) 6 from the last Grafting Day, and (5) Anecdotal Observation Period

The AG regimen occurs in stages, beginning with excision of the burned skin, followed by temporary wound coverage (e.g. cadaveric skin allografts, porcine xenograft, synthetic or biologic dressings or medical devices) to achieve wound homeostasis, and completed by permanent wound closure using autologous skin.</description>

          -  Is a prisoner at the time of obtaining written informed consent.

          -  Has a documented history of allergy or sensitivity to any of the antimicrobials or
             reagents used in preparation and application of ESS-W including the irrigation
             solution used before and after grafting. These include aminoglycosides, polymyxin B,
             mupirocin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin B, hydrocortisone, and insulin.

          -  Has a documented history of allergy or sensitivity to any of the animal products used
             in preparation of ESS-W. These products include bovine blood, bovine collagen, bovine
             collagenase, and porcine trypsin-versene.

          -  Has a documented history of allergy or sensitivity to glycosaminoglycan, the polymer
             component of ESS-W.

          -  Has a documented ongoing condition which could delay wound healing such as
             insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Cushing syndrome or disease, scurvy, chronic
             hypothyroidism, congenital or acquired immunosuppressive condition, chronic renal
             failure, or chronic hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh class B or C).

          -  Has a severe malnutrition or other concomitant illness which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, has the potential to significantly delay wound healing.
