  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the injection of Hearticellgram-AMI into acute myocardial infarction patients who are
      the primary targets of the drug, long term efficacy in the improvement of the left ventricle
      ejection fraction upon the first cell treatment is to be evaluated and compared with the
      current existing treatments (contemporary drug treatment).This study will also compare the
      efficacy and safety of single dose of hearticellgram-AMI to a two dose regimen of
      hearticellgram-AMI.

      We are enrolling a patient who had successful conventional percutaneous coronary intervention
      after acute myocardial infarction. Patients are allocated to one of three groups
      (group1=comparator, group2= one dose of hearticellgram-AMI, group 3= two dose of
      hearticellgram-AMI). single dose of hearticellgram-AMI have been attained new drug approval
      from MFDS (related to NCT01392105).

    <description>After implementing PCI, contemporary drug treatment is conducted.
*Contemporary drug treatment is a general drug treatment (Unfractionated heparin, Low Molecular Weight Heparin, Glycoprotein llb/llla inhibitor, Aspirin, clopidogrel or Ticlopidine, Nitrate, ACE inhibitor or ARB, β-blocker, CCB, Diuretics, Statin, etc.)</description>

Furthermore, contemporary drug treatment is conducted. After 30 days (+ / -7 days) from the first injection, a two dose of hearticellgram-AMI is administered in the same way. Furthermore, temporary drug treatment is conducted.</description>
