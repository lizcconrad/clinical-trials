  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about the effects of an investigational
      combination of medicines, which includes special immune cells (T-cells).

      A T-cell is a type of lymphocyte, or white blood cell. Lymphocytes are a kind of white blood
      cell that protect the body from viral infections, help other cells fight bacterial and fungal
      infections, produce antibodies, fight cancers, and coordinate the activities of other cells
      in the immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, these special immune T-cells will be taken from a sample of the participant's
      tumor tissue that will be surgically removed. Certain parts of these cells will be
      multiplied, or grown, in the laboratory. They will then be given back to the patient by an
      infusion in their veins. These cells are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The
      investigators want to study the benefits and side effects of TIL when they are given with the
      following combination of drugs:

        -  Vemurafenib - a type of drug used to slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells.
           This drug will be given for about three weeks while T-cells are being grown in the lab
           and then again after T-cell infusion for up to two years.

        -  Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide - two types of chemotherapy drugs. These drugs will be
           used for what is called lymphodepletion. The purpose of lymphodepletion in this study is
           to temporarily reduce the number of normal lymphocytes circulating in the patient's body
           before they are given the T-cells that were grown in the lab. This is so that there will
           be more &quot;space&quot; for the lymphocytes (T-cells) that will be infused in their veins.

        -  Interleukin-2 (IL-2) - a drug used to help the body's response to treatment on the
           immune system. A high dose regimen of IL-2 will be given after they receive the infusion
           of the T-cells.

      The use of TIL is investigational, meaning it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). Vemurafenib and IL-2 have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      metastatic melanoma and melanoma that cannot be surgically removed. The chemotherapy drugs
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, used for lymphodepletion, have been approved by the FDA,
      but not for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

      The combination of vemurafenib followed by lymphodepletion with chemotherapy, TIL infusion,
      and high dose IL-2 is investigational, and has not been proven to help treat melanoma. This
      combination is not FDA approved; however, the FDA is allowing its use in this study.

    <measure>Overall Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response (OR) is defined as the patient being alive at week 6, confirmed at week 12 and tumor size evaluated at both times using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 to be a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Evaluations will be made by CT scan approximately 6 weeks after the cell infusion, then confirmed by CT scanning approximately 12 weeks after the cell infusion, and by clinical evaluation during the first 12 weeks. The complete response rate, complete and partial response rate (CPR) will be summarized using both a point estimate and its 95% exact confidence interval based on the binomial distribution.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Drop Out Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The drop-out rate will be summarized using both a point estimate and its 95% exact confidence interval based on the binomial distribution. For the secondary endpoint, drop-out rate, the power will be 0.66 and 0.91 at the end of stage 1 and 2, respectively, for detecting a desired drop-out rate of ≤ 20% against an expected baseline drop-out rate of ≥ 40% (based on our experience, that of the National Cancer Institute, and that seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center) using a one-sided binomial test at alpha error of 0.05.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from study entry to disease progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, will be summarized with the Kaplan-Meier curve. Confidence intervals for the median and survival rates at different time points will be constructed if needed and appropriate. This secondary endpoint will be reported descriptively.</description>
