    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-stage intervention study is to investigate the effect of a novel
      nutraceutical (containing tetrahydro iso-alpha acids derived from hops) on weight loss and
      weight loss maintenance in obese participants.

    <description>Stage 1 (the first 12 weeks of the study): all subjects participate in a structured lifestyle change program featuring a high-protein, high-phytonutrient food plan (HP2). Those randomized to THIAA arm additionally receive the THIAA tablet, 3 times a day.
Stage 2 (the subsequent 52-week study): All qualified subjects (i.e. those who have lost at least 7.5% of their body weight in Stage 1) participate in a less restrictive lifestyle change program featuring a Mediterranean-style Low-glycemic-load food plan (MLGL). Those randomized to THIAA arm additionally receive the THIAA tablet, 3 times a day.</description>
