      This study aims to prove that, by a one-time topical spray on the cervix, AV2-DM is an
      effective antiviral in reducing on short term (3 months) the human papillomavirus (HPV)
      infection.

        -  Primary endpoint: significant drop in viral load AV2-DM versus placebo

        -  Secondary endpoint:the number of patients with adverse events
