      The proposed study will assess the efficacy and safety of the innovative endoscopic technique
      for the acquisition of full thickness gastric muscle wall biopsies. Having access to full
      thickness biopsies will allow an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of
      gastrointestinal diseases such as functional gastrointestinal disorders, gastroparesis,
      pseudoobstruction and other motility disorders. This information is essential to development
      of more targeted and effective therapy than currently available. Despite the high prevalence
      of functional gastrointestinal disorders and its significant impact on social and health care
      costs, the underlying cause is not well understood and there is no effective specific
      treatment to successfully alleviate patient symptoms.

      Our group has studied a new endoscopic method using a submucosal endoscopy with mucosal flap
      (SEMF) technique to acquire full thickness gastric tissues successfully and safely in
      preclinical studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic refractory idiopathic gastroparesis:

               1. The refractory nature of symptoms (e.g. based on nutritional failure,
                  consideration for enteral or parenteral nutrition) will be determined by the
                  physician/gastroenterologist who is the primary care provider for the patient's
                  gastroparesis.

               2. Patients will have documentation within the last 2 years of delayed gastric
                  emptying with &gt;30% retained gastric contents at 4 hours based on 296 kcal
                  solid-liquid, fat-containing standard meal gastric emptying test.

               3. The patient's physician will determine if this procedure may potentially provide
                  prognostic and therapeutic options.

          2. Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 70 years old

          3. Hemoglobin (Hb) &gt; 10g, platelets &gt;150,000 and prothrombin time- international
             normalized ratio (INR) &lt;1.5

          4. Ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior oropharyngeal, esophageal, gastric or small bowel surgery

          2. Esophageal stricture

          3. Prior abdominal radiation therapy

          4. Prior feeding tube placement

          5. Coagulopathy

          6. Use of Coumadin or anti-platelet drugs e.g. Plavix, steroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs

          7. Pregnancy -
