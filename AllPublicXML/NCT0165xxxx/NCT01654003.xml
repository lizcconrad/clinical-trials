  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study wants to compared the safety and efficacy of GDTs using standard pressure-related
      parameters vs. dynamic hemodynamic indices associated with fluid compartment monitoring, in
      septic patients requiring emergency surgery.

    <description>In the CONTROL group, the administration of fluid (250-500ml crystalloids or colloids) and cardiovascular supportive drugs will be guided to maintain standard pressure-related parameters within a normal range: MAP &gt; 65mmHg, HR &lt; 90/min, CVP &gt;8-12&lt; cm H20, urinary output &gt; 0.5 ml/kg/h. In line with the conventional approach, other physiological parameters will also be targeted: T° &gt; 35.5°C, Sp02 &gt; 95%, lactate &lt; 2.5 mmol/L, normalisation of the BE. The maximal infused volume of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven®) will be 33 ml/kg.
At the discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist with the FMH level, a pulmonary artery catheter, a transoesophageal Doppler flow probe or the PiCCO monitor will be inserted to complement the standard hemodynamic monitoring if deemed necessary.</description>

    <description>In the OPTIMIZED group, the central venous catheter and the 4-French artery catheter (femoral or humeral access site) will be connected to a dedicated haemodynamic monitor (Pulsiocath, PV2024L; Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany).
The administration of fluid (250-500ml crystalloids or colloids) and cardiovascular supportive drugs will be guided by an algorithm taking into account standard parameters (HR, MAP, lactate, Hb), as well as static and dynamic volumetric parameters (SVI, CI, GEDVI, EVLWI, SVV, PPV, PVI).</description>
