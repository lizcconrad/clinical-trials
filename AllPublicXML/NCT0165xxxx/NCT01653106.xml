    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of short-term (2 hours/120 minutes) and
      long-term (6 hours/360 minutes) schedules of crushed ice therapy (cryotherapy). Patients that
      receive high dose melphalan for bone marrow transplantation commonly develop significant
      mouth pain and sores (oral mucositis) unless cryotherapy is utilized. The goal of this study
      is to scientifically determine (using randomization and a larger sample size) if a short-term
      schedule is as effective as the standard long-term schedule in preventing, or minimizing the
      symptoms involved with oral mucositis. The study is also trying to determine the best dose of
      melphalan and how patient's body breaks down melphalan and will obtain blood through central
      venous catheter to measure the amount of melphalan in patient's blood at specific times after
      the melphalan is infused

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the maximum inpatient mucositis grade after 120- vs. 360-minutes standardized
      cryotherapy regimens in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing autologous hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation at Ohio State Medical Center.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a pharmacokinetic model predicting variability in unbound serum melphalan area
      under the concentration-time curve (AUC).

      II. To compare the neutropenic fever and bacteremia incidence after 120- vs. 360-minute
      cryotherapy regimens.

      III. To compare patient-reported mucositis-related symptoms up until discharge utilizing the
      Patient-Reported Oral Mucositis Symptoms Scale (PROMS) after 120- vs 360-minute cryotherapy
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Beginning fifteen minutes before melphalan treatment, patients receive 1 ounce of
      shaved ice in their mouth, allow it to melt and then replenish it immediately for 120
      minutes.

      ARM II: Beginning fifteen minutes before melphalan treatment, patients receive 1 ounce of
      shaved ice in their mouth, allow it to melt and then replenish it immediately for 360
      minutes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of severe (Grade 3 or 4) mucositis achieved between two different cryotherapy regimens during inpatient hospitalization based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test will be used to compare the proportion of patients who develop severe mucositis between those treated with 120-minute vs. 360-minute cryotherapy. Logistic regression modeling will also be used with incidence of severe mucositis as the dependent variable and assess various factors in addition to treatment arm on this incidence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Melphalan pharmacokinetic model including apparent volume of the central compartment (Vc), elimination rate of constant (Ke), half-life (t1/2), systemic clearance (CLs), and AUC.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, within 5 minutes prior to completion of infusion, at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, and 3 and 6 hours post end of infusion</time_frame>
    <description>All pharmacokinetic results will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics. A nonlinear mixed effects approach will be used for modeling melphalan pharmacokinetics, identifying significant covariates, and relating these to mucositis.</description>
