    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of using JVS-100 to accelerate wound
      healing and reduce scar formation in subjects receiving surgical incisions (&quot;sternotomies&quot;)
      during cardiovascular surgery. Twenty-five (25) subjects receiving a median sternotomy of 16
      - 25 cm in the process of cardiothoracic surgery will be enrolled consecutively and be
      followed for 6 months post-dosing. Three cohorts of approximately 8 subjects each will be
      enrolled, and within each cohort subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive a single set of
      needle-free dermal injections of either JVS-100 or placebo. JVS-100 or placebo will be
      delivered along the edge of the sternal wound using a needle-free injection device that has
      FDA-clearance for subcutaneous injections.
