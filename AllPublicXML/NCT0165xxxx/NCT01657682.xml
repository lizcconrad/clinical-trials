    <textblock>
      This pilot Phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of crenolanib
      in two cohorts of AML patients with FLT3 activation mutations (patients whose leukemia has
      recurred after prior chemotherapy not including a FLT3 TKI and patients whose leukemia has
      progressed after prior therapy with a FLT3 TKI).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open label study of crenolanib besylate. This study will enroll subjects
      with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3 activating mutations. Two cohorts of
      patients will be enrolled: those whose AML has recurred after prior chemotherapy without a
      FLT3 TKI, and those whose AML has progressed after prior therapy with FLT3 TKIs. Subjects
      will take Crenolanib besylate at 100 mg TID until disease progression, death, or unacceptable
      toxicities. Concurrent hydroxyurea is permitted during the first 28 days of study therapy.

    <description>To determine the response rate to crenolanib, including the rates of complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), and partial remission (PR), in relapsed/refractory AML patients with FLT3 activating mutations after first cycle (28-days) and at best response.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity rate associated with crenolanib therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the safety and tolerability of crenolanib in AML patients with FLT3 activating mutations. The two cohorts of patients will be jointly monitored for the safety. The toxicity is defined as any grade 4 or greater non-hematologic toxicities attributed to the study drug. Targeting a 30% toxicity rate as a trade-off, the trial will be stopped early according to the following monitoring rule. If at any time during the study we determine that there is more than a 95% chance that the toxicity rate is more than 30% we will stop the study. Crenolanib has been well tolerated in studies including over 100 patients and toxicity patterns are relatively well understood.</description>

          -  Confirmed primary AML relapsed or refractory after prior therapy, AML secondary to
             antecedent chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or AML due to prior myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS)/ myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) as defined by WHO criteria with
