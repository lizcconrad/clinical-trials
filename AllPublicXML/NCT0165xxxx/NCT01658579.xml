      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare the glucose control during treatment with a new formulation of insulin
           glargine and Lantus in adult participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare a new formulation of insulin glargine and Lantus given in the morning or in
           the evening

        -  To compare the incidence and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the new formulation of insulin glargine
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Up to 4-week screening period;

        -  16-week open-label comparative efficacy and safety treatment period;

        -  4-week post-treatment safety follow-up period.
