  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia and morphine based pain medicine analgesia has been the mainstay of
      practice in breast cancer surgery at Women's College Hospital. There is evidence to suggest
      that patients have a better recovery, with less pain and nausea and vomiting when nerve
      blocks or freezing of nerves are given in addition to a general anesthetic. Specifically for
      breast cancer surgery, evidence has suggested that the use of paravertebral blocks provide
      patients with a better quality of recovery after surgery. The aim of this study is to examine
      whether patients who receive the nerve blocks using an ultrasound machine in addition to
      general anesthesia have a better quality of recovery than patients who receive a general
      anesthetic alone. The hypothesis is that patients receiving ultrasound-guided paravertebral
      blocks (PVB) with propofol-based general anesthesia (GA) will have a better quality of
      recovery than patients receiving general anesthesia-opioid-analgesia. Quality of recovery
      will be assessed using a modification of the QoR-27, a validated instrument to assess
      postoperative recovery in an ambulatory surgical population.
