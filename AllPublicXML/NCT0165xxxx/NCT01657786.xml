    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common and distressing complication in patients
      undergoing general anesthesia. However, although 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor
      antagonists have significantly reduced PONV, it is reported that over 35% of patients treated
      with ondansetron experience PONV. Though the cause of failure in ondansetron treatment is not
      clear, the investigators assumed that polymorphism in the 5-HT3 receptor gene would
      contribute to such inter-individual variation. In this study, the investigators examine
      whether the polymorphisms of 5-HT3 receptor gene affect the efficacy of ondansetron to
      prevent PONV in patients undergoing general anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery.

    <description>Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg is administered intravenously. We assess an episode of PONV at first 2 h and 2-24 h after surgery. Genomic DNA was prepared and screened. The incidence of PONV is compared among genotypes in 5-HT3 receptor gene polymorphisms (5-HT3a: S253N; 5-HT3b: Y129S, -100_-102delAAG).</description>
