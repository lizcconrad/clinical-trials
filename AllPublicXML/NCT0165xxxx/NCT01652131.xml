  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no objective evidence of how long intravenous solutions remain inside venous blood
      vessels after they have been administered, therefore there is no definite guideline of how to
      administer them in the preoperative setting. Besides, obese patients represent a particular
      group of subjects as they theoretically with-hold a constant inflammatory response and that
      would modify the way solutions behave intravenously, that is how long they remain inside.

      Having said this, we wish to describe the way colloid solutions behave in this group of
      patients by taking serial blood samples in 12 obese patients after a colloid infusion, to
      calculate plasma dilution curves based on hemoglobin dilution and therefore infer the time it
      remains intravascularly.

      All this in the hope this information will help, in the near future, to establish a more
      objective way to use these solutions and avoid possible complications due to
      over-administration.

    <description>In obese patients candidates to laparoscopic gastrojejunal bypass an infusion of Tetrastarch (130/0.4)) of 15mL/kg (of corrected weight) will be initiated after protocoled induction of general anesthesia. Blood samples will be taken at time 0 (after induction of anesthesia and before initiating infusion) and then every 5 minutes for half an hour and then every 15 minutes up to 90 minutes. Blood samples will be processed in the Institution's laboratory. Urine will be measured at the end of the intervention. With these data kinetic parameters will be estimated for each patient.</description>
