      To characterise and understand the current UK COPD population including demographics, active
      comorbidities and missed opportunities for COPD diagnosis in the years previous to diagnosis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using real-world primary care clinical databases, ascertain whether 1) trends in respiratory
      resource utilisation prior to COPD diagnosis (including lower respiratory tract infections
      [LRTIs], consultations and hospitalisations) could be used as 'flags' to aid earlier
      diagnosis, and 2) characterize comorbid conditions present at the time of COPD diagnosis, and
      evaluate the relationship to COPD disease severity and age at diagnosis.

        Subjects aged 40 years or older, with an electronically coded diagnosis of COPD made

        corticosteroids, theophylline and leukotriene receptor antagonists.
