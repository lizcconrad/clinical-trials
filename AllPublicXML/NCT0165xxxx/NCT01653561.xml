      shrink or slow the growth of pretreated non-triple-negative metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      (VEGFR), and its anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The
      investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the maximum
      tolerable daily dose is 850 mg. The hypothesis of this clinical research study is to discover
      if the study drug apatinib can shrink or slow the growth of non-triple-negative breast
      cancer. The safety of apatinib will also be studied. Patients physical state, symptoms,
      changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help
      the research team decide if apatinib is safe and effective in pretreated non-triple-negative
      metastatic breast cancer patients.

          -  Metastatic breast cancer, confirmed by histological analysis.

          -  Have experienced at least 1 and at most 4 regimens, and failed from the last
             chemotherapy regimen. Pretreated anthracycline, taxanes and capecitabine (any rational
             reason for no use of capecitabine is acceptable) are mandatory.

             have failed for at least 1 anti-HER2 therapy (any rational reason for no use of
             anti-HER2 therapy is acceptable). HER2+ is defined as +++ staining on
             immunohistochemistry or FISH/CISH positive for gene amplification.

          -  Women diagnosed with HR+ should have failed for at least 1 hormonal therapy.
