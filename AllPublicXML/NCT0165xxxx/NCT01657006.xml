  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to prospectively enroll consecutive patients, without known ischemic
      heart disease, referred by their physician for routine exercise MPI at a tertiary care
      center.

      Prior to the MPI (nuclear stress test), eligible and consenting patients will undergo a
      one-hour period of Holter ECG digital recording. Application of ECG electrodes will be
      performed by medical technicians following standard recommendations, utilizing approved
      Holter device &amp; stickers. The Holter ECG data will be used for the offline heart rate
      variability (HRV) analysis by the HeartTrends device.

      Immediately following data acquisition, all patients will undergo an exercise MPI according
      to accepted clinical practice guidelines.

      Following the MPI, there will be no interference with patient management, which will be
      conducted by the patients' treating physicians according to current guidelines, unaware of
      HRV results.

      Analysis of recorded ECG data for HRV will be performed blinded to the EST and MPI results,
      by HeartTrends device.

      The results of the HRV tests will not be available to treating physicians and will not be
      used to guide patient management. Patients will be followed for 6 months for the occurrence
      of coronary interventions and MACE, defined as: death, myocardial infarction, unstable
      angina, or any coronary revascularization.
