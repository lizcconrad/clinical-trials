      This study was to compare the single-dose oral bioequivalence of Pantoprazole sodium 40 mg
      delayed release tablets (containing 45.1 mg of Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is
      equivalent to 40 mg of Pantoprazole) of OHM Laboratories Inc. USA (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy
      Pharmaceuticals Inc. USA) with PROTONIX® 40 mg delayed release tablets (containing 45.1 mg of
      Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is equivalent to 40 mg of Pantoprazole) of Wyeth

      The study was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence,
      single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence under fed conditions

      A washout period of 08 days was enforced between the administrations of study drugs in each
      period. At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site at least 36 hours prior
      to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1 dosing. Blood sample
      collections were obtained within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and after dose
      administration at periodic interval up to 48.00 hour in each period. A total number of blood
      draws during the study were sixty six (66) and the total volume of blood drawn did not exceed
      324 mL.

      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a high-fat high-calorie breakfast was served
      to the study subjects. Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of
      Pantoprazole delayed release tablet 40 mg of either test or reference formulation was
      administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient
      temperature under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel. Both
      test and reference products were administered to all the study subjects, one in each period.
