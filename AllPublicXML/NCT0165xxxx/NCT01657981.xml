      The study aims to observe how YM150 was absorbed, distributed and excreted after dosing with
      a radio labeled drinking solution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy male subjects are admitted on Day 0. Subjects receive a single oral dose of
      14C-labeled YM150 in the morning of Day 1 and remain in the unit for 7 days (6 nights).
      Blood, plasma, urine and feces samples are collected until 120 hrs after dosing for analysis
      of 14C-labeled radioactivity, YM150, YM-222714 and other metabolites. Expired air is
      collected as well for assessment of 14C-radioactivity.
