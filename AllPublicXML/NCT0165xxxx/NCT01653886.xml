      A pilot study was conducted to develop the study menus that were similar in appearance,
      aroma, and taste.

    <textblock>
      The aim of the pilot study was to test for differences in palatability ratings of the four
      menus that will be administered during the ENERGY I project. During the pilot study,
      palatability ratings were collected for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) from four
      different menus that were served to participants during the main ENERGY I trial. The menus
      consist of three diets that vary in dietary fat and energy density: 1) high fat/high energy
      density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density. In
      addition to these three menus, the menu from the baseline period of the trial will also be
      tested for palatability.

    <description>You will be required to taste small portions (1 to 2 bites) of 4 different breakfast meals. You will be asked to reate the taste after each meal. Meals will vary in fat and energy density, and will consist of two high fat diets and a high carbohydrate diet. Energy density is the ammount of enregy of kilocalories in one gram of the food.</description>
