      1. Introduction 1.1 Background Migraine is a common disabling headache disorder. Patients
           with Chronic Migraine (CM) experience headache on a minimum of 15 days per month. CM is
           associated with significant disability and reduced quality of life .

           Since the late 1990s, there has been considerable progress in neurostimulation
           techniques to treat medically intractable chronic-headache syndromes patients, by
           applying peripheral-nerve stimulation to patients . It is indeed well demonstrated that
           a non-painful stimulation of peripheral nerves can elicit analgesic effects, and that
           occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), by retrograde activation of the trigemino-cervical
           complex can provide effective pain relief in patients with headache disorders, including
           migraine. Recently, high cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been tested for the
           treatment of chronic cluster headache , highlighting a potential benefit of SCS over
           ONS: SCS exerts an immediate and almost maximal effect, which allows a test phase prior
           to implantation of the pulse generator with the possibility of removing the electrode in
           case of insufficient pain relief.

           Both SCS and ONS produce paresthesia, an unpleasant tingling sensation for the patients
           In recent prospective studies, a new modality of SCS, High Frequency (HF) SCS, has been
           demonstrated to be effective and safe in a chronic pain population, the Failed Back
           Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) population . High Frequency SCS differs from conventional SCS in
           several ways, which present significant advantages to both the patients and the
           healthcare professionals: 1) absence of paresthesia (tingling) which leads to greater
           patient comfort and acceptance of the therapy, 2) shorter procedural time as no
           paresthesia mapping is needed, and 3) increased efficacy compared to conventional SCS,
           demonstrated in the FBSS population. Additionally, HF SCS has a similar safety profile
           as conventional SCS.

           HF-SCS may thus combine the advantage of paresthesia free therapy (and thus greater
           patient tolerability of the therapy) with the possibility of testing the therapy during
           a trial phase prior to the implantation of a permanent pulse generator.

        2. Study Objective, Outcomes, and Design 2.1 Objective The objective of this study is to
           investigate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of high frequency (HF) Spinal cord
           stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of patients with chronic migraine.

           2.2 Outcomes

             -  Change of frequency in headache days from baseline;

             -  Change of frequency in migraine days from baseline;

             -  Change in frequency of moderate/severe headache days from baseline;

             -  Change in headache pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score from baseline;

             -  Change in HIT-6 score from baseline;

             -  Change in Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Score from baseline;

             -  Change in frequency of triptans intake from baseline;

             -  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC);

             -  Change in Quality of Life from baseline;

             -  Change in the number of sleep disturbances per night from baseline;

             -  Incidence of device-related adverse events.

           2.3 Target Size This feasibility study will enroll a minimum of 10 subjects and a
           maximum of 20 subjects.

           Each subject will undergo a trial phase of the therapy. If the trial is successful, the
           subjects will be followed-up for 6 months, with regular clinic follow-up visits.

           It is expected that the first subject will be enrolled in June 2012. The last subject is
           expected to complete the study follow-up period by January 2013.

           2.4 Devices Used

           The Senzaâ„¢ System, manufacturer by Nevro (Menlo Park, USA), received CE mark in 2010 for
           use as an aid in the management of chronic intractable pain of the lower trunk and/or
           limbs. The Senza System is similar to other available SCS systems in design and
           function. However, Nevro's proprietary waveform algorithms may eliminate unwanted side
           effects, improve subject experience and potentially provide better pain relief.

           Similar to the commercial systems, the Senza System includes lead(s), anchor(s),
           extension(s), trial stimulator, implantable pulse generator (IPG), charger, patient
           remote control, and clinician programmer. Additional components include surgical tools,
           cables and various other accessories for use in the placement of the leads and IPG.

        3. Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects

                or planned to be enrolled in another clinical trial 3.2 Subject Early Withdrawal

           A subject may be withdrawn early from the study for the following reasons:

             -  Adverse event

             -  Non-compliance

             -  At the discretion of the Investigator

             -  Subject withdrawal of consent

             -  Study is stopped by the Investigator or Ethics Committee (EC) 3.3 Device
                Explantation At the discretion of the Investigator or subject, the IPG and/or the
                leads(s) may be explanted from a subject. If the explantation is as a result of an
                unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) or device failure, the Investigator will
                send the explanted devices and accessories (i.e., Remote Control) to Nevro for
                device analysis.

           If the subject is experiencing an adverse event related to the explant, the subject will
           be followed until resolution of that adverse event or determination that the subject's
           condition is stable. The Investigators or the EC may suspend or terminate the study
           early at any time. If the study is suspended or terminated prematurely, all currently
           enrolled subjects will be withdrawn from the study.

        4. Treatment of Subjects/Study Procedures 4.1 Screening/enrollment The Investigator will
           identify potential study candidates who are likely to meet study inclusion and exclusion
           criteria and discuss participation in the study. If the subject agrees, the Investigator
           and research staff will meet with the subject to review details of the study. The
           subject will have the opportunity to read the informed consent and ask any questions.
           This study is entirely voluntary. Subject consent will be obtained in accordance and in
           compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and Italian regulations.

           If the subject agrees to participate in the trial he/she will sign the consent form.
           After the subject provides informed consent, he/she is considered enrolled into the
           study.

           The subject will be asked to attend the clinic to complete a series of subject
           questionnaires to gather information on their condition and current level of pain,
           disability and affected lifestyle metrics.

           Enrolled subjects will undergo a 2 week HF-SCS trial. 4.2 Trial Phase During the trial
           implant, the 2 leads will be positioned to cover the C2-C3 cervical levels.

           Over the following 2 weeks, the investigator will optimize therapy delivery by
           identifying the stimulation settings providing maximal headache pain relief.

           During this period, the patient will complete daily a headache diary to record their
           headache frequency, intensity and duration.

           The subject will be asked to attend the clinic at the end of the trial period. Together
           with his/her physician, the subject will discuss his/her experience over the past 2
           weeks (satisfaction with the therapy), and decide whether or not move forward with a
           Nevro Senzaâ„¢ IPG. If the subject chooses not to move ahead, she/he will be given
           alternative treatment options by the physician, and no further follow up study
           procedures will be required.

           During the trial phase, and until the 3 month follow-up visit, the physician will try to
           keep the headache medication as stable as possible, in order to avoid confounding
           factors when investigating the efficacy of the therapy Permanent Implant The Nevro
           Senzaâ„¢ IPG will be implanted in the buttock or abdomen area as outlined in the
           Physician's Manual. Fluoroscopy and impedance measurements may be used during the
           procedure to confirm lead placement and location.

           As per the Investigator's standard clinical practice the subject will be placed on
           prophylactic antibiotics as a preventative for skin flora (bacteria) infections.
           Subjects will follow the Investigator's protocol for anticoagulant therapy and other
           medications.

           Before hospital discharge, the IPG will be programmed with the optimal settings
           identified during the trial phase. The Patient Manual will be reviewed with the subject
           and a copy will be given to the subject for future reference 4.3 Follow-Up Visits
           Subjects implanted with an IPG will be asked to attend in-clinic visits at 3 and 6
           months post IPG implantation.

           During these visits, the subjects will undergo a clinical assessment and the following
           data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs):

             -  Medication usage

             -  Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6 questionnaire

             -  Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire

             -  Quality of Life questionnaire

             -  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale

             -  Patient Sleep disturbances

           The patient headache diary will be reviewed and a new one provided for the next
           follow-up period.

           During these visits, all Adverse Events will be documented. Until the 3 month follow-up
           visit, the physician will try to keep the headache medication as stable as possible, in
           order to avoid confounding factors when investigating the efficacy of the therapy

           At the end of the 6-months period, the study will be completed and the subjects will
           continue to be followed-up as per the center standard practice.

           4.4 Interim/Unscheduled Visits Subjects may be seen in the clinic for
           interim/unscheduled visits at any time during study. Possible reasons for an
           interim/unscheduled visit include the need to modify device programming to adjust pain
           relief, or for an adverse event. Such visits will be documented on CRFs.

        5. Data Measures and Analysis Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected and
           analysed. Table 1: Data Collection per visit

           General descriptive measures will include counts and percentages for categorical
           measures and the mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values for
           continuous data.

           Non-parametric 2-tailed cross sectional and pair-wise comparisons will be undertaken.
           Simple linear and non-linear regression will be used to calculate predictor values from
           the vertebral level data collected. Significance will be set at the 0.05 level.

           Additional analyses may be conducted.

        6. Adverse Events 6.1 Definitions The definitions presented in this section allow for a
           clear understanding of adverse event data collection and reporting requirements.

           6.1.1 Adverse event An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesirable clinical
           occurrence in a subject that appears or worsens in the clinical study (as compared to
           the subject's baseline health) and is any untoward medical occurrence defined as an
           unintended disease or injury or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory
           findings) in a subject whether or not related to the investigational or commercial
           medical device. This definition includes events related to the study medical devices and
           events related to the study procedures. An AE is also any event related to any
           underlying medical condition, present at baseline, which increases in severity by a
           clinically meaningful amount during the study as determined by the Investigator.

           Adverse events will be summarized by type, severity, treatment/intervention provided,
           relationship to the device/procedure, and resolution.

           As the primary efficacy measure in this study is pain, back and leg pain does not need
           to be reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a serious adverse
           event. However, Investigators may, at their discretion, report any pain-related adverse
           events during the study.

           Pre-existing conditions will not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a
           substantial increase in the severity or frequency of the problem which has not been
           attributed to natural history.

           6.1.2 Serious adverse events

           A serious adverse event is an adverse event that:

             -  Leads to death

             -  Leads to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:

             -  Results in life-threatening illness or injury

             -  Results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function

             -  Requires in-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

             -  Results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body
                structure or a body function

             -  Leads to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect
                6.1.3 Adverse device effect

           An adverse device effect (also called a device-related adverse event) is an adverse
           event with a reasonable possibility that the device caused or contributed to the event.
           During this clinical investigation an event should be considered related to the device
           when it is the result of:

             -  The device components (e.g., lead, extension, IPG)

             -  The implant procedure

             -  The therapy/stimulation 6.1.4 Serious adverse device effect An untoward medical
                occurrence that happens in a subject, is related to the investigational device,
                procedure, or therapy and is serious, but is not unanticipated is a serious adverse
                device effect (SADE). Untoward medical occurrences that are anticipated, i.e. are
                unsurprising, are identified in the investigator's brochure or protocol and
                informed consent form.

           Anticipated adverse events related to the device, procedure or therapy are listed in
           section 7, Risk/Benefit.

           6.1.5 Unanticipated serious adverse device effect An untoward medical occurrence that
           happens in a subject, is related to the investigational device, device procedure, or
           therapy, is serious, and is unanticipated is classified as an unanticipated serious
           adverse device effect (USADE).

           Anticipated adverse events related to the device, procedure or therapy are listed in
           Section 7, Risk/Benefit.

           6.1.6 Severity

           The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse
           event:

             -  Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject's
                usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and no sequelae

             -  Moderate: Interferes with the subject's usual activity or requires symptomatic
                treatment

             -  Severe: Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort with significant impact of the
                subject's usual activity and requires treatment 6.2 Reporting The Investigator will
                assess the subject for adverse events and capture the required adverse event
                information in the subject records or an appropriate study form. Adverse events can
                be based on subject report. Subjects should be instructed to contact their
                physician in the case of emergency, as described in the informed consent.

           All AEs will be followed until the event is resolved (with or without sequelae). If an
           event is ongoing at the time study completion of termination, the subject will be
           followed until resolution or Investigator determination that the subject's condition is
           stable.

           The Investigator is responsible for reporting information regarding specific AEs (e.g.
           SAEs and UADEs) to the appropriate EC as required by local regulations. The Investigator
           will also report any UADEs and appropriate device related AEs to Nevro.

        7. Risk/Benefit 7.1 Potential Risks A risk analysis was completed by Nevro Corporation in
           accordance with ISO 14971 - Application of Risk Management for Medical Devices. This
           analysis showed that the Senza System exhibits a safety profile equivalent to the
           commercially available stimulators.

           In an effort to report all of the potential risks for this study, all adverse events
           attributed to the device, procedure or stimulation therapy reported in a review of key
           SCS literature (Cameron 2004; Kumar et al. 2007) are described in this section. Table 2
           lists the adverse events that were reported in these articles in order of frequency
           reported in the Cameron article. These are foreseeable risks that are presented in the
           informed consent and are typical of commercial SCS systems.

           Other adverse events which may potentially occur, but were not reported in the Cameron
           and Kumar articles, include: increased intensity, duration, or frequency or back and/or
           leg pain, uncomfortable stimulation of tissue around the leads including skin and
           muscle, development of pain symptoms in a new location, thrombosis, nerve injury,
           seizure, and death.

           As the primary efficacy measure in this study is pain, headache pain does not need to be
           reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a serious adverse event.
           However, Investigators may, at their discretion, report any pain-related adverse events.

           7.2 Possible Benefits The Senza System has received CE mark approval for use in the
           treatment of chronic intractable pain. The hazards and mitigation mechanisms were
           identified and risk factors were calculated for each of the identified hazards and were
           found to be within the acceptance criterion. The results of the risk analysis concluded
           that the benefit of providing pain relief for subjects suffering from chronic
           intractable pain outweighs the residual risks that may be posed by the use of this
           device.

           The desired benefit is the improvement in the status of the patient's refractory pain.
           There is however, no guarantee that this will happen. Results of prior and on-going
           clinical studies show that the Senza System offers an opportunity for improved pain
           relief in this chronic intractable pain population. Thus, by participating in this study
           the information gathered will add to the understanding of treatment options for patients
           with chronic migraine. This knowledge may advance medical science and may benefit other
           patients with chronic pain and potentially society at large.

        8. Conduct of Study

           8.1 Statement of Study Compliance The study will be performed in accordance with ISO
           14155-2011, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, recommendations guiding physicians
           in biomedical research involving humans adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly,
           Helsinki, Finland (1964 and later revisions). The Investigator, as required by the local
           regulations should notify the EC in writing after completion, termination, or
           discontinuation of the study at the site. If study is discontinued due to safety
           concerns, the Investigator will notify the EC immediately.

           8.2 Investigator Responsibilities The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the
           investigation is conducted according to the study protocol, and applicable ISO EN
           14155-2011, data protection regulations, and any other applicable Ethics Committee=
           requirements.

           The Investigator(s) shall be responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the investigation
           as well as for the safety and well-being of the human patients involved in the clinical
           investigation.

           It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain approval of the study protocol
           from the EC and to keep the EC informed of any serious adverse events, unanticipated
           adverse device effects, and amendments to the protocol. All correspondence with the EC
           should be filed by the Investigator.

           8.3 Quality Control and Quality Assurance All documents and data shall be produced and
           maintained in such a way to assure control of documents and data to protect the
           patient's privacy as far as reasonably practicable. Representatives of the applicable
           regulatory authorities are permitted to inspect the study documents (e.g., study
           protocol, CRFs, and original study-relevant medical records/files) as needed. All
           attempts will be made to preserve patient confidentiality.

           8.4 Ethics The Investigator is a physician whose first responsibility is to the care of
           the patient. Should individual care conflict with study requirements, it is understood
           that the care of the patient is foremost. In all respects, this study shall be conducted
           pursuant to the &quot;Declaration of Helsinki: Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in
           Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects&quot;.

           At all times, the Investigators are to follow this confirmatory study plan, abide by all
           Good Clinical Practice requirements set by prevailing national law and any EC
           regulations.

           8.5 Termination or Suspension of the Investigation The study may be terminated when all
           of the requirements of the protocol have been fulfilled. Patients will be considered to
           have completed all study requirements following completion of the 6 month visit.

           The Investigators or EC may suspend or terminate the study early at any time. If the
           study is suspended or terminated prematurely, all currently enrolled patients will be
           withdrawn from the study. If there is an ongoing event related to the device or therapy,
           the patient will be followed until resolution of that adverse event or determination
           that the subject's condition is stable.

        9. Data Handling and Recordkeeping

      All documents will be maintained by the Investigator. The data will be collected using
      appropriate questionnaires and will be secured by the Investigator. The Investigator will be
      required to keep study records as dictated by local regulations.

      Appendix A - Responsibilities of Investigators

      The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that this clinical study is conducted according
      to all conditions of the HREC approval and applicable regulations. The Investigator is
      responsible for ensuring that informed consent is obtained from all subjects prior to any
      diagnostic tests or treatments that are outside the standard course of treatment that would

    <description>During the trial implant of Senzaâ„¢, High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulator for Refractory Chronic Migraine, the 2 leads will be positioned to cover the C2-C3 cervical levels.
Over the following 2 weeks, the investigator will optimize therapy delivery by identifying the stimulation settings providing maximal headache pain relief.
The subject will be asked to attend the clinic at the end of the trial period. Together with his/her physician, the subject will discuss his/her experience over the past 2 weeks (satisfaction with the therapy), and decide whether or not move forward with a Nevro Senza IPG.
The Nevro Senza IPG will be implanted in the buttock or abdomen area as outlined in the Physician's Manual. Fluoroscopy and impedance measurements may be used during the procedure to confirm lead placement and location.
Before hospital discharge, the IPG will be programmed with the optimal settings identified during the trial phase.</description>
