      Chronic pains can affect the life quality. This study has performed in the first time in
      Mashhad.The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of acupuncture on the life
      quality of 150 patients who suffered from chronic pain. Some people like performing
      acupuncture because they believed it's free of risks and beneficial.

      In order to achieve this purpose, we had examined the life quality of the patients before and
      after acupuncture. This study was randomly performed on 150 patients aged between 17-75. They
      were suffering from chronic pain.

      The questionnaire is based on WHO QOL. The questionnaires were filled out once before
      acupuncture and once 12 weeks after it.
