  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done due to a new imaging method that may help others in the future to
      improve evaluation of diseases in the eye and eye socket and to help make a decision
      concerning best treatment of the disease. Previous studies suggests that dynamic contrast
      enhanced MRI is ideally suited to show small structures in the eye and eye socket as well as
      to provide information about the eye socket such as blood circulation. This research may also
      provide information about the likelihood of the tumor spreading from the eye into other
      organs as well as correlate the study images with all other clinical imaging

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of DCE-MRI (dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging) as non-invasive imaging tool to image contrast enhancement in ocular and orbital
      tumors.

      II. To compare contrast enhancement and its distribution within orbital tissue. III. To
      assess potential differences in contrast enhancement which help to characterize malignant
      lesions as well as discriminate these from benign tissue.

      IV. To compare image characteristics between clinical high field end ex-vivo ultra high field
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

      V. To correlate imaging findings with obtained histology by comparing contrast enhancement
      parameters, e.g. maximum signal intensity, to histology characteristics, e.g. vascular
      density.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo DCE-MRI.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.

    <description>Crude comparisons between the groups of patients (benign vs. malignant) will be performed using a one-way ANOVA or nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, where appropriate. Outliers and influential covariate patterns will be identified using diagnostic plots. Depending on the complexity of the models, exact methods may be necessary.</description>

    <description>Logistic regression models will be applied to determine the factors most predictive of malignancy using forward selection methods described in Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test as well as the area under the Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve.

    <description>Studies will be performed on standard clinical MR Systems which are available on Campus. With the proposed imaging technique, we are able to acquire a 3D volume covering the orbit with a temporal resolution of approximately 15s. The affected eye will be immobilized to reduce motion artifacts. A routinely used MR contrast agent will be administered in a dose of 0.1mmol/kg bodyweight.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has an orbital mass which needs further diagnostic evaluation before
             treatment or for monitoring

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  Return for follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a lesion &lt; 2 mm

          -  The patient should not participate in this study is any of the following applies to
             the patient: the patients has a pacemaker, metallic cardiac valve(s), magnetic
             material such as surgical clips, implanted electronic infusion pumps or any other
             condition that would interfere with the MRI, the patient has a stent somewhere in the
             body, the patient has a history of allergic reaction to any metals, contrast agents,
             x-ray dyes, the patient has claustrophobia

          -  Patients cannot be pregnant and prisoners will not be considered for the study

          -  Exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents increases the risk for nephrogenic
             systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with acute or severe renal dysfunction; therefore,
             patients with the following conditions are excluded from the study:

               -  Acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30
                  mL/min/1.73 m^2)

               -  Acute renal dysfunction due to the hepato-renal syndrome or in the perioperative
                  liver transplantation period

          -  In order to identify subjects at risk for the development of NSF, the American College
             of Radiology (http://acr.org) recommends obtaining a medical history and a glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) assessment within six weeks of MR imaging in the following
             patients:

               -  Renal disease (including solitary kidney, renal transplant, renal tumor)

               -  Age &gt; 60

               -  History of hypertension

               -  History of diabetes

               -  History of severe hepatic disease/liver transplant/pending liver transplant

          -  All subjects providing written informed consent will complete the subject history and
             screening form prior to MR imaging; the form will be reviewed to determine whether the
             subject is at risk as defined above and the availability of an estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (eGFR) within six weeks of anticipated MR imaging; an eGFR result
             greater than six weeks prior to the MRI imaging date will be repeated and evaluated
             for renal function; subjects with an eGFR of &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 will be excluded
             from the study
