  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-04691502 is an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR kinase. Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor for
      the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women whose disease has progressed following
      tamoxifen therapy. The combination of PF-04691502 and exemestane might mitigate resistance to
      hormonal therapy and result in greater clinical benefit than exemestane alone in women with
      estrogen receptor positive advanced breast cancer.
