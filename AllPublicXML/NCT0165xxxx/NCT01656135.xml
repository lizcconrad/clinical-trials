  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the progression of the immunological response in living-donor kidney
      transplant recipients treated with a standard immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical,
      immunological, and health-economic data collected during this Reference Group Trial will be
      used to corroborate historical renal transplantation statistics and generate reference ranges
      for future clinical studies that will test immunoregulatory cell therapy as an adjunct
      immunosuppressive treatment in renal transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Organ Donor:

        A prospective donor is eligible for the research if all of the following inclusion criteria
        apply:

          1. Eligible for live kidney donation

          2. Aged at least 18 years

          3. An ABO blood type compatible with the organ recipient

          4. Willing and able to provide a blood sample for The ONE Study Subprojects

          5. Willing to provide personal and medical/biological data for the trial

          6. Signed and dated written informed consent.

        In signing the donor information sheet/informed consent form (DIS/ICF), organ donors agree
        to provide a blood sample for the IM Subproject, and permit access to their medical records
        for the collection of specified demographic and medical/biological data for the trial.

        Organ Recipient:

          1. Chronic renal insufficiency necessitating kidney transplantation and approved to
             receive a primary kidney allograft from a living donor

          2. Aged at least 18 years

          3. Able to commence the immunosuppressive regimen at the protocol-specified time point

          4. Willing and able to participate in The ONE Study subprojects

          5. Signed and dated written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Organ Donor:

        If a prospective donor fulfils any of the following criteria, then they are ineligible for
        the trial:

          1. Genetically identical to the prospective organ recipient at the HLA loci

          2. Exposure to any investigational agents at the time of kidney donation, or within 28
             days prior to kidney donation

          3. Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder, or other condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may invalidate communication with the Investigator and/or
             designated study personnel

          4. Subjects unable to freely give their informed consent (e.g. individuals under legal
             guardianship).

        Organ Recipient:

         10. Malignant or pre-malignant haematological conditions

         11. Any uncontrolled medical condition or concurrent disease that could interfere with the
             study objectives

         14. Participation in another clinical trial during the study or within 28 days prior to

                  the duration of the study

               2. The career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation of the patient ensures that there is
                  no risk of pregnancy for the duration of the study (at the discretion of the

         18. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up visit schedule

         19. Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder, or other condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may invalidate communication with the Investigator and/or
             designated study personnel

         20. Patients unable to freely give their informed consent (e.g. individuals under legal
