  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      investigational agent, olaparib, to give in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in
      patients with relapsed ovarian cancer or uterine cancer. Furthermore, the investigators
      intend to study the safety and tolerability of the study treatment, response to treatment,
      time to disease progression, and overall survival.
