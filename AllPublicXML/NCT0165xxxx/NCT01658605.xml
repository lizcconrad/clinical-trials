  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1605786 is an oral antagonist specific for the chemokine receptor CCR9 in development for
      treatment of small bowel and colonic Crohn's disease (CD). The purpose of this Phase II proof
      of concept study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of GSK1605786 (500 mg twice daily)
      administered orally for 16 weeks for the treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis
      (UC). A key secondary objective is to understand the mechanism by which GSK1605786 is acting
      and to this end samples will be collected to confirm the degree of inhibition of CCR9 on T
      lymphocytes in the blood of patients, and to explore the relationship between concentration
      of drug and changes in lymphocyte and antigen presenting cell populations in the peripheral
      circulation and in the colon. Patients recruited at specified investigational sites will be
      invited to participate in an optional sub-study to explore the effects of GSK1605786 on
      trafficking of technetium labelled T cells using Single Photon Emission Computerized
      Tomography (SPECT). Specifically, the technique will be used to follow trafficking to large
      intestine and thymus and findings linked to pharmacokinetics of GSK1605786, receptor
      occupancy and clinical efficacy outcomes
