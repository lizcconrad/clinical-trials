    <textblock>
      In treating alcoholism, many studies show Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT) is more effective
      than typical counseling, but BCT is not widely used because standard BCT delivered one couple
      at a time is costly to deliver and does not fit with the primary group therapy focus of most
      community clinics. The proposed study will test with married or cohabiting alcoholic patients
      whether a group format for BCT will produce similar positive outcomes as standard BCT, and
      deliver these results at a lower cost. If outcomes are favorable, this could prompt clinics
      to start using group BCT and improve outcomes for alcoholic patients and their families.

    <textblock>
      Multiple studies indicate that participation in Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT) is
      associated with robust positive outcomes for alcoholic and drug-abusing patients, in terms of
      reduced substance use and improved relationship functioning. Yet, community-based treatment
      programs rarely offer BCT to incoming eligible patients. As reported by providers and
      administrators in a national survey of treatment programs in the U.S., BCT was viewed as
      prohibitively labor intensive, due in large measure to its standard conjoint
      one-couple-at-a-time delivery format. Given the public policy climate that is now emphasizing
      not only clinical effectiveness, but also economic accountability, an intervention's
      efficiency (i.e., the ratio of effectiveness to program resources used to provide the
      service) is a critical factor in decisions by treatment programs to adopt new interventions.
      Although BCT has well-proven efficacy, the consensus of providers and administrators is that
      BCT is not efficient.

      To address these issues, we have studied couples group formats to deliver BCT. First, in
      earlier work the PI developed a 10-week BCT group with a number of conjoint sessions added
      before to prepare couples and afterwards to prevent relapse. While the outcomes were
      favorable, the added conjoint sessions and the closed group that once begun did not add
      additional members made it a hard sell for community agencies looking for briefer treatments
      and typically running ongoing groups with new members added regularly. Second, to overcome
      these problems, the PI and Co-PI developed a 10-session ongoing BCT group format that has
      rotating content and rolling admissions in which couples join the group, complete 10
      sessions, and &quot;graduate&quot;. A major advantage of this ongoing group format for BCT is that it
      fits with the way other types of groups generally are run in substance abuse programs. It got
      favorable reviews in provider focus groups and showed promise in a pilot study.

      The pilot study with married or cohabiting male drug-abusing patients examined the efficacy
      of a multi-couple group therapy version of BCT (G-BCT) compared to standard conjoint BCT
      (S-BCT), and individual-based treatment (group and individual counseling) for the patient
      only. Results showed G-BCT yielded equivalent outcomes when compared to S-BCT, in terms of
      reduction in substance use and improved relationship adjustment, but GBCT was less costly to
      deliver and had superior cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness. Both G-BCT and S-BCT yielded
      better clinical and cost-outcomes than individual-based treatment. Also, a small-scale
      evaluation study indicated G-BCT was more likely to be used in community-based treatment
      programs than S-BCT.

      Thus, this proposed study will conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the clinical
      effectiveness, in terms of substance use, relationship functioning, and psychosocial
      adjustment, of Group BCT (G-BCT) versus Standard BCT (S-BCT) for 160 alcoholic patients and
      their nonsubtance-abusing partners. Given the likely differences in cost of treatment
      delivery between the 2 interventions, we will also examine the comparative cost-benefit and
      cost-effectiveness of the 2 intervention packages.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        (a) both members of the couple must be between 18 and 65 years of age; (b) patient must
        meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric
        Association, 1994) criteria for current (past 12 months) alcohol dependence and alcohol
        must be the patient's primary substance of abuse as determined by a clinical algorithm
        (Fals-Stewart, Stappenbeck et al, 2004); (c) be married to their current partner for at
        least 1 year or be cohabiting in a stable common-law relationship for 2 years; (d) patient
        agrees to a goal of abstinence from alcohol and drugs at least for the duration of the
        12-week study-based treatment; (e) patient drank in past 60 days; (f) patient agrees to
        forego other alcoholism counseling except for self-help meetings (e.g., AA) or treatment
        required for a clinical emergency or clinical deterioration for the duration of the 12-week
        study-based treatment; (g) no more than 4 months living apart in past year; (h) alcohol
        dependent patient and partner currently living with each other, i.e., not separated or
        planning divorce; and (i) both alcohol dependent patient and the relationship partner are
        willing to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        a) partner meets DSM-IV criteria for a substance use disorder (other than nicotine) in the
        last 12 months; (b) patient has dependence on alcohol or other drugs that requires
        inpatient treatment or medical detoxification (as indicated by daily heavy use or use to
        prevent or deal with withdrawal symptoms) - after patient has completed detoxification, he
        or she may be eligible for the study; (c) patient or partner are at immediate risk for
        suicide or homicide or either made a suicide attempt in past 30 days; and (d) patient or
        partner meets DSM-IV criteria for a current organic mental disorder, schizophrenia,
        delusional (paranoid) disorder, or any of the other psychotic disorders. The SCID-IV (SCID;
        First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1995) will be used to screen out participants with
        psychosis or thought disorder. Subjects with other disorders, however, will not be
        excluded. Consistent with general AdCare Hospital services, the AdCare physician can
        prescribe psychiatric medication (e.g., antidepressants) if necessary. Finally, we also
        will exclude couples with a recent history (past 3 years) of severe partner violence on a
        day when drinking or drug use did not occur or if either member of the couple expresses
        fear that couples therapy may put him or her at risk of violence.
