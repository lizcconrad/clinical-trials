  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) featuring the latest integrated oxygen
      conserving devices (OCDs) provide greater patient accessibility and mobility during
      ambulation and travel. Recent POCs are compact, lightweight, battery-operated, and require no
      refill-time, thus meeting patients' clinical and lifestyle needs. There is, however, a lack
      of research on the clinical performance of the latest POCs that could help to determine their
      ability to maintain patients' oxygen saturations ≥ 90 % during exercise.

      Aim: The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of three POCs, with maximum oxygen
      production capabilities of 950 to 3000 ml per minute, to maintain oxygen saturations ≥ 90 %
      in patients with chronic lung disease during exercise.

      Method: Six minute walk tests (6-MWTs) will be administered in order to measure oxygen
      saturations by pulse oximetry (SpO2) in up to 20 patients with a diagnosis of either Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), or Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF) with documented exertional
      oxygen desaturations of ≤ 85% on room air. All participants will participate in 4 different
      6-minute walk tests: the first will be a control walk performed with the participants'
      current oxygen system set at their prescribed exertional flow rate. Then, the participants
      will perform a walk test with each of the three POCs set at the units' maximum pulse dose
      setting. The order in which the participants use the POCs will be randomly assigned using a
      sequence generator.

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that all three POCs will provide oxygen saturations ≥ 90 %
      during exercise in patients with chronic lung disease with moderate to severe exertional
      oxygen desaturation.

      Participants will attend two study sessions. During the session 1 participants will perform a
      6-minute walk test on room air oxygen to assess their suitability for the study. Only those
      participants with documented exertional oxygen desaturations of ≤ 85% as measured by pulse
      oximetry during this walk will be asked to return for the second session. During session 2
      participants will perform a further four 6-minute walk tests spread over a morning and
      afternoon testing session. All all data for primary and secondary outcomes will be measured
      at session 2.
