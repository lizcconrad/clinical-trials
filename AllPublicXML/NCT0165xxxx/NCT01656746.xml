    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for
      colorectal diseases, compared to multi-port laparoscopic surgery. This study is also intended
      to standardize the SILS technique for colorectal diseases

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report the experience of SILS procedure in the treatment of colorectal disease.

      II. To standardize the SILS technique.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo single incision laparoscopic surgery with GelPort® attachment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and
      at 1 year.
