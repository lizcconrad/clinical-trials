  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, prospective placebo-controlled clinical trial to be
      conducted within the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Clinic Health System.

      The goal of the research study is to gather information to determine whether Doxycycline is
      effective for the treatment of unacceptable bleeding associated with the etonogestrel
      subdermal implant (ESI), as compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESI is a long-acting reversible contraceptive. Though safety and efficacy have been
      established world wide, only about 1 % of women have been reported to use this method. Its
      use is limited by bleeding pattern changes which result in requests for early removal, most
      commonly within the first 8 months of use.

      Women ages 18-51 years, choosing ESI and who meet eligibility criteria, will be offered
      enrollment in the study at the time of ESI insertion. Every effort will be made to insert
      Implanon on the same day as consent unless medically contraindicated. Prospective diaries
      will be completed starting on the date of ESI insertion. All participants will be contacted
      by study personnel 13 weeks after enrollment and queried as to the presence of unacceptable
      bleeding. Bleeding concerns will be objectively assessed using a modification of the
      Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBLAC).

      Participants initiating contact with bleeding concerns at any time after 13 weeks post-ESI
      insertion will be offered treatment randomization at the time of contact. The basis for
      randomized treatment will be whether the bleeding is considered &quot;unacceptable&quot; to the
      participant. This is inherently subjective, but constitutes the basis for most removal
      requests. Participants that report unacceptable bleeding at 13 weeks post-ESI insertion, and
      those who call with bleeding concerns anytime after 13 weeks post-ESI insertion, will be
      randomized into one of two groups, Doxycycline or matching placebo.

      Participants that do not report unacceptable bleeding will continue to complete diaries and
      may be eligible for randomized treatment if unacceptable bleeding develops.

    <description>The efficacy of Doxycycline on ESI-related bleeding will be compared to placebo based on rates of unacceptable bleeding and weekly prospective symptom diary at 13 weeks post-randomization.
Method continuation rate at 13 weeks post-randomization will be compared.
Bleeding patterns will be quantified based on the PBLAC and WHO classification of clinically important bleeding patterns over each 13 week reference period.
Incidence of additional symptoms including acne, headache, mood changes in the treatment groups will be compared to placebo at randomization and 13 weeks post-randomization based on the weekly prospective symptom diary.
Interval to recurrence of unacceptable bleeding post-randomized treatment will be calculated.
Rate of adverse events associated with medical treatment will be documented by prospective symptom diary and BMI calculation. These include headache, mood changes, acne and change in BMI.</description>

    <description>Patient satisfaction with ESI will be assessed at randomization (pre-treatment)and will be compared to patient satisfaction assessed at 13 weeks following primary treatment with Doxycycline / placebo.
For patients receiving secondary treatment with Doxycycline, satisfaction with ESI will be assessed again at 26 weeks post-randomized treatment.</description>

    <description>Method continuation rate at 26 weeks post-randomized treatment for patients with continued unacceptable bleeding after primary treatment who undergo secondary treatment with Doxycycline will be calculated Rate of ESI removal for bleeding between 13 and 26 weeks post randomization. Rate of ESI removal for reasons other than bleeding with enumeration of reasons for removal between 13 and 26 weeks post-randomization.
Alternative contraception chosen in the event of ESI removal will be documented.</description>
