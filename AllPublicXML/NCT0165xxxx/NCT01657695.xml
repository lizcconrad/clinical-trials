  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term objective is to develop a new tool based on a (molecular-biology) integrated
      imaging technology able to characterize and categorize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      patients in need of liver transplant (LT). To this end, our study aims at correlating
      specific imaging traits and fractional growth of individual tumors collected over a
      restricted time frame (T0 and at week 7 after first tumor detection), with a &quot;molecular
      signature&quot;, obtained by custom microarray, histochemical and cytokine analysis. This should
      allow us to translate a series of purely morphologic information into a meaningful
      pathobiologic data sets. Validation of the integrated molecular-imaging tool will be
      performed prospectively by correlating the imaging-molecular data with HCC outcome in term of
      survival and disease-free survival after down staging procedures.

      Organ allocation in our region is regulated according to MELD score. Patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receive an additional score depending on size of the tumor and
      the time spent in transplant waiting list. However, the advantage given to these patients is
      uniform and does not take into account the profound biological heterogeneity of individual
      HCCs. To make the additional score righteous, the investigators need to identify patients
      with aggressively growing HCC who require salvage transplantation while those with
      slow-growing HCC do not deserve the additional score.

      All cirrhotics with suspect HCC identified at routine US screening will be therefore enrolled
      in the prospective imaging and bio-molecular study.

      They will be subjected to two computed tomography (CT) exams at 7 weeks interval to define
      fractional tumor growth and imaging traits, baseline US-guided liver biopsy for microarray
      and histochemical characterization, serum sampling for cytokine assay. Survival, disease-free
      survival after downstaging and transplant outcome will be recorded and analyzed in relation
      with imaging and molecular data. The investigators expect to set up an accurate imaging and
      molecular diagnostic tool able to identify patients with aggressive HCC requiring urgent
      access to transplant, reliable in predicting survival, standardisable and not too expensive.

      We have designed custom arrays selecting those genes that, on the basis of literature and our
      own data, will be most informative regarding molecular pathways of relevance for HCC onset
      and progression and which have been already associated with decreased survival. These genes
      belong to cell cycle, apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell signaling, hypoxia and
      metastasis-prone pathways.
