  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the aim of the study is to get evidence for an enhancement of immune status in subjects after
      probiotics mixture consumption ( lactobacillus gasseri PA 16/8, Bifidobacterrium longum SP
      07/3, Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5) based on influenza vaccination model - compared to
      placebo.

    <textblock>
      probiotics are &quot;live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a
      health benefit on the host&quot; . many health effects are associated with probiotics , but
      various degrees of evidence support the benefits associated to probiotics consumption .
      Impact on defences and the immune system has been shown with several strains and this may
      result in improved protection against some infections or improvment of vaccine efficacy .

      In its scientific requirments for health claims related to immune function, EFSA indicates
      that it is generally accepted that higher vaccination responses are beneficial.
