  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is an important health problem in the rapidly-aging demographic. Fragility
      fractures are devastating consequences of osteoporosis. The most common treatment approach in
      osteoporosis is inhibition of bone resorption with drugs like alendronate (ALN). Parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) stimulates bone formation and is the only anabolic drug available. Dual therapy
      with ALN and PTH is not as effective as single-drug therapy in preventing fracture. Bone
      progenitor cells (MSCs) are recruited to sites of bone remodeling when a growth factor called
      Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β1) is released from bone. Different osteoporosis
      medicines may have differing effects on this process. The effects of ALN versus PTH on bone
      progenitor recruitment in humans are unknown. This is a randomized, clinical trial of ALN,
      PTH, and calcium and vitamin D in post-menopausal women with low bone mass. Women will be
      treated for 3 months with ALN or PTH or calcium and vitamin D. Data collected will include
      bone biopsies for histomorphometry and micro computed tomography (µCT), bone marrow aspirates
      for molecular studies, peripheral blood to detect circulating bone progenitor cells and dual
      X-ray absorptiometry. The investigators hypothesize that in humans, PTH will 1) increase bone
      progenitor number, 2) enhance recruitment of bone progenitor cells to bone resorption sites,
      and 3) increase bone progenitor number in peripheral circulation. Furthermore, the
      investigators hypothesize that ALN treatment will have the opposite effect. Understanding the
      differences in bone progenitor cell activity and recruitment during osteoporosis therapy will
      provide a mechanistic rationale for effective use of PTH and anti-resorptive drugs in
      osteoporosis treatment.
