    <textblock>
      The investigators want to learn about treating relapsed/refractory lymphoblastic leukemia and
      lymphoma with a drug called sirolimus. The investigators are using sirolimus along with other
      cancer drugs that are often given to patients with relapsed leukemia and lymphoma.

      The main purpose of this study is to determine if sirolimus can be given safely in
      combination with standard drugs used to treat relapsed lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      You will receive the drug sirolimus in addition to standard chemotherapy drugs.

      Just like your original cancer treatment, relapsed leukemia/lymphoma treatment is divided
      into different parts. You will get sirolimus during the first two parts:

        1. Re-induction: We give chemotherapy drugs to try to put your cancer back into remission,
           meaning that no cancer cells are found in the bone marrow samples (if you have leukemia)
           or on imaging studies (if you have lymphoma). From start to finish, this part of therapy
           lasts 35 days. On this study, you will take the drug sirolimus daily in addition to the
           normal re-induction chemotherapy drugs. You will swallow liquid sirolimus and you must
           take it with food. You will take sirolimus three times on the first day and two times
           each day after that during re-induction.

           Altogether, this is the schedule for re-induction:

             -  Sirolimus by mouth starting 7 days before standard re-induction starts, and
                continuing every day through day 28

             -  Mitoxantrone by vein on days 1 and 2

             -  Vincristine by vein on days 3, 10, 17 and 24

             -  Dexamethasone by vein or by mouth on days 1-5 and 15-19

             -  PEG-asparaginase* on days 3 and 17

             -  IT Methotrexate given in spinal fluid on day 1 (all patients) day 8,29 (if no
                cancer found in spinal fluid)

             -  IT Triples given in spinal fluid on days 8,15,22,29 (if cancer found in spinal
                fluid)

           (If you have an allergic reaction to PEG-asparaginase, you may be given 6 doses of
           Erwinia L-asparaginase instead)

        2. Consolidation: We give drugs to continue to kill cancer cells in your body and prevent
           them from coming back. From start to finish, this part of therapy will last 63 days (it
           could be longer if we have to interrupt your treatment because you have low blood
           counts, and you need to wait for them to come up). On this study, you will take the drug
           sirolimus daily in addition to the normal consolidation chemotherapy drugs. You will
           take sirolimus three times on the first day and two times each day after that during
           consolidation.

           Altogether, this is the schedule for consolidation:

             -  Sirolimus by mouth starting 7 days before consolidation starts, and continuing
                every day through day 56.

             -  Cyclophosphamide by vein on days 1 and 29

             -  Cytarabine by vein or under skin on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, 36-39

             -  6-mercaptopurine by mouth on days 1-14, 29-42

             -  PEG-asparaginase* by vein on days 15 and 43

             -  Vincristine by vein on days 15 and 43

             -  It Methotrexate in spinal fluid on Days 1 and 29

        3. After you complete re-induction and consolidation, your doctor will determine the next
           steps of your treatment. This will depend on how you are doing and it will be up to you
           and your doctor. It will not be part of this study.

      This research only includes the re-induction and consolidation portions of treatment (1 and
      2, above). If you have already done re-induction, you can enter the study for consolidation
      only.

      In addition to all the regular tests and procedures done to check on your cancer during this
      study, we will also take additional blood samples to monitor the levels of sirolimus in your
      blood (in order to adjust your dose) and we will also take blood samples to find certain
      markers in your blood that might indicate that the sirolimus is doing what it is supposed to
      do.

          -  A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:

        The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula for

             daunorubicin or doxorubicin)

        Hematologic parameters

          -  NOTE: this applies for patients enrolling for consolidation block 2 only. Patients
             enrolling for induction have no blood count requirements

        Pregnancy or Breast-Feeding

        -Pregnancy tests must be obtained in females of childbearing potential. Pregnant or
        lactating patients are ineligible for this study. Males or females of reproductive
        potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive
        method.

        Patients With Uncontrolled Infection

          -  Patients must have any active infection under control. Fungal disease must be stable
             for at least 2 weeks before enrollment. Patients with bacteremia must have documented
             negative blood cultures for &gt; 48 hours prior to initiation of treatment.

             inhibitors

          -  Patients who have a history of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis ARE eligible but
             will have asparaginase omitted from therapy. Patients who have a history of E-coli
             asparaginase allergy will receive Erwinia asparaginase.

          -  Patients with active lung disease as defined by presence of pulmonary infiltrates on
             screening chest x-ray or baseline room air oxygen saturation of &lt; 93%

          -  Hematopoietic growth factor(s): Must not have received within 7 days of entry onto
             this study for a short-acting growth factor, or within 14 days for a long-acting
             growth factor

          -  Azoles: Due to interference with sirolimus metabolism, voriconazole, itraconazole,
             fluconazole, and ketoconazole should be avoided and alternative antifungal therapy
             initiated. If one of these agents must be given, sirolimus dosing will be decreased by
             80% and trough levels monitored every other day for the first week and then weekly per
             protocol.

          -  Calcineurin inhibitors: Must be off of tacrolimus and/or cyclosporine for at least 2
             weeks prior to entry on this study

          -  Additional medications that interact with CYP3A4: See Appendix III of the protocol for
             medications to be avoided while receiving sirolimus. Patients should be off these
             medications at least 2 weeks prior to entry on this study. If the medication is deemed
             essential and cannot be discontinued, sirolimus dosing will be adjusted following
             discussion with the study pharmacologist, Dr. Vinks, depending on the degree of
             expected interaction. Levels should be monitored every other day during the first
             week, then weekly per protocol.
