  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that the use of olivamine-containing products in
      the management of patients with compromised nonhealing lower extremity ulcers is feasible in
      the Philippine setting. It will result in complete ulcer healing or wound closure after 16
      weeks.

      The specific aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of using olivamine-containing
      products in the management of patients with compromised nonhealing lower extremity ulcers in
      the Philippines. The primary endpoint of which is to evaluate the efficacy of Olivamine on
      healing of chronic lower extremity ulcers which will be assessed by rate of change in ulcer
      size (wound healing trajectory) and proportion with complete ulcer healing (wound closure) at
      4, 8, 16 and 16 weeks compared to baseline, week 0.

        Potential study subjects will be patients who are 18 years or older, has confirmed with the
        informed consent. He/she has a non-healing lower extremity ulcers compromised due to
        underlying factors such as peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, venous insufficiency, and
        pressure. The ulcer must be between 1.0 cm2 and 10 cm2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 years old or older.

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of arterial, diabetic foot, venous insufficiency, or pressure
             ulcer or surgical and traumatic wound.

          -  Patient's target study ulcer/wound is a lower extremity full thickness ulcer/wound not
             involving tendon, capsule, or bone.

          -  Patient's target study ulcer/wound and is ≥1.0 cm2 and ≤ 10.0 cm2 in size at the day
             of initial consult.

          -  Study ulcer/wound has been present for greater than 6 weeks prior to initial consult.

          -  Patients with Charcot foot deformities can be entered so long as the Charcot disease
             is not active, and the ulcer can be offloaded by an orthotic device.

          -  The patient has adequate circulation to the lower extremity as evidenced by an ABI
             (measured by Doppler) of ≥ 0.7. If the patient has non-compressible leg arteries, as
             documented by an ABI &gt;1.3, then the patient must have a Toe-Brachial Index be &gt; 0.6,
             or a toe pressure &gt;50 mm Hg.

          -  Patient must have adequate in-home support to comply with all protocol-mandated visits
             and procedures, offloading or pressure redistribution as required, and proper
             application of study products and wound care regimen.

          -  Patient or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review
             Board-approved Informed Consent form before Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An ulcer/wound that is ≥10.0 cm2 and ≤ 1.0 cm2 in size at the day of initial consult
             is not eligible for this study.

          -  Patient has clinical evidence of gangrene or infection on any part of the affected
             foot.

          -  The patient is judged by the investigator or study staff to be unable or unlikely to
             comply with daily wound care instructions, or study visits.

          -  Patient has muscle, tendon, or bone exposure in any ulcer bed.

          -  Patient has known sensitivity or allergy to any component of the study product -
             Olivamine10.

          -  Patient has one or more medical condition(s), including renal, hepatic, hematologic,
             neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the - Investigator would make the

             mg/dL.

          -  Patient has chronic liver disease or clinically significant liver enzyme abnormality
             as evidenced by elevated AST, ALT, or bilirubin greater than 1.5 times upper limit of
             normal (ULN).

          -  Patient is receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic agents, or is anticipated to require such agents during the course of the
