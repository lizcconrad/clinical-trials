        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be adults (&gt; 20 years old) in good health on the basis of medical
             history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and routine laboratory
             evaluations.

          2. Vital signs (after 3 minutes resting in a upright position) which are within the
             following ranges: Ear body temperature between 35.0-37.5 °C. Systolic blood pressure,
             90-140 mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure, 50-90 mm Hg. Pulse rate, 50-90 bpm

          3. Fasting blood glucose &lt; 100 mg/dL.

          4. Body weight must be above 50 kg for men and 45 kg for women and within 20% of ideal
             body weight.

          5. Negative urine drug screen at clinic check-in before each dosing

          6. Able to sign informed consent prior to study.

          7. Able to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any prescription or over the counter medication within 14 days prior to
             investigational products administration; with the exception of acetaminophen (not more
             than 2 g/day) or vitamins.

          2. A plan to take concomitant medications while enrolled in the study, with the exception
             of acetaminophen (not more than 2 g/day) or vitamins.

          3. Presence of any acute or chronic medical condition within 2 weeks prior to
             investigational products administration, including but not limited to: hepatic,

             respiratory, endocrine, or cardiovascular system abnormalities; psychiatrical disease
             including major psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder); acute
             infection; or other conditions that would interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs. Evidence of impaired renal function as indicated by
             clinically significant abnormal creatinine or BUN values or abnormal urinary
             constituents (e.g., albuminuria) as judged by the investigator. Evidence of liver
             disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C or liver injury as indicated by an clinically
             significant abnormal liver function profile such as GOT, GPT, g-GT, alkaline
             phosphatase, serum bilirubin, HBs Ag, or HCV Ab as judged by the investigator.

          4. Hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL

          5. Participation in any clinical investigation within 2 months or 5 half-lives, whichever
             is longer, prior to investigational products administration.

          6. Donation or loss of more than 500 mL blood within 3 months prior to investigational
             products administration.

          7. Subject is known for HIV infected.

             administration ; current consumption of alcohol in excess of 28 units/week (one unit
             is 6 oz of beer, ½ oz of hard liquor, or 2 oz of wine)

         10. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, should not participate in the study
             or may not be capable of following the study schedule for any reason.

         11. Consumption of more than 36 to 40 oz (1.1-1.2 L) of caffeine-containing beverages per
             day
