    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of the systematic application of the
      CONEM-BETA game in the subjective welfare of family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's
      disease or other advanced stage dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically diagnosed based on memory and cognitive deterioration,
      and the loss of other functional abilities. Nevertheless, for the caregivers and the patients
      themselves, the psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia (PBSD) are specially
      relevant aspects.

      These PBSD are a source of stress for the caregiver. PBSD treatment starts with
      non-pharmacological treatment, but if the symptomatology is moderate to severe, then
      pharmacological treatments are indicated on top of the non-pharmacological ones. The symptoms
      that better respond to non-pharmacological interventions are depression and mild apathy,
      wanderings and repetitive behaviors.

      Once dementia progresses, the ability to interact at cognitive and emotional levels are
      reduced, and then, alternative approaches are needed. In this circumstance, it has been
      postulated that the caregivers should not try to bring -patients with AD back to the
      objective reality, but that they should rather empathize with them and establish an emotional
      connection. This is a complex process, and requires intervention tools that favor this
      connection and improve the subjective welfare of the caregivers of persons with dementia.

      The current study is based on a previous experience in implementing the Montessori method at
      SARquavitae nursing homes and daycare centers. The &quot;therapeutic game&quot; called CONEM-BETA
      contains a subset of these activities that have been adapted from the original texts from the
      Myers Research Institute. We aim to prove that CONEM-BETA may have also socio-emotional
      benefits for the caregivers when they systematically use them at home with their AD
      relatives. These potential benefits will be assessed by using validated questionnaires that
      measure changes in subjective welfare, anxiety and depression, coping strategy, overload
      level and perceived social support.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EBP (Escala de Bienestar Psicologico - Psychological Welfare Scale) assesses the degree of the person self-satisfaction, comfort with himself during a period of his life, and contains four sub-scales: subjective welfare, material welfare, professional welfare and welfare of the relationship with his partner. It allows also to obtain partial scores, that allow to have indicators of overall welfare psychological index, and a weighted score obtained from the items with higher discriminative power</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline compared to the control and active arms using the Cornell scale and NPI-Q to assess behaviour of the patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or other advanced stage dementia</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cornell scale assesses the signs associated with depressive disorders in patients with dementia. It contains 19 items that assess 5 dimensions of depression: changes in mood, behavior disorders, physical signs, circadian rhythms, and judgement disorders. NPI-Q is based on NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), and was designed as screening tool to assess the emotional distress of the caregiver. NPI-Q assesses the degree of delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition and irritability.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Martin and cols. scale is an adaptation of the Zarit questionnaire to assess the overload level of the caregiver. It is a self administered questionnaire, with 22 items.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Goldberg's questionnaire has two subscales with 9 items each, one for anxiety and one for depression. It was originally designed by Goldberg with the aim of having a short interview as a screening tool.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Developed for the general population, the DUKE-UNC questionnaire allows to assess the perceived social support. It is self-administered and contains 11 items.</description>

    <description>The PANAS questionnaire includes 20 items, 10 related to the impact on positive affect (PA), and 10 related to the negative impact in affect (NA).</description>

    <description>Caregivers will receive 4 socioeducational training sessions during an 8 week period. These sessions will focus on the description and process of the Alzheimer's disease (AD), and will also provide to the caregivers resources and strategies to cope with AD. During the last 4 weeks, they will also systematically play with the patient at home with the CONEM-BETA game.
After that period, caregivers will use the game based on their preference and frequence during a period of 6 more weeks.</description>
