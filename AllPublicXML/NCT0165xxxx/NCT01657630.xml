    <textblock>
      This is an open, prospective, descriptive study aiming to evaluate the change in treatment
      satisfaction of primary care givers of young children who use the Accu-Chek Combo System.
      Patients will routinely be scheduled and start their therapy with the Accu-Chek Combo System
      on visit 1. Twelve weeks later the final acquisition of data will occur. Diabetes Treatment
      Satisfaction Questionnaires (DTSQ) will be completed at baseline and after 12 weeks, a
      distinct acceptance questionnaires will be completed at final visit. In addition, Diabetes
      related therapeutic information will be collected and data about the use of the device
      components will be downloaded from the Accu-Chek Combo System
