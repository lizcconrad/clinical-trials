  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two physical therapy training consisting of gait training
      that are distinguished by one being associated with tasks that require handling of the main
      executive functions, performed by individuals with Parkinson's Disease.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the experimental group (EG), which hold gait training
      with higher cognitive demands (dual-task condition), will make improvements in the parameters
      measured (functionality of gait and cognitive ability) to a greater extent compared to the
      control group (CG), which hold gait training without executive tasks (single-task condition).

      The aim of this study is to compare two physical therapy training consisting of a gait
      training that are distinguished by one being associated with tasks that require handling of
      the main executive functions (protocol designed by the same team), performed by individuals
      with Parkinson's Disease.

      Both training consists of 30 minutes of global exercises that involves stretching, muscle
      strengthen and axial mobility exercises, with the following difference:

        -  the experimental group (EG) will hold another 30 minutes of gait training in a dual-task
           condition associated with distracting tasks that require handling of the main executive
           functions;

        -  the control group (CG) will hold an additional 30 minutes of gait training without
           associated tasks.

      It will be a prospective study, single blind, randomized, where 30 patients with PD in stages
      1 to 3 on Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale will participate in the study, to be held in Brazil Parkinson
      Association. Patients will be randomized into an experimental and control group, 15 in each
      one.

      The training will consist of 10 sessions, two times per week for five weeks. The executive
      tasks concomitant with gait training cover the following executive functions: volition,
      self-awareness, planning, response inhibition, response monitoring and attention.

      The main outcome measures are: (1) Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), (2) Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), (3) Trail Making Test A and B, (4) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale (UPDRS) and (5) Falls Efficacy Scale (FES).
