  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII)
      and is treated by replacement therapy with FVIII concentrate. Approximately 30% of people
      with severe hemophilia A develop neutralizing antibodies, called FVIII inhibitors, which
      interfere with the function of FVIII concentrates. The reason that some, but not all, people
      with severe hemophilia A develop inhibitors is incompletely understood. Understanding
      individual and environmental risk factors is important to be able to prevent and possibly
      treat inhibitors. This study will look at individual and treatment characteristics in babies
      with severe hemophilia A who have not yet received treatment with FVIII (called Previously
      Untreated Patients, or PUPS). Subjects in the study will be asked to provide diaries of
      treatments, medications, and illnesses. Treatment will be directed by the subjects'
      physician, but all subjects will receive Advate, a third-generation recombinant FVIII
      product. Subjects will have blood drawn for laboratory tests, which include studies of the
      immune system and genetic studies of the FVIII mutation, before and 7-9 days after the first
      treatment with FVIII, and 5 days (+/-2 days) after the 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th
      days of treatment with FVIII (exposure days). The duration of the study will be first 50
      treatments or 3 years, whichever comes first.
