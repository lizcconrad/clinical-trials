  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of protocol-driven
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia delivered by ordinary primary care personnel
      (primary care nurses and social workers) in general medical practice with unselected
      patients, in line with a stepped care approach. The study design was a randomised controlled
      parallel group design, with allocation to CBT and waiting list control group (WL). Following
      an active treatment-control period, the control group were re-assigned to CBT. The study
      hypothesis was that the CBT group would experience less symptoms of insomnia after treatment
      compared with the WL group. Primary outcome measure was a brief self-report screening form,
      Insomnia severity index.
