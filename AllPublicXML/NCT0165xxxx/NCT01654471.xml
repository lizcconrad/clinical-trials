      The aim of the study is to validate the Korean version of Walking Impairment Questionnaire in
      patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

      First, the original version of WIQ will be translated into Korean, then it will be translated
      into English, again. The translated version will be sent to the original author to compare
      with the original version. After correcting, the Korean version will be completed.

      The patients with peripheral arterial disease will fill in the Korean version of WIQ before
      starting treatments. Baseline results of arterial function test, toe-brachial index and
      treadmill test will be recorded. Three months later, the patients will complete the
      questionnaire again. Arterial function test, toe-brachial index and treadmill test also will
      be taken again after treatment and the correlation of WIQ and other exams will be evaluated.
