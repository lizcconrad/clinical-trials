    <textblock>
      This study will treat approximately 24 participants who experience cold sores. Patches will
      be applied to the cold sore for up to ten days, and the symptoms will be measured during
      daily clinic visits using non-invasive measurement techniques.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of blood flow was performed using Field Laser Perfusion Imaging (FLPI) technique.
Total episode value (TEV) was calculated as the summation of (test region response minus control region response) across all days. Maximum episode value (MEV) was calculated as the maximum of (test region response minus control region response) across all days.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Color Intensity of Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The redness of the cold sores to be measured and quantified using sophisticated, standardized and reproducible color photography. Parameter represents distance between test and control values according to a* axis and b* axis colour intensity values. The values on the scale ranged from -100 (green, lowest intensity) to +100 (red, highest intensity).</description>

    <measure>Participant Assessment of Patch Comfort and Noticeability at Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants reported experience of the patch aesthetics and cold sore noticeability on the cold sore using a 5-point scale ( 1=Strongly Disagree 2=Rather Disagree 3=Neither Agree nor Disagree 4=Mostly Agree 5=Completely Agree) on 9 questions asked to them:
Today my sore felt completely protected
Today my cold sores interfered with facial movements such as smiling, eating or drinking
Today my cold sores interfered with my interaction with other people
Today the patch disguised my cold sores
Today I was bothered by the appearance of my cold sores
Today my patch was easy to apply
Today the patch covering my cold sores was bothersome
Today the patches stayed in place on my cold sores until I removed them
Today the patches were easy to remove from my lip or skin</description>
