      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability following
      administration of single ascending doses of GCC4401C in healthy male subjects; and the
      secondary objective of this study is to characterize the single-dose PK profile after oral
      administration of GCC-4401C, and to determine an appropriate dose range and dosing regimen of
      oral GCC-4401C for subsequent clinical trials.

             defined as the subject's weight in kilograms divided by the square root of the

             or equal to 450 ms) at screening, Day -1 and Day 1, predose (baseline). Repeat ECG
             measurements will be allowed at the baseline assessment for QTcF values above 450 ms
             and the average will be used to assess eligibility.

             at least 1 month, and having a urine cotinine less than 400 ng/mL).
