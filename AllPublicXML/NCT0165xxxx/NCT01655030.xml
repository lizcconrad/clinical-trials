      The purpose of this study is to determine whether creatine monohydrate is effective as an
      adjuvant treatment for bipolar depression.

      Bipolar Depression is associated with high rates of disability and increased mortality.
      Despite its major negative impact, treatment of Bipolar Depression is still controversial and
      only partially efficacious, with over half of patients not responding adequately to available
      treatment. In this context, the use of drugs that modulate energy metabolism has been
      proposed as promising new option as treatment strategies for bipolar depression. The aim of
      our proposed study is to perform a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial of creatine monohydrate as an adjuvant treatment for bipolar depression.
