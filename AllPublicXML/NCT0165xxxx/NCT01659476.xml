  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this research are to compare (i) the bronchodilating and (ii) the
      bronchoprotective effects of deep inspirations (DIs) in individuals with: (a) asthma, (b)
      CVA, (c) methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity and .

      (d) in healthy individuals (without asthma, chronic cough or asymptomatic airway
      hyperresponsiveness).

      Hypotheses:

      i. The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be: (a) absent or impaired in individuals with
      classic asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; (c) preserved in individuals with
      methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity; and (d) preserved in healthy
      individuals (without asthma, chronic cough or asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness).

      ii. The bronchoprotective effect of a DI will be: (a) absent in individuals with classic
      asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; (c) preserved in those with
      methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity; and (d) preserved in healthy
      individuals (without asthma, chronic cough or asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness).

      iii. Healthy individuals without asthma, chronic cough, or asymptomatic airway
      hyperresponsiveness, will not cough, or develop significant dyspnea, small airways
      obstruction or dynamic hyperinflation during high-dose methacholine bronchoprovocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation.
      Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze,
      shortness of breath and chest tightness. Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which
      chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of
      asthma. The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic
      bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood. We have recently identified individuals
      with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie. do
      not have asthma or CVA) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis. The purpose of this
      research is to examine the pathophysiologic differences between three causes of chronic
      cough: asthma, cough variant asthma and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway
      sensitivity. The responses in healthy normal subjects are crucial to understand the clinical
      relevance of methacholine-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity.

    <time_frame>Time frame of the methacholine challenge varies between individuals. At provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% and 50% decline in FEV1 (PC20 and PC50 respectively). On average, these occur about 15-25 minutes into the challenge test.</time_frame>
    <description>The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be examined using responses to high-dose methacholine challenge testing (Visit 1) in these subgroups by comparing the mid-expiratory flow difference between the partial (PEF) and full maximal flow-volume (MEF) loops at 40% above Residual Volume (RV) from the forced vital capacity (FVC) (PEF40 and MEF40 respectively) at PC20 and PC50 with that recorded at baseline.</description>
