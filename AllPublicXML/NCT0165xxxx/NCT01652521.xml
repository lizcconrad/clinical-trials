    <textblock>
      The effects of pleural drainage on lung mechanics are unknown. Insertion of esophageal
      balloon will allow us to measure and assess pleural pressure, and thus assess any possible
      effects of pleural fluid drainage may have on lung mechanics.

    <measure>chest wall and lung compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The use of esophageal balloon allows us to partition respiratory system into its components, namely, chest wall and lung compliance. These measurements have not been described so far in patients undergoing pleural fluid drainage. Thus, assessment of esophageal pressure which is a surrogate of pleural pressure will allow us an accurate measurement of the effect of pleural fluid drainage on chest wall and lung mechanics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>oxygenation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We suspect that pleural fluid drainage will be associated with improved chest wall and lung mechanics. If this will be the case, then we expect a concomitant improvement in oxygenation.</description>
