  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the existence of a relationship between the
      presence of certain abl polymorphisms (or haplotypes) upon CML diagnosis and the occurrence
      of primary resistance to the treatment of CML by imatinib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first secondary objective of this study is to identify, in patients not responding to
      treatment, possible changes in the polymorphisms of interest during the course of the
      disease, reclassifying such polymorphisms as mutations.

      The second secondary objective is to compare the control patients in terms of polymorphism
      frequency on the nonpathological abl fraction.

        We will include 60 healthy controls (free of hematologic pathology, seen in genetic
        counseling) and stratify the recruitment of patients with CML among 30 patients with
        optimal imatinib response and 30 with primary resistance.
