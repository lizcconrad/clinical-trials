  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MID-Frail STUDY project focuses on the use of interventions designed to improve
      functional status and enhance quality of life (rather than traditional treatments such as
      glucose- and blood pressure- lowering) by acting on the mechanisms involved in producing
      frailty and its progression to adverse outcomes.

      Detailed Description: Subjects enrolled in the main study will also be invited to join the
      following sub-studies:

      GENEFRAIL: this sub-study aims to determine the polymorphisms of several genes associated to
      frailty, in order to establish its predictive value for developing disability and response to
      treatment as well METABOFRAIL: this sub-study aims to investigate the metabolomic profile of
      frail and pre-frail patients. SARTRAIN: the combination of the assessment tools used in
      SARTRAIN (ARFI US, MRI, posturographic measurements) will provide a comprehensive study of
      the structural and functional characteristics of muscle and adjacent tissues and their change
      with time and the intervention. MID- POW: this sub-study aims to investigate changes in
      muscle power.

      The project also include an randomized controlled ancillary study: SENSOLE for which the aim
      is to investigate the potential effects of vibrating insoles device on gait and posture.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a simple test to measure lower extremity function using tasks that mimic daily activities. The SPPB examines 3 areas of lower extremity function; static balance, gait speed, and getting in and out of a chair. These areas represent essential tasks important for independent living and are thus an important outcome measure for patients with cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.</description>
