  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a split-dose regimen of crystalline
      lactulose for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy, as assessed by the
      physician's determination of the cleanliness of the colon using the Boston Bowel Prep Scale
      (BBPS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, pilot study to determine the safety, efficacy, and
      patient preference of a split-dose regimen of Crystalline Lactulose for cleansing of the
      colon prior to colonoscopy. Safety will be assessed by the occurrence of any treatment
      emergent adverse events. Efficacy will be determined by the endoscopist's rating of the
      cleanliness of the colon and the incidence of treatment failure (insufficient evacuation of
      the bowel). Patient preference will be determined by the patient's responses on a patient
      questionnaire.

    <description>To evaluate the secondary objective of efficacy, the following endpoint will be measured:
