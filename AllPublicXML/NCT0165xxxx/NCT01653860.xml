      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Brøset anger management
      model in reducing violent behavior amongst clients who are violent in intimate partnerships
      and who voluntarily seek help.

      Violence in intimate partnerships constitutes a serious problem worldwide and there is reason
      to believe that cognitive behavior therapy has some effect on the reduction of violent
      behavior. However, there are currently too few randomized controlled studies to conclude
      about the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy for this client group.
