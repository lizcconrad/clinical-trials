      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of Tysabri on cognition in multiple sclerosis
      (MS) patients. During a period of 24 months, the study will assess the evolution of cognitive
      function in Tysabri treated MS patients using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the
      CogState battery of tests.

    <textblock>
      Tysabri reduces the relapse frequency, slows progression and preserves cognitive function as
      compared to placebo as per the AFFIRM trial. The benefit on relapse rate and progression
      appears to be sustained in longer-term studies such as STRATA. In clinical practice however
      despite a stable condition on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) patients often
      complain of cognitive deterioration. It has yet to be shown that Tysabri will prevent
      cognitive deterioration after more than 2 years of treatment.

      The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a sensitive and validated test of cognition in MS.
      CogState offers a standardized battery of cognitive tests frequently used in clinical
      research in the fields of dementia and Parkinson's disease. The CogState battery of tests
      consisting of the Detection test (processing speed), Identification test (attention), One
      Back test (working memory), International Shopping List test (verbal learning) and the Groton
      Maze Learning test (reasoning and problem solving) will further confirm and validate the
      results of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test(SDMT) in MS patients as well as examine other
      cognitive parameters.

      Together the above tests done prospectively can assess the evolution of cognitive function in
      Tysabri treated MS patients over the longer term.
