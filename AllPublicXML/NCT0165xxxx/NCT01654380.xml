  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LY2605541 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
      This study is designed to understand how the body handles the investigational drug, what
      effect this investigational drug has on the body and how much should be given. This study
      will also measure how much of the investigational drug gets into the blood stream and how
      long it takes the body to get rid of it. The study has 2 parts: Part A will be conducted in
      healthy participants. Part B will be conducted in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (T1DM). This study will take approximately 10-14 days spread over 6-20 weeks, not including
      screening. Screening will be performed within 30 days of the start of the study.
