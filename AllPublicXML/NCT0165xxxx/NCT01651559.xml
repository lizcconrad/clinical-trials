  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-center study aimed to assess the efficacy of Dead Sea Minerals in alleviating
      symptoms of Psoriasis Vulgaris, in 50 patients undergoing phototherapy. A bilateral left
      right comparison will be made, after using the study product and the placebo, for 8 weeks,
      twice daily, on each of the body sides (left right). In addition to the clinical evaluations,
      skin biochemistry will be studied using non-invasive techniques. The latter will be
      correlated with the clinical results of the patients. These will serve for future development
      of diagnostic assays and personalized therapies.
