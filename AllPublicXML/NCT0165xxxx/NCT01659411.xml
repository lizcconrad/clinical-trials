      Multi-center, observational, U.S.-based longitudinal program. Data will be collected
      prospectively for 3 years. Individual physician feedback will be provided on data collected
      with the purpose of improving the management of patients - quality enhancement research
      initiative (QuERI) process from adult patients enrolled with a history of repaired Congenital
      Heart Disease (CHD).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 800 male and female adult patients with a history of repaired CHD will be
      recruited from approximately 100 cardiology practices and will be followed up every twelve
      months for the period of three years. Consecutive patients in each practice meeting inclusion
      and exclusion criteria should be considered for the study. Two groups of subjects will be
      enrolled based on identical exclusion criteria and inclusion criteria, with the exception
      only of inclusion criteria #3: cohort 1- those demonstrating historic high risk criteria and
      cohort 2 - those demonstrating current high risk criteria.
