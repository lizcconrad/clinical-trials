      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the drug isradipine for cognitive
      enhancement in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Incomplete
      treatment response can be common in these disorders. While there are medications that are
      effective at treating positive symptoms, some other symptoms of the disorders are often left
      only partially treated (cognitive impairment and negative symptoms). This study will begin to
      address if the medication isradipine might help to treat some of the cognitive problems
      associated with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Isradipine is a medication that
      acts by blocking a specific type of receptor in the brain called a calcium channel. It is
      currently approved by the FDA for hypertension.
