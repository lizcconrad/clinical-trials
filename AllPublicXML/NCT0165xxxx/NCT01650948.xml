  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AMD will provide cheek cell samples to determine if their is a correlation
      between genotype (DNA markers) and phenotype (the type of AMD the patient has).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test individuals who have already progressed to various forms of AMD to
      evaluate correlations between genetic markers and particular features of AMD including
      geographic atrophy and pigment epithelial detachments. We hypothesize that patients with more
      aggressive forms of AMD will have a higher genetic burden contributed by markers in ARMS 2,
      Complement Factor H (CFH), Complement component 3 (C3), Complement component 2 (C2) , Factor
      B (FB), or other genetic polymorphisms associated with CNV.
