      Objectives:

      Phase I part

        -  Primary Objective: To determine the recommended dose of the combination of lapatinib
           with Lipo-Dox as first line chemotherapy in patients with ErbB2 positive metastatic
           breast cancer.

        -  Secondary Objectives:To define the safety profile; To observe the response rate and
           progression free survival

      Phase II part

        -  Primary Objective :To determined the objective response rate of the combination of
           lapatinib with Lipo-Dox as first line chemotherapy in patients with ErbB2 positive
           metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Secondary Objectives:To define the safety profile; To determined the progression free

      In phase I part Lapatinib (L) - dose level I, II 1000mg po daily dose level III, IV 1250mg po
      daily Intravenous Lipo Dox at the dose level reached on days 1 of a 21 days cycle• The
      recommended duration of combination treatment for each patient is at least 8 cycles, then,
      with continue combination treatment cycles or single lapatinib treatment (start with 1500 mg
      per day) at investigator's discretion. The treatment will stop if progressive disease,
      unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal occurred. Intra patient escalation of dose level
      is allowed if no major toxicity noted.

      In phase II part Patients will receive recommended dose according to phase I study result.
