  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot to assess feasibility of the protocol in patients and controls across
      six participating sites. The goal is to identify biological markers (biomarkers)that can be
      measured at baseline or early in treatment to predict treatment outcome in individual
      patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Biomarkers of interest will be clinical (using
      interview and self-report measures), molecular (from blood samples) and neurobiological
      (using neuroimaging and EEG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to collect clinical and biomarker data which will be used to build models to
      predict treatment response. This is not a study to evaluate efficacy of medications, as
      medications in this study have been approved by Health Canada and are widely used for the
      treatment of MDD.

      This is an open label study involving MDD patients and healthy controls.Patients with a
      diagnosis of MDD and a current major depressive episode (MDE) will receive open-label
      standard of care treatment with escitalopram (10-20mg). Healthy controls will not receive
      medication; however, they will go through clinical assessments, blood collection and
      neuroimaging procedures.

      At week 8, patients will be assessed for medication response (response is defined as ≥ 50%
      reduction in MADRS scores from baseline). Responders will continue medication at their
      effective dose until study endpoint while non-responders will receive open label add-on
      treatment with aripiprazole (2-10mg).

      There are approximately 7 clinic visits over a 16 week period during which patients and
      healthy controls will undergo clinician administered scales and self reports, provide blood
      and urine samples (which will undergo proteomic and genomic analyses) as well as neuroimaging
      (fMRI and EEG).

      At the end of the study, mathematical modeling methods will be used to integrate the data
      from the various modalities to see which features best predict treatment outcome.
