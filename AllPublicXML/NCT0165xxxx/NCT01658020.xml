    <description>The outcome measurement is Change in EXACT-PRO score for clinical populations at Test of cure visit.
EXACT-PRO means that the questionnaires for Exacerbation of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool-Patient Reported Outcome of United BioSource Corporation(UBC) of USA that had been standardized, equipped with reliability and feasibility applicable to various COPD patients groups were used in order to quantitate frequency, severity and duration of acute exacerbation as a tool to measure acute exacerbation of COPD.
EXACT-PRO is consisted of 14 questionnaire items were classified into 3 domains, Respiratory Distress Domain, Cough/Sputum Domain, and Chest Symptoms Domain. The Scores of each domain were to be summed into the domain raw summed score or converted into EXACT domain score according to the conversion table. The total score had value in the range from 0 to 100 and higher the value was, severer the respiratory symptoms were in evaluation.</description>

    <description>The outcome measurement is Change in CAT scores for clinical populations at Test of cure visit.
CAT score means that COPD Assessment Test was used as a tool to assess the effects of COPD on physical, mental status and daily life.
CAT is consisted of 8 items in total and each question item was scored from 0 point to 5 point.
The scores of each question item were summed into the total score, which had values between 0 and 40.</description>

EXACT-PRO means that the questionnaires for Exacerbation of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool-Patient Reported Outcome of United BioSource Corporation(UBC) of USA that had been standardized, equipped with reliability and feasibility applicable to various COPD patients groups were used in order to quantitate frequency, severity and duration of acute exacerbation as a tool to measure acute exacerbation of COPD.
EXACT-PRO is consisted of 14 questionnaire items were classified into 3 domains, Respiratory Distress Domain, Cough/Sputum Domain, and Chest Symptoms Domain. The Scores of each domain were to be summed into the domain raw summed score or converted into EXACT domain score according to the conversion table. The total score had value in the range from 0 to 100 and higher the value was, severer the respiratory symptoms were in evaluation.</description>
