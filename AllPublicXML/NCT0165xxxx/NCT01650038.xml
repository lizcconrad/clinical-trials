  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the colon.
      Complaints such as abdominal pain, cramps and bloody diarrhoea usually start in early
      adulthood and lead to life-long substantial morbidity. There is no medical treatment
      available that meets the desired criteria of high efficacy versus low adverse effects. The
      current prevailing hypothesis regarding the cause of UC states that the pathogenesis involves
      an inappropriate and ongoing activation of the mucosal immune system driven by the intestinal
      microbiota in a genetically predisposed individual. Systematic investigation into the effect
      of correcting the dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis patients has never been performed. The most
      radical way to restore the presumably disturbed natural homeostasis in UC is to perform
      faecal transplantation from a healthy donor. In this trial the potential beneficial effects
      of restoring microbial homeostasis by faecal transplantation through a duodenal tube will be
      studied in a phase II randomised placebo controlled design.

      Endpoints are clinical remission and reduction of endoscopic inflammation after 12 weeks
      (primary), as well as time to recurrence, intra individual changes in faecal samples and
      mucosal biopsies. Follow up is 12 months.

      treatment with faecal transplantation from a healthy donor in active ulcerative colitis
      patients. In this trial the potential beneficial effects of restoring microbial homeostasis
      by faecal transplantation through a duodenal tube will be studied in a phase II randomised
      placebo controlled design.
