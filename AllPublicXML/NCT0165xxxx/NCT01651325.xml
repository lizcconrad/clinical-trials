  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of dextromethorphan in healthy adult subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will check-in on Day -1 and remain confined to the clinical unit until Day 13. On
      the morning of Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of dextromethorphan. On Days 6 and
      7, subjects will receive isavuconazole three times daily (TID) administered approximately 8
      hours apart. On Day 8 through 12, subjects will receive isavuconazole once daily (QD). On Day
      10, subjects will receive a single dose of dextromethorphan. A follow-up visit will be
      scheduled on Day 21 (± 2 days).

             female subjects

          -  The subject's clinical laboratory test results at Screening and Day -1 are within

             significant. Results for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) must be ≤ upper limit of normal, and total bilirubin must be ≤ 1.5 mg/dL
