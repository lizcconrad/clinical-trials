      Background:

      - Stress can cause people to give in to temptations to eat less healthily. People who are on
      weight loss diets often have problems sticking to their diets when they are stressed. Some
      tests have shown that the drug pexacerfont can help reduce stress-related seeking of
      high-calorie foods. However, it has not been tested on reducing food craving. Researchers
      want to test pexacerfont on people who are on diets to see if it can reduce stress-related
      food cravings.

      Objectives:

      - To see if pexacerfont can help reduce stress-induced food cravings.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 21 and 65 years of age who are on a diet to control their weight.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. This study
           requires seven visits over about 35 days.

        -  Participants will take either pexacerfont or placebo pills during the study. They will
           have three pills every morning. They will record video of themselves taking the pills
           every day.

        -  Every evening, participants will fill out a questionnaire. It will ask questions about
           feelings and behaviors related to eating and food craving.

        -  Participants will have regular study visits while taking the pills. The visits will
           involve questions about stressful situations and food cravings. One visit will involve a
           mildly stressful math test, followed by tasting of different foods. This test will look
           at whether pexacerfont can affect food preferences. Participants will provide blood and
           saliva samples as directed at these study visits.

        -  Participants will have follow-up phone calls 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of the
           study.

      Objective: To evaluate pexacerfont, an orally available, brain-penetrant selective CRF1
      antagonist, for its ability to modulate food craving and consumption in chronic unsuccessful
      dieters.

      Study population: We will collect evaluable data from up to 90 restrained eaters (individuals
      who indicate a history of chronic yo-yo dieting by scoring 15 or higher on the Dietary
      Restraint Scale). To ensure that all participants have some degree of preoccupation with
      food, an additional inclusion criterion will be endorsement of the Restraint Scale item Do
      you give too much time and thought to food? Apart from their preoccupation with food,
      participants will be healthy. They can be either normal-weight or overweight (Body Mass Index
      (BMI) &gt; 22kg/m2); this will be stratified across dose groups.

      Frank eating disorders will be exclusionary.

      Design: This will be a randomized, double-blind, between-groups study with two groups.

      Participants will be stabilized on either pexacerfont or placebo for 28 days (300 mg/day
      loading dose for 7 days, followed by 100 mg/day maintenance dose for 21 days). On day 15,
      they will undergo a math-test stressor and have stress-induced food consumption and craving
      assessed in a bogus taste test and on visual-analog scales. During three subsequent visits
      between days 16 and 28, they will be exposed to three personalized imagery-induction
      scripts-one stress-related, one food-related, and one neutral/relaxing. Food craving and food
      consumption will be assessed on those visits as well.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is stress-induced eating after the math-test
      stressor. Other outcome measures will include spontaneous food consumption after the other
      stressors, subjective ratings of stress, mood, and food craving, autonomic responses
      (galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate, and blood pressure), and endocrine responses
      (salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, and serum cortisol).

               2. Score of 15 or higher on the Dietary Restraint Scale, with endorsement of the
                  Restraint

                  Scale item Do you give too much time and thought to food?

               3. Age 21 - 65 years.

             (4a) For women of childbearing potential: must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72
             hours prior to the start of study drug, and agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy for a period of 6 months beginning from first dose of

             experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not
             postmenopausal. Adequate methods of contraception for sexually active women are having
             a male sexual partner(s) who is surgically sterilized prior to inclusion; having a
             sexual partner(s) who is/are exclusively female; using oral contraceptives (either
             combined or progesterone only) with a single-barrier method of contraception
             consisting of spermicide and condom or diaphragm; using double-barrier contraception,
             specifically, a condom plus spermicide and a female diaphragm or cervical cap; or
             using an approved intrauterine device (IUD) with established efficacy.

             (4b) Men, unless surgically sterilized (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia),
             must agree to practice abstinence or use barrier contraception, and not donate sperm,
             for a period of 6 months beginning from first dose of randomized treatment.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Current employment at NIDA IRP or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), or being in the
             immediate family of an employee. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent,
             child, or sibling, whether biological or legally adopted.

          2. Current participation in another clinical study that includes exposure to an
             investigational or non-investigational drug or device.

          3. Participation in a clinical study for a condition related to weight or dieting within
             the preceding month.

             compounds.

          5. Any medical condition or laboratory finding that, in the judgment of the
             investigators, could adversely affect safety or study integrity. Examples include but

             from the administration of first dose of study drug.

          7. Past or present diagnosis of any eating disorder, including Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia
             Nervosa, and Eating Disorder NOS (e.g., Binge-Eating Disorder). (Eating-disordered
             individuals probably represent a distinct population and should therefore be studied
             separately.)

          8. Past or present diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or any psychotic
             disorder; past or present diagnosis of dementia or any other disorder that has led to
             a clinically significant cognitive impairment; present diagnosis of any mood or
             anxiety disorder; any other psychiatric condition that presently requires, or in the
             past month has required, pharmacological intervention.

             abnormal screening labs.

         13. Current seizure disorder or a significant history (as judged by the investigators) of
             a seizure disorder, other significant neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson's
             Disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, neurodegenerative disease, cerebral palsy) or
             severe head trauma (including closed head trauma, penetrating head injury, skull
             fracture, or intracranial hemorrhage), or CNS tumor.

         14. Active liver disease or a history of hepatic intolerance to medications that, in the
             investigators' judgment, is medically significant.

         15. History of diabetes mellitus type I and II or gastric bypass or reduction surgery.

             Justification: illnesses that change metabolism or the absorption from the GI tract,

         20. Systemic intake of corticosteroids acutely within 2 weeks or chronically (&gt; 28 days)
