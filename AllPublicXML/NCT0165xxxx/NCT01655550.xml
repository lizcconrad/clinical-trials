  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to demonstrate the non-superiority of oral contrast versus no oral
      contrast in intravenously enhanced CT in the outpatient setting. The investigators want to
      decrease preparation time for the patient and decrease delay in obtaining the study which
      will ultimately lead to faster results and an increased level of patient convenience.

      The investigators hypothesis: Oral contrast does not significantly affect the diagnostic
      confidence of interpreting radiologists in intravenously enhanced abdominal CT scans.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial comparing radiologist confidence when faced
      with an intravenously enhanced study with and without oral contrast. At the time of making
      the appointment, the clerk will ask the patient if he/she wishes to participate in a research
      study about the impact of oral contrast. If the patient assents, he/she will receive a phone
      call from a research assistant to obtain informed consent. The first ten patients to call the
      office to schedule a scan using a 64 slice MDCT will be recruited and randomized if they
      consent.

      Subjects will be randomized at the time of recruitment, which will be when he/she calls to
      make the appointment for the exam, in a 1:1 ratio between the control arm (contrast) and the
      experimental arm (no contrast). The control arm will either pick up their two bottles of oral
      contrast at a radiology office or have the bottles mailed to them as is currently the
      standard. They will drink the oral contrast two hours before the study. They will also ingest
      300 mL of water immediately prior to imaging and be administered the standard intravenous
      contrast dose. The experimental group will not be mailed or given any oral contrast. They
      will arrive at their appointment and ingest 300 mL of water immediately prior to the exam as
      well as the standard intravenous contrast dose and be scanned. This design will eliminate the
      need to repeat scanning patients, thus decreasing radiation dose. A patient satisfaction
      survey will be given to each patient following the exam and handed to the technologist
