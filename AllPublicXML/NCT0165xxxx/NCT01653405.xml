    <textblock>
      Over 100,000 VHA patients receive anticoagulants (blood thinners) each year to prevent blood
      clots (including strokes). Too much anticoagulation increases the risk of serious or even
      fatal bleeding, and too little anticoagulation fails to protect the patient against blood
      clots. VHA anticoagulation clinics vary widely on how much time their patients spend in the
      therapeutic range, the range within which they are protected from clots but not at excessive
      risk of bleeding. Anticoagulation clinics can improve anticoagulation control by following
      several relatively simple procedures, including following-up promptly when patients are out
      of range and focusing on educating and supporting patients with poor control. In this study,
      the investigators will promote these practices at the anticoagulation clinics of the New
      England VA region, with a goal of improving anticoagulation control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Over 100,000 VA patients receive oral anticoagulation (AC) each year to prevent
      blood clots, including strokes. AC is safer and more effective when it is managed skillfully
      and therefore well-controlled. AC control can be measured using percent time in therapeutic
      range (TTR), the proportion of time when patients are sufficiently anticoagulated to prevent
      clots but not excessively anticoagulated (which increases the risk of bleeding). The
      investigators have shown that the anticoagulation clinics (ACCs) of the VA vary widely on
      TTR, from 40% (very poor control) to 70% (excellent control). Improving TTR in the VA would
      prevent thousands of adverse events, including strokes, major hemorrhages, and deaths. The
      investigators have further investigated the structures and processes of care that contribute
      to these wide disparities in TTR performance.

      Objectives: In this proposed study, the investigators will apply proven methods to change
      provider behavior and improve patient adherence and self-management. The goal will be to
      facilitate the adoption of these evidence-based practices in order to improve TTR in VISN 1.
      The investigators will accomplish this through a two-part intervention: 1) A
      clinician-focused intervention will utilize educational outreach, audit and feedback,
      internal facilitation, and external facilitation to promote improvements in four
      evidence-based processes of care. 2) A patient-focused intervention will utilize outreach, a
      group educational seminar, and motivational interviewing to educate patients with poor
      baseline anticoagulation control and promote behavior change.

      Methods: The clinician-focused intervention will use a Dashboard to measure site-level TTR
      and processes of care and an Algorithm for routine AC management. Both the Dashboard and the
      Algorithm are concrete representations of our main evidence-based recommendations to improve
      AC management. The investigators will promote their use through quarterly visits to the
      sites, which will include audit and feedback and educational outreach, and also provide
      external facilitation to address ways to improve these performance measures. The
      patient-level intervention will be delivered to the 25% of VISN patients with low TTR at
      baseline (&lt;50%). ACC staff will identify such patients using the Dashboard, and will send
      them an outreach letter inviting them to attend a brief educational seminar. All intervention
      patients, whether or not they attended the seminar, will receive follow-up management
      including motivational interviewing (MI) to address behavior change. The main outcome for Aim
      1 is change in site TTR over time, which will be compared between VISN 1 and non-VISN 1 sites
      using an interrupted time series. The main outcome for Aim 2 is change in patient-level TTR,
      for which intervention and control patients will be compared using a regression discontinuity
      analysis. Secondary outcomes will include site-level changes in processes of anticoagulation
      care (measured using automated data), costs and cost savings, and sustainability of changes
      over time.

      Anticipated Impact: The goal of this project is to increase TTR in VISN 1 to 75%, far higher
      than any other VISN. Such improvement in TTR is associated with greatly reduced rates of
      adverse events for patients. Improved TTR will save more money than our intervention will
      cost, in large part because of efficiencies of management and less-frequent follow-up for
      better controlled patients. At the conclusion of this regional project, the investigators
      will promote the spread of these interventions throughout the VHA.

    <description>Mean INR value is a proxy measure for the actual target range that was used. If the clinician is truly attempting to achieve an INR of 2.5, then the mean INR should be very close to that over time, although individual values may be higher or lower. A mean INR value below 2.3 or above 2.7 is associated with poor anticoagulation control. We will be measuring the mean INR value at the individual patient and also aggregated at the site level.</description>

    <description>Patients in the bottom 25% of TTR at baseline will receive an outreach message delivered at a routine care visit. The outreach message will inform them that their control is poor and this puts them at risk for bad outcomes. They will be offered an invitation to attend an education session to learn more about how to self-manage warfarin therapy. This session will be delivered by local clinical staff, using materials that we will provide. Finally, we will educate local clinical staff in the use of motivational interviewing (MI) and will provide a manual to help them deliver MI-based care. They will be asked to deliver MI-based care specifically to patients in the intervention group.</description>
