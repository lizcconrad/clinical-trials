      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of treatment with cabergoline, compared
      to treatment with placebo, on cocaine induced craving and subjective effects in
      cocaine-dependent human volunteers.

      Secondary aims are to clarify the genetics of substance abuse, potentially leading to
      improved methods to diagnosis those at risk and to help develop better therapeutic
      interventions and to develop a new saliva-based test for the detection and measurement of
      drugs of abuse. As an additional aim, we will also collect blood samples for analyzing a
      number of genetic polymorphisms.

    <measure>The effects of treatment with cabergoline and cocaine on cardiovascular measures</measure>
    <description>Before and after each cocaine infusion, physiologic responses will be closely monitored using repeated HR, BP, and ECG readings. To evaluate safety, a DSMB will meet annually and following any serious AE to examine data as well as any new published information on cabergoline relevant to the project. The number of AEs (including arrhythmias and ECG changes), changes in BP and HR, and changes in mood and psychiatric symptoms (using the BSI, BDI, POMS, and BPRS) will also be assessed throughout the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effects of treatment with cabergoline and cocaine on cocaine-induced craving and subjective effects</measure>
    <description>The ability of cabergoline, as compared to placebo, to reduce cocaine-induced craving and to reduce reinforcing effects produced by cocaine will be measured by: 1. VAS, Adjective Scales, and MCQ; 2. Choices for cocaine vs. money in the self-administration assay.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be English-speaking volunteers who are not seeking treatment at the time of the study.

          -  Be between 18-55 years of age.

          -  Meet DSM-IV TR criteria for cocaine dependence; participants may or may not meet
             criteria for nicotine dependence. Nicotine dependence is allowed but not required
             because most cocaine users smoke cigarettes.

          -  Have a self-reported history of using cocaine by the smoked or IV route.

          -  Have vital signs as follows: supine blood pressure &gt; 100/65 mm Hg. To ensure that
             subjects will not be at risk from cocaine, the resting pulse must be &lt; 90 bpm and the
             blood pressure must be &lt; 150 mmHg systolic and &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic.

          -  Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal (+/- 10%) limits
             with the following exceptions: a) liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and
             alkaline phosphatase) â‰¤ 3 x the upper limit of normal, and b) kidney function tests
             (creatinine and BUN) within normal limits.

          -  Have a baseline EKG that demonstrates clinically normal sinus rhythm, clinically
             normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias.

          -  Have a medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no clinically
             significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of the
             admitting physician and the principal investigator.

          -  Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test during screening and at followup, on
             day 22.

          -  Provide a negative urine test for cocaine metabolite on Day 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet DSM IV TR criteria for dependence on drugs other than cocaine or nicotine.

          -  Have any history or evidence suggestive of seizure disorder or brain injury.

          -  Have any previous medically adverse reaction to cocaine, including loss of
             consciousness, chest pain, or epileptic seizure.

          -  Have a history of heart valve disease.

          -  Have any evidence from physical exam of heart murmur.

          -  Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as: psychosis, bipolar illness or
             major depression as assessed by MINI; organic brain disease or dementia assessed by
             clinical interview; history of any psychiatric disorder which would require ongoing
             treatment or which would make study compliance difficult; history of suicide attempts
             within the past year and/or current suicidal ideation/plan.

          -  Have evidence of clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined
             by the PI.

          -  Have evidence of untreated or unstable medical illness including: neuroendocrine,
             autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active infectious disease.

          -  Have symptomatic HIV or are taking antiretroviral medication.

          -  Be pregnant or nursing. Other females must either be unable to conceive (i.e.,
             surgically sterilized, sterile, or post-menopausal) or be using a reliable form of
             contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills, intrauterine device, condoms, or
             spermicide). All females must provide negative pregnancy urine tests before study
             entry, upon hospital admission, and at the end of study participation.

          -  Have asthma or currently use theophylline or other sympathomimetics.

          -  Have any other illness, condition, or use of psychotropic medications, which in the
             opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or successful
             completion of the study.

        Criteria for Discontinuation Following Initiation:

          -  Inability to comply with study procedures.

          -  Meet discontinuation criteria due to exaggerated response to cocaine, described below.

          -  Use cocaine prior to randomization.
