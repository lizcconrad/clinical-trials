      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug AT7519M has on mantle cell
      lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because AT7519M has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and
      has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer
      better results than standard treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented mantle cell lymphoma non-refractory to prior therapy.
             Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma should be confirmed by the local institution's
             lymphoma pathologist.

          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of
             disease must be bidimensionally measurable using CT or MRI performed in the 3 weeks
             prior to study enrolment. Bone lesions are not considered to be bidimensionally
             measurable.

          -  Minimum size of at least ONE lesion must be as follows: (must be done within 21 days
             prior to registration)

          -  Lymph nodes (measured by spiral CT scan) &gt; 1.5 cm x or 1.5 cm

        Other non-nodal lesions:

        MRI ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm CT scan ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm Physical exam ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm (e.g. skin lesion,
        nodules)

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (see Appendix II).

          -  Previous Therapy Patients must have received at least one, and up to three prior
             systemic chemotherapy regimens (high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell
             support is permitted but this must be counted as one line of therapy) but must NOT
             have shown disease progression while receiving chemotherapy or within 1 month of last
             dose of most recent therapy (i.e. must be non-refractory).

        Systemic Therapy:

        Patients must be ≥ 4 weeks since last dose of systemic therapy (including investigational).
        As noted, 1-3 previous chemotherapy regimens may have been given. NB: The same chemotherapy
        combination given for first line therapy and second line therapy is considered two
        regimens. Exceptions to the 4-week interval since last treatment are possible if prior
        therapy is non-myelosuppressive or if any treatment-related myelosuppression has resolved.

        Not permitted:

          -  Radioactive Monoclonal Antibody Therapy

          -  Prior treatment with AT7519M or another CDK inhibitor

          -  Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant (Note: autologous stem cell transplant is
             permitted) Prior rituximab or bortezomib treatment is permitted, but they must be
             counted as systemic therapy regimens if given as single agents.

        Radiation:

        Patients may have had radiation, provided a minimum of 21 days has elapsed prior to
        enrollment. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation prior
        to registration.

        Surgery:

        Previous surgery is permitted provided that wound healing has occurred and at least 14 days
        have elapsed if surgery was major.

          -  Laboratory Requirements: (must be done within 7 days prior to registration) Hematology
             Absolute neutrophils (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L Chemistry Serum
             creatinine ≤ UNL Bilirubin ≤ UNL AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x UNL Potassium, calcium, magnesium
             - Within normal limits Creatine Kinase (CK or CPK) ≤ UNL

          -  Patient consent must be obtained according to local Institutional and/or University
             Human Experimentation Committee requirements. The patient must sign the consent form
             prior to registration.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, response assessment and follow-up.

          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working
             days of patient registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma
             skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours
             curatively treated with no evidence of disease for &gt; 5 years.

          -  Patients with known CNS involvement by lymphoma. Tests to investigate CNS involvement
             are required only if clinically indicated (i.e. disease suspected on basis of symptoms
             or other findings).

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to the study drug or its components.

          -  The following are exclusions for enrolment on the study:

                  a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration).

               2. Men and women of childbearing potential who do not agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
                  study entry and for the duration of the study participation. (Should a woman
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant, or should a man father a child, while
                  participating in this study, she/he should inform the treating physician
                  immediately.)

          -  Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed
             according to the protocol, including, but not limited to:

               1. history of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder (e.g. uncontrolled
                  psychotic disorders) which would impair the ability to obtain consent or limit
                  compliance with study requirements;

               2. active uncontrolled or serious infection;

               3. pulmonary disease requiring oxygen;

                  3 months of entry or any cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, increases risk for ventricular arrhythmia.

               2. Any personal history of ventricular arrhythmia, which was symptomatic or required
                  treatment (CTC grade 3). This includes: multifocal PVCs, bigeminy, trigeminy,
                  ventricular tachycardia)

               3. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg or higher or
                  diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg or higher)

               4. A previous history of drug induced significant QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc
                  interval equal to or greater than 500msec) or causing significant ECG
                  abnormalities

               5. Congenital long QT syndrome

               6. QT and QTc, unmeasurable or &gt; 460 msec on screening ECG

               7. Left ventricular ejection fraction of less than the institution's lower limit of
                  normal (LLN) measured by MUGA or echocardiogram

          -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with agents with a known risk of
             Torsades de Pointes. (see http://torsades.org (list #1)). However, patients may be

             dose of AT7519M.
