      The aim of the following study is to identify if cancer patients in pain report unmet
      supportive care needs that are comparable to the general cancer population or if these unmet
      needs are exacerbated depending on whether their pain is controlled, uncontrolled or if the
      patients have intermittent breakthrough pain. 312 cancer patients, who have reported to have
      either controlled, uncontrolled or breakthrough pain, will complete a series of
      questionnaires at two time points. The primary outcome is to determine the prevalence of
      self-perceived unmet supportive care needs, as identified by the Supportive Care Needs Survey
      -Short Form (SCNS-SF), in people who have pain caused by their cancer or cancer treatment.

      Hypothesis- Patients with pain caused by their cancer or cancer treatments will report unmet
      needs, which will increase if their pain is uncontrolled or if they have breakthrough pain.

      Secondary Objectives-

        1. To establish if other confounding factors -such as age, gender, marital status,
           diagnosis, educational level and treatment, are significant predictors in the reporting
           of unmet needs of people with cancer or cancer treatment related pain.

        2. To establish if there are any other symptoms, identified by the Memorial Symptom
           Assessment Scale - Short Form (MSAS-SF), that are significant predictors in the
           reporting of unmet needs of people with cancer or cancer treatment related pain.

        3. To compare the prevalence and severity of self-perceived unmet supportive care needs
           between people who experience controlled pain, uncontrolled pain and breakthrough pain.

        4. To compare the prevalence and severity of unmet supportive care needs of people whose
           pain has become controlled or uncontrolled over a period of four weeks.

        5. To identify if there are any changes in the participants' symptoms, Eastern Cooperative
           Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score or treatment that could contribute to a change
           in the reporting unmet needs between time point one and two.

        6. To establish if there are any characteristics of breakthrough pain, such as the
           frequency or severity of pain episodes, that have an association with prevalence and the
           severity of the unmet supportive care needs reported by patients with breakthrough pain
           caused by their cancer or cancer related treatments. Factors will be identified by the
           Breakthrough pain Assessment Tool (BAT).

      The study will build on a range of qualitative and quantitative literature which has
      identified the unmet supportive care needs of people with cancer. This research has already
      led to the development of several needs assessment tools that have been used clinically or
      for research purposes. This study is not trying to identify new needs, but investigate which
      of the unmet needs that have already been identified, within the literature, apply to cancer
      patients who are in pain. These needs include psychological needs, such as fears about the
      cancer spreading or for loved ones and health information needs.

        Participants will be recruited from patients attending St Luke's Cancer Centre at the Royal
        Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, UK. An audit is already being carried out at the
        centre, to determine the amount of patients who have pain. Patients who have pain who have
        completed the audit and are willing to take part in research will be screened for the
        trial. In order to ensure that sufficient numbers of patients in the trial have controlled
        pain, uncontrolled pain and breakthrough pain, when 104 participants have been recruited
        into one of these specific pain groups then people will no longer be approached who have
        that type of pain.
