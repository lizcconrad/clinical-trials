  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The choice of fluid therapy is controversial in cardiac surgery. Numerous studies have shown
      that colloid is better as compared to crystalloids. Several previous studies have
      demonstrated that Hypertonic Sodium Lactate (HSL) administration during cardiac surgery shows
      a promising effect. This study aims to compare hemodynamic effects and fluid balance of HSL
      with 6% Hydroxy Ethyl Starch (HES).

      The primary objectives of this prospective, randomized and open-label study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Hypertonic Sodium Lactate (HSL) in comparison with
           6% HES to maintain hemodynamic stability in intra CABG patients related to hemodynamic
           status and Body fluid balance.

        -  To assess the safety of HSL in intra CABG patients related to defined laboratory
           parameters clinical adverse events which occur during the trial.

      Subjects meeting enrolment criteria will be randomly assigned to HSL or 6%HES treatment
      groups.

      Assessment of comparability will be done by unpaired student t-test or Chi-Square test or by
      a two-way ANOVA for repeated measures followed by post-hoc analysis when significant
      difference is found within the two groups.

      The hypothesis tested is that HSL is effective in intra CABG surgery patients, requiring less
      volume with better cardiac index, as compared to 6% HES.
