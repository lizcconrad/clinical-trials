  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In areas of Africa where malaria is only a problem during a short rainy season, monthly
      courses of antimalarial drugs can provide very effective prevention of malaria in children.
      This approach, called intermittent preventive treatment in children (IPTc) but now known as
      Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), may also be useful in large areas of Africa where
      malaria is transmitted for longer each year. It is uncertain if IPTc would be effective,
      acceptable to communities or sustainable when delivered over a longer period, but this is an
      important public health question of key interest to policy makers, because in areas with a
      longer transmission season, the burden of malaria is typically higher than in highly seasonal
      areas.

      Another form of prevention that would be operationally easier for African countries to put
      into practice would be to treat malaria patients with long-lasting antimalarials, which
      protect children against further malaria episodes for several weeks. Because malaria
      disproportionately affects certain high risk children more than others, causing repeated
      attacks of fever and leading to severe anaemia, long-acting drugs may be a simple and
      effective way to target limited resources at the individuals who most need protection. This
      may be particularly beneficial where malaria is a seasonal problem, because repeated malaria
      attacks will not only be borne by a few unfortunate children, but will also occur close
      together in time.

      The investigators propose a clinical trial to evaluate these two forms of chemoprevention in
      Kumasi, Ghana, an area with an extended malaria transmission season. Children under 5 years
      of age currently have access to diagnosis and treatment of malaria via by community based
      health workers. Children enrolled in the study will receive either the standard
      community-based diagnosis and treatment, treatment with a longer-acting artemisinin
      combination therapy (ACT), or standard care plus five monthly courses of seasonal malaria
      chemoprevention (SMC) during the peak in transmission.
