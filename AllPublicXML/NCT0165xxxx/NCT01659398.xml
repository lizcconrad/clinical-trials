  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP)
      therapy for 7 consecutive weeks will improve cerebral blood flow and possibly over time
      enhance or slow down breakdown of cognitive function in patients diagnosed with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI).
