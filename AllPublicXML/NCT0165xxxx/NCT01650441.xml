  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of formoterol and
      beclometasone dipropionate in a dry powder inhaler (NEXThaler®) on central and peripheral
      airway dimensions in asthmatic patients. Therefore Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will be
      used. Further more, the effect of this combination therapy on lung function (spirometry,
      resistance and diffusion), the Asthma Control Test (ACT™) and the Asthma Control
      Questionnaire (ACQ) will be assessed and the safety will be evaluated.

    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>The safety of the NEXThaler® device will be monitored for the duration of the study, an expected average of 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>During the study the patient will be told to record each day taken medication and any possible comments on the daily diary cards, starting from visit 1. Further more, the patient will be contacted at least once a month (either by phone or a visit in the hospital.)</description>

    <description>All patients will be treated with the active product. No placebo arm will be used. The active product is a fixed combination containing extra-fine beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fumarate in a new dry powder inhaler device, NEXThaler® (Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy).</description>

    <description>In this trial, patients will take two inhalations of the beclometasone dipropionate 100 µg and formoterol fumarate 6 µg combination therapy (Foster®) using a Dry Powder Inhaler (NEXThaler®) device in the morning and two inhalations in the evening, for a total of 4 inhalations a day (total daily dose: BDP 400 µg / FF 24 µg).</description>

    <intervention_type>Radiation</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>CT thorax</intervention_name>
    <description>CT scan of the thorax will be performed at 2 time points: baseline and after 6 months of treatment.
The CT scan will be performed with low dose radiation using the multi-slice CT scan. Scanning will be performed at Functional Residual Capacity and Total Lung Capacity (2 times 8 sec). The lung volumes will be controlled using adapted spirometry during the CT procedure. The radiation dose will be reduced by reduction of the tube current and voltage. These settings depend on the patients' weight (1mAs/kg). In addition to this there will be an increase in noise factor to further reduce the radiation dose.</description>
