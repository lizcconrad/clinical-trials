    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to identify the percentage of health care workers
      working in an acute care hospital who have high blood pressure, to determine the awareness of
      their blood pressure status, and to see how well it is managed. Study participants will come
      from the following three distinctly different types of departments: telemetry (clinical),
      non-telemetry (clinical), and non-direct patient care staff. All study participants are
      offered educational information surrounding high blood pressure and review the recommendation
      for their primary care engagement. Study participants with high blood pressure will be asked
      to continue in the study for up to 6 months. It is intended that each study participant who
      continues will take their blood pressure three times a day and record the results in a study
      provided diary. Each study participant should also make some of the suggested changes that
      promote a healthier lifestyle including exercising, improving their diet, and seeing their
      primary care provider. It is the thought that these changes will reduce the study
      participant's blood pressure. The secondary purpose is to determine the effect shift work has
      on these hospital employees and the potential positive effects of the three interventions.

    <textblock>
      Research on hypertension (HTN) in hospital personnel during work hours is limited yet
      research has been published on the relationship of job strain and the risk of cardiovascular
      disease. HTN can be caused by sympathoadrenal activation brought on by long-term exposure to
      stressors and an inherent biomarker that is associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease.

      The primary purpose of this study is to quantify differences in HTN prevalence, awareness and
      management in three distinctly different areas and shifts within an acute hospital. Blood
      pressure (BP) will be taken during working hours along with pre and post sleep hours. The
      secondary purpose is to identify the effect of shift work within an acute care hospital and
      effectiveness of: BP monitoring, increases in physical activity, positive nutritional
      changes, and the correlation between a primary care provider visits and lowering BP.
