  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical, randomized, crossover, is to assess the pharmacodynamic
      profile of the drug Heparin Sodium from swine (intravenously), manufactured and marketed by
      Laboratory Blau Farmacêutica S/A, compared to the product of Heparin Sodium ® company APP
      Pharmaceuticals, through the determination of activity of the following markers:

        -  Anti-FXa;

        -  Anti-FIIA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacodynamic profile of the drug will be assessed through:

        -  Reason for Anti-FXa activity / Anti-FIIA;

        -  TFPI activity.

      The aPTT activity marker will be evaluated as an exploratory objective.
