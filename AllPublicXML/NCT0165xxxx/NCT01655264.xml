      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a home-based
      tele-motion-rehabilitation (TMR) program in improving functional status of people who had
      stroke. We hypothesize that the clinical effectiveness within a mock-up set up in the
      hospital of the TMR will be greater in comparison to self-training exercise carried out at
      home in improving outcomes of Range of Motion and functional performance of the weak upper
      extremity.

      Twenty-four subjects who had a stroke, aged between 18 and 80 years, and living at home will
      participate. Subjects will be 2-72 months post stroke, and no longer receiving rehabilitation
      as in or out patient. They will have moderate impairment of the affected upper extremity
      determined by range of motion (ROM). Subjects will be evaluated for motor and cognitive
      abilities for a total of 5-6 hours by a skilled therapist who will be blind to group's
      assignment of the subjects. The evaluations will be repeated 3 times, once before the
      intervention commences, once immediately following the intervention and once four weeks after
      the intervention.

      Subjects will be randomized into the two groups (TMR versus self-training treatment) with
      matching for level of impairment of the upper extremity by a person who is not part of the
      study. Each subject will receive twelve 45-60 min sessions over 4 weeks while seated. The
      control group will receive self-training exercises that are based on conventional therapy
      using principles of motor control and will include training of upper extremity movements in
      order to achieve better use of the affected arm in ADL. The experimental group will receive
      TMR treatment of comparable duration and intensity to those in the conventional treatment
      group with remote online monitoring by the therapist. Treatment feedback will be given in the
      form of Knowledge of results (game scores) and Knowledge of performance (feedback of
      compensatory movements made while using the upper extremity) to enhance motor learning. The
      software will generate a report which will include the duration and type of exercises
      performed by the subject.

      The Gertner TMR system is implemented via Microsoft's Kinect three-dimensional) camera-based
      gesture recognition technology. Using the patient's natural hand and body movements control
      all activity within customized computer games. The system runs off a standard desktop
      computer and is displayed on a large television screen.

      Telerehabilitation refers to the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to
      provide rehabilitation services to people remotely in their homes or other environments. By
      using ICT, patient access to care can be improved and the reach of clinicians can extend
      beyond the physical walls of a traditional healthcare facility, thus expanding continuity of
      care to persons with disabling conditions. Telerehabilitation holds significant potential to
      meet this need and to provide services that are more accessible to more people, while having
      the ability to offer a more affordable enhanced level of care.

      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a home-based
      tele-motion-rehabilitation (TMR) program in improving functional status of people who had
      stroke. We hypothesize that the clinical effectiveness within a mock-up set up in the
      hospital of the TMR will be greater in comparison to self-training exercise carried out at
      home in improving function of the weak upper extremity and performance of Activities of Daily
      Living.

      Twenty-four subjects who had a stroke (as verified via CT or MRI), aged between 18 and 80
      years, and living at home with a caregiver will participate. Subjects will be 2-72 months
      post stroke, and no longer receiving rehabilitation as in or out patient. They will have
      moderate impairment of the affected upper extremity determined by range of motion (ROM);
      shoulder flexion and abduction must be more than 45 degrees with mild to moderate
      compensations; elbow flexion should be about 30 degrees. Measures used to characterize their
      level of ability include: NIH Stroke Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, Sensory evaluation
      (light touch, extinction, stereognosis, proprioception), and the Behavioral Assessment of the
      Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS); these will not be used as study outcome measures.

      The subjects will be evaluated over 2 sessions on different days for a total of 5-6 hours.
      The second session will include the setting of treatment goals for either treatment
      condition. Primary outcome measures will include Range of Motion (ROM) of the shoulder, elbow
      and trunk, the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI), and the Motor Activity Log
      (MAL). Secondary outcome measures will include the Functional Reach Test (FRT) (in sitting
      and standing), the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain
      evaluation, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
      (IADL), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). Responses to the tele game activities will be monitored by
      using the following tool: BORG scale of perceived effort, Short Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ),
      Tele-game scores, and arm and trunk 3-Dimensional kinematics; these will not be used as
      outcome measures.

      Subjects will be randomized into the two groups (12 in tele and 12 in self-training
      treatment) such that the two groups will be matched for level of impairment of the upper
      extremity. Each subject will receive twelve 45-60 min sessions (3 sessions per week for 4
      weeks) of one of two types of treatment while seated. The control group will receive
      self-training exercises that are based on conventional therapy using principles of motor
      control and will include training of upper extremity movements in order to achieve better use
      of the affected arm in ADL. Each subject will receive a list of exercises to be performed in
      his home using a stand-alone poster as targets for the movements. In addition, each subject
      will be asked to write the dates and duration of time he/she did the each exercise. They will
      be in contact with a therapist once a week to monitor the self training program and adjust
      the level of exercise.

      The experimental group will receive tele-rehabilitation treatment of comparable duration and
      intensity to those in the conventional treatment group. However, the treatment will be
      delivered via the Gertner Tele-Motion Rehabilitation system with remote online monitoring by
      the therapist. Treatment feedback will be given in the form of Knowledge of results (game
      scores) and Knowledge of performance (feedback of compensatory movements made while using the
      upper extremity) to enhance motor learning. The software will generate a report which will
      include the duration and type of exercises performed by the subject. If needed, a personal
      attendant may provide physical support in the tele home mock-up room.

      The Gertner Tele-Motion-Rehabilitation system is implemented via Microsoft's Kinect
      three-dimensional) camera-based gesture recognition technology without any additional
      accessories (i.e., with no need for head mounted helmets or gloves). Using the patient's
      natural hand and body movements control all activity within customized computer games. The
      system runs off a standard desktop computer and is displayed on a large television screen.
      The patient may see himself (whole body or hands) within the virtual environment or may only
      see virtual objects that he is manipulating.

      Each subject meeting the inclusion criteria will sign an informed consent. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned into one of two groups by a person who is not part of the study. Each
      subject will be assessed with the outcome tests listed above by a skilled therapist who will
      be blind to group's assignment of the subjects. The evaluations will be repeated 3 times,
      once before the intervention commences, once immediately following the intervention and once
      four weeks after the intervention.

    <description>The MAL is a structured questionnaire designed to assess the self-perceived use of the more- impaired arm after stroke while performing a wide range of basic and instrumental activities of daily life (BADL, IADL). The questionnaire examines both the patient's perception of the Amount of arm Use (AOU) and his/her satisfaction with the Quality of Movement (QOM). High internal consistency (Chronbach's α=0.87-0.95) and discriminative validity was established and it correlates well with other assessments of daily function. It was found to be stable and sensitive to patient responses. High correlation were found between the patient responses and caregiver scale responses (ICC= 0.52, p&lt;0.05). A Pearson's correlation of 0.7 (p&lt;0.5) was found in comparing between the patient responses and accelerometer recordings (Uswatte et al., 2006).</description>
