      Select patients of primary breast cancer whose hormone receptor is positive and accepted
      postoperative adjuvant aromatase inhibitors for endocrine treatment.Treat them with
      zoledronic acid 4mg intravenous infusion every six months until the end of the aromatase
      treatment. Assess the disease-free survival; overall survival; combination of security, as
      well as the situation of bone loss.
