      The mailer will encourage those who are due for mammograms, colonoscopies, blood pressure or
      cholesterol tests to receive the appropriate test. This particular mailer will only be sent
      to Evive clients in need to the test in question. The research will examine differences in
      follow-through on this recommendation among the targeted population over the 3-12 month
      period following the mailing as a function of experimental condition.
