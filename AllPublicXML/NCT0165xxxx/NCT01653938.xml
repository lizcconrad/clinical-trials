      This is a randomized controlled trial of a CPR video decision aid in patients with advanced
      congestive heart failure (CHF).

      Aim 1: To compare the care preferences for CPR and intubation among subjects randomized to
      video and subjects randomized to the current standard of care without the video.

      Hypothesis 1: Subjects randomized to the video intervention will be significantly more likely
      to opt against CPR and intubation compared to those who do not see the video.

      Aim 2: To compare code-status documentation in the electronic medical records between
      subjects randomized to the video and those who are receiving the current standard of care
      without the video.

      Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to the video are more likely to have their code status
      correctly documented in the electronic medical records compared to those who do not see the
      video.

      Aim 3: To compare knowledge and decisional conflict of subjects randomized to video and
      subjects randomized to the current standard of care without the video.

      Hypothesis 3: When compared to subjects randomized to the current standard of care, subjects
      in the video intervention group will have higher knowledge and lower decisional conflict
      (lower decisional conflict scores) when asked to choose CPR and intubation preferences.
