      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Phenazopyridine HCl Tablets,
      USP 200 mg as a short term analgesic treatment of pain upon urination associated with
      Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (uUTI).

      The secondary exploratory objective is to evaluate safety and efficacy of Phenazopyridine HCl
      Tablets, USP 200 mg as a short term analgesic treatment of burning upon urination associated
      with uUTI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will make separate self-assessments for severity of pain and burning upon urination
      using the NRS and self-assessments of their discomfort using the GSAS at designated intervals
      for 24 hours. Subjects will rate the effectiveness of the study medication using the SASMS at
      a designated interval for 24 hours.

             esterase.

          -  Has moderate to severe pain (score of 4 to 10 inclusive on the NRS) and burning (score
             of 4-10, inclusive on the NRS) upon urination.

             scales.

          -  Has serious acute illness (e.g., pneumonia) or an untreated or unstable medical
             illness that would likely interfere with assessments of uUTI.
