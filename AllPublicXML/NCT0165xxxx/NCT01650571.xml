  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, standard wound care practice is suboptimal at assessing wound remodeling and
      bacterial infection in real-time. An alternative and complimentary means of providing
      real-time imaging of connective tissue re-modeling and bacterial infection may greatly
      increase the early detection of infection thus leading to rapid therapeutic intervention. Our
      new device, PRODIGI(TM), images tissue and bacterial autofluorescence (without agents) and
      may provide this clinically-important capability.

      In preliminary preclinical testing, the investigators have discovered that when wounds are
      illuminated by violet/blue light, endogenous collagen in the connective tissue matrix emit a
      characteristic green fluorescent signal, while most pathogenic bacterial species emit a
      unique red fluorescence signal due to the production of endogenous porphyrins. Therefore,
      with autofluorescence imaging, no exogenous contrast agents are needed during imaging, making
      this approach particularly appealing as a diagnostic imaging method for clinical use.

      The investigators hypothesize that real-time imaging of tissue autofluorescence signals
      emanating from endogenous connective tissue (e.g. collagen) and pathogenic bacteria within
      complex wounds can be used to determine healing status (i.e., collagen re-modeling and wound
      closure), detect wound bacterial contamination and/or infection that is occult under standard
      clinical white light evaluation, and guide intervention and wound care.

        20 patients with wounds resulting from general abdominal surgery will be entered into this
        trial, based on statistical power-based calculations for sample size determined in
        collaboration with the UHN Biostatistics Group (assuming one wound per patient).
