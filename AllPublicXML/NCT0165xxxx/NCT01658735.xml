  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this project is to execute a high-quality double-blinded randomized controlled
      clinical trial that compares the H-Wave® device with a commonly used TENS device with a
      sub-therapeutic electrocurrent device. This study will provide a definable level of evidence
      for treatment efficacy, and provide a basis for evidence-based recommendation for or against
      utilization for these two modalities. The results for H-Wave® device, if positive, could
      significantly impact morbidity by providing a non-invasive, non-pharmacologic treatment for
      symptomatic relief, and reduce overall disability and health care costs associated with
      chronic low back pain.

      H-Wave® Device Stimulation (Intervention A) plus usual care, transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS) (Intervention B) plus usual care, and sham electrotherapy plus usual care
      (control). Each treatment arm will have identical participants enrolled (n=38 per arm) of
      with the same number of visits and investigator contact time.

      Eligible participants will be allocated through computerized randomization utilizing a
      stratified permuted-block randomization employing random block sizes. Allocation is
      concealed. Participants and assessors will be blinded. Participants will not be told what
      types of electrotherapy devices are being studied, only that there are different types, and
      that they may be randomized to receive a sham device.

      Patients will be instructed on the use of the device they received to perform daily home
      therapy. Subjects will be assessed at week 1, 4, 8 and 12 for the primary and secondary
      outcomes measures. Compliance to treatment will be measured through an electronic meter on
      each of the devices, as well as by patient diary. Patients will be allowed to receive usual
      care from their own health care provider, with the exception of invasive procedures or
      surgery. Results will be analyzed by intention to treat methods.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Oswestry Disability Index at 1 Week</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of the change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) after one week of treatment compared with baseline measure.
The ODI is a commonly used outcome-measure questionnaire for low back pain. It is a self-administered questionnaire divided into ten sections designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section is scored on a 0-5 scale, 5 representing the greatest disability. The index is calculated by dividing the summed score by the total possible score, which is then multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage, with a possible range of 0 to 100. Higher scores represent higher reported disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Oswestry Disability Index at 1 Week</title>
        <description>Measure of the change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) after one week of treatment compared with baseline measure.
The ODI is a commonly used outcome-measure questionnaire for low back pain. It is a self-administered questionnaire divided into ten sections designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section is scored on a 0–5 scale, 5 representing the greatest disability. The index is calculated by dividing the summed score by the total possible score, which is then multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage, with a possible range of 0 to 100. Higher scores represent higher reported disability.</description>

          <description>Measure of the change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) after one week of treatment compared with baseline measure.
The ODI is a commonly used outcome-measure questionnaire for low back pain. It is a self-administered questionnaire divided into ten sections designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section is scored on a 0–5 scale, 5 representing the greatest disability. The index is calculated by dividing the summed score by the total possible score, which is then multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage, with a possible range of 0 to 100. Higher scores represent higher reported disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in VAS Pain Score at 8 Weeks</title>
        <description>Measure of the change in visual analogue scale (VAS) after eight weeks of treatment compared with baseline VAS measure.
The VAS is a commonly used continuous scale measure for low back pain. For pain intensity, the scale is anchored by “no pain” (score of 0) and “pain as bad as it could be” or “worst imaginable pain” (score of 10). Higher scores represent higher reported pain.</description>
