  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of repeated daily administration of
      rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) of abiraterone
      following single-dose administration of abiraterone acetate tablets in healthy male
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center
      (study conducted at one site), 2-period, sequential-design (studies that combine both
      longitudinal and cross sectional methods), to evaluate the effects of rifampicin on the
      pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate in healthy male participants. The study consists of a
      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and a follow up phase. The screening phase
      will be within 14 days before the first study medication administration. The treatment phase
      will consist of 2 treatment periods, Period 1: a single oral dose of abiraterone acetate
      tablets, and Period 2: a daily oral dose of rifampicin capsules alongwith a single oral dose
      of abiraterone acetate tablets. The 2 periods will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 7 days. Blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic assessments will be done for
      determination of abiraterone and rifampicin concentrations. The follow up phase will be of 14
      days. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram,
      vital signs, and physical examinations will be monitored throughout the study. The total
      study duration will be approximately 31 days.
