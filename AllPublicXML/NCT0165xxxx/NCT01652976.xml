  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the study drug, dasatinib, given in
      combination with 5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) will work against
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Dasatinib is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for treating chronic
      myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, however it is not currently approved
      for use in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      Systemic control of pancreatic cancer remains a clinical unmet need. The recent superiority
      of 5-FU based combination therapies over the historical standard gemcitabine represents an
      opportunity to develop novel combinations of synergistic and effective cytotoxic and biologic
      targeted therapies. Src excess activity has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer and is
      implicated in the invasive and metastatic phenotype clearly represented by this disease.
      Inhibition of Src activity is associated with numerous biologic modifications capable of
      positively modifying this phenotype and appears to have synergy with restoring inherent
      chemosensitivity. The addition of dasatinib to FOLFOX (FOLFOX-D) represents a novel
      therapeutic regimen in pancreatic cancer with safety and pharmacokinetic data already having
      been established in colorectal cancer. This protocol will test the safety and activity of
      this combination in pancreatic cancer where current clinical outcomes remain far from
      optimal.
