  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to see if lymphocytes can be collected from patients with
      high grade gliomas before they start standard radiation and chemotherapy. (Lymphocytes are
      cells that normally circulate in the blood and are an essential part of the immune system).
      The investigators goal is to store these and give them back to the patient after radiation is
      completed. This is part of a larger effort that will attempt to preserve the immune system
      from the effects of radiation and chemotherapy.

      The patients blood will be collected (apheresis) before starting the patients planned
      standard of care radiation therapy and chemotherapy:

        -  An IV will be inserted into the vein in the patients arm.

        -  The blood will be sent to a machine that removes the lymphocytes and returns the rest to
           the patient.

        -  This procedure will last from 1 hour and 15 minutes to 4 hours.

        -  During this time the patient will also be treated with a blood thinner to prevent the
           blood from clotting in the machine.

        -  The lymphocytes will be counted and stored. If an insufficient number were collected, we
           will ask for another similar collection in about 1 week.

        -  After the patient has completed the full 6 weeks of radiation, all of the lymphocytes
           will be returned to the patient through a simple intravenous infusion. A larger
           intravenous access (i.e. midline) might be needed. Any cells that are not reinfused will
           be stored for 1 year and then discarded.

        -  Study bloods (10 ml) will be collected at the time of lymphocyte collection, prior
           lymphocyte reinfusion, and then every 2 weeks until week 20th. These blood samples will
           be stored and used for future analysis.

      Blood counts are obtained weekly as part of standard care for patients with this kind of
      brain tumor. For the first 14 weeks after the lymphocyte reinfusion we will be doing some
      extra tests on the routinely collected blood to see how the effective the reinfused
      lymphocytes are in raising the patients lymphocyte counts. These results will be available to
      the patients treating physician.

      At no time will this study interfere with the patients planned standard of care radiation and
      chemotherapy.
