    <textblock>
      The Preventure Program is the first and only school-based alcohol and drug prevention program
      that has been shown to prevent onset and growth in alcohol and substance misuse in British
      and Canadian youth. Unlike universal programs that tend to promote generic coping skills and
      balance normative attitudes around substance use, this selected personality-targeted approach
      is based on a psychosocial model and validated by Dr Patricia Conrod and targets four
      personality-specific motivational pathways to substance misuse: Hopelessness, Anxiety
      Sensitivity, Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking, each associated with different motives for
      substance use, drug use profiles and patterns of non-addictive psychopathology.

      As a primary goal of the Coventure project, the investigators propose a long-term trial of
      this intervention strategy to examine how this evidence-based intervention can reduce onset
      of substance use disorders in young people and related secondary mental health, academic and
      cognitive outcomes.

      As a secondary goal, the investigators propose to use sensitive neuropsychological measures
      to examine how this evidence-based intervention can positively impact on cognitive
      development over the course of adolescence, to tease apart some of the mechanisms involved in
      the causal pathway from early onset substance use to poor cognitive development and long-term
      addiction outcomes.

      This is a cluster randomized design in which 31 high schools across Montreal, Canada will be
      randomly assigned to receive training and to deliver the program to two cohorts of Grade 7
      students or to be trained and assisted in delivering the program to future Grade 7 cohorts.
      Assessment of participating students will occur annually from September to May until the end
      of high school year. Students will be assessed on personality, substance use, mental health
      and cognitive measures.

      The program involves delivering specialized coping skills group workshops to students when
      they are in the 7th or 8th grade. About 45% of students in a given grade will be invited to
      participate in the workshops.

      The workshops will focus on motivating children to understand how their personality style
      leads to certain emotional and behavioural reactions. They will be guided in learning
      cognitive behavioural skills on how to channel their strengths towards their long-term goals.
      Four different workshops will be run, focusing either on managing impulsivity, sensation
      seeking, anxiety sensitivity or negative thinking.

      The students will first be asked to participate in a 45-60 minutes survey asking them about
      their personality, their strength and weaknesses, their risk-taking behaviour and their
      learning style.

      Then, if their school has been trained to deliver the program, they might be invited to
      participate in two 90-minute workshops, delivered at school during class time or lunch hour.
      All children who agree to participate in the study will be invited to complete the same
      survey in each subsequent academic year for the next four years.

      Primary outcomes:

        1. Short-term: delayed onset of alcohol and substance use (up to two years post
           intervention)

        2. Long-term: prevention of onset of substance use disorder (at 5th year follow-up).

      Secondary intermediate outcomes are neuropsychological functions, for which two hypotheses
      will be investigated regarding the possible effects of delaying early substance use:

        1. Global Effects Hypothesis: substance use and binge drinking will have global harmful
           effects on cognition and interventions that successfully prevent substance use onset
           will result in global improvements in cognitive function in participants who received
           the intervention relative to those randomized to control condition.

        2. Critical Developmental Period Hypothesis: the toxic effects of alcohol and drug use are
           developmentally specific, so effects of interventions will be observed on cognitive
           processes that are maturing in adolescence, namely, executive functions and reward
           sensitivity, after controlling for general intelligence quotient (IQ) and memory
           function following procedure described by Séguin, et al (2004).

      Secondary outcomes will be measures of poor mental health and functional cognitive measures
      such as academic achievement and school drop-out.

    <description>The 'Detection of alcohol and drug problems in adolescents' questionnaire (DEP-ADO) is a self-report alcohol and illicit drug use measure in high-risk youth, including onset of drinking, binge drinking and illicit drug use. This tool has demonstrated good construct validity, internal consistency, test-retest and intermodal execution reliability in Quebec youth.</description>

    <description>1. A computerised adaptation of the Cultures Figure Task (CFT) is used to measure fluid intelligence. This task is based on two of the sections from Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test: the linear pattern completion and matrix reasoning.
ii. A computerised task based on the 'Dot Location' test, a subtest of the Child Memory Scales (CMS) is used to assess spatial memory. In this task, eight dots of the same colour are presented on a grid.</description>

    <description>The interventions are conducted using manuals which incorporate psycho-educational, motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive-behavioural (CBT) components, and include real life 'scenarios' shared by local youth in with similar personality profiles. In the first session, participants are guided in a goal-setting exercise, designed to enhance motivation to change behaviour. Psycho-educational strategies are then used to teach participants about the target personality variable and associated problematic coping behaviours like avoidance, interpersonal dependence, aggression, risky behaviours and substance misuse.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Public or private high school

          -  Must have a Grade 7 cohort of at least 100 youth (up to 200), providing access to
             45-90 high risk students per school Selection of high risk youth: Inclusion criteria
             for students are that they be enrolled in Grade 7 and that they have provided active
             assent and passive parental consent to participate in the longitudinal survey and
             randomised trial phases of this study. Participants who score 1 standard deviation
             above the school mean on one of four subscales of the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale
             will be selected to participate in the intervention groups, but all students will be
             followed on outcomes. There are no other exclusion criteria for participants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Schools cannot be classified as having a majority of their students coded as special
             needs students, because these schools are smaller and the intervention protocol would
             have to be tailored for their particular needs
