  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is uncertainty about whether a live attenuated vaccine (LAIV) offers additional benefit
      over inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in providing indirect benefit to those who
      are unvaccinated through herd immunity. The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to
      determine whether immunizing children in Hutterite colonies with LAIV can provide increased
      community-wide protection over TIV. Children aged 3 to 15 years in Hutterite colonies from
      Alberta and Saskatchewan will be randomized to one of two regimens: TIV or LAIV. The primary
      outcome of this study will be laboratory-confirmed influenza as detected by PCR in all
      participants (i.e vaccine recipients and nonrecipients). Secondary outcomes will include
      influenza-like illness, hospitalization, pneumonia, death, antibiotic use, absenteeism.

      The goal of this study is to test whether immunizing children in Hutterite colonies with LAIV
      can significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in the entire community compared to
      TIV. We hypothesize that ≥70% uptake of LAIV compared to a similar uptake of TIV among
      healthy children and adolescents will reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in LAIV colonies
      by 50% compared to TIV colonies. Other specific objectives are to determine if LAIV reduces
      influenza in the healthy children and adolescents immunized and if LAIV reduces the following
      relative to TIV in all participants: influenza-like illness, antimicrobial prescriptions,
      physician-diagnosed otitis media, school or work-related absenteeism, physician visits for
      respiratory illness, lower respiratory infection, pneumonia, hospitalizations, and death. We
      will assess reactogenicity in both study groups.
