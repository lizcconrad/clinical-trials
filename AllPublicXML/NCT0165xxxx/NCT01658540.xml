      The primary purpose of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of the Drug Eluting
      Balloon (DEB) technology for the treatment of the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) ischemic
      obstructive vascular disease in patients presenting with long lesions. As secondary aim this
      study is going to explore treatment effect on a number of procedural and clinical endpoints
      in order to collect information to design a future comparative effectiveness study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at collecting preliminary safety and efficacy data related to the use of
      Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) technology for the treatment of symptomatic Superficial Femoral
      Artery (SFA) ischemic vascular disease in patients presenting with long lesions.

      The present clinical evaluation is intended as a prospective observational data collection of
      patient treatment in full accordance with institution standard practice and utilizing an
      approved (CE marked) DEB currently available on the market.

    <description>Primary patency is defined as freedom from the combined endpoints of clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) and &gt;50% restenosis in the treated lesion. Clinically driven TLR is defined as any re-intervention within the target lesion due to symptoms or drop of ABI of ≥20% or &gt;0.15 when compared to post-procedure. Restenosis &gt; 50% is defined by a peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) &gt; 2.4.</description>
