    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the association between VEGF gene
      polymorphism and the response to intravitreal drugs in neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration. This is a retrospective review of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 at the
      Institute of Vision, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
