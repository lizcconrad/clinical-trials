    <textblock>
      Pharmacological interventions to aid behavior management's techniques are commonly used in
      pediatric dentistry. The aim of the medicaments is to control behavior and allow safe
      completion of a dental procedure. Homeopathic remedy is safe and can be effective to control
      behavior and decrease anxiety in children during dental treatment.

      Aim: 1. To explore the efficacy of homeopathic drugs in decreasing children's dental anxiety
      before dental treatment.

      2. To assess the effectiveness of homeopathic remedy in facilitating dental treatment for
      anxious children.

      Methods: prospective, double-blind study. Thirty healthy children (5-12 years-old) will
      receive homeopathic remedy\placebo before dental treatment. Anxiety reduction will be
      measured using: saliva cortisol levels, saliva α-amylase levels, facial image scale (FIS),
      and Houpt behavior scale.

      Expected results: the homeopathic remedy will reduce anxiety and increase child cooperation
      during dental treatment.

    <description>The homeopathic remedy will reduce anxiety and increase child cooperation during dental treatment. Studies demonstrated elevation of salivary cortisol and salivary α-amylase levels before the dental treatment, and lower levels after the dental treatment in children and adults. The average level of salivary α-amylase activity in healthy children was about 41.1% lower after dental treatment (39.27U/ml), compared to levels found before treatment (66.65 U/ml).Cortisol level after dental treatment was 0.66 mg/dl, compared to 0.74 mg/dl that was measured before treatment.</description>
