    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the correlation between the efficacy and
      toxicity of S-1 on gastric cancers and the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS),
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase(OPRT).

      TS, DPD and OPRT are the key enzymes on the metabolic pathway of 5-Fu. We will
      retrospectively analyze the clinicopathological features of the patients who have suffered an
      inoperative or recurrent gastric cancers and administrated with S-1, such as the overall
      survival (OS), progressive-free survival (PFS), Lauren's classification and toxicity of S1,
      etc. We will divide the patients into several subgroups according to the parameters above,
      and then investigate the correlation between the parameters and the expression of TS, DPD and
      OPRT.

      All of the analysis is retrospective, there is no different treatment operation once the
      subject enrolled in this study.
