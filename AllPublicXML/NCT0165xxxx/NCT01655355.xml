    <textblock>
      Between the years 1999-2011 70 patients went through a revision of the hip joint(revision
      after not successful Total or Partial Hip Replacement). During the revision the Acetabular
      implant was found to be stable and it was decided not to replace it. The polyethylene insert
      was replaced and was fixated using a cement. Our purpose is to evaluate the physical
      condition of these patients.
