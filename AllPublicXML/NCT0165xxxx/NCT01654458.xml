  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of sexual and body image problems among women treated for
      gynecologic cancer, which can lead to considerable distress. Given the sensitive and highly
      personal nature of these problems, women are often reluctant to speak to their doctors about
      these concerns and have few resources for support and information. The research team will
      conduct a prospective randomized controlled trail (RCT) to test the benefits of &quot;GyneGals,&quot; a
      12-week online (i.e. Internet-based) support group intervention for women who are sexually
      distressed due to gynecologic cancer and its treatment.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a professionally-facilitated,
      information-rich, online support group is beneficial for women who are sexually distressed
      due to gynecologic cancer and the side effects of treatment.
