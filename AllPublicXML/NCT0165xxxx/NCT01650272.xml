  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      5% Minoxidil lotion was approved for using to stimulate hair growth in male androgenetic
      alopecia by US FDA science 1988. The mechanism of action still unclear. In general the 5%
      Minoxidil in solution is the first choice preparation for treatment, therefore allergic
      contact dermatitis to solution was report up to 5.7% (Ebner H. et al,1995). Propylene glycol
      which is the main solvent of these solution, was the main responsible to allergic contact
      dermatitis with positive patch test up to 81.8% (Friedman ES. et al. 2002) One of the
      alternative solution using butylene glycol as the solvent was invented to solve the problem.
      In Siriraj hospital the investigators using this new solvent and made our in house product
      called 5% Minoxidil milky lotion. However the efficacy and safety of the new solution have
      not been investigated. This study is conducted to evaluated efficacy and safety of 5%
      Minoxidil milky lotion compare with the classic solution in male androgenetic alopecia.
