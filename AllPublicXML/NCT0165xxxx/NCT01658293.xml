  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensory and/or motor deficits in upper limb following stroke often have negative impacts on
      their daily living. Thermal stimulation with hot and cold pack alternatively incorporated
      into conventional rehabilitation has been reported and proved to be effective for upper limb
      functional recovery after stroke. However, whether hot- and cold-water stimulation
      alternatively based on thermal stimulation also has the effect still remains unknown. The aim
      of present study is to investigate the facilitated effect of hot and cold water stimulation
      alternatively on upper limb after stroke.

      Stroke patients from department of rehabilitation in Tzu Chi general hospital will be
      recruited and randomized into two groups, one for experimental group and the other for
      control group. In addition to receiving routine standard rehabilitation for both groups, the
      experimental group will receive additional hot- and cold-water stimulation alternatively for
      five times one session, consecutive four sessions a set, one set for 30 minutes a day and
      five sets a week for six weeks. The control group will be given ergometer exercises with the
      similar duration as experimental group. Both groups will be evaluated at baseline before TS
      and every two weeks till six weeks after TS, then at 3, 6 and 12 months for follow-up. A
      variety of evaluations used in the present study include Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for
      sensory functions; Brunnstrom's stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale and Motricity Index were
      used for upper limb motor control and strength; Box and block test for hand dexterity. The
      modified Motor Assessment Scale and Barthel Index are utilized for evaluating general motor
      functions and daily activity performance, respectively. The modified Ashworth scale is used
      for change of muscle tone of upper limb.
