    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in
      healthy adult subjects of an investigational vaccine being developed for the prevention of
      pandemic influenza. The vaccine, identified as H5-VLP + GLA-AF, consists of a recombinant
      influenza virus H5 protein (hemagglutinin from A/Indonesia/5/2005) produced in a plant-based
      expression system assembling into virus-like particles together with the adjuvant GLA-AF.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 18 to 49 years of age.

          -  Must be in good general health as confirmed by a medical history and physical exam,
             vital signs, and screening laboratories conducted no more than 30 days prior to study
             injection administration.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential, regardless of birth control history, must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, a negative urine pregnancy test on
             the day of each study injection, must not be breast-feeding or lactating, and are
             required to consistently use one of the following methods of contraception through the
             first three months of the study: hormonal (e.g. oral, transdermal, intravaginal,
             implant, or injection); double barrier (i.e., condom, diaphragm with spermicide);
             intrauterine device (IUD) or system (IUS); vasectomized partner (6 months minimum);
             abstinence (as confirmed by the investigator); or bilateral tubal ligation (if no
             conception post-procedure). These precautions are necessary due to unknown effects
             that H5-VLP + GLA AF or H5-VLP alone might have in a fetus or newborn infant. The
             subject must have no plan to become pregnant during the first three months of the
             study period. Females who are post-menopausal (no spotting at all) for at least one
             (1) year will not require a pregnancy test.

          -  The following screening laboratory blood tests must have values within the normal
             ranges (as provided by each clinical site) or not clinically significant as determined
             by the Principal Investigator (or designated sub-investigator) and Medical Monitor
             (all test results must be within 30 days prior to first study injection): sodium,
             potassium, BUN, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, fasting
             glucose, fasting lipid panel, total WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.

          -  The following serology tests must be negative: HIV 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.

          -  Negative urine test for recreational drugs and alcohol per Clinical Research Unit
             standards.

          -  Urinalysis not clinically significant as determined by the study clinician.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, must show comprehension of the study requirements,
             competence and willingness to provide written, informed consent for participation
             after reading the informed consent form. The subject must have adequate opportunity to
             discuss the study with an Investigator or qualified designee.

          -  Must be capable of completing a study memory aid in English.

          -  Must be able and willing to attend all evaluation visits, be reachable by telephone on
             a consistent basis by the study site personnel, and have a permanent address.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous exposure to H5N1 vaccines or experimental products containing GLA-AF.

          -  History of allergy to any of the constituents of H5-VLP (H5N1) + Alhydrogel (aluminum
             hydroxide) vaccine.

          -  Participation in another experimental protocol or receipt of any investigational or
             non-registered products within the past 3 months or planned use during the study
             period. Subjects may not participate in any other drug study while participating in
             this study.

          -  Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., oral or injected steroids, such as
             prednisone; high dose inhaled steroids) or cytotoxic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy
             drugs or radiation) within the past 6 months.

          -  Received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulin within the past 3 months.

          -  Donated blood products (platelets, whole blood, plasma, etc.) within past 1 month.

          -  Poor venous access.

          -  Administration of any vaccine (including any other influenza vaccine) within a 30 day
             period prior to study enrollment, or planned administration of any vaccines within the
             period from the first study injection up to blood sampling at Day 42 or within 30 days
             prior to blood sampling at Day 189. Immunization on an emergency basis of a tetanus
             and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed for adult use (Td) will be allowed provided the
             vaccine is not administered within two weeks prior to study injection administration.
             Receipt of any other emergency immunizations (e.g. rabies) will result in a
             case-by-case review of continued participation.

          -  History of autoimmune disease or other causes of immunosuppressive states.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including
             history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or presence of
             lymphoproliferative disease.

          -  History or evidence of any acute or chronic illness (including cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, neurological, hepatic, rheumatic, hematological, metabolic, or renal
             disorders, controlled hypertension), or use of medication that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator (or designated sub-investigator), may interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine.

          -  Cancer or treatment for cancer within 3 years of study injection administration.
             Persons with a history of cancer who are disease-free without treatment for 3 years or
             more are eligible. Persons with treated and uncomplicated basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin are eligible.

          -  Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric
             illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:

               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study
                  vaccine administration

               -  Requiring a change in medication dosage in one month prior to test article
                  administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage
                  adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable), or

               -  Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse event
                  within one month prior to test article administration

          -  Rash, tattoos or any other dermatological condition that could adversely affect the
             vaccine injection site or interfere with its evaluation.

          -  BMI &lt;18 or &gt;30 kg/m2.

          -  Hypertension (systolic ≥150 mmHg or diastolic ≥90 mmHg).

          -  Resting pulse rate &lt;40 bpm or &gt;100 bpm.

          -  Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would
             render the subject incompetent to provide informed consent or unable to provide valid
             safety observations and reporting.

          -  Known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months.

          -  Chronic smoker (&gt; 20 pack years).

          -  History of allergy to tobacco or eggs.
