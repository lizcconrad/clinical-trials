      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the ophthalmic solution
      PRO-118 compared with olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in allergic
      conjunctivitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic conjunctivitis is inflammation of the tissue lining the eyelids (conjunctiva) due to
      a reaction from allergy-causing substances. The main aim in allergic conjunctivitis is to
      improve the quality of life in these patients. Antihistaminic medication is commonly used to
      treat allergic conjunctivitis symptoms. The aim of the study is to compare the clinical
      efficacy of two ophthalmic solutions containing each one an antihistaminic drug.

      A phase III randomized double-blind clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate efficacy of
      the ophthalmic solution PRO-118 compared with olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution
      in allergic conjunctivitis. Patients will be randomized to receive one of the treatments for
      21 days. Efficacy endpoints will be measured at baseline and at 21 days after treatment.
