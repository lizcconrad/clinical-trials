  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether or not a new type of software is, or is not, of benefit.
      The software, ClearRead Confirm, is designed to enhance the ability of radiologists to detect
      tubes, lines and wires that may be placed within a patients chest. These types of devices are
      commonly used for very sick patients in intensive care units and are also used following
      surgery and in the treatment of cancer. This study will test radiologist's detection of the
      tips of these devices comparing the results with standard chest radiographs and the the
      modified chest radiographs. The primary interest is in the time used to interpret the
      radiograph. We will determine if there is any change in accuracy of detection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hypothesis: the amount of time used for the interpretation of these radiographs will
      not change. (null hypothesis)

      Secondary hypothesis: there will be no change in the accuracy of the detection of the tips of
      venous catheters and tubes transiting the esophagus. (null hypothesis)

    <description>Following the viewing of the test radiographs, the radiologists were asked a series of questions of overall preference. On this scale, 1 indicates strong disagreement, 5 indicates strongly agree. Ten statements were used. Note that a low value for the standard image is equivalent to a high value for the modified image.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Ten Board Certified radiologists practicing in community (non-university) practice were recruited from the Washington, DC, - Baltimore, MD, Metropolitan region. Recruitment was by email and phone calls to prior participants in our studies and to other radiologists that they referred us to. Recruitment April, 2012 through September, 2012</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>54 cases were used to train the radiologists on the use of the data recording computer and to make them familiar with the appearance of the processed chest radiographs. These cases were not used in the test of reader performance.</pre_assignment_details>

Measure is the distance from the median location determined by five experts in chest radiology.</description>

        <description>Following the viewing of the test radiographs, the radiologists were asked a series of questions of overall preference. On this scale, 1 indicates strong disagreement, 5 indicates strongly agree. Ten statements were used.
