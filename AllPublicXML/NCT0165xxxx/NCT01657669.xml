    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to evaluate 2.0 mg intravitreal aflibercept injection
      administered in subject who have active choroidal neovascularization due to Age Related
      Macular Degeneration (AMD).

    <textblock>
      Twenty (20) consented participant who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled to be
      followed for 48 weeks. All subjects will receive 2.0 mg intravitreal aflibercept injections
      with three initial monthly doses, and mandatory doses at Weeks 16, 24, 32, and 40. Dosing at
      monthly intervals is allowed if needed in the opinion of the investigator based on presence
      of fluid on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and/or a decrease in visual acuity of greater
      than or equal to 5 letters from the best previous visit. Only one eye will be enrolled in the
      study.
