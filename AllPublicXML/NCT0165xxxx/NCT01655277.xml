  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective was to determine if an ultrasound guided ACB can preserve quadriceps strength,
      thus minimizing weakness of knee extension compared with ultrasound guided femoral nerve
      block. Our primary outcome was the percent of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)
      of knee extension preserved at 30 mins after either an ACB or FNB. Secondary outcomes
      included MVIC of knee extension at 60 min, hip adduction at 30 and 60 mins, and assessment of
      fall risk with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) at 30 minutes.
