    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the effect of YM150 and to compare gender and ethnic
      differences in healthy Caucasian and Japanese male and female subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each dose group consists of a cohort of 8 Caucasian and 8 Japanese male subjects to be
      randomized such that 6 subjects of each race receive active treatment and 2 subjects of each
      race receive matching placebo. The highest tolerated dose is repeated with a cohort of 8
      Caucasian and 8 Japanese female subjects, unless emerging safety and PK information justifies
      higher dose levels or require additional female dose groups.

      Each subject is administered a single dose YM150 or placebo on Day 1 followed by multiple
      doses of YM150 or placebo once daily on Days 3 to 9.
