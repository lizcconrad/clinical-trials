      The main purpose of this phase III clinical trial was to compare intra-individually the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing versus
      non-adhesive wound dressing only in accelerating the wound healing of Split-Thickness Skin
      Graft (STSG) donor sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oleogel-S10 has shown efficacy and was well tolerated in previous clinical trials in
      participants with skin lesions. Especially the results in a previous study with STSG donor
      sites suggested that Oleogel-S10 should be efficacious and safe in the treatment of
      superficial wounds.

      The present phase III clinical trial in STSG donor sites was initiated to demonstrate wound
      healing progress, i.e., the time to healing and the grade of epithelialization of the wound.

      In this study, STSG donor sites were separated into 2 wound halves. Randomly assigned, 1
      wound half was treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing, the other wound half
      with non-adhesive wound dressing only (standard of care).

      Wound healing progress was documented by photos which were assessed by expert reviewers blind
      to the treatment of the wound halves.

    <measure>Intra-individual Difference in Time to Wound Closure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves, either treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing or treated with non-adhesive wound dressing only. Independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological series of cropped and coded photographs by wound half that were taken before start of treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment. Difference in time to wound closure was calculated for every individual participant as [time taken for wound half treated with Oleogel-S10 to close] - [time taken for wound half treated with non-adhesive wound dressing to close], i.e., results below 0 indicate earlier wound closure of Oleogel-S10 treatment. The overall mean difference in time to wound closure was calculated based on all mean differences in time to wound closure of individual participants. Hence, primary outcome data derived from mean difference in time to wound closure by participant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time From Surgery Until Wound Closure is Achieved</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time from surgery until wound closure is achieved, separately for wound halves treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing vs. non-adhesive wound dressing only. While outcome measure 1 (intra-individual difference in time to wound closure) was calculated based on mean intra-individual difference in time to wound closure in 107 participants with missing values replaced by a value of 0, for outcome measure 2 missing values were not replaced. For 5 of the 107 wounds data were missing, thus the reported values are calculated from 102 STSG donor site wound halves by intervention (Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing vs. non-adhesive wound dressing only).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study participants were enrolled from 03 Aug 2012 to 01 Aug 2013 in 18 clinical centers in 6 countries: Germany (8 centers), Czech Republic (2 centers), Poland (1 center), Finland (1 center), Austria (2 centers), and Bulgaria (4 centers).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>111 participants were screened and wound halves of 107 participants were randomized and treated. For four screened participants, wound halves were neither randomized nor treated with study medication for the following reasons: not randomized by mistake, violation of inclusion criteria, surgery cancelled, and withdrawal of consent.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Intraindividual comparison: A split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site wound ≥15 cm² in size was divided in 2 halves. One wound half was randomized to Oleogel-S10 treatment and non-adhesive wound dressing, the other half to non-adhesive wound dressing (intra-individual comparison). Non-adhesive wound dressings such as soft silicone-faced polyurethane foam dressings (e.g., Mepilex®) represent standard of care (SOC) in the treatment of STSG donor site wounds. Oleogel-S10 was administered at a thickness of approximately 1 mm or 0.04 inches. Treatment was repeated and wound dressings were changed at least every 3 to 4 days until wound closure (at least 95% epithelialisation) was achieved or the end of treatment was reached at Day 28.</description>

        <description>Intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves, either treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing or treated with non-adhesive wound dressing only. Independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological series of cropped and coded photographs by wound half that were taken before start of treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment. Difference in time to wound closure was calculated for every individual participant as [time taken for wound half treated with Oleogel-S10 to close] - [time taken for wound half treated with non-adhesive wound dressing to close], i.e., results below 0 indicate earlier wound closure of Oleogel-S10 treatment. The overall mean difference in time to wound closure was calculated based on all mean differences in time to wound closure of individual participants. Hence, primary outcome data derived from mean difference in time to wound closure by participant.</description>
