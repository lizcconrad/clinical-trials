          4. Patient has received 3 or more different prior chemotherapies for the treatment of
             pancreatic cancer

          5. Any significant change in treatment within the 14 days before screening or an
             un-stable medical condition that may affect patient participation or evaluation in the
             study.

          6. Concurrent use of any other investigational product or within 28 days before study
             entry.
