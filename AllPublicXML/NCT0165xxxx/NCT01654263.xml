      The proposed phase IIb randomized, open label, dose ranging, safety and immunogenicity study
      will evaluate two different doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in two
      groups of participants (55 through 74 years of age). First group vaccine naïve participants
      will be open-label to receive a single injection of 0.5 mL PCV13. Second group of participant
      previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive two injections of 0.5 mL PCV13, one dose in each arm (Group IIA or
      Group IIB). Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, at one month and six months
      post-vaccination. The primary objectives are: to determine if two 0.5 mL doses of PCV13 are
      statistically significantly more immunogenic than a single 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 for at least
      some of the vaccine serotypes among participants 55 through 74 years of age previously
      vaccinated with PPSV23, as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 28 days after study

    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIb open-label immunogenicity and safety study to evaluate dosages of 0.5 mL
      and 1.0 mL (given as two 0.5 mL injections in separate arms) of PCV13 in adults 55 through 74
      years of age previously vaccinated with PPSV23. The study will enroll two groups of
      participants. Group I participants will all receive an open-label dose of 0.5 mL PCV13 and
      will include 294 adults 55-74 years of age who have not previously received 23-valent
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Group II will be randomized 1:1 to receive 0.5
      mL PCV13 (Group IIA) or 0.5 mL PCV13 in the right arm and 0.5 mL PCV 13 in the left arm
      (Group IIB). Group II will include 588 adults 55 through 74 years of age who previously
      received a single dose of PPSV23 &gt; /=3 years and &lt; /=7 years prior to enrollment. Enrollment
      in both groups will be stratified by age group (55 through 64 years and 65 through 74
      years).The study duration is approximately 18 months. The primary objectives are: to
      determine if two 0.5 mL doses of PCV13 are statistically significantly more immunogenic than
      a single 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 for at least some of the vaccine serotypes among participants
      55 through 74 years of age previously vaccinated with PPSV23, as measured by
      serotype-specific OPA titers 28 days after study vaccination, and is non-inferior to 12
      vaccine serotypes; and determine if two 0.5 mL doses of PCV13 administered to participants
      previously vaccinated with PPSV23 are non-inferior to a single dose of 0.5 mL of PCV13
      administered to vaccine-naïve adults 55 through 74 years of age for the 12 vaccine serotypes,
      as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 28 days after study vaccination. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to: determine if two x 0.5mL doses of PCV13 is statistically
      significantly more immunogenic than a single 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 for at least some of the
      vaccine serotypes among participants 55 through 74 years of age previously vaccinated with
      PPSV23, as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 180 days after study vaccination, and is
      non-inferior to 12 vaccine serotypes; to determine if two x 0.5mL doses of PCV13 administered
      to participants previously vaccinated with PPSV23 is non-inferior to a single dose of 0.5 mL
      of PCV13 administered to vaccine-naïve adults 55 through 74 years of age for 12 vaccine
      serotypes, as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 180 days after study vaccination.

        muscle of the right arm and unable to receive a vaccination in the deltoid muscle of the
        left arm because of insufficient muscle mass, need to avoid injections due to prior lymph
        node dissection or radiation, or other factor. For Group II, unable to receive a
        vaccination in the deltoid muscle of one or both arms because of insufficient muscle mass,
        need to avoid injections due to prior lymph node dissection or radiation, or other factor.
        16. Currently on anticoagulant therapy (for example, warfarin, heparin [IV or SQ], or
        dabigatran) or a history of bleeding diathesis that would contraindicate intramuscular
        injection. (Aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
        are allowed). 17. Known clinically significant allergic reaction to prior pneumococcal
        vaccination (for Group II participants) or to a component of PCV13 vaccine (PCV13 is latex
        free). 18. Current known abuse of alcohol or drug addiction that in the opinion of the
        Investigator may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with trial procedures. 19.
        Rec eipt of any other investigational vaccine or agent within one month before enrollment
        or intent to receive any other investigational vaccine or agent prior to the conclusion of
        the study. 20. Any medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place
