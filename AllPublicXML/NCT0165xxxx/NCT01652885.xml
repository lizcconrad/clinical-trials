    <description>ISGA assess severity of atopic dermatitis on a 5 point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (maximum severe), where higher scores indicate higher degree of atopic dermatitis. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual discoloration, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting). Treatment success was defined as ISGA score of 0 or 1, and a minimum improvement of 2 grades in ISGA from Baseline to Day 29.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 8, 15, 22, 29</time_frame>
    <description>5 signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis were: 1) erythema, 2) pruritus, 3) exudation, 4) excoriation and 5) lichenification. The severity of each of these 5 signs and symptoms were assessed on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Higher scores (for each of the 5 signs and symptoms) indicate higher degree of severity of atopic dermatitis.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Treatment Success Based on Investigator’s Static Global Assessment (ISGA)</title>
        <description>ISGA assess severity of atopic dermatitis on a 5 point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (maximum severe), where higher scores indicate higher degree of atopic dermatitis. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual discoloration, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting). Treatment success was defined as ISGA score of 0 or 1, and a minimum improvement of 2 grades in ISGA from Baseline to Day 29.</description>

        <description>5 signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis were: 1) erythema, 2) pruritus, 3) exudation, 4) excoriation and 5) lichenification. The severity of each of these 5 signs and symptoms were assessed on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Higher scores (for each of the 5 signs and symptoms) indicate higher degree of severity of atopic dermatitis.</description>
