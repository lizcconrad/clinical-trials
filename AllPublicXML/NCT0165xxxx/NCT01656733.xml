    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to determine if the nicotine inhaler in combination with counseling
      will help pregnant women quit smoking, and whether it is safe when compared to placebo (an
      inactive inhaler).

      This project will examine the safety and efficacy of the nicotine inhaler as an aid to
      smoking cessation during pregnancy. The specific aims are: (1) To examine the efficacy of the
      nicotine inhaler compared to a matching placebo for smoking cessation during pregnancy; (2)
      To compare the nicotine inhaler with placebo on overall nicotine exposure (i.e., serum
      cotinine concentrations), and on birth outcomes (i.e., birth weight and gestational age); (3)
      To identify factors that determine which women benefit most from the use of the nicotine
      inhaler for smoking cessation during pregnancy; (4) To explore mechanisms by which the
      nicotine inhaler increases birth weight and gestational age.

      Subjects will be recruited from two prenatal clinics that serve primarily a low-income,
      minority population.

      Pregnant smokers (n=270) who smoke at least 5 cigarettes/ day will receive nurse-delivered
      behavioral counseling and be randomized to receive a 6-week course of treatment with either a
      nicotine inhaler or placebo, followed by a 6-week taper. Birth outcomes will be obtained on
      all participants
