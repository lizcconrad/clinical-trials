      A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Tolvaptan in the treatment of patients with cardiac edema (body fluid
      retention caused by congestive heart failure) based on the conventional therapy.

      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tolvaptan 15 mg on congestive heart failure patients
      with body fluid retention after current diuretic treatment, after continuous treatment of 7
      days' oral Tolvaptan 15mg or placebo.

           breakfast, for successive 7 days

        -  Study period:

        -  Screening period (4 days in minimum, 7 days in maximum), including:

      Screening period: from the time the informed consent form is signed to Day -4 Observation
      period: 3 days before drug administration

        -  Treatment period: 7 days

        -  Follow up visits: Day 8 (efficacy evaluation day) and Day 7 (+3) after the last dosing
