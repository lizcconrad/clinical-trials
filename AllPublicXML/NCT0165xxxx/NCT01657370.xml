    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of MK-1602 in the treatment
      of acute migraine, including the influence of demographic and other variables on MK-1602
      pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the relationship between MK-1602 concentrations and
      efficacy of the drug.
