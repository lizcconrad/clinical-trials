      Stroke is the main cause of long-term disability among adults. Disability following stroke
      results in significant impairment of patients quality of life. There was a lot of
      investigations with using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as effective additional
      therapy in stroke rehabilitation. In this researches uses different protocols and patient's
      categories: high-frequency, low-frequency, etc. Using method of navigation transcranial
      magnetic stimulation with neuroimaging could help in choosing optimal protocol, assess
      effectiveness of therapy and forming prognosis.
