      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, Phase II,
      parallel-group study of up to four weeks in duration. The study consisted of a screening
      visit followed by a one-week single blind placebo period. At next visit, each subject was
      randomized to one of four treatment groups: 90 mcg levalbuterol, 180 mcg levalbuterol, 180
      mcg racemic albuterol, or placebo. All study medication was administered as 2 actuations 4
      times a day for 21 days.

    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, Phase II,
      parallel-group study up to four weeks in duration. Seven days of QID (four times a day)
      single-blind, placebo administration (via metered dose inhaler (MDI)) was followed by 21 days
      of QID double-blind treatment. During the single-blind period, rescue medication consisted of
      racemic albuterol MDI (90 mcg per actuation) for all subjects. During the double-blind
      period, rescue medication consisted of double-blind levalbuterol MDI (45 mcg per actuation)
      for all subjects in the levalbuterol treatment groups or double-blind racemic albuterol MDI
      (90 mcg per actuation) for all subjects in the racemic albuterol and placebo treatment
      groups.The study consisted of two periods, an optional follow-up visit, and a final telephone
      evaluation. This study was previously conducted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor
      Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was
      changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

             chemistry, or urinalysis).

          -  Subject had a clinically significant abnormal 12-lead ECG that would have put the
