    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of a robotic device that is remotely controlled to maneuver
      a circular mapping catheter in the left atrium during Atrial Fibrillation (AF) ablation
      procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Key to the success of an electrophysiology procedure is the ability to accurately map, sense
      and pace the heart. Electrophysiology mapping catheters are available in a variety of shapes
      and electrode configurations. The majority of these catheters are manipulated manually by the
      physician. The Vdrive simplifies these manipulations by allowing an operator to mechanically
      advance, retract, rotate, deflect and maneuver a circular mapping catheter. The circular
      mapping catheter is not altered in structure, function or indication in the same manner as
      the predicate device (Cardiodrive Catheter Advancement System).

      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, controlled study comparing manual navigation
      of a circular mapping catheter with mechanical navigation by the Vdrive. A total of 120
      patients are expected to complete the study: 80 patients in the Vdrive navigation arm and 40
      patients in the manual navigation arm. Patients will be enrolled at a minimum of one site in
      the European Union where the product is currently marketed and the United States, where the
      Vdrive is considered to be investigational.

    <description>Success was navigating and sensing by obtaining an EGM at the pre-specified targeted PVs. The null hypothesis was to be tested at the α = 0.05 significance level using a test statistic Z based on the Farrington and Manning likelihood score statistic with adjustment to take into account the correlation between multiple observations (PVs) on the same subject. The null hypothesis was to be rejected if Z &gt; 1.645 or, equivalently, if the corresponding p-value was less than 0.05.</description>

    <description>The Vdrive will allow physicians to manipulate compatible circular mapping catheters while maintaining a safety profile that is not inferior to manual circular catheter navigation. The one-sided null hypothesis was to be tested at the α = 0.05 significance level using a standard unpooled asymptotically normal test statistic. The null hypothesis was to be rejected if Z &lt; -1.7046 or, equivalently, if the corresponding p-value was less than 0.05.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Left atrial AF ablation procedure requiring the use of a Lasso mapping catheter

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Subject must be male, female of no childbearing potential, or a female that has a
