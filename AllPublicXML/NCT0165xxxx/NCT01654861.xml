  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC is safe and may favorably change the clinical
           course for an individual patient.

        -  The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC is synergistic in anti-tumor effect as seen in
           preclinical models, where HDIVC creates a pro-oxidative effect that adds to the
           anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine.

        -  The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC may improve Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  The dosage schema of 1.2 g /kg bolus infusion followed by lower dose of 0.3 g / kg
           infusion may create sustained elevation in Vitamin C plasma levels for increased
           cytotoxic effect.

        -  The addition of HDIVC &amp; oral supplementation of Vitamin C to standard treatment with
           gemcitabine may improve quality of life for patients with comparison to prior to
           treatment start of this protocol.

        -  CA 19-9 and inflammatory markers may show trends for patients in this trial.

          <description>CT and PET scans will be performed at baseline and then every two months. Target and Non-Target Lesions will be identified and recorded at baseline. When subsequent scans are performed, anti-tumor responses will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>
