      This study evaluates a questionaire designed to measure satisfaction and ophthalmic-related
      quality of life (QoL) of 300 civilian participants prior to and three months following
      state-of-the-art laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).

      The LASIK Quality of Life Collaboration Project (LQOLCP) is a government partnership among
      the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Department of Defense, and
      the National Eye Institute (NEI). This project examines patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
      following LASIK surgery. This three-phased project is part of FDA's ongoing effort to better
      monitor and improve the safety and effectiveness of lasers used in LASIK surgery. PROWL-2 is
      the third phase of the larger LQOLCP project. The primary objective of PROWL-2 is to explore
      the psychometric properties of a computer-based questionnaire assessing the patient-reported
      outcomes of satisfaction and ophthalmic-related quality of life before and over a period of 3
      months following LASIK. This questionnaire initially developed and examined in PROWL-1 (a
      military population) will be examined psychometrically in a civilian population. PROWL-2 is a
      prospective, multi-center, observational study in which a participant's pre-operative status
      will serve as the baseline for one-month and three-month post-surgical comparisons. Three
      hundred (300) participants planning to undergo refractive surgery using LASIK for myopia,
      hyperopia, or astigmatism will be enrolled in this study from five (5) clinical sites across
      the United States. Additionally, routine clinical data will be collected pre- and
      post-operatively (e.g., best corrected visual acuity, manifest refraction, wavefront
      aberrometry, conreal topography, and other clinical assessments) and questionnaires will be
      independently administered pre-operatively and at the one-month and three-month
      post-operative visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators will be instructed to base subject eligibility on the Professional Use
             Information for their specific laser and keratome system, including but not limited to
             subjects who:

          -  Are aged 21 years or older.

          -  Have the ability to give informed consent.

          -  Speak and read English fluently.

          -  Have not previously had any form of refractive surgery, including prior LASIK or
             cataract surgery.

          -  May benefit from increased spectacle independence.

          -  Have been determined to be a good candidate for the LASIK procedure based on the
             investigator's assessment of medical and ophthalmic health, general cognitive
             function, and physical and social limitations.

          -  Have a treatment target of bilateral emmetropia. Of note, an eye must be treated
             within 7 days of the fellow eye.

          -  Express willingness and potential ability to return for all follow-up examinations
             through the 3-month follow-up exam under the care of the treating investigator.

          -  Have access to a computer with internet service.
