  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C is endemic in Egypt with a high prevalence of the resistant genotype 4.
      Conventional standard of care treatment has modest response with only 50% sustained virologic
      response. Recent reports have suggested an augmented response with the addition of vitamin D.
      This is a prospective randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of adding vitamin D to
      standard of care for chronic hepatitis C genotype 4.
