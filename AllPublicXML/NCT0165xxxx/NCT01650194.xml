  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide in
      combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. Subjects diagnosed with cancer of the
      prostate that is getting worse and spread to the bone despite receiving hormone treatment
      will be enrolled and receive study treatment until disease progression.

      For the study duration, all subjects will maintain androgen deprivation with a gonadotropin
      releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist or orchiectomy. Study drug will be
      administered until disease progression. Disease progression is defined as a composite
      endpoint consisting of either clinical deterioration, radiographic progression or
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials
      Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria.
