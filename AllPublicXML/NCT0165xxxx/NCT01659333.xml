    <textblock>
      Dry weight (DW) assessment is essential for the efficient treatment of peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) patients but so far objective methods for DW assessment have not been established for
      daily clinical practice. Our aim was to evaluate hydration state in PD patients by using a
      body composition monitor (BCM) and calf bioimpedance (c-BI) and N-terminal prohormone of
      brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and to compare both methods with arterial
      stiffness.

      We evaluated 60 patients using a new BCM device that implies a validated body composition
      model. This method allows correct quantification of extracellular fluid overload or
      deficiency (normal limits:-1.1 to +1.1L). Patients were assigned to normo and hypervolemic
      groups according to BCM results. Also, normalized calf resistivity (nRho) was calculated from
      resistance at 5 Khz using c-BI and the levels of NT-proBNP were measured in all study
      patients. The analyses of arterial stiffness were performed by using the pulse wave velocity
      (PWV) technique on the patients. All patients underwent conventional echocardiography and
      their left ventricular diastolic functions were evaluated.

    <description>All calculations are automatically performed by the software of the BCM device. Absolute over hydration (OH) is the difference between the expected patient's ECW under normal physiological conditions and the actual ECW, whereas the relative over hydration (Rel. OH) is defined as the OH to ECW ratio. Normohydration is defined when OH is between the 10th and the 90th percentile for healthy, age- and gender-matched individuals from the reference population, i.e., between 10th percentile (−1.1 L) to 90th percentile (+1.1 L), while volumes below and above this range define underhydration and overhydration, respectively.</description>

        We evaluated 60 patients' hydration states were measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy
        methods. Patients were assigned to normo and hypervolemic groups according to Body
        composition monitor(BCM) results. Also, normalized calf resistivity (nRho) was calculated

        technique on the patients. Additionally, all patients underwent conventional
        echocardiography and their left ventricular diastolic functions were evaluated. The
        patients were grouped using the BCM method because, according to the literature, this
        method is the only one that can classify subjects in terms of volume conditions.
