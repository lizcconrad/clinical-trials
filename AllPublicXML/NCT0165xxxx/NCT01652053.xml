  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoints of the investigation will include assessment of the maintenance of disc
      height demonstrated by radiographic evidence based on plain radiographs and MRI and relief of
      pain as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at six months post-surgery. It is anticipated
      that outcomes with the InterCushion Disc Nucleus Prosthesis (DNP) will be comparable to or
      better than the historical published results for discectomy alone.

      All patients will be followed for at least 24 months once enrolled in the study. Clinical
      evaluations will be conducted before surgery (baseline), intraoperative, 2 week (± 1 week), 6
      week (± 1 week), 3 months (± 2 weeks), 6 months (± 1 month), 12 months (± 2 months) and 24
      months (± 2 months).

        The protocol includes skeletally mature patients, both male and female, 18 to 60 years old
        suffering from a herniated disc (confirmed by X-ray, CT or MRI) with persistent leg pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             disc herniation will not disqualify the patient from participating in this study) and

          -  Patient has congenital stenosis

          -  Patient is diabetic.

          -  The patient has osteoporosis or severe osteopenia as determined by the Investigator.
