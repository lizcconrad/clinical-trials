  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies showed that ascertaining the effectiveness of rehabilitative interventions
      on conditions leading to long-term disability, such as stroke, is a complex task because the
      outcome depends on many interacting factors. Several studies underline the importance of
      brain plasticity and its therapeutic potential in neurological disorders. Accredited theories
      of cortical reorganization after brain lesion endorse the use of early, intensive,
      repetitive, and context-related exercise as optimal strategies to promote motor relearning
      and minimize motor deficit. The use of robotic systems in upper limb motor rehabilitation
      programs has been already demonstrated to provide safe and intensive treatment to subjects
      with motor impairments due to a neurological injury: several studies showed the advantages of
      robotic therapy on chronic post-stroke patients, even if no consistent influence on
      functional abilities was found and evidence of better results providing intensive treatments,
      both robotic and conventional rehabilitative techniques, was found. Recent development and
      recent trial in robot-assisted rehabilitation has shown the great potential of robotic
      devices for delivering repetitive training, thus facilitating a high intensity and a large
      dose of training during sub-acute and chronic phases of stroke rehabilitation. The proposed
      project, through a randomized controlled observer-blind multicenter trial is aimed at
      evaluating the effectiveness of robot-assisted therapy as additional treatment to the
      standard physical therapy in the early phase after stroke onset and evaluating in conjunction
      with EEG and EMG recordings the effects of the rehabilitative treatments in a quantitative,
      measurable way, by providing reliable and objective methods for measuring functional recovery
      after stroke.

      The main original contribution of this project is to provide an experimental framework, based
      on proximal robotic treatment approach, to test whether starting with the distal
      robot-assisted sensorimotor therapy the effective in improving motor functions of sub-acute
      stroke patients.

      The use of robotic platforms to administer the rehabilitation therapy is crucial for two main
      reasons:

        1. the physical therapies based on robotic platforms assure that each patient in the same
           testing group is treated in the same repeatable way, eliminating the intrinsic
           subject-dependent variability that affects traditional therapies;

        2. the robotic platforms, in conjunction with EEG and EMG recordings, can be used to assess
           the effects of the rehabilitative treatments in a quantitative, measurable way, by
           providing reliable and objective methods for measuring functional recovery after stroke.

    <description>The MIT-MANUS/InMotion2 (Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA) system has two translational degrees of freedom (dof): shoulder abduction-adduction (ab-ad), elbow flexion-extension (flexext).
The robotic system supports the execution of reaching movements in the horizontal plane through an assist as needed control strategy. The robot can guide the movement of the upper limb of the patients and record end-effector physical quantities such as the position, velocity, and applied forces. The device is designed to have a low intrinsic end-point impedance (i.e., be back-drivable to easily carry the weight of the patient's arm, to execute movements without constraint and offer minimal resistance. A 3-dof force transducer is placed at the robots end-effector, as well.</description>
