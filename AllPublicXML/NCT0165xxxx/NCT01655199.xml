  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the previous phases of the project (Phase I and II), two new field tests have been
      designed and validated for an integration in a primary care setting in Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). These new field tests are 3-min paced-walk test (3MPWT) and 3-min
      paced step test (3MPST). If the validity and sensitivity of the TM3 could be highlighted,
      particularly by the reduction of dyspnea level following bronchodilatation, Phase II
      highlight that the 3MPST does not allow to detect this decrease of dyspnea after
      bronchodilatation. The use of too high step rates could explain these results through a
      hypothesis relative to neuromechanical coupling of dyspnea. The main objective of this trial
      is to follow the investigations on the sensitivity of 3MPST to detect the effects of
      pharmacological intervention on the exertional dyspnea in COPD patient. The hypothesis of
      this work is that the use of lower step rates cadences could allow to detect an improvement
      of exertional dyspnea following treatment-induced bronchodilatation, contrary to higher step
      rates.

      For this project, 40 patients with COPD will be recruited in 2 centres (in the Institute of
      Cardiology and Pneumology of Quebec and in the Chest Institute of Montreal). For each
      patient, three visits will be performed. During the first visit, baseline pulmonary function
      and maximal exercise capacity will be evaluated and the patients will be familiarized with
      step test proceedings. Between the different visits, a 3-7 days period will be respected.
      During the second and the third visits, 4 step tests will be performed at 4 different rates,
      following one of the two conditions (placebo or bronchodilatation). This project will propose
      two randomization levels. The first randomization will be relative to the choice of the
      condition used during the second visit (placebo ou bronchodilatation) and the second one for
      the rates order (14, 16, 20, 24 steps/min). During each performed exercise, cardiorespiratory
      and pulmonary parameters will be measured using a portable system.

For the visit 3, the other intervention drug will be assigned. The bronchodilation obtained with the medication will allow to determine if the 3-min step test is sensitive by detecting an improvement of exertional dyspnea following bronchodilation.</description>
