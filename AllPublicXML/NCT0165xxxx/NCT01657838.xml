        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a body weight of at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) of 18
             to 32 kg/m2, inclusive

             medically acceptable double barrier method (e.g. spermicide and diaphragm, or
             spermicide and condom) to prevent pregnancy and agrees to continue using this method
             from Screening until the end of the study; and is not lactating or pregnant as

          -  The subject has a history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, unexplained cardiac
             arrhythmia or torsade de pointes, structural heart disease, or family history of Long
             QT syndrome (suggested by sudden death of a close relative at a young age due to
             possible or probable cardiac causes)

          -  The subject has a positive result for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis B surface
             antigen at Screening or is known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

             products or the azole class of compounds or a history of multiple and/or severe
             allergies to drugs or foods (as judged by the investigator), or a history of severe
             anaphylactic reactions

             months prior to Screening

          -  The subject has had treatment with prescription drugs or complementary and alternative
             medicines within 14 days prior to Day -1, or over-the-counter medications within 1
             week prior to Day -1, with the exception of occasionally use of ibuprofen
