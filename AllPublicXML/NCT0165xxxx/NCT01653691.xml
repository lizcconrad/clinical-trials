  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulse-dye laser therapy has been used to treat the redness, tightness and discomfort of
      hypertrophic scars resulting from burn injuries. To date the effectiveness of laser therapy
      on children's burned scars has not been measured.

      In this study we hope to answer an important question in pediatric burn care: what are the
      techniques whereby tunable-dye laser neo-vessel ablation is optimally employed to ameliorate
      hypertrophic scars resulting from burn injuries in children? Hypertrophic scarring is
      considered an adverse wound healing event that results in abnormal scar formation. This
      scarring process is associated with pruritis and discomfort and can interfere with function
      and aesthetics. Topical creams, massage, stretching and pressure are used as standard
      treatments of burn scar formation. With the child serving as their own control, we want to
      objectively measure the impact of PDL on burn scars in children. Variables of timing of
      application, duration and number of sessions will all be collected.

    <description>This scar assessment tool uses a set of reference photographs, a numeric scale, and location technique to measure change over time of a burn scar. This tool will assist us in determining the comparative merits of laser treatments. It is portable and inexpensive.</description>

Some subjects will receive laser to both sides of their scar, while others will not receive any intervention to one side and laser to the other side. Each side will be evaluated during outpatient visits. 12 months after treatment is completed, 2 burn experts will rate each side of the scar without knowing its treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects 9 years and older to 21 years of age or younger with a second degree burn
             with erythema and the potential for hypertrophic scarring to the thigh and or trunk.

          -  subject is clinically stable within 3 months of the burn injury.

          -  burn size of at least 15cm2 and able to be divided into equivalent halves (divided
             along line of tension). Equivalent orientation distance from mobil joint with regard
             to history,physical findings, proximity to tension producing forces and orientation.

          -  subjects in acute phase of burn injury generally less than one year from the time of
             the burn injury at 2-3 months post burn when deemed appropriate for pressure therapy,
             and have been evaluated as an appropriate candidate by a surgeon involved in this
             study for inclusion.

          -  subjects can be included up to one year post burn if referred from another treatment
             facility.

          -  no skin conditions that could potentially have an adverse effect on wound healing

          -  all race/ethnic groups

          -  children/guardians or significant others ability to speak English or Spanish and
             respond to study questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects less than 9 years old as this age group is more fragile.

          -  subjects with no second degree burn to thigh and or trunk

          -  subjects with chemical burns

          -  subjects at low risk for hypertrophic scaring (wounds that demonstrate fading erythema
             at 9-12 weeks and wounds that are healed at less than 3 weeks are at low risk for
             hypertrophic scaring). Vancouver scar scale pigmentation rating of 0 or 1, vascularity
             rating of 0 or 1.

          -  TBSA greater than 50% as massive burns will confound results.

          -  potential life threatening injuries which would confound the effects of laser
             treatment and complicate sequential administration of therapy (e.g.
             shock,sepsis,inhalation therapies, brain injury).

          -  subjects with other inclusion criteria not met and evaluation by surgeon negative for
             inclusion in study.

          -  children/guardians or significant others inability to speak English or Spanish and
             respond to questionnaires.

          -  SUBJECTS WITH DOCUMENTED HYPERSENSITIVITY/ALLERGY TO AQUAPHOR,LIDOCAINE OR ANY OF
             THEIR COMPONENTS.
