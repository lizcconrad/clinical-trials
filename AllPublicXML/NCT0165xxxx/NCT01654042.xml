  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 2 million patients in North America are treated with warfarin - a &quot;blood thinner&quot; -
      to prevent blood clots in arteries or veins. The treatment has to be monitored with a blood
      test and the dose changed accordingly every 1-4 weeks. One third of the patients have very
      stable results and hardly ever have to change the dose. The investigators wish to show that
      the level of control of the treatment with warfarin in these very stable patients is not
      worse with 12-weekly testing. A pilot study the investigators performed indicated that
      12-weekly testing would be safe but this has to be confirmed in a large study. One third of
      patients taking warfarin have not had any changes in the dose for the past 6 months or
      longer. These patients will be asked about participation in the study. They will be
      randomized to testing and dosing every 4 or 12 weeks. Each patient is in the study until it
      ends, which will be minimum 1 year and can be up to about 4 years. The study is designed to
      show that 12-weekly testing does not significantly increase the risk for major bleeding or
      blood clots. The results would be important for a large number of patients. An increase of
      the interval between blood tests from 4 to 12 weeks would reduce the burden for these
      patients on life-long treatment considerably.

      The study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center non-inferiority trial to
      demonstrate that the interval between internation normalized ration (INR) tests can be
      extended from the recommended 4 weeks to 12 weeks for patients with stable INRs. PROBE
      design. Patients receiving warfarin therapy that have exhibited INR stability, defined as no
      change in maintenance dose for at least 6 months, are potentially eligible for enrolment in
      the study. The primary outcome is a composite of major bleeding (ISTH criteria) plus
      objectively verified arterial or venous thromboembolism (excluding superficial
      thrombophlebitis) plus death related to thromboembolism. Justification: the study is not
      reflecting a &quot;trade-off&quot; scenario where one regimen is expected to be more effective at the
      cost of increased harm compared to the other regimen. Conversely, the potential disadvantage
      of the experimental regimen in this trial is increased variability in INR, which may result
      in an increased rate of low as well as high INRs and therefore potentially an increase of
      both types of clinical events.

    <description>The justification for a composite outcome including both bleeding and thromboembolism is that the study is not reflecting a &quot;trade-off&quot; scenario where one regimen is expected to be more effective at the cost of increased harm compared to the other regimen. Conversely, the potential disadvantage of the experimental regimen in this trial is increased variability in prothrombin time, which may result in an increased rate of short as well as long prothrombin times and therefore potentially an increase of both types of clinical events.</description>

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will be scheduled for prothrombin time testing and dosing of warfarin every 12 weeks instead of every 4 weeks. This has been suggested in the latest edition of the ACCP guidelines as a possibility for very stable patients. In order to change this from a suggestion to a formal recommendation a study powered for clinically important outcomes is needed.</description>
