      RATIONAL: Preliminary results fron the Study MESOT-TREM-2012 indicate a promising activity of
      tremelimumab in malignant mesothelioma (MM) patients.

      PURPOSE: The proposed study MESOT-TREM-2012 aims to explore the efficacy of a more intensive
      schedule of treatment with tremelimumab in 29 MM patients. Subjects will receive
      investigational product every 4 weeks (wks) for 6 doses, followed by doses every 12 wks until
      confirmed disease progression.

      Primary endpoint:

      1) To assess the rate of objective clinical complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. To define toxicity profile according to NCI CT-CAE V. 3

        2. To assess the overall survival (OS)

        3. To estimate disease control rate (DCR) (proportion of patients with best response of
           CR+PR+SD) according to the modified Recist criteria

        4. To assess the progression-free survival in treated patients according to modified Recist
           criteria

        5. To evaluate qualitative and quantitative changes in cellular and humoral immune
           responses
