      It is a phase I randomized placebo controlled trial (vaccine and placebo ratio of 2:1). A
      phase II study is planned to be conducted following review of results of this phase.

      Phase I: It is a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial involving 24 participants
      age 18-49 years (16 will receive vaccines and 8 will receive placebo). All will be admitted
      in the isolation ward for 10-14 days after each immunization mainly for safety assessment.
      Two doses of live attenuated influenza H5 vaccine candidate strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133
      (H5N2) will be given by intranasal route 21 days apart. Each group of 4 participants will be
      immunized at a time at 30-60 mins interval. All participants will be followed 21 days after
      each immunization. Total follow up is 60 day.
