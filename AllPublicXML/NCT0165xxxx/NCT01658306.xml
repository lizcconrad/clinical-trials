  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) might have a
      beneficial effect on outcomes of cerebral small vessel disease (CSV).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CSV constitutes an important type of ischemic stroke due to a generalized hypo-perfusion of
      brain. Few treatment methods are available except some beneficial effect shown with
      nimodipine. The potential treatment effect of RIPC on protection of brain from cerebral small
      vessel disease has not been investigated. The investigators designed this randomized,
      double-blind, controlled clinical trial to examine (1) whether RIPC has a beneficial effect
      on brain lesions of CSV, and (2) whether RIPC can protect patients of CSV from cognitive
      deterioration. There are 2 arms in this trial: One arm is RIPC treatment, the other one is
      sham RIPC treatment. Brain lesions will be quantified by volumetric MRI, and Xe-CT will be
      used to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion. Cognitive function will be evaluated by
      mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
