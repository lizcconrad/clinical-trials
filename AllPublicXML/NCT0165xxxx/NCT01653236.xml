      Hypothesis Combination of Boceprevir with Ribavirin in treatment-naïve patients with genotype
      4 chronic hepatitis C infection will increase the proportion of patients achieving sustained
      viral response compared to standard treatment alone.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Boceprevir 800 mg
      three times per day (TID) orally (PO) (hereafter called Boceprevir) in combination with
      peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 μg/kg once per week (QW) subcutaneously (SC) plus weight-based
      dosing (WBD) of ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg/day) compared to standard of care (SOC) (therapy
      with peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG)+ribavirin (RBV) WBD) in previously untreated adult subjects
      with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4 infection.

      Primary Trial Objectives:

      - The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Boceprevir in
      combination with PEG 1.5 μg/kg QW SC plus WBD of RBV (800 to 1400 mg/day) compared to the
      efficacy of SOC (therapy with PEG+RBV WBD) in the Control Arm in previously untreated adult
      subjects with CHC genotype 4 infection

             propafenone, quinidine and ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine,
