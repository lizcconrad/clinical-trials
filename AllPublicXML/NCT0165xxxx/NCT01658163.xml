      The investigators prospectively studied the results of wound closure after abdominoplasty
      with randomized use of PrineoTM and conventional suturing to assess the possible difference
      in outcome between these two methods.Follow-up visits to the outpatient clinic were scheduled
      at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery. A panel consisting of three plastic
      surgeons and three plastic surgery residents assessed the wound and scar appearance during
      the three follow-up visits.

      Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic surgery. The
      appearance of the scar is a major factor contributing to the aesthetic outcome of the
      procedure and depends largely on the technique of wound closure. The new PrineoTM wound
      closure system was introduced to combine the effectiveness of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate
      (Dermabond TM) together with a self-adhering mesh.Fifty-two women and 8 men aged between 21
      and 65 years scheduled for abdominoplasty were included in the study. Total operating time
      after abdominoplasty between the traditional wound closure technique and the PrineoTM-type
      wound closure technique was compared. Two weeks postoperatively, the wounds were examined and
      graded according to the Hollander Cosmesis Scale. At 6- and 12-month follow-up, the aesthetic
      outcome of the abdominal scar was evaluated with the Vancouver Scar Scale. Twelve months
      postoperatively, the patients were further asked to score their part of the Patient Scar
      Assessment Scale.There was a statistically significant shorter mean of total operating time
      for the new skin closure system compared with intradermal sutures. The Hollander Cosmesis
      Scale indicated a significantly more favourable overall result with PrineoTM at 2 weeks after
      surgery. The Vancouver Scar Scale demonstrated a better cosmetic outcome in favour of
      PrineoTM 6 and 12 months after surgery The Patient Scar Assessment Scale scores 12 months
      after surgery indicated that the patients noted significantly less pain, thickness and
      irregularity with PrineoTM.Based on our results, we conclude that PrineoTM is a safe and
      effective substitute for superficial skin closure, with good cosmetic results and no increase
      in wound complications. The use of PrineoTM decreases operative times and costs and enhances
      patients' postoperative comfort.
