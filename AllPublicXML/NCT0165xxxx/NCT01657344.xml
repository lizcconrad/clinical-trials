      The objectives of this study are to: develop an emergency care visit registry for pediatric
      patients for Quality Improvement purposes and to support future research; to use the
      emergency care visit registry to collect stakeholder-prioritized emergency care performance
      improvement measures for important pediatric medical and trauma conditions at the level of
      the Emergency Department (ED) and individual clinical; and report emergency care performance
      improvement measures to individual ED clinicians and sites, and measure subsequent changes in
      quality performance. The hypothesis is that by providing this type of information to
      individual clinicians will result in improved performance and decreased variability
      (variation) of care for an individual clinician, between different clinicians, and eventually
      between hospital sites.

    <ipd_description>When the study is completed, the data coordinating center (DCC) will prepare a distributable database in compliance with Federal requirements.This database will be de-identified sufficiently that it will not be subject to Federal regulations nor the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).There is provision to destroy identifiers before integrating patient data into the registry. Investigators will destroy the master list after 3 years after completion of the research.</ipd_description>
