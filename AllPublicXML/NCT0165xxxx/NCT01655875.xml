  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients 2-21 years old who have acute leukemia that has not responded well
      to chemotherapy and will have a bone marrow transplant. This is a pilot (phase 1) study of
      AMD3100(also called Plerixafor, Mozobil). AMD3100 is given in combination with a standard
      pre-transplant conditioning regimen (total body irradiation, etoposide and cyclophosphamide).
      The conditioning regimen is the treatment that is given just before the transplant. This
      treatment kills leukemia cells as well as healthy bone marrow and immune cells. Researchers
      want to learn more about how AMD3100 affects acute leukemia cells. Blood and bone marrow
      samples from study participants will be collected to find out if AMD3100 is making patients'
      cells more sensitive to the conditioning regimen and to find out how it does this.

      The first six patients receive three daily doses (240 mcg/kg via IV). If it appears that
      three doses do not significantly increase the side effects of transplant conditioning, the
      investigators will give a second group of six patients five daily doses.

      The first six patients will receive three daily doses of AMD3100 (240 mcg/kg via IV). If it
      appears that three doses do not significantly increase the side effects of transplant
      conditioning, the investigators will give a second group of six patients five daily doses.

      AMD3100 is given in combination with a standard pre-transplant conditioning regimen (total
      body irradiation, etoposide and cyclophosphamide.) AMD3100 causes healthy bone marrow cells
      to be released from the bone marrow into the blood so that they can be collected in patients
      who will have peripheral (blood stream) blood stem cell transplants. AMD3100 also pushes out
      leukemia cells from the bone marrow. Research in animals and in test tubes shows that the
      bone marrow partially protects leukemia cells from chemotherapy and radiation. AMD3100 could
      make leukemia treatments better by pushing out the leukemia cells from the bone marrow and
      making them more sensitive to treatment. Clinical trials combining AMD3100 with normal doses
      of chemotherapy are being done for relapsed acute leukemia. Researchers hope AMD3100 can be
      given with conditioning regimen safely without causing more side effects. Up to 12
      participants will be enrolled and estimated accrual duration is 2 years.

If 2 cases of grade 4 toxicity or 3 cases of grade 3-4 toxicity occur, dose level 1 and study will be closed. Otherwise, after 6 patients have been assessed at day 42, the dose will be escalated to 5 days of AMD3100 (dose level 2). If 2 cases of grade 4 toxicity or 3 cases of grade 3-4 toxicity occur, the study will be closed.
