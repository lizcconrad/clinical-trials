    <textblock>
      Non-interventional study consisting of a population of patients who had received for soft
      tissue sarcoma by at least 2 courses of Yondelis® at a dose of 1.5 mg / m² / 3 weeks after
      failure or intolerance to doxorubicin / ifosfamide from 2007 to 2011.

    <textblock>
      Patient selection is based on a database of retrospectively within the GSF / GETO.

      The tumor assessment must be made by scanner at baseline and post-C2 or C3 and should be
      available and sent to sponsor.

      The comparative reading of the imaging is centralized and made without the knowledge of the
      local assessment:

        -  sum of the large diameter for 2 imagery (baseline and 1st evaluation

        -  tumor density on areas of interest for the 2 imaging (baseline and 1st evaluation

        -  Rank patients according to two methods (Choi and RECIST): complete response, partial
           response, stability, progress and non-assessable.
