  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-rising-dose study will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MK-8150 in healthy young
      men, in male participants with mild to moderate hypertension, in elderly male and female
      participants with mild to moderate hypertension, and in male and female participants with
      resistant hypertension. A primary study hypothesis is that there is at least one dose that
      does not increase heart rate (HR) to a clinically meaningful extent in male participants with
      mild to moderate hypertension and in elderly participants with mild to moderate hypertension
      on either Day 1 or the last Day of multiple dosing (Daylast), as measured by Time-weighted
      Average Across 24 hours (TWA0-24hrs). The hypothesis is met if mean increase (MK-8150 -
      placebo) in TWA0-24hrs HR in the identified groups is ≤15 beats per minute on Day 1 and
      Daylast.

      Ten panels (Panels A-J), consisting of 103 participants in total, will be randomized to
      receive either MK-8150 or matching placebo.

      Males (18 to 55 years of age, inclusive) with mild to moderate hypertension will be
      randomized in Panels A-D and will receive either MK-8150 or placebo as once daily treatment
      for 10 consecutive days.

      Elderly males and females (65 to 80 years of age, inclusive) with mild to moderate
      hypertension will be included in Panels E and F and will receive a single dose of either
      MK-8150 or placebo on Study Day 1 followed by at least 5 days of wash-out before proceeding
      to once daily treatment of the same randomized treatment at a lower dose for 10 consecutive
      days.

      Participants 18 to 65 years of age with resistant hypertension will be enrolled in Panels H
      and will receive in randomized sequences of MK-8150/placebo or placebo/MK-8150 in 2 treatment
      periods. There will be a minimum 3 weeks washout period between the 2 treatment periods in
      Panel H.

      Healthy males (18 to 55 years of age, inclusive) will be enrolled in Panel G and will receive
      MK-8150 or matching placebo once daily for 28 days. Participants randomized to MK-8150 in
      Panel G who meet all of the dose-escalation criteria and have not met any of the hemodynamic
      stopping criteria will be eligible for dose increases on Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22. If dose
      escalation criteria are not met (or if the Investigator or Sponsor elects not to increase the
      dose), then the participant will continue on the current dose and will be eligible for a dose
      increase at the next dose-escalation decision day if all dose-escalation criteria are met at
      that time.

      Male participants (18 to 65 years of age, inclusive) with mild to moderate hypertension will
      be randomized in Panels I and J. In each panel, 18 participants will receive either MK-8150
      or matching placebo as once daily treatment for up to 28 consecutive days. Participants who
      are randomized to placebo will receive placebo throughout the study. On Days 8, 15 and 22 in
      both Panels I and J, participants will be eligible for dose-escalation, down-dosing, or
      continuing their current dose depending on their hemodynamic status. Participants in Panels I
      and J who meet down-dosing criteria at any time during the study will have their doses
      reduced to the previous well-tolerated dose level until the next dose-escalation decision
      day, or through the end of the study, whichever is first.

    <time_frame>Up to 14 days after the last dose (Up to approximately 42 days, excluding pre-dose/screening period)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE. The 8 crossover Panel H participants are represented in both Panel H - MK-8150 10/20 mg column and Placebo (Panel A - J) column.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

    <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

The length of time spent at an identified pSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

    <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value (determined separately in each period).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time-weighted Average Across 24 Hours (TWA0-24hrs) cSBP in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A/B/C/D)</title>
        <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <description>HR was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all HR values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each HR value by that HR value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified HR value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline for Day 1 was Day 1 pre-dose value; Baseline for Day 6-15 was Day 6 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs HR in Elderly Male and Female Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Single and Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel E)</title>
        <description>HR was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all HR values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each HR value by that HR value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified HR value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline for Day 1 was Day 1 pre-dose value; Baseline for Day 6-15 was Day 6 pre-dose value.</description>

        <description>HR was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all HR values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each HR value by that HR value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified HR value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline for Day 1 was Day 1 pre-dose value; Baseline for Day 6-15 was Day 6 pre-dose value.</description>

          <description>HR was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all HR values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each HR value by that HR value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified HR value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cSBP in Male and Female Participants With Resistant Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel H)</title>
        <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value (determined separately in each period).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cSBP in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel I)</title>
        <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cSBP in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel J)</title>
        <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs AIx in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A/B/C/D)</title>
        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cDBP Following Day 10 Dose in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A/B/C/D)</title>
        <description>cDBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cDBP value by that cDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs pDBP Following Day 10 Dose in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A/B/C/D)</title>
        <description>pDBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pDBP value by that pDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs AIx in Elderly Male and Female Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Single and Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel E)</title>
        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR. Baseline for Day 1 was Day 1 pre-dose value; Baseline for Day 6-15 was Day 6 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cDBP Following Day 15 Dose in Elderly Male and Female Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Single and Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel E)</title>
        <description>cDBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cDBP value by that cDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline for Day 1 was Day 1 pre-dose value; Baseline for Day 6-15 was Day 6 pre-dose value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs AIx in Elderly Male and Female Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Single and Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel F)</title>
          <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR. Baseline for Day 1 was Day 1 pre-dose value; Baseline for Day 6-15 was Day 6 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs AIx in Healthy Male Participants Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel G)</title>
        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

          <description>pDBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pDBP value by that pDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value (determined separately in each period).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs pDBP Following Day 10 Dose in Male and Female Participants With Resistant Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel H)</title>
        <description>pDBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pDBP value by that pDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value (determined separately in each period).</description>

        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs pDBP Following Day 28 Dose in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Multiple Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel I)</title>
        <description>pDBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pDBP value by that pDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.

The length of time spent at an identified pSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. Baseline was Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>
