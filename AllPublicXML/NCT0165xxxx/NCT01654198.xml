    <textblock>
      When patients with psoriasis develop joint pain, it is often hard to decide whether or not
      the pain is due to psoriatic arthritis (PsA). At this time, doctors use information from the
      history and physical exam to determine the diagnosis. X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) and ultrasound have been used to help with the diagnosis but all three have
      limitations. A newer imaging technique, whole body Positron Emission Tomography/Computed
      Tomography (PET/CT) uses the idea that inflammatory cells take up sugar to locate
      inflammation in the body. Because patients with PsA have inflammatory cells in their joints
      and tendons, this type of scan allows the physician to take a picture of the whole body and
      locate inflammation. The investigators have found that some patients with psoriasis (but
      without arthritis) have inflammation in joints and tendons even before the patient has
      symptoms. In this study, the investigators will explore how well PET/CT works for assessing
      inflammation in patients with PsA. This would be a very exciting tool that could be used to
      find and treat inflammation before it causes damage or pain.
