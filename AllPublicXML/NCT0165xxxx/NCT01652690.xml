  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, observational study in Czech Republic and Slovakia is to
      describe per country the characteristics of women treated with denosumab in routine clinical
      practice and the clinical management of these patients during the first 2 years of treatment.
      In addition, the study aims to collect safety data in the real-life clinical practice
      settings on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and serious ADRs.

        <description>Serious adverse events that were considered related to denosumab were classified as serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs). A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that also: • is fatal • is life threatening (places the patient at immediate risk of death) • requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • is an “other significant medical hazard” that does not meet any of the above criteria.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
