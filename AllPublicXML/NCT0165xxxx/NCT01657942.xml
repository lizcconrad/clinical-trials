  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that focal treatment with ExAblate MRgFUS has the potential
      to be an effective non-invasive treatment for intermediate risk, organ-confined prostate
      lesions, with a low incidence of morbidity. The study hypothesis will be tested by measuring
      treatment-related safety and initial effectiveness parameters in the ExAblate MRgFUS treated
      patients, as described above.

      Objective of this pivotal trial is to assess safety and initial effectiveness of ExAblate
      MRgFUS in the treatment of intermediate risk, localized (organ confined) prostate lesions.

      ExAblate treatment will be implemented as a focal lesion-selective therapy, directed at
      pre-defined volume(s)/sector(s) in the prostate, identified by mapping biopsy and
      multi-parametric MRI, rather than a whole gland or hemi-ablation treatment.

      Safety: evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ExAblate's MRgFUS
      focal treatment of intermediate risk organ confined prostate lesions. The risk of ExAblate
      treatment-related incontinence and impotence will also be assessed in this study.

      Effectiveness: determine the lesion control effect of ExAblate's MRgFUS focal treatment of
      intermediate risk organ-confined prostate lesions (confirmed by IMAGE-guided mapping biopsy
      results).

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male subjects age 50 and older.

          2. Biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate (using a IMAGE-guided 14+ core mapping
             biopsy), and targeted cores as needed obtained up to 6 months prior to scheduled
             treatment.

          3. Patient with intermediate risk, early-stage organ-confined prostate cancer (T1a up to
             T2b, N0, M0) and voluntarily chooses ExAblate thermal ablation as the non-invasive
             treatment, who may currently be on watchful waiting or active surveillance and not in
             need of imminent radical therapy.

          4. Patient with PSA less than or equal to 20 ng/mL

          5. Gleason score 7 (4 + 3 or 3 + 4), based on mapping prostate biopsy, with no more than
             15mm cancer in maximal linear dimension in any single core.

          6. Single hemilateral index Gleason 7 lesion, identified in the prostate based on biopsy
             mapping with supporting MRI; may have secondary Gleason 6 lesion on ipsilateral or
             contralateral side confirmed with biopsy and/or MRI.

          7. Gleason 7 tumors must be MRI visible:

               1. In the event that a tumor is in contact with the capsule, the length of the
                  contact should be â‰¤ 5 mm, on axial images.
