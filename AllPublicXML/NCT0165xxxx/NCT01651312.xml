    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the routes and the extent of metabolism and excretion of YM178 after
      a single dose of 14C-radiolabeled YM178 administered as a drinking solution in healthy male
      volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Four subjects are studied in one group. Each subject stays in the clinic for 6 days, and
      receives a single oral dose of 14C-labeled YM178. Blood, plasma, urine, feces and expired air
      are collected for 96h after dosing.

      If 14C-radioactivity quick counts show that radioactivity in urine or feces is above
      acceptable limits (ie. &gt; 50 dpm/ml in urine; &gt;75 dpm in 400 mg feces) on day 5, subjects are
      requested to stay in the clinic until the levels decrease. If, after 3 days, radioactivity is
      still &gt; 50 dpm/ml in urine and/or &gt;75 dpm in 400 mg feces, urine and/or feces is collected at
      home, until the amount of radioactivity decreases.
