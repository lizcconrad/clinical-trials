  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent consequence of a stroke is a communication impairment. When patients cannot
      articulate their needs, frustration and agitation are frequent responses, often resulting in
      poor optimization of post-stroke function. Staff's lack of knowledge of communication
      strategies exacerbates the problem. A key component of patient-centred care is the ability of
      staff to communicate in such a way that allows them to understand the patient's needs.
      Members of our team developed the patient-centred communication intervention (PCCI) targeting
      registered and unregulated staff caring for complex continuing care (CCC) patients with
      communication impairments post stroke. The purpose of the study is to examine if the PCCI
      results in improved patients' quality of life and in improved staff attitudes and skills in
      caring for patients with communication impairments.
