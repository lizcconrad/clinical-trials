      The main objective of the trial is to show that doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and
      dacarbazine (ABVD)-based response-adapted therapy for advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, with
      treatment intensification (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
      procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPPesc) in case of a positive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
      positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) after one cycle of ABVD, has
      non-inferior efficacy compared with the intensive BEACOPPesc regimen. A second objective is
      to assess the prognostic value of FDG-PET/CT after one cycle of BEACOPPesc.

    <description>Hematological toxicity (blood cell count) can be significant especially for patients who will receive BEACOPPesc .
Bleomycine interstitial pneumonitis has been frequently reported and requires the immediate stop of further bleomycine administration.
Rarely, procarbazine allergy and intolerance has been reported.
Nausea &amp; vomiting due to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, dacarbazine and procarbazine may be significant.
Total reversible alopecia occurs in most cases.
Escalated BEACOPP-related toxic deaths have been reported but do not exceed those observed with standard ABVD.</description>

    <description>An experimental arm (early FDG-PET/CT-response adapted), where all patients are initially treated with a single cycle of ABVD. Very early FDG-PET/CT-negative patients continue on ABVD therapy to a total of six cycles. Very early FDG-PET/CT-positive patients receive 3 cycles of BEACOPPesc followed by another 3 cycles of BEACOPPesc. Mid-treatment evaluation is performed after 4 cycles. In case of treatment failure (less than partial remission (PR)), the patient goes off protocol treatment.
Only patients with residual FDG-PET/CT-positive disease after chemotherapy will receive radiotherapy (36 Gy/18 fractions on the FDG-PET/CT-positive residual mass(es)).</description>

    <description>A standard arm, where patients are treated with four cycles of BEACOPPesc followed by 2 cycles of BEACOPPesc. FDG-PET/CT is performed after one cycle, but with no therapeutic consequences. Mid-treatment evaluation is performed after four cycles. In case of treatment failure (less than PR), the patient goes off protocol treatment.
Only patients with residual FDG-PET/CT-positive disease after chemotherapy will receive radiotherapy (36 Gy/18 fractions on the FDG-PET/CT-positive residual mass(es)).</description>
