      This study aims to analyse the serologic response to PCV-1 in the PEDIARIX® [GSK Biologicals'
      Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant)
      and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine] and KINRIX® (GSK Biologicals' Diphtheria and Tetanus
      Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine) vaccine
      products. The samples have been collected at pre-determined time points from a subset of
      subjects who participated in selected studies [217744/085 and 213503/048] conducted in the
      United States.
