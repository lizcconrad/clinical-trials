  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to gather medium (0-5 years) and long-term (6-10 years) information
      regarding the performance and safety of the commercially available Ceramax™ Ceramic on
      Ceramic Total Hip System. This is a two-phased study consisting of a clinical follow-up phase
      and a clinical outcomes phase.

      In Phase One (0-5 years), diagnostic, demographic and operative information will be gathered
      for each subject enrolled in this study. In addition, Harris Hip Evaluations, subjective
      evaluations and radiographs will be completed annually.

      In Phase Two (6 - 10 years), a subjective outcomes questionnaire and a SF-12 Health Survey
      will be mailed to subjects annually.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized study of the 28mm Ceramic on Ceramic (COC) device. This
      study will follow each subject through 10 years postoperatively and will consist of:

        1. a clinical follow-up phase and

        2. a clinical outcomes phase.

      Radiographic and clinical follow-up exams will take place at six-weeks, six-months and then
      annually through year 5 for each subject. For years 6 - 10, a communication will be sent to
      each subject in order to collect survivorship and general health information. This
      communication will ask whether the COC device is still in vivo and, if not, when the revision
      surgery took place, why, and which components were removed, if applicable. In addition,
      subjects will be asked to complete a SF-12 Health Survey at each 6 to 10-year follow-up
      interval. A self-addressed, stamped envelope will be provided to facilitate information
      return and privacy.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is that the 10-year Kaplan-Meier survivorship estimate of the COC 28mm implanted hips will be a minimum of 90% (as recommended by National Institute of Clinical Excellence [NICE]). Based on an anticipated margin of error (ie. one-half the width of the confidence interval) of 7%, the lower 95% confidence interval will be no worse than 83%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>At five years, the Harris Hip Score must be &gt; 80 points or higher and the Harris Hip pain assessment must be mild or no pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>At 5 years, secondary radiographic outcome measures will include:
No radiolucencies &gt;2mm in any zone in any post-operative interval;
No acetabular cup migration &gt;4mm;
No change in cup inclination angle &gt;4 degrees when compared to immediate post-operative angle; and
No osteolysis.</description>

    <description>The 28 mm ceramic acetabular bearing insert component is manufactured from high purity, dense alumina matrix composite ceramic. The inserts secure to DePuy's Pinnacle acetabular shells by means of an interlocking mechanical taper. The Pinnacle acetabular shell is a hemispherical type acetabulum replacement prosthesis, is available in a range of outer diameter (OD) sizes, and is used with a 28mm femoral head. Pinnacle 100 shells will be used in this study. The BIOLOX® delta ceramic femoral head components are manufactured from the same ceramic material as the acetabular bearing insert components. The femoral head is secured to the femoral stem component with an interlocking taper.</description>
