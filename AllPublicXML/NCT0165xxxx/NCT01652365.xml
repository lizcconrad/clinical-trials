    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and impact of introducing subsidized
      malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) into retail sector drug shops in Uganda. This is a
      randomized controlled trial at the village level, taking place in 6 districts in Eastern
      Uganda. Licensed drug shops in selected villages were trained in proper RDT storage,
      administration, interpretation and disposal and were given access to subsidized RDTs for
      sale. This study explores whether drug shop owners--when given access to training and
      subsidized RDTs--will choose to promote and sell RDTs to customers and, if so, at what volume
      and what price. The investigators also explore whether shops will safely store, administer,
      interpret and dispose of RDTs and to what extent they will use RDT results to guide treatment
      recommendations. Finally, the study explores whether making RDTs available for sale in local
      drug shops has a community level impact on diagnostic testing and appropriate treatment for
      malaria.
