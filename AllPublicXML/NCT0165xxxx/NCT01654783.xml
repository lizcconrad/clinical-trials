    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to investigate how oral 5-ASA drugs have been used in the
      condition without symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea/bloody stool (remission stage),
      or in the transition from the condition with symptoms such as abdominal pain or
      diarrhea/bloody stool (active stage) to the remission stage in ulcerative colitis and to
      study how many patients will be able to maintain the remission stage during the observation
      period and how many times the patients will experience the active stage (relapse), as well as
      how symptoms will change during the observation period to discover better treatment plans.

      Period: 2012-2014 Observation Time: 0, 26week, 52week

      Matters investigated:

        1. pUCDAI scores(Stool frequency, Bloody stool, Physician's global assessment)

        2. Medication adherence (VAS scale)

        3. Remission, Relapse

        4. Age, gender, body height, body weight, date of diagnosis, extension of inflammation,
           classification by clinical course, smoking, alcohol, work, disease complication,
           duration of remission maintained to enrollment(remission patient)
