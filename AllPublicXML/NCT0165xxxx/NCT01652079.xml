  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. In addition to studying safety, Phase II
      clinical trials test if the investigational drug is effective and whether the drug works in
      treating a specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and
      that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use,
      the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of
      cancer. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet
      approved CRLX101 for your type of cancer.

      Camptothecin is a chemical extracted from plants that is the basis for the standard
      FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and topotecan. Camptothecin works by interfering
      with the way cells divide and multiply. The investigational drug CRLX101 is a formulation of
      camptothecin and a large molecule (nanoparticle)that appears to allow more of the
      camptothecin to get into tumors and stay in tumors. The persistence of the CRLX101 in the
      tumor may increase the probability that the tumor cells will be damaged.

      CRLX101 has been well tolerated in the laboratory and in participants with different kinds of
      cancer.

      Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor which has activity in many kinds of cancer.
      Bevacizumab has been successfully combined with many chemotherapy partners.

      It has been hypothesized that the combination of bevacizumab with CRLX101 might have unique
      clinical activity in combination in the treatment of this disease due to the simultaneous
      inhibition of distinct steps along the HIF → (CAIX) → VEGF → VEGFR2 pathway. Specifically, it
      is hypothesized that CRLX101-mediated inhibition of HIF-1α carries with it the potential to
      interrupt hypoxia and HIF-1α-associated resistance to VEGFR inhibitors. It is hoped that this
      combination will work to treat your type of cancer.

    <textblock>
      You will receive CRLX101 and bevacizumab through an intravenous (IV) infusion once every 14
      days. Each cycle is 28 days. You will continue to receive both drugs until you and/or the
      research doctor decides it may not be in your best interest to continue.

      You will receive premedication including decadron, zantac and benadryl to help prevent an
      allergic reaction and nausea prior to your CRLX101 infusion.You will also receive IV fluid
      before and after the study drug administration to keep you hydrated. It will be important for
      you to drink water regularly in between study visits.You will be treated as an outpatient. At
      every clinic visit, you will undergo the following assessments: Medical history, physical
      examination, vital signs, performance status, routine blood tests, urine tests, assessment
      for any new side effects, CT evaluation (every 8 weeks).

      You will have an end of study visit within 30 days of your last dose.
