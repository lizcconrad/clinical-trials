      This study looks at an 8-week hatha yoga intervention for women reporting high levels of
      stress, a risk factor for various forms of psychopathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yoga practice appears to reduce stress and associated emotions. Specifically, yoga has been
      associated with significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. These
      findings underscore the promise of yoga practice for improving mental health in women prone
      to stress.

      This study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an eight-week
      Hatha Yoga intervention for improving stress and mental health. To this end, the
      investigators will recruit 40 women high in stress to receive an 8-week hatha yoga
      intervention consisting of two weekly 90-minute sessions. At baseline and at
      post-intervention, participants will undergo several cognitive, emotional, and behavioral
      assessments, followed by a relaxation time. Primary feasibility outcomes will be the time
      required to recruit 40 participants, the number of screen failures, participant retention and
      participant adherence to the study protocol. Acceptability will be evaluated with
      questionnaires and an interview during the final visit. Primary efficacy outcomes will be
      group differences in pre- to post-intervention change in perceived stress and various mental
      health parameters.

    <description>The PSQ (Levenstein et al., 1993) is a self- report measure of cognitive and emotional reactions to perceived stressful situations. The questionnaire consists of four subscales assessing (1) worries, anxious concern for the future, feelings of desperation and frustration; (2) tension, exhaustion, and lack of relaxation; (3) positive feelings of challenge, joy, energy, and security; and (4) perceived environmental demands, such as lack of time, pressure, and overload.</description>

          -  Female patients between the ages of 25 and 45. We only will only include women in this

             interventions; e.g., Dunn et al., 2005; Trivedi et al., 2006). This criterion was
             selected in order to be able to test the effects of the yoga intervention.

          -  Written physician approval/medical clearance to participate in an exercise/yoga
             protocol.

          -  Capable and willing to give written informed consent, to understand inclusion and

          -  Currently at risk of self-harm or harm to others, in the Sponsor's opinion, based on
             clinical interview.

          -  Currently a psychiatric inpatient; have been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition
             within the past year.
