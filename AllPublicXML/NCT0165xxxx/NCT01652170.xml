  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a brief interaction with the subject or parent or guardian to
      obtain consent, collect a blood sample, medical history, and physical examination of those
      who meet the inclusion criteria. The blood sample will be tested for the WBC value, as well
      as processed into plasma in order to compute the APPY1 Test result, which is based on a
      combination of the WBC value and the plasma MRP 8/14 and CRP concentrations received from the
      APPY1 Test cassette. There will be a 2-week (14 days +/- 3) follow-up telephone call for
      those subjects that were discharged from the ED without an appendectomy or diagnosis of acute
      appendicitis. Use of the APPY1 Test to help identify low risk patients could significantly
      reduce the use of CT scans in diagnosis of AA, thereby reducing the exposure to ionizing
      radiation in children, adolescents, and young adults.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  2 to 20 years old (up until the 21st birthday),

          -  Right lower quadrant or poorly localized abdominal pain, or tenderness that includes
             the right lower quadrant, and/or other features including, but not limited to, nausea,
             vomiting, and/or anorexia, requiring acute appendicitis to be added to the
             differential,

          -  Onset of abdominal pain within 72 hours or less,

          -  Patients of either gender may participate and,

          -  Patient or accompanying parent or guardian is able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History includes prior appendectomy,

          -  Subjects whose presentation history and physical examination place them at such high
             risk of acute appendicitis that it would be clinically reasonable to proceed with
             exploratory laparotomy and/or appendectomy without advanced imaging,

          -  Treatment with any immunosuppressive medication or chemotherapeutic agents within 28
             days, or systemic steroids (oral or intravenous) within 14 days,

          -  History of end-stage, metastatic cancer or an active immune disorder,

          -  History includes abdominal trauma or invasive abdominal procedures/surgery within the
             previous two weeks,

          -  Patients who have received diagnostic imaging (CT, MRI, or US) for abdominal pain in
             the previous two weeks,

          -  Patients with report of abdominal pain greater than 72 hours,

          -  History of active bleeding disorder, which may complicate phlebotomy or placement of
             peripheral IV catheter,

          -  Participation in a research study within the previous 30 days,

          -  Prisoners of an adult or juvenile detention center, and
