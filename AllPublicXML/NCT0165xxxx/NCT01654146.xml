      The purpose of this study is to determine if weekly chemotherapy (i.e. giving paclitaxel or
      carboplatin at a lower dose every week) is more effective than standard chemotherapy
      (paclitaxel and carboplatin given once every three weeks over 18 weeks) in treating ovarian
      cancer. The investigators also want to see if weekly chemotherapy causes more or fewer
      side-effects than standard chemotherapy.

      ICON8 is a three-arm, three stage trial. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio.
      Patients in arm 1 (control arm) will receive weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel on day 1 of a
      21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Patients in arm 2 will receive carboplatin on day 1 and
      dose-fractionated weekly paclitaxel on day 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles.
      Patients in arm 3 will receive dose-fractionated weekly carboplatin and dose-fractionated
      weekly paclitaxel on day 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles.

      The trial will have three planned stages. Stage 1 will be conducted to confirm feasibility
      and safety of protocol treatment in all patients and separately in the Delayed Primary
      Surgery (DPS) patients. The outcome measure for stage 2 will be 9-month progression-free
      survival (PFS) rate. The primary outcome measures for stage 3 will be PFS and overall
      survival and secondary outcomes will be toxicity, Quality of Life and Health Economics. If
      pre-defined levels of deliverability, at stage 1, or activity, at stage 2, are not met then
      the research arms will be reconsidered.
