    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Leptin levels in females, in the setting of
      papillary thyroid cancer, benign thyroid nodules, and in normal females without thyroid
      disease.

      There will be three groups in this study, but 2 of the groups are part of another study so

        Females with no prior history of thyroid disease and not on thyroid medications.

        Active recruitment will be for normal controls only. They will be age and weight/height
        matched to females with prior diagnosis of thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules who are
        already part of another study.
