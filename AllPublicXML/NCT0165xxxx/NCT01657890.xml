  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects receive a single dose of isavuconazole on Day 1 under fasting conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are healthy, non-elderly males and females between 18 and 45 years and
             healthy, elderly males and females 65 years of age and older

          -  The subject has a body weight of at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) of 18
             to 32 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  The estimated (calculated) creatinine clearance must be within the age-appropriate
             normal range, if abnormal, the abnormality is not clinically significant, as
             determined by the Investigator

          -  Results for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and
             total bilirubin must be within the normal range

          -  The Female subject agrees to sexual abstinence, or is surgically sterile,
             postmenopausal (defined as at least 2 years at Screening without menses), or using a
             medically acceptable double barrier method (e.g. spermicide and diaphragm, or
             spermicide and condom) to prevent pregnancy and agree to continue using this method
             from Screening until 3 weeks after the follow-up visit at the end of the study; and is
             not lactating or pregnant as documented by negative pregnancy tests at Screening and
             Day -1

          -  The Male subject agrees to sexual abstinence, is surgically sterile, or is using a
             medically acceptable method to prevent pregnancy and agrees to continue using this
             method from Screening until 3 weeks after the follow-up visit at the end of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, unexplained cardiac
             arrhythmia or torsade de pointes, structural heart disease, or family history of Long
             QT syndrome (suggested by sudden death of a close relative at a young age due to
             possible or probable cardiac causes)

          -  The subject has a positive result for hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B surface
             antigen at Screening or is known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  The subject has a known or suspected allergy to any of the components of the trial
             products including the azole class of compounds, or a history of multiple and/or
             severe allergies to drugs or foods (as judged by the investigator), or a history of
             severe anaphylactic reactions

          -  The subject is a smoker (any use of tobacco or nicotine containing products) within 6
             months prior to Screening

          -  The subject, if non-elderly, has had treatment with prescription drugs or
             complementary and alternative medicines within 14 days prior to Day -1, or
             over-the-counter medications within 1 week prior to Day -1, with the exception of
             acetaminophen up to 2 g/day

          -  The subject, if elderly, has not been on stable concomitant medications (minor
             necessary dosing changes are acceptable) for at least 4 weeks prior to study drug
             administration or is taking any medication that would interfere with the evaluation of
             isavuconazole in this study (CYP3A4 inducer or inhibitor)

          -  The subject has a recent history (within the last 2 years) of drug or alcohol abuse,
             as defined by the investigator, or a positive drug and/or alcohol screen
