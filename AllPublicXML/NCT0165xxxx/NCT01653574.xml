      Malate can shrink or slow the growth of pretreated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Famitinib Malate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor mainly targeting vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor 2(VEGFR2), and its anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical
      tests. The investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and
      the recommended phase II dose is 25 mg. The hypothesis of this clinical research study is to
      discover if the study drug Famitinib Malate can shrink or slow the growth of pretreated
      HER2-negative breast cancer. The safety of Famitinib Malate will also be studied. Patients
      physical state, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained
      while on-study will help the research team decide if Famitinib Malate is safe and effective
      in pretreated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        ●≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  Women diagnosed with HER2-negative breast cancer. HER2- is defined as 0 or 1+ staining
             on immunohistochemistry or FISH/CISH negative for gene amplification.

          -  Metastatic breast cancer, confirmed by histological analysis.

          -  Have failed from the last chemotherapy regimen, but experienced at most 2 regimens in
             the relapsed or metastatic setting. Pretreated anthracycline, taxanes and capecitabine
             (any rational reason for no use of capecitabine is acceptable) are mandatory.

          -  Have failed from at least 1 endocrine therapy, if HR positive.

          -  Duration from the last therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, target therapy and
             operation) is more than 4 weeks (Duration for nitroso or mitomycin is 6 weeks).

          -  Have at least one extracranial measurable site of disease according to RECIST 1.1
             criteria that has not been previously irradiated.

          -  Life expectancy of more than 3 months.

          -  If the patients have brain or meninges metastases, the lesions must have been
             controlled at least 8 weeks.

          -  Adequate hepatic, renal, heart, and hematologic functions (hemoglobin ≥ 90g/L,
