      The intent of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy of IV ibuprofen when
      administered at induction of anesthesia. Results from this pilot study will be used to design
      and determine the appropriate statistical power for a larger, multi-center randomized study.

    <textblock>
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) are an effective adjunct to opioid analgesia
      for moderate-severe pain, with improvement in the quality of pain relief and consistent
      evidence of opioid dose sparing. NSAIDs alone could provide effective analgesia post-surgery
      when mild-moderate pain is expected. There is also evidence that the use of NSAIDs, by
      avoiding or decreasing the need for opioids, can lead to a reduction in the incidence of
      adverse events which are commonly attributed to, or exacerbated by, opioids.

      The intent of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy of IV ibuprofen when
      administered at induction of anesthesia. Results from this pilot study will be used to design
      and determine the appropriate statistical power for a larger, multi-center randomized study.

    <measure>Efficacy of IV Ibuprofen for Post-op Pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>first possible assessment following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the efficacy of IV ibuprofen for the treatment of postoperative pain as measured by patient pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) upon first possible assessment following surgery. The VAS is a continuous scale compromised of a horizontal line, one hundred millimeters in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance, in mm, on the 100 mm line between the &quot;No Pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark. The score would be between o and 100.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of patient satisfaction post-procedure. During the post-treatment period, subjects were asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire (Quality of Recovery - 40 or QoR-40) defining their quality of recovery at 24 hours following surgery. The QoR - 40 is a 40-item questionnaire that provides a global score and subscores across five dimensions of quality of recovery: emotions (minimum score = 6, maximum score = 30), physical comfort (minimum score = 8, maximum score = 40), patient support (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 35), physical independence (minimum score = 5, maximum score = 25), and pain (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 35). Higher subscores represent a better outcome.
Subscores are added to create a Global QoR-40 score. Global scores range from 40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent quality of recovery).</description>

    <time_frame>24 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the efficacy of IV ibuprofen for the treatment of postoperative pain as measured by patient pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) in the post-surgical period through 24 hours post-procedure. The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The subject is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance, in mm, on the 100 mm line between the &quot;No Pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark. The score would be between 0 and 100. Subject's were contacted at 24 hour post-discharge during a follow-up phone contact and asked to completed the VAS at Rest and VAS with Movement and return both completed VAS assessments via the envelope provided. The analysis was performed on the VAS assessments returned to the study site.</description>

        <title>Efficacy of IV Ibuprofen for Post-op Pain.</title>
        <description>Measurement of the efficacy of IV ibuprofen for the treatment of postoperative pain as measured by patient pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) upon first possible assessment following surgery. The VAS is a continuous scale compromised of a horizontal line, one hundred millimeters in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance, in mm, on the 100 mm line between the &quot;No Pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark. The score would be between o and 100.</description>

        <title>Patient Satisfaction.</title>
        <description>Measurement of patient satisfaction post-procedure. During the post-treatment period, subjects were asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire (Quality of Recovery - 40 or QoR-40) defining their quality of recovery at 24 hours following surgery. The QoR - 40 is a 40-item questionnaire that provides a global score and subscores across five dimensions of quality of recovery: emotions (minimum score = 6, maximum score = 30), physical comfort (minimum score = 8, maximum score = 40), patient support (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 35), physical independence (minimum score = 5, maximum score = 25), and pain (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 35). Higher subscores represent a better outcome.
Subscores are added to create a Global QoR-40 score. Global scores range from 40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent quality of recovery).</description>

The QoR - 40 is a 40-item questionnaire that provides a global score and subscores across five dimensions of quality of recovery: emotions (minimum score = 6, maximum score = 30), physical comfort (minimum score = 8, maximum score = 40), patient support (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 35), physical independence (minimum score = 5, maximum score = 25), and pain (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 35). Higher subscores represent a better outcome.
Subscores are added to create a Global QoR-40 score. Global scores range from 40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent quality of recovery).</description>

        <title>Measurement of the Efficacy of IV Ibuprofen for the Treatment of Postoperative Pain as Measured by the Pain Intensity as Assess by Patient Pain Intensity (VAS) in the Post-surgical Period, Through 24 Hours</title>
        <description>Measurement of the efficacy of IV ibuprofen for the treatment of postoperative pain as measured by patient pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) in the post-surgical period through 24 hours post-procedure. The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The subject is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance, in mm, on the 100 mm line between the &quot;No Pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark. The score would be between 0 and 100. Subject's were contacted at 24 hour post-discharge during a follow-up phone contact and asked to completed the VAS at Rest and VAS with Movement and return both completed VAS assessments via the envelope provided. The analysis was performed on the VAS assessments returned to the study site.</description>
