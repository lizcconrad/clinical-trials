  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility, tolerability and
      safety of surgical debulking and resection with heated intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC)
      followed by repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for treatment of recurrent ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinomas.

      This is a phase II , open label, single center study of surgery followed by heated
      intraoperative cisplatin in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian
      tube cancers. Approximately twenty patients will receive surgery and intraoperative
      (hyperthermic) cisplatin followed by four consecutive courses of outpatient intraperitoneal
      cisplatin and doxorubicin given on days 1 and 8 during a 3 week cycle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian
             tube carcinoma.

          2. Patients must have measurable evidence of recurrent intraabdominal disease based on
             Computed tomography (CT scan) findings.

          3. Patients must fulfill the following with regard to prior chemotherapy:

               1. 4 weeks or greater since conclusion of prior chemotherapy;

               2. Prior intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin is acceptable; and,

             abnormalities.

          3. Prior radiation therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          4. Have uncontrolled active systemic infection requiring therapy.

          5. Have a history of allergic reaction attributable to compounds containing boron or

          7. Have had a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not to be registered. Patients who are not
             considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and
             are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse.

          8. Have had any investigational agent within 4 weeks before enrollment into the study.

          9. Have a history of a serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent
             or, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient a poor study candidate.

         10. Evidence of extraabdominal metastasis on preinclusion thoracic computed tomography
             (CT) scans (i.e. brain or chest disease).
