  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of 2 different Prothrombin Complex
      Concentrates (PCCs) on their ability to reverse (normalize) the pharmacodynamic effects of
      rivaroxaban in healthy adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label (volunteers and staff will know the identity of all
      treatments), randomized (volunteers assigned to treatment by chance) study in healthy adult
      volunteers to assess the effects of 2 different Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs)
      (drugs that act to control bleeding) on the pharmacodynamics (ie, the study of the
      biochemical and physiological effects of a drug on the body) of rivaroxaban (a drug that acts
      to prevent the formation of blood clots). Eligible volunteers will receive treatment with
      rivaroxaban administered orally (by mouth) on Days 1-4. On Day 5, rivaroxaban will be
      administered orally before the randomized intravenous (IV) (into the vein) administration of
      1 of 3 treatments: Profilnine SD (a 3-factor PCC), Beriplex P/N (a 4-factor PCC), or saline.
      Blood samples will be collected from healthy volunteers during the study to assess the
      activity of rivaroxaban. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. The total length of
      participation in the study for each volunteer will be approximately 28 days (includes a
      21-day Screening Period and a 7-day Treatment Period).

    <description>Pharamacodymic (PD) variables (ie, PT, INR, aPTT, TGA, and anti-FXa) are blood coagulation (or clotting) tests. These blood clotting tests will be performed to assess the effects of Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs) (Profilnine SD or Beriplex P/N) on the pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban.</description>
