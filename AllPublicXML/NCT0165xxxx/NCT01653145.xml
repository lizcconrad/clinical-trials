  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the metabolic and behavioral effects of a positive
      energy balance induced by adding food to the usual level of activity.

      It is hypothesized that: 1) food intake will not differ significantly after 2 days of
      positive energy balance induced by a high carbohydrate vs. high fat diet when both diets are
      low in energy density, and 2) food intake will be higher after a positive energy balance
      induced by a high fat/high energy dense diet vs. a high fat/low energy dense diet.

      The purpose of this trial is to examine the metabolic and behavioral effects of a positive
      energy balance induced by adding food to the usual level of activity. During this study, we
      will induce a positive energy balance for two days by increasing food intake to 140% of
      baseline energy requirements and keeping energy expenditure constant. The following three
      diets, which vary in dietary fat and energy density (kcal/g), will be used to induce the
      positive energy balance in a within subjects or cross over design: 1) high fat/high energy
      density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density. Food
      intake and activity will be measured for 4 days after each diet to quantify the response to
      positive energy balance and manipulation of dietary fat and energy density.

             ovaries), or use an IUD not made of copper.

          -  You use prescriptions or over-the-counter medications or herbal products that affect
             metabolism or body weight (e.g. weight loss medications such as sibutramine, or
             orlistat).
