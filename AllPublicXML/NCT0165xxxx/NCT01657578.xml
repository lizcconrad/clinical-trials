  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;The principal aim of this trial is to determine the minimum effective dose of omeprazole in
      neonates with GERD objectively diagnosed by a 24-h intra-oesophageal pH monitoring (pHmetry),
      to obtain a short-term efficacy in the pHmetry of control performed 72 hrs ± 24 after
      initiation of omeprazole.

      The secondary objectives of the study were: (1) to assess the efficacy of omeprazole upon
      other pHmetry parameters, (2) to characterize the population pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacogenetics of omeprazole, (3) to evaluate the effect of omeprazole upon oro-pharyngeal
      pH monitoring and (4) to assess the short-term safety of use of omeprazole in neonates.&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor increasingly prescribed in the neonatal population for
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complicated or not by the presence of esophagitis.
      Although extensively evaluated in adults, optimal dosing schemas, efficacy and safety have
      not been determined in the neonatal population where its prescription remains off-label. The
      study is a double blind trial that was designed using a Bayesian sequential analysis
      approach. The principle of this approach is to identify the adequate drug dosage to obtain a
      level of efficacy as close as possible to a predetermined target level of efficacy in the
      population. In this study, five different dosages of omeprazole are tested (1, 1,5, 2, 2,5, 3
      mg/kg/day) and a target probability of successful treatment of 95% has been chosen. To assess
      the influence of gestational age on omeprazole's efficacy, analysis was stratified on 3
      groups: (1) neonates of less than 32 weeks gestational age (GA), (2) neonates born between 32
      and 35 weeks of GA, (3) neonates of more than 36 weeks of GA.

      A total maximum number of 90 neonates is expected to be included (30 neonates per group).

      Patients' participation in the study ends after completion of the pHmetry of control that is
      72 ±24 hours after omeprazole initiation.

      Patients in the study will all benefit for the management of their GERD from
      non-pharmacological therapies such as adequate positioning and use of available thickening
      agents for formula The only pharmacologic agent authorised during study for treating GERD is
      omeprazole. All other available GERD treatments will not be prescribed.&quot;
