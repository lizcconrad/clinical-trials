  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to examine the contribution of intense pulsed light (IPL) for
      relieving signs and symptoms of dry eye due to meibomian gland dysfunction. The effect of IPL
      will be examined in a study designed as a randomized controlled trial. In the study arm,
      subjects will undergo 4 treatment sessions, consisting of IPL pulses immediately followed by
      meibomian gland expression (MGX). In the control arm, subjects will undergo the same
      treatments, except that the IPL pulses will be disabled. For each subject, the duration of
      the study will be 10 weeks, as explained in the detailed description.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcome measures (tear break-up time,meibography, self-assessed symptoms and close up photos
      of the lid margins) will be measured at baseline. All subjects will receive 4 treatments at 2
      weeks intervals. In each treatment session, a subject allocated to the study group will be
      treated with intense pulsed light (IPL) administered in the malar region, from tragus to
      tragus including the nose, 2-3 mm below the lower eyelids. Immediately following the IPL
      administration, the subject will undergo meibomian gland expression (MGX) in both eyelids of
      both eyes. Subjects in the control arm will receive exactly the same treatment, except that
      the IPL administration will be sham. A single follow-up will occur at 10 weeks after the
      baseline (or 4 weeks after the 4th treatment session). At the follow-up, the changes in the
      outcome measures will be evaluated, and compared between the two arms.

      For each subject, the duration of the study will be 10 weeks: 1st treatment at baseline; 2nd
      treatment at 2 weeks after baseline; 3rd treatment at 4 weeks after baseline; 4th treatment
      at 6 weeks after baseline; and a single follow-up at 10 weeks after baseline).

      Statistically significant differences between the two arms will support the study hypothesis
      that IPL treatment itself provides relief to both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subjects in the study arm will receive a series of IPL pulses using the M22 IPL handpiece. In subjects of the control arm, the device will be disabled. The subject will feel the lightguide on the skin, will hear clicking sounds, but no light will be actually produced by the M22 device. Since during treatment both eyes of the subject will be fully occluded, no subject will be able to see if the treatment is actual or sham. There is no way to completely mask the subjects, since the IPL generally causes slight redness of the skin, and in some patients is may also cause some discomfort</masking_description>
