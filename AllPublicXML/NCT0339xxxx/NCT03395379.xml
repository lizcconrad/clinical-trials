      The investigators aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using ambient air to
      protect against thermal injury during RadioFrequency Ablation (RFA) for Renal Cell Carcinoma
      (RCC) based on data from cases at their institute.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been increasing, particularly among patients
      &gt;65 years of age. As older individuals are at higher risk for surgical complications, the use
      of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small renal masses (SRM) &lt;4 cm in size, which include
      T1a tumors,may be a compelling treatment option for elderly patients. However, RFA uses heat
      to destroy abnormal tissue, with the risk of thermal injury to tissues and organs, including
      gastric tissue and nerve roots, which are in proximity to the targeted treatment zone. The
      incidence rate of major complication with RFA, including thermal wounds, has been reported to
      vary between 3.2% and 5.2%. Different thermal protection methods have been developed to lower
      the risk of injury to adjacent tissues during ablation, such as air dissection using CO2
      injection and hydrodissection using G5% for shielding. Although both of these options are
      effective, they are expensive. To lower the cost of thermal protection, the investigators
      have been using ambient air instead of CO2 for air dissection prior to RFA for SRM-RCCs.

        The study cohort is selected from our institution. Patients with a single SRM of &lt;4 cm,
        confirmed as RCC on biopsy, are offered RFA as an alternative to open resection. In cases
        in which vital tissues are located within 10 mm of the target treatment area, air
        dissection are planned if the patient provide his consent.
