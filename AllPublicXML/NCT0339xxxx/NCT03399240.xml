    <textblock>
      This is a single site evaluation study of Vitastiq device accuracy in healthy men and women
      in ratio 1:1 (approximately) aged between 18 and 64 years. A total of 45 Vitastiq personal
      devices will be used by volunteers for two months. The Vitastiq device will be evaluated
      during three site visits: on day 1, 29 ± 4 days and 57 ± 4 days. During site visit days,
      blood sampling will be collected and analysed and readings using Vitastiq device will be
      performed. Data will be analysed retrospectively to evaluate Vitastiq performance compared to
      blood tests results.
