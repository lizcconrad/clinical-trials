      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Adipose derived
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (AD-MSCs) plus Calpocitriol Ointment with moderate to severe
      psoriasis. Any adverse events related to AD-MSCs infusion will be monitored.The primary
      outcome is the reduction rate of PASI(Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and treatment
      response will be computed from PASI before and after treatment.
