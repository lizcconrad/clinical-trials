  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of autologous bone
      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells compared to placebo (sham operation) when administered
      via percutaneous coronary infusion to patients with ischemic heart failure, who are screened
      by D-SPECT and have pretreated with 3-month cardiac shock wave therapy.
