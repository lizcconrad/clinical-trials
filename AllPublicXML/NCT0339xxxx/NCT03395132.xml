  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Fucicort® Lipid cream with the
      combination treatment of Fucidin® cream followed by betamethasone (Lianbang Beisong®) cream,
      or Fucicort® Lipid cream vehicle, when applied twice daily for two weeks. The trial is
      designed to demonstrate that treatment with Fucicort® Lipid cream is not inferior to the
      combination treatment with the mono component drugs, Fucidin® cream followed by betamethasone
      (Lianbang Beisong®) cream and that treatment with Fucicort® Lipid cream is superior to the
      treatment with Fucicort® Lipid cream vehicle. This is a 3-arm, parallel group, active- and
      vehicle-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety after 14 days treatment of
      Fucicort® Lipid cream, to Fucidin® cream followed by betamethasone (Lianbang Beisong®) cream,
      or Fucicort® Lipid cream vehicle, in subjects with clinically infected AD/eczema.

    <masking_description>In order to keep the trial investigator-blind, packaging and labelling of the outer box will be identical for all investigational medicinal products (IMPs). Handling of individual tubes of IMP will therefore be handled by a designated third person. Individual tubes of IMP will be inaccessible for the (sub)investigator and other trial staff involved in evaluation of subjects and conduct of the trial. Subjects will be instructed to only reveal the IMP to the drug dispenser and not to the trial staff.</masking_description>

    <description>The percentage change in modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (m-EASI) on trunk and extremities from baseline to Day 15. The m-EASI is a composite score evaluating the severity of 4 clinical signs (erythema, oedema/induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) and the extent of the disease on each of 3 body regions (upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs) by use of standard scales. The maximum total score is 64.8, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition.</description>

Ongoing (serious or non-serious) AE with a possible, probable, or non-assessable relationship to the IMP at the last visit in the treatment phase. The investigator should follow up on the outcome for 14±2 days or until the final outcome is determined.
