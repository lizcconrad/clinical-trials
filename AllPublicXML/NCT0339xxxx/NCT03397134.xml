      MIN-101C07 is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MIN-101 in adult schizophrenia
      patients.The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 fixed doses of MIN-101
      compared to placebo in improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia over 12 weeks of
      double-blind treatment as measured by the change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) Marder negative symptoms factor score (NSFS) over 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Marder negative symptoms factor score (NSFS) derived from the complete Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) has been the most frequently used scale in schizophrenia clinical studies focusing on negative symptoms The PANSS measures comprehensive psychiatric symptoms, including positive, negative, and general symptoms. The full PANSS rates the patient on 30 different symptoms from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme) based on an interview as well as reports of family members or primary care hospital workers. The NSFS consists of the sum of the negative symptom PANSS items N1, N2, N3, N4, N6, G7, and G16 (minimum score = 7; maximum score = 49). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Personal and Social Performance (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale is used to evaluate the effect of treatment with antipsychotic drugs on functional performance.The PSP considers 4 areas of social and individual performance (socially useful activities, including work and study; personal and social relationships; self-care; disturbing and aggressive behaviors). The clinician must assign an initial six-degree of severity to each area (absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe or very severe). Then, in a table with levels of score set the correspondent decimal (e.g., 21-30), according to the observed performance and, within the decimal range, the assigned unit to determine the final score (e.g., within the range 21-30, the performance corresponds to the score 24). The resulting final value is a single measurement from zero to 100% of functioning.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients</description>
