  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with polio sequelae have persistent and progressive worsening more than 15
      years after the initial damage, with loss of muscle strength, asthenia and musculoskeletal
      pain. In these patients, there is a denervation process associated with insufficient
      reinnervation. The frequency of this syndrome post-polio (SPP) is of the order of 20 to 60%
      according to the studies. In the literature, several studies have advanced the hypothesis of
      immune dysregulation to this late degradation, with greater expression of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, and abnormal phenotypic expression of T cells in the bloodstream. In this context,
      the use of immunomodulatory immunoglobulin IV treatment was studied several times, with no
      significant result on pain, fatigue and muscle strength scores. In the absence of significant
      efficacy of immunoglobulin treatment, the objective of this study is therefore to define the
      immunological profile of patients with post-polio syndrome, compared with control subjects,
      in order to support the pathophysiology of this syndrome. to study the possible presence of
      an inflammatory syndrome associated with this syndrome. On the other hand, depending on the
      results found, referral to targeted therapies could be considered.
