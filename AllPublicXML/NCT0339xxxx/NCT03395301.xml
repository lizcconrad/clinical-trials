  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study is to investigate the success rate of proximal tubal occlusion with coil devices
      in women with hydrosalinx and to observe there pregnancy rate with IVF-ET.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will recruit 80 females with unilateral or bilateral
      hydrosalpinx as confirmed by HSG. Tubal ligation may be a safe and effective method in the
      treatment of hydrosalpinx. But in this study, investigators will use fiber platinum coils to
      occlude the tubes. After the treatment, IVF-ET will be applied,and then the patients'
      pregnancy rate will be assessed in the following-up.
