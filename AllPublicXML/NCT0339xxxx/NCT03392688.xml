  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early activation of lateral hamstrings (LH) in respect of medial hamstrings (MH) may cause
      abnormal knee abduction and external rotation moments in individuals. This situation may
      increase the risk of ligament injury and may be the reason for susceptibility of
      patellofemoral pain (PFP). The aim of this study is to compare the time delays in
      electromyographic studies between medial and lateral hamstrings in patients with PFP and
      asymptomatic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a very common complaint in younger population with still unclear
      and controversial etiology. It was suggested that a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
      factors cause PFP. The strain of the retropatellar subcondral bone caused by excessive
      lateral patellar tracking is known to be the one among intrinsic factors (Thomee R.1999).
      Imbalance of the dynamics between knee extensor muscles, Vastus Medialis (VM) and Vastus
      Lateralis (VL), has also received a great research interest during last 10 years. However,
      uneven timing between onsets of counterpart knee flexor muscles, Lateral and Medial
      hamstring, were just considered as a possible etiological factor of the PFP (Patil S.2011),
      yet this hypothesis remains to be proven. The investigators aimed to investigate whether
      there is a relative time delays of the LH (biceps femoris, BF) and MH (semitendinosus, ST)
      during the walking at the self-selected speed in patients with patellofemoral pain. Even
      though dynamic EMG investigations are challenging because of cross-talks between muscles,
      hence difficult to determine clearly onset times, the investigators think that any
      information acquired during walking would be highly important because patellofemoral pain is
      mainly exaggerated by dynamic activities.

      15 patients who were diagnosed with PFP (age 28.73±7.44, height 169.73±7.09, weight
      67.47±14.31) and 15 asymptomatic subjects (age 30.47±6.22, height 167.87±7.81, weight
      67.87±13.48) were recruited in the study. The inclusion criteria for PFP subjects was
      presence of the anterior and retropatellar pain for minimum 2 months scaled as 3 in
      accordance with Numeric Analog Scale during at least two of the following activities: stair
      descending, ascending, squatting, prolonged sitting, jumping, sitting on the knees. Surface
      EMG was recorded from Medial Hamstring and Lateral Hamstring muscles at 1000 Hz sampling rate
      during walking at participants' normal walking speed. EMG data obtained from 5 gait trials
      were evaluated. The EMG traces were full wave rectified and low pass filtered at 50 Hz. Delay
      in timing before heel strikes between MH and LH was calculated. Statistical significance
      between differences in time delays was analysed using &quot;paired sample t-test&quot;.

    <masking_description>The algorithm used to calculate the onset of the EMG was identified according to the point at which the signal deviated by more than three times standard deviations, for a minimum of 25 ms from the baseline level (computing started 200 ms prior to the start of walking). MatLab program (R2011 version) was used for design a custom made program for data analysis. Additionally to automatic calculation, all data was visually checked to ensure that there was no signal noise, deteriorating the signal analysis, possibly caused by the movement artefact. A blind assessor visualy checked the onsets of the MH and LH muscles and record the onset time.</masking_description>

    <description>The surface EMG electrodes (silver/silver chloride, pre-gelled, Ambu Blue Sensor, Denmark) (Konrad P.) with an interelectrode distance of 20 mm between centers were used to record an EMG signal during walking. Portable 8 channel (TELEEMG, BTS, Milan, Italy) with built in x10 amplifications, 10-450 Hz bandpass and sampling rate of 1000 Hz were used for recording. The location and orientation of the electrodes for each MH (ST) and LH (BF) were identified according to SENIAM (Surface ElectromyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles) criteria</description>

    <measure>kujala patellofemoral pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the begining of the study each participant was asked to complete the scale. It took average 10 minutes. Performed once.</time_frame>
    <description>Kujala patellofemoral pain scale (Kujala 1993) is composed of 13 items that evaluate subjective symptoms and functional limitations. Minimum score is 0 points and maximum score is 100 points; higher values represent a worse outcome. Kujala patellofemoral pain scale is reported to be responsive, valid and demonstrates high test-retest reliability (Crosley K.2014). Turkish version of the Kujala patellofemoral pain score was used in our study (Kuru T. 2010).</description>
