  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study plans to learn more about the role of female sex hormones on adipose
      tissue (or fat) and the gut microbiome (or the organisms that are in your digestive tract).
      The rationale for this study is that the rate at which women gain fat (especially in the
      stomach region) increases after menopause. It is thought to be due to the loss of estrogen
      because post-menopausal women who take estrogen gain less weight than those who do not take
      estrogen. Gut bacteria process estrogen and help determine the types of estrogen that
      circulate in the body. These bacteria can be changed with lifestyle factors such as diet, and
      may therefore, also affect the risk of diseases that are more common in women after menopause
      i.e., cardiovascular disease and cancer. In this study the investigators will obtain fat
      biopsies before and after 6 months of ovarian hormone suppression to measure how the fat
      cells change with the loss of female sex hormones (e.g., medical menopause). The
      investigators will also obtain stool and urine samples before and every month during the
      study to measure changes in the microbiome.

    <description>Participants will undergo 6 months of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHag) therapy (intramuscular injection of leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg for depot suspension; Lupron; TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.; Lake Forest, IL) to chronically suppress ovarian hormones. A single injection of leuprolide acetate produces an initial stimulation (for up to 3 wk) followed by a prolonged suppression of pituitary gonadotropins and ovarian hormones. Repeated monthly dosing suppresses ovarian hormone secretion.</description>
