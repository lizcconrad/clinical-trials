    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to conduct a multi-site RCT to evaluate the replicability
      and efficacy of the ReInventing Yourself after SCI intervention in improving health and
      function outcomes for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). A total of 252 participants will
      be randomized to one of three research arms: 1) Group treatment plus workbook (Group), 2)
      individual self-study through YouTube video plus workbook (Indiv), and 3) no treatment, no
      workbook (Control). Participants randomized to the Group arm will attend 6 weekly group
      sessions led by a pair of group facilitators and will utilize the study workbook. Indiv arm
      participants will receive the workbook and will be instructed to independently access YouTube
      videos of the group session content. Control arm participants will not receive any
      intervention during the 6 week period. Participants in all three arms will be assessed at
      identical time points throughout the study: baseline, 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks,
      and 46 weeks.

      It is hypothesized that individuals in the Group intervention arm will show greater
      improvements after the six week intervention in SCI-specific and general self-efficacy,
      emotional well-being, increased societal participation, less depressive and anxiety
      symptomatology, and improved resilience than participants in the Indiv and Control arms.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
      evaluate the replicability and efficacy of a structured six-week, manualized, group therapy
      intervention, ReInventing Yourself after SCI that delivers positive psychology concepts
      within a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based model. The goals of this RCT are to
      increase SCI-specific and general self-efficacy, enhance emotional well-being, and improve
      participation in society for people with SCI living in the community. Craig Hospital is the
      lead site for this study, collaborating with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and
      Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in New Jersey.

      The intervention is delivered through six sessions, each lasting approximately 2 hours. Eight
      skills are presented over the course of the intervention to address reframing a person's
      method of looking at events, building confidence by focusing on personal strengths,
      developing methods of recognizing and appreciating the good in one's life and expressing
      gratitude for positive attributes. These skills are presented in a specific sequence through
      a workbook so that participants can gain mastery of introductory concepts before undertaking
      those that are both more difficult and complex.

      The RCT will have three research arms: 1) Group treatment plus workbook (Group), 2)
      individual self-study through YouTube video plus workbook (Indiv), and 3) no group or
      individual sessions, no workbook (Control). It is hypothesized that presenting the positive
      psychotherapy topics in an interactive structured CBT group format while restructuring
      maladaptive thought processes and providing experiential opportunities to reinforce
      behavioral change will result in increased self-efficacy, enhanced well-being and improved
      societal participation. Three specific hypotheses will be tested:

      Hypothesis 1 (Primary): Individuals in the Group arm will show greater improvements after the
      six week intervention in SCI-specific and general self-efficacy, emotional well-being,
      increased societal participation, less depressive and anxiety symptomatology, and improved
      resilience than participants in the Indiv and Control arms.

      Hypothesis 2 (Secondary): Individuals in the Group arm will maintain greater improvements
      through 46 weeks post-intervention in SCI-specific self-efficacy than participants in the
      Indiv and Control arms.

      Hypothesis 3 (Secondary): Individuals in the Group arm will show greater improvements after
      six weeks of treatment and through 46 weeks post-intervention in general self-efficacy, life
      satisfaction, community participation, resilience, and less depressive and anxiety
      symptomatology than participants in the Indiv and Control groups.

      The Moorong Self-Efficacy Scale (MSES) will serve as the primary outcome measure for this
      study. Secondary outcome measures include the General Self-Efficacy Scale, Diener
      Satisfaction with Life Scale, and measures of participation, resilience, anxiety and
      depression.

      Each collaborating site will enroll 84 individuals to be randomized into one of the three
      study arms in waves of 21 people per wave (4 waves per site). Training of site facilitators
      will take place at Craig Hospital.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Moorong Self-Efficacy Scale (MSES) - assessing change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>The MSES will be administered at baseline and subsequent follow-up assessments (i.e., 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 46 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSES is a 16 item self-report measure of self-efficacy related to everyday life activities, designed specifically for persons with SCI. Individuals use a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very uncertain) to 7 (very certain) to rate their ability to perform 16 everyday tasks, with higher scores representing greater perceived self-efficacy. A Total Score, ranging from 16 to 112 is calculated by summing all item responses</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES)- assessing change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>The GSES will be administered at baseline and subsequent follow-up assessments (i.e., 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 46 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The GSES is a questionnaire designed to assess a person's ability to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life, with ten items scored using a Likert rating scale, ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (exactly true).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diener Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)- assessing change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>The SWLS will be administered at baseline and subsequent follow-up assessments (i.e., 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 46 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SWLS will be used to measure global life satisfaction. This is a five item measure on which respondents rate their life satisfaction using a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A Total Score is calculated by summing each of the items, and has a range of 5 to 35, with higher scores representing greater perceived QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools - Objective (PART-O)- assessing change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>The PART-O will be administered at baseline and subsequent follow-up assessments (i.e., 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 46 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PART-O is a 24-item assessment of participation and has demonstrated good psychometric properties in measuring participation for people living with disabilities. An Averaged Total Score is computed by taking the mean of 17 items, with scores ranging from 0 (never participate in these types of activities) to 5 (almost always participate in these types of activities), with higher scores representing greater participation. This assessment will be utilized to measure overall participation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9)- assessing change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>The PHQ-9 will be administered at baseline and subsequent follow-up assessments (i.e., 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 46 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 9 item scale that will be used to assess depression. Respondents rate the frequency at which specific problems have been bothersome during the past two weeks, using a four point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A Total Score is calculated by summing all items, with higher scores indicating an increasing severity of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)- assessing change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>The GAD-7 will be administered at baseline and subsequent follow-up assessments (i.e., 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 46 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a brief 7 item measure that will be used to assess the severity of general anxiety. Using a four point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all sure) to 3 (nearly every day), respondents rate how often they have been bothered by specific symptoms during the past two weeks. A Total Severity Score, ranging from 0 to 21, is calculated by summing all items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) short form- assessing change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>The CD-RISC 10 will be administered at baseline and subsequent follow-up assessments (i.e., 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 46 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CD-RISC 10 will be used to measure resilience. The measure consists of 10 items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all of the time). The scale measures how the participant felt over the past month. The questionnaire produces an overall resilience score that ranges from 0-40, with higher scores representing greater resilience.</description>
