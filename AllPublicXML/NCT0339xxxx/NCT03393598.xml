  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the preparation of the recipient site prior to autologous fat
      grafting (AFG) using different methods.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous fat grafting is emerging as a powerful tool for soft tissue reconstruction and
      augmentation and is widely used in plastic surgery. However, there is great variability in
      terms of long-term graft retention (survival). Moreover, the recipient site preparation is
      the phase of the procedure which received less attention in clinical and pre-clinical
      investigations. To provide information regarding an effective preparation of the recipient
      site may potentially lead to improvements in fat graft survival.
