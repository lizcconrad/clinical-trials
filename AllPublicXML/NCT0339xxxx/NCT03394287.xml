    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, Open-labeled,Two-arms Investigator-initiated Clinical Trial of SHR-1210
      (Anti-PD-1 Antibody) in Combination With Apatinib (VEGFR2 inhibitor) in Subjects with
      Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

      Subjects with Triple Negative Breast Cancer will be recruited. There are 2 cohorts in this
      study, the first cohort is SHR-1210 combination with apatinib daily dosing，the second cohort
      is SHR-1210 combination with apatinib intermittent dosing, each cohort will enrolle10-29
      subjects (Simons two stage design).

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 combination with apatinib in
      the treatment of advanced TNBC.
