  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if a brief educational program can alter the attitudes
      and knowledge of individuals with chronic back pain, which is likely to be non-structural in
      nature.

      Individuals will be randomly assigned to an experimental condition (performs written
      educational and emotional awareness exercises) or a control condition (completes a general
      health activities questionnaire). Comparisons will be made to assess the degree of
      centralized pain features and functional improvements at 1-month follow-up

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English-speaking adults ages 18 years or older with internet access who are referred
             to the University of Michigan Health Service Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
             Spine Program identified the physician with chronic nonspecific back pain (longer than
             3 months) or fibromyalgia. Degenerative changes seen on imaging are considered
             nonspecific. Alternatively, enrolled in the University of Michigan Health Research
             Volunteer Pool with a profile that includes chronic low back pain or fibromyalgia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any signs of a serious underlying condition (cancer, infection, cauda equine), spinal
             stenosis or radiculopathy, or other specific spinal cause (vertebral compression
             fracture or ankylosing spondylitis). Those patients who are being considered for an
             interventional spine procedures or surgical consults would not be included in this
             study.

          -  Individuals receiving or applying for compensation or disability, the inability to
             provide written informed consent, severe physical impairment (e.g. blindness,
             deafness), co-morbid medical condition limiting function (e.g. malignant cancer), the
             use of illicit drug use, or a psychiatric condition that would limit judgment.
