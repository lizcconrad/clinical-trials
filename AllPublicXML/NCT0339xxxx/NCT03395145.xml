      Evaluation of Bone volume Changes after socket preservation using Geistlich Bio-Oss® Collagen
      and Geistlich Mucograft® Seal compared to natural healing after tooth extraction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade dental implants have become widely used for oral rehabilitation. But, the
      usage of dental Implants might be difficult in cases of alveolar bone deficiencies.

      Different ridge preservation techniques were successfully used, using membrane with or
      without bone substitutes.new grafting material is Mucograft Seal, a collagen matrix graft,
      which originally used as an alternative to the connective tissue graft for the treatment of
      gingival recessions. Mucograft has demonstrated a good tissue reaction with high
      biocompatibility and a low shrinkage tendency, in order to increase the amount of keratinized
      gingiva in the augmented area.

      Study Hypothesis: The observed changes in ridge dimensions when using Geistlich Bio-Oss®
      Collagen and Geistlich Mucograft® Seal as ridge preservation will be less pronounced in
      comparison to natural healing after tooth extraction.

    <description>The socket width (buccal-lingual aspect) will be assessed at the following reference points:
3-(∆ACH pre-post) millimeters apical to the alveolar crest, where the buccal and lingual walls are intact.
5-(∆ACH pre-post) millimeters apical to the alveolar crest, where the buccal and lingual walls are intact.
The width of each cortical buccal and lingual bone plate, 3 millimeters apical to the alveolar crest.
The width of each cortical buccal and lingual bone plate, 5 millimeters apical to the alveolar crest.</description>

    <description>Alveolar crest height (ACH) will be measured from the apical part of the stent to the bone crest at the mid M-D distance of the socket.</description>

    <description>In the lower jaw the keratinized tissue width will be measured from the apical part of the stent to the mucogingival line on the buccal and lingual sides. On the upper jaw only the keratinized tissue on the buccal side will be measured.</description>
