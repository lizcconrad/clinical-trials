  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who were previously treated with Adaptimmune NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are asked to take
      part in this study to see how safe NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are and what side effects they might
      cause over 15 years. Patients will not be treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells as part of this
      study.

      For a period of 15 years starting from last treatment with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells, patients will
      visit their study doctor to have their blood checked for any changes that might have happened
      because of the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells. Patients can receive other therapies for their cancer
      while they are being followed for long term safety in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who
      have, in a previous Adaptimmune clinical trial, received NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T by a process that
      utilizes lentiviral vectors. A dynamic list of studies associated with this protocol will be
      included in the Study Procedures Manual. This protocol is designed in adherence with FDA and
      EMA guidelines.

      The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed
      to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Adaptimmune clinical studies. Subjects will undergo
      clinical evaluation (i.e., new medical history, physical exam, adverse events, and exposure
      to mutagenic agents, anti-cancer therapies and investigational products in other clinical
      studies) with careful attention to adverse events possibly related to gene transfer or
      lentivirus-induced diseases. Blood samples will be collected for evaluating persistence of
      cells with lentiviral vector sequences, the detection of replication competent lentivirus
      (RCL), and chemistry and hematology laboratory assessments. Subjects will be followed for
      survival.
