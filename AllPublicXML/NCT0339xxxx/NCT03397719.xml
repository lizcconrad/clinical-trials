  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness
      of parent coaching sessions using video-based feedback, compared to the sessions without the
      use of video-based feedback on parent strategy use.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of video-based feedback interventions for the
      parents of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the beginning of the study,
      each participant will be randomized to the video-based feedback condition (treatment
      condition) or standard care procedure (control condition). All participants will be asked to
      implement the strategies taught during the sessions in the home environment (e.g., following
      the child's lead, sitting face-to-face). Participants randomized into the video-based
      feedback condition (treatment condition) will be asked to video-tape their interactions with
      their children (maximum 30 mins/week at home during free play, book reading, bath or meal
      time routines). The therapist then will review the tapes and then use the recorded sessions
      to give feedback on the parents' use of strategies in addition to providing in-vivo feedback
      based on the live interactions during the sessions. For parents whose children are randomized
      into the standard care condition, the families will receive coaching based on in-vivo
      sessions as described above. For all participants, a battery of assessment (diagnostic,
      developmental testing), will be administered at the beginning of the study participation, in
      the mid-point at 3 months, at the end of their 6-month participation of treatment sessions,
      and then at the follow-up period, 6 months after the end of their participation of the
      treatment sessions.
