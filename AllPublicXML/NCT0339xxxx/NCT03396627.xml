  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: Upper eyelid retraction was believed to be maintained solely by voluntary
      contraction of the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) and frontalis muscles, together with
      involuntary contraction of the sympathetically innervated Müller's muscle (MM). However,
      several studies have suggested that the LPS also undergoes involuntary contractions, and that
      a visual stimulus may not be the only trigger for frontalis muscle contractions. Recent
      studies hypothesized that the MM contains proprioceptive neuronal structures, which elicit
      involuntary LPS muscle contraction by the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus via a continuous
      stretch reflex. We aim to identify proprioceptive structures in MM by means of histological
      examinations.

      Methodology: Prospective study. Collaboration of oculoplastics, ophthalmologists and a
      neuroanatomy specialist in Sheba Medical Center. 50 fresh MM specimens from patients
      undergoing Müllerectomies will undergo histologic examinations, including immunohistochemical
      staining and light and electron microscopy.

      Significance: Identification of proprioceptive structures in MM will be the first
      evidence-based proof of a proprioceptive mechanism in the eyelid. This might have a
      significant impact on future surgical management of eyelid procedures. Comprehensive
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying eyelid function is especially important in the
      management of children with ptosis who may have coexisting amblyopia.

      The investigators' goal is to find proprioceptive neuronal structures in Müller's muscle
      (MM). The investigatorswill recruit 50 MM specimens of patients diagnosed with either
      unilateral or bilateral ptosis who were referred to undergo a posterior approach surgical
      correction (MMCR). In this surgical approach, the proximal part of MM is removed between the
      levator palpebrae superioris muscle and the tarsus of the upper eyelids. The excised tissue
      is generally not used but simply discarded. For study purposed, the investigators will obtain
      the patients' consent to save these tissues and carry out histologic examinations of the
      samples. No change in the surgical procedure or the following management will be needed.
