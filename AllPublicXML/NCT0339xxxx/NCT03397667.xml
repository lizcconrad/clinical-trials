  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of an intervention for Veterans diagnosed with
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and the burden on their informal
      (family/friend) caregiver.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of people with Alzheimer's (AD) and Traumatic brain Injury (TBI) are cared for
      in primary care settings and receive significant amounts of care and assistance in activities
      of daily living from family members or friends.

      The ABC ANSWERS intervention will incorporate and integrate the common features of an
      evidence-based collaborative care model for brain care, while also attending to the
      implementation barriers of delivering care and skills to dyads of patients with AD and TBI
      and their family caregivers.

      The study team will conduct a 1-year randomized control trial (RCT) designed to improve the
      Quality of Life (QoL) of Veterans with AD and TBI, and their family caregivers, and decrease
      their family caregivers' burden. The dyads in the intervention group will receive primary
      care plus ABC ANSWERS. The control group will receive primary care.

    <measure>Change from baseline Caregivers Quality of Life at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of quality of life using the 12 item Logsdon's Quality of Life scale. Items are scored on a scale from 0-3, &quot;poor to excellent&quot;. The higher the score, the better the reporting of item.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Caregiver Burden at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver burden is measured using the Oberst Caregiver Burden Scale (OCBS). This is a valid 15 item questionnaire that rates 15 different types of caregiving tasks for informal caregivers based on perceived time and difficulty of the task. For each item the caregiver chooses a value from not difficult(0) to extremely difficult (5). Scores are averaged across 15 items of the time and difficulty subscales, thus achieving a score between 1 and 5 for each.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Veteran depression at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of Veteran depression using the Center for Epidemilogic Scale -Depression (CESD).This is a twenty item questionnaire comprising of six scales reflecting major facets of depression. Possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>

    <description>Measure of anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). This is a seven item anxiety scale with a total score from 0-21. Items are scored from &quot;Not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;Nearly everyday&quot; (3). The higher the score, the more often anxiety symptoms are endorsed.</description>
