  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or
      refractory B-cell malignancies; however, a subset of patients relapse due to the loss of CD19
      in tumor cells. Dual Specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cells can recognize and kill the
      CD19 negative malignant cells through recognition of CD20 or CD22. This is a phase 1/2 study
      designed to determine the safety of the allogenic gene-edited dual specificity CD19 and CD20
      or CD22 CAR-T cells and the feasibility of making enough to treat patients with relapsed or
      refractory hematological malignancies.

      1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

             1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of universal dual specificity CD19 and CD20
                or CD22 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia and lymphoma.

             2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells,
                and the phenotype of persisting T cells. Real Time polymerase chain receptor
                (RT-PCR) and Flow cytometry(FCM) analysis of PB,BM and lymph node will be used to
                detect and quantify survival of universal dual specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22
                CAR-T cells over time.

        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

             1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to universal
                dual specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cell infusions.

             2. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine
                anti-CD19, and assess correlation with loss of detectable universal dual
                specificity CD19 and CD20 or CD22 CAR-T cells (loss of engraftment).

      The CAR-T cells will be administered by i.v. injection over 20-30 minutes as a using a &quot;split
      dose&quot; approach to dosing: 10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2.
