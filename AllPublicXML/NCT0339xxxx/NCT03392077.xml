  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery is one of the most commonly performed surgical operations worldwide
      Cesarean delivery even as an elective procedure has been associated with considerable
      maternal risks compared with vaginal delivery. Some of the complications include postpartum
      hemorrhage, uterine infection, urinary tract infection, wound infection, septicemia and
      maternal death. Over the years, many variations in the surgical technique of Cesarean
      delivery have been employed with the main purpose of improving its safety. A woman's cervix
      is firm and undilated at the beginning of pregnancy, but progressive remodeling occurs during
      gestation until the cervix is soft at term, especially the nulliparous cervix . The
      progressive dilatation of the cervix needs uterine contraction during labor. A mechanical
      dilatation of the cervix at cesarean section is defined as an artificial dilatation of the
      cervix performed by finger, sponge forceps or other instruments at non-labor cesarean
      section. According to a cochrane view The information currently available about the
      advantages of cervical dilatation at cesarean section is inconclusive. This may be due to
      small sample sizes and low power of statistic.
