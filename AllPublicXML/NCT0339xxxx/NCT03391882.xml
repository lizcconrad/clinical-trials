      An Open-Label, Randomized, Crossover Trial utilizing a Single-Blinded Rater to evaluate
      sublingual administered APL-130277 (apomorphine) compared to subcutaneously administered
      APO-go® (apomorphine) in Levodopa Responsive Subjects with Parkinson's Disease complicated by
      motor fluctuations.

      This is a two part study. The first part consists of an open-label, crossover titration phase
      where subjects will be randomly assigned to APL-130277 or APO-go® and titrated to the dose
      that turns them from the practically defined &quot;OFF&quot; state to the full &quot;ON&quot; state. They will
      then be crossed over to the other drug and similarly titrated to the dose that provides a
      full &quot;ON&quot; state.

      The second part of the study consists of open-label repeated doses of APL-130277 or APO-go®
      (at the dose determined in the first part) for 28 days, and then cross-over to the other drug
      for repeat doses for 28 days.

        defined as:

          -  Random (non-fasting) screening glucose is &lt; 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L); and• HbA1c ≤
             6.5%; and

          -  If a subject is currently being treated with oral anti-diabetic medication(s), the
             dose must have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Such medication
             may be adjusted or discontinued during the study, as clinically indicated.

        Note: If the subject's random (non-fasting) screening glucose is ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L),
        glucose must be retested in a fasted state. If the retested fasted value is ≥ 126 mg/dL
        (7.0 mmol/L), the subject will be excluded.

        13. The subject's screening ECG at SV1 or SV2 shows a corrected QT interval using
        Fridericia's formula (QTcF) of ≥ 450 msec for male subjects or ≥ 470 msec for female
        subjects. Eligibility will be based on the core laboratory ECG interpretation report.

        14. Subject has a positive screening laboratory test result for human immunodeficiency
        virus (HIV).

        15. Subject has a positive screening laboratory test result for hepatitis B surface antigen
        or hepatitis C antibodies and has liver function test results at screening above the ULN
        for the reference laboratory.

        16. Subject has major psychiatric disorder, including but not limited to in the last 12
        months: bipolar disorder, psychosis (including hallucinations), major depressive episode,
        or any disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires new or ongoing treatment
        that would make study participation unsafe or make treatment compliance difficult.

        17. Subject has Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) that precludes providing informed
        consent or would interfere with participation in the study. Symptoms of PDP commonly
        include visual hallucinations, delusions (paranoia) and illusions (misperception of
        objects).

        18. History of clinically significant impulse control disorder(s).

        19. Orthostatic hypotension (defined clinically as requiring medication).

        20. Dementia that precludes providing informed consent or would interfere with
        participation in the study.

        21. Current suicidal ideation within one year prior to Screening Visit 2 (SV2) as evidenced
        by answering &quot;yes&quot; to Questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the
        Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or attempted suicide within the last 5
        years.

        22. Presence of canker or mouth sores in the 30 days prior to SV1, or other clinically
        significant oral pathology in the opinion of the Investigator. The Investigator should
        follow-up with an appropriate specialist on any finding, if indicated before enrolling a
        subject into the study.
