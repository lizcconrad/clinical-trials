      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and aspirin work in treating
      patients with melanoma that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by
      surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Aspirin may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and
      aspirin may work better in treating patients with melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) by week 12 in patients with stage III
      unresectable/stage IV melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median progression free survival, overall survival, and toxicity profile
      of the combination of ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and high dose aspirin in patients with stage
      III unresectable/IV melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, ipilimumab IV
      over 60 minutes on day 1 for courses 1-4, and aspirin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
