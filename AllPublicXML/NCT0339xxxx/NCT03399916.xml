  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two phase trial to understand the personal, behavioral, environmental, and contextual
      factors that underpin sedentary behavior and to systematically test a series of contextual
      prompt characteristics that may lead to subsequent change in sedentary behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1: This is an observational study that will utilized Ecological Momentary Assessment
      (EMA), to determine which personal (e.g. fatigue, mood, and stress level), behavioral (e.g.
      watching TV, working at desk, and eating meals), environmental (e.g. being at home or work,
      time of the day, and weather) and contextual factors were associated with sedentary behavior.
      Three EMAs per day will be sent randomly sent to participants on weekdays (Monday to Friday),
      for four consecutive weeks (total of 20 days). During these days, participants will also wear
      an activPAL device to objectively measure sedentary behavior. We will identify the
      combination of factors most likely to precede and proceed short (&lt;30 min) and long (â‰¥30 min)
      bouts of sedentary behavior.

      Phase 2: Using a micro-randomized trial, we will test whether an email based prompt is more
      likely to elicit a proximal effect (e.g., a postural response defined as a transition from
      seated to standing or seated to moving within 5 minutes to interrupt prolonged sitting) than
      no prompt. A secondary aim of this study is to determine whether prompts that encourage
      standing are more likely to elicit a response than those that encourage moving. An
      exploratory aim is to examine whether varying the content of the stand or move prompt to
      include combinations of short term goals and employer approval, influence the magnitude of
      response.

    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>Affective states will be assessed using an EMA survey based on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule questionnaire. An open-source app (Personal Analytic Companion App) will be used to deliver EMA questions randomly throughout a participant's workday. This will allow us to measure self-reported levels of positive or negative affect.</description>

    <description>An email based prompt was sent- containing either a stand or move message. Exploratory variations of the prompt were designed to include the addition of a goal e.g., stand for the next 5-minutes, and/or employer support e.g., PTS says &quot;stand for the next 5 minutes&quot;.</description>

    <description>Prompt delivery was sequentially randomized to be sent (ST) or not sent (NST) to all participants (probability of 0.5), at eight decision points per day (between 9am and 5pm), to achieve a total of 3200 randomizations across participants (160 per participant). Therefore 50% of the time, no prompt was sent.</description>
