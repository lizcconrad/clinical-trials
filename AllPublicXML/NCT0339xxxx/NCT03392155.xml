    <time_frame>Baseline (during week 1-2 of study), After intervention (week 16), 12 weeks after completion of study (week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF) is a self-report questionnaire that contains 26 items and addresses 4 QOL domains: physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items) and environment (8 items). Two other items measure overall QOL and general health. Each domain's mean score can range between 4 and 20 and a higher score indicates a higher quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in exercise self-efficacy score (for participants not living with spinal cord injury)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (during week 1-2 of study), After intervention (week 16), 12 weeks after completion of study (week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The Barriers Specific Self-Efficacy Scale is a self-reported survey and was designed to measure subjects' perceived capabilities to exercise even if faced with barriers to exercise. Scores can range from zero to 100 with higher numbers indicating better confidence that the subject has the capability to exercise.</description>

    <description>The Spinal Cord Injury Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES) is a self-reported survey and includes 10 questions and a maximum score of 40 with higher scores indicating more confidence to exercise.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported un-weighed food records</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (during week 1-2 of study), After intervention (week 16), 12 weeks after completion of study (week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported un-weighed food records are collected by participant interview with a registered dietician and also with digital photography of full food plates and left-overs. Improvement in dietary intake is indicated from a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; of whether study participants have met individual goals that are determined during baseline session with dietician.</description>
