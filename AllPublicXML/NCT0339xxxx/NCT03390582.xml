    <textblock>
      Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), which includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Grave's
      disease (GD), are the most common organ-specific autoimmune diseases and affect more women
      than men, with a female-to-male ratio from 5 to 10. Many studies have indicated that
      alterations in the gut microbiota are important environmental factors in the development of
      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Investigators systematically performed a comparative
      analysis of the gut microbiota in AITD patients and healthy controls.

      Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), which includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Grave's
      disease (GD), are the most common organ-specific autoimmune diseases and affect more women
      than men, with a female-to-male ratio from 5 to 10. These two diseases are clinically diverse
      because in HT, T cells aid in the destruction of the thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes)
      and thyroid epithelial structure and eventual fibrous replacement of parenchymal tissue
      leading to hypothyroidism, whereas GD is primarily a humoral disease where auto-antibodies
      are generated against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) leading to
      hyperthyroidism (2,163-165). However, these diseases still share several immunological
      features，and the disease may progress from one state to another as the autoimmune process
      evolves. Many studies have indicated that alterations in the gut microbiota are important
      environmental factors in the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
      Investigators systematically performed a comparative analysis of the gut microbiota in AITD
      patients and healthy controls.
