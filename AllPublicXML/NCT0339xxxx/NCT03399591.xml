  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases will increase over the next decades driven by
      ageing population. It seems important to develop reliable, replicable and accessible
      diagnostic tools.

      This is a prospective study whose objective is to study the spatio-temporal parameters of
      gait in patients with Alzheimer's and Lewy body diseases. 64 patients were included in this
      study. A comparison of the two pathologies was conducted, followed by an analysis based on
      four groups (mild, severe Alzheimer's disease, mild, severe Lewy body disease) and a study of
      the severity of the diseases. To study these parameters, we used the Gaitrite treadmill.

      The analysis of spatio-temporal parameters of walking in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body
      disease enables to identify discriminating variables between the two pathologies. The
      probability of suffering from an Alzheimer's disease decreases with the pace increase but
      increases with variations in length of the step, and with the rotation of the foot. While the
      probability of suffering from Lewy body disease increases with the pace, variations in the
      step duration, and the duration of double support.

      These results are interesting but do not allow to establish a diagnostic score for these two
      diseases. The monitoring of the variations of these parameters at individual level would
      probably be more relevant and would enable to detect dual pathologies.
