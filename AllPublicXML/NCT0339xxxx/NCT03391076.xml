    <textblock>
      LRTI (Lower respiratory tract infection) is a severe disease in China. The fast and accurate
      diagnosis of pathogens, bacteria or viruses that cause the infection is critical for the
      therapy. In this study, investigators assume that the use of FilmArray Respiratory Panel will
      provide more rapid and comprehensive evidences to physicians to diagnose LRTI which is caused
      by viruses or atypical pathogens and then reduce the length of antibiotics use by 0.5-1.0
      days as well as other hospital resources (length of hospital/ICU stay, take-away oral
      antibiotics, etc.). Secondly, investigators assume that in LRTI patients with viral infection
      and a low serum PCT level, fewer length of antibiotics use can be expected. Thirdly, the use
      of FilmArray Respiratory Panel will provide clearer epidemiology data of virus and atypical
      pathogens in hospitalized LRTI patients.
