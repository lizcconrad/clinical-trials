  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will determine the long-lasting effects of post-acute rehabilitation after
      traumatic brain injury and stroke. Investigators will also evaluate if the beneficial effects
      of rehabilitation continue after discharge from a rehabilitative program.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term effects of rehabilitation will be evaluated on 60 patients with traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) and 60 patients that suffered a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) that underwent an
      comprehensive rehabilitative. These patients will be matched with subjects that received
      limited or no rehabilitation rehabilitative therapy. Thus, the total number of subjects in
      this study will be 240. Subjects will be contacted at least 1 year after discharge and will
      be lowed up every two-years thereafter for a total period of 10 years. Procedures will be
      performed in-person whenever possible. However, it is highly likely that the majority of
      participants will be contacted via phone interviews.

      Aim 1: Determine if rehabilitation improves vocational status and living status after TBI and
      CVA.

      Aim 2: Determine if rehabilitation improves life quality after TBI and CVA.

      Aim 3: Determine if rehabilitation improves cognitive function after TBI and CVA.

      Aim 4: Determine if rehabilitative benefits are sustained.

      Aim 5: Determine if long-term outcome is dependent on the duration of rehabilitation.

      Aim 6: Determine if long-term outcome is dependent on the nature of the rehabilitative
      treatment by comparing the effects of different types of rehabilitation. These will include
      the following: residential-multidisciplinary, day-treatment (i.e. full time multidisciplinary
      outpatient), outpatient (part-time), skilled nursing and no post-acute rehabilitation.
