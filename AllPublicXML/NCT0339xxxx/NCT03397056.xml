  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over time, clinical research has become a challenge both in terms of public health and in
      terms of scientific progress. Additionally, it has also become a financial challenge for
      institutions, especially in France where a significant part of their government funding is
      provided according to their ability to conduct quality clinical research. Pulmonology is a
      sector where clinical research is well established with strong incentives from several
      pharmaceutical companies and numerous academic research projects. Nevertheless, it is
      important to put the patient back at the centre of biomedical research.

      A better knowledge of patient expectations, questions and misunderstandings would
      considerably improve treatment observance, clinical trial data quality, doctor-patient
      trust/relationship, and ultimately, the patient's health.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine how biomedical research is perceived by
      patients already participating in a pulmonology research project.

      The secondary objectives are to determine:

        -  how biomedical research is experienced / felt;

        -  if the information delivered to the patient (orally - information note) is clearly
           perceived.

      Comparisons with PROTOACCEPT1 (osf.io/nsjjr) will also be performed.

    <ipd_description>The general goal is to make the study data available to interested researchers as well as to provide proof of transparency for the study. Data (and an accompanying data dictionary) will be de-identified and potentially further cleaned or aggregated as the investigators deem necessary to protect participant anonymity.
Data will be made available on a not-for-profit, free platform that allows access control: zenodo.
A link on osf.io/pxnhc will point towards the zenodo upload.</ipd_description>
