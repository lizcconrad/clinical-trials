  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Do daily high (4 tablets) or intermediate (2 tablets) administration of the broccoli-based
      dietary supplement Avmacol® have improved bioavailability over a broccoli sprout beverage
      rich in sulforaphane and its biogenic precursor, glucoraphanin? The beverage formulation has
      been used successfully in the investigators' previous intervention studies in regions of
      China with high levels of air pollution to reduce the body burden of carcinogenic and toxic
      pollutants. The investigators seek to evaluate a more stable, less expensive formulation of a
      broccoli sprout preparation that can be used for disease prevention in future studies.

      The investigators will conduct a 3-armed placebo-controlled 16-day intervention with the
      dietary supplement Avmacol® to determine the bioavailability with repeated dosing of a simple
      tablet-based intervention in the study participants. As shown in Scheme 1, the 3 arms are: 1)
      4 tablets of Avmacol® daily for 14 days; 2) 2 tablets of Avmacol® daily for 14 days together
      with 2 placebo tablets to maintain parity in consumption; and 3) 4 placebo tablets daily for
      14 days. In addition, all participants will receive 4 placebo tablets for 2 consecutive
      run-in days prior to commencing intervention in the 3 distinct arms. Consecutive overnight
      (12-hour) urine samples will be collected during the 2-day run-in, the 14-day intervention
      and during a 5-day run-out period (total = 21 days). Additional day-time urine collections
      will be made at 2 timepoints: the day after administration of Avmacol® tablets begins and the
      day after the last administration of Avmacol® tablets. A blood sample will be collected at
      the beginning of the run-in and after the last Avmacol® dose (Day 17 for intervention groups,
      and for the placebo group) from each participant. The tablets will be taken before dinner
      each day.
