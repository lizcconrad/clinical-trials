  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain understanding of how PET-MR (positron emission
      tomography-magnetic resonance imaging) using the substance 18F-DCFPyL (PyL) may help in
      diagnosing prostate cancer and in determining the stage of prostate cancer before surgery.
