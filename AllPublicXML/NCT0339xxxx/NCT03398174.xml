  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this pilot single blind randomised controlled trial is to assess the
      effects of exercise and education program on pain and functional disability in rural Nigerian
      community-dwelling individuals with chronic nonspecific LBP (CNLBP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a supervised graded exercise training emphasizing motor
      control exercise (MCE) combined with patient education (PE) consistent with the current
      guidelines will be more effective in improving pain, functional disability, and back beliefs
      in rural community-dwelling individuals with CNLBP following 6-weeks of therapeutic session.

      Participants will be recruited and assigned to one of two intervention groups that include
      combined MCE and PE group, and a control group using simple random technique based on an
      electronic randomization table generated by a computer software program. Blinded assessment
      of all clinical outcomes will be performed at baseline and 6 weeks after randomization.

      Primary outcomes include pain intensity and functional disability while secondary outcomes
      include back beliefs and treatment satisfaction.

      Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and ANOVA. All statistical
      analyses will be performed on SPSS (version 24.00) at alpha level of 0.05.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks after beginning treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability will be measured by Oswestry disability index (ODI). The questionnaire consists of 10 items with each item having six statements. All scores are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100) with higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in back beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks after beginning treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Back pain beliefs will be evaluated by Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ). The questionnaire consists of 14 items with 9 items ranked on a 5 point scale and used to calculate a final score from 9 to 45. Higher scores are indicative of better LBP beliefs and indicate the potential of a better ability to cope with LBP.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a total of 12 sessions (2 sessions per week) of exercise program consisting of motor control training and patient education session once a week at interval of 1-week over 6-weeks (3 sessions).
The motor control training will be aiming at improving function of specific muscles of the lumbopelvic region and the control of posture and movement.
The patient education program will be aiming to provide non-threatening information to enable patients to better understand their pain, change any unhelpful beliefs about LBP, decrease fear avoidance behavior and catastrophic thought, promote positive attitude, self-management, and active coping strategies In addition, participants will also perform segmental stretching exercises and instructed to perform continuous overground walk as indicated in the control group.</description>

    <description>Segmental stretching exercises aiming at targeting the postural muscles and connective tissue around the lower back, pelvis and lower limb that tend to get shortened in chronic LBP. In addition, participants will be instructed to perform aerobics in the form of continuous overground walk at desirable speed at home for the minimum of 30 minutes per day or 5 times per week.</description>
