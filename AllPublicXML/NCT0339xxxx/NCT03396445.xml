    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of MK-5890 when
      administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with advanced
      solid tumors. The initial course of MK-5890 monotherapy or MK-5890 plus pembrolizumab
      combination therapy will be for up to 35 administrations (approximately 2 years).

      Participants receiving MK-5890 monotherapy who experience disease progression may be eligible
      to switch to receiving MK-5890 plus pembrolizumab combination therapy for up to 35 cycles
      (approximately 2 years) at the discretion of the Investigator and approval of the Sponsor.

          -  Received a live-virus vaccine within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Currently participating and receiving study treatment in a study of an investigational
