      An open label study will be performed on 60 people with HIV infection who are maintained on
      effective treatment with antiretroviral drugs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test whether a bowel anti-inflammatory drug that is known to be
      safe and effective for inflammatory bowel disease would offer benefit in reducing the
      residual immune activation associated with treated HIV-1 infection. Specifically, the two
      immediate goals are to examine the safety of Pentasa速 in reducing markers of immune
      activation believed to be important reflectors of risk for cardiovascular disease and ongoing
      immune damage in people with chronic treated HIV-1 infection.
