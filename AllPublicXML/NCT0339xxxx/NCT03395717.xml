  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait recovery is one of the main goals of post-stroke rehabilitation where robotic-assisted
      practice has shown positive outcomes. However, literature lacks of clinical studies on
      exoskeleton-supported gait rehabilitation. Recently, a wearable exoskeleton (Ekso™,
      EksoBionics, USA) has been commercialized for re-enabling patients to stand and walk,
      involving them directly in steps trigger through body weight balance. The main aim of this
      study is to assess the clinical and neuromuscular effects of exoskeleton-based gait
      rehabilitation in sub-acute and chronic stroke patients, compared to patients with similar
      characteristics who will conduct a traditional over-ground gait training.

      In this multicentric RCT, 162 stroke patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the
      Experimental Group (EG) or to the Control Group (CG). Patients will conduct at least 12
      one-hour-sessions (about 3 times/ week) of Ekso™ (EG) or traditional over-ground (CG) gait
      rehabilitation. Clinical evaluations (lower limb Modified Ashworth Scale- MAS; Motricity
      Index - MI; Trunk Control Test - TCT; Functional Ambulation Classification - FAC; 10-meter
      walking test - 10mwt; 6-minute walking test - 6mwt; Walking Handicap Scale - WHS; Time Up and
      Go - TUG) will be administered to patients at the beginning (T1) and at the end (T2) of the
      training period. The primary outcome is the distance performed during the 6mwt. A follow up
      study at 1 month (T3) and at 3 months (T4) after T2 will be conducted.

      *Procedures During Screening Process:

      This multicentric study will involve recruitment of individuals who have experienced a middle
      to severe stroke as well as patients with similar neurological weakness from the inpatient
      setting, outpatient clinics, as well as day rehabilitation sites through all the health
      institutes participating to this study project. Members of the research teams will perform
      the initial screening of potential subjects. These clinicians will determine study
      eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria provided by Ekso Bionics in
      accordance with the medical recommendations of Prof. Marco Franceschini.

      Potential subjects will be asked questions regarding their medical history and current level
      of function. If the subject meets the criteria, researchers will then provide the subject
      with a consent form. The researchers will discuss the objectives, the study protocol, and the
      risks and benefits to each subject. The subjects will be given time to review the form and
      ask any questions about it.

      Once each subject has provided informed consent, he or she will undergo a screening process
      to assess the joint range of motion, and any spasticity present (via Modified Ashworth
      Scale). These measures will be used to determine subject qualification based on inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Vital signs (including heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation)
      will be assessed at baseline, after each session, and during sessions as needed based on
      subject's signs and symptoms. Oxygen saturation and heart rate will be monitored using a
      pulse oximeter. Blood pressure will be assessed with a manual blood pressure cuff and
      stethoscope.

      Participants will be screened at the first therapy session (T1) and at the last one (T2).
      Follow-up assessments will also take place at 1 month (T3) and 3 months (T4) after the end of
      treatment.

      *Procedures During Treatment: The enrolled stroke patients will be randomly assigned to the
      Experimental Group (EG) or to the Control Group (CG). All patients will conduct gait therapy
      for at least 12 (subacute patients) or 18 (chronic patients) one-hour-sessions (about 3
      times/ week).

      Experimental Group (EG): Exoskeleton-Assisted Over ground Gait Training Sessions will begin
      with donning the Ekso device to ensure a proper fit. A physical therapist will check the
      subject for proper alignment of joints with the device and check for areas of increased
      pressure between the device and body. If necessary, additional padding will be added to
      ensure safety and comfort or the device configuration will be modified. During the initial
      sessions, skin checks will be occur more frequently at the end of each session to customize
      well the padding. Moreover, the identification of the best exoskeleton settings for each
      patient will be conducted for planning a customized and tailored robotic treatment.

      During the treatment, the subject will be trained in interfacing with the exoskeleton Ekso
      with optimal postural alignment, and weight shifting strategies. No strength is required from
      the patient; only proper balance and weight shifts are required to achieve walking since
      steps are triggered by the user's lateral weight shift. Enrolled patients will undergo 60
      minute long sessions of gait training using the powered wearable exoskeleton. Patients will
      conduct robotic training in conjunction with conventional physiotherapy training.

      Control Group (CG): Traditional Over ground Gait Training The control group will perform 60
      minute long sessions of Traditional Over ground Gait Training with a senior physiotherapist.
      In the starting phase, the gait task can be facilitated by the physiotherapist or by using
      aids, such as walkers, tripods etc.

      Traditional Over ground Gait Training include:

        -  Sit-to-Stand tasks

        -  Exercises for upright position control (right/left load shift): these tasks will allow
           to include people who are unable to walk in the CG. CG patients will not use any other
           robots or treadmill for gait training.

    <measure>Change in 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline), Session 12 (week 4), 1 month follow-up (week 8), and 4 month follow-up (week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT measures the distance a subject covers during an indoor gait on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The minimal detectable change in distance for people with sub-acute stroke is 60.98 meters. The 6MWT is a patient self-paced walk test and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test. However, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the test, the time is stopped at that moment. The missing time and the reason of the stop are recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a pulse oximeter to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation, also integrated with Borg scale to assess dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>Change in 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline), Session 12 (week 4), 1 month follow-up (week 8), and 4 month follow-up (week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>This test will assess the patient's speed during gait. Patients will be asked to walk at their preferred maximum and safe speed. Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk 10 meters, and pass the end line approximately 1 meter after. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be measured using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundredth of a second (ex: 2.15 s). The test will be recorded 3 times, with adequate rests between them. The average of the 3 times should be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Time Up And Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline), Session 12 (week 4), 1 month follow-up (week 8), and 4 month follow-up (week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is a test used to assess mobility, balance, and walking in people with balance impairments. The subject must stand up from a chair (which should not be leant against a wall), walk a distance of 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down - all performed as quickly and as safely as possible. Time will be measured using a chronometer.</description>

    <measure>Change in Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline), Session 12 (week 4), 1 month follow-up (week 8), and 4 month follow-up (week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is a 6 point ordinal scale used for grading hypertonia in individuals with neurological diagnoses. A score of 0 on the scale indicates no increase in tone while a score of 4 indicates rigidity. Tone is scored by passively moving the individual's limb and assessing the amount of resistance to movement felt by the examiner.</description>

    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline), Session 12 (week 4), 1 month follow-up (week 8), and 4 month follow-up (week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The MI aims to evaluate lower limb motor impairment after stroke, administrated on both sides.
Items to assess the lower limbs are 3, scoring from 0 to 33 each: (1) ankle dorsiflexion with foot in a plantar flexed position (2) knee extension with the foot unsupported and the knee at 90° (3) hip flexion with the hip at 90° moving the knee as close as possible to the chin. (no movement: 0, palpable flicker but no movement: 9, movement but not against gravity :14, movement against gravity movement against gravity: 19, movement against resistance: 25, normal:33)
1 leg score for each side = SUM (points for the 3 leg tests) + 1 Interpretation: minimum score: 0; maximum score:100</description>

    <description>sEMG will be acquired in order to study neuromuscular variations. The electrical potentials of following muscles will be gathered: biceps femoris, quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscle (medial head). The surface electrodes will be placed by following the SENIAM protocol.
The sEMG will be acquired during the following tasks (if the patient is able to do them):
upright position for 30 s;
10 meters-long ecological gait;
during ankle, knee and hip flexion/extension tasks;
robot-assisted gait (if the patient takes part of the EG)
In order to identify the gait phases during the tasks 2 and 3, an inertial sensor (IMU) will be placed at L5 level.</description>

    <description>Patients conduct sessions of gait training, each lasting 60 minutes, using the powered wearable exoskeleton (Ekso) in addition to conventional therapy. Before the treatment's beginning, a PT checks the correct alignment of the subject's joints with Ekso and the areas of greater pressure between body's skin and device, to set a proper Ekso fit as to customize the padding as well. The best individualized exoskeleton settings should be verified to plan a tailored robotic treatment. During treatment, subjects are trained to interface with the Ekso, with optimal postural arrangement and weight shifting strategies. No strength is required from the patient; only an appropriate balance and weight shifts are necessary to achieve walking, since steps are triggered by the user's lateral weight shift.</description>
