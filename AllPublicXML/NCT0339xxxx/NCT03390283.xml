  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn how opioid medications (medications that are used
      to manage pain) are handled by the parents and/or caregivers of patients who are 18 years or
      younger. This includes information on how opioids are stored, used, and disposed of.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will complete an online survey
      on an iPad at the clinic. As part of the survey, the following information will be collected:

        -  demographic information about participant (age, ethnicity, gender, and so on)

        -  any family history of substance abuse (including alcohol, prescription drugs, and/or
           illicit drugs)

        -  any family history of psychiatric disorders (such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
           and so on)

        -  how opioid medication is managed, stored, and administered in participant's home,
           including who has access and control over the medication

      It should take about 20 minutes to complete. Once participant has answered the questions,
      participant cannot go back and change participant's responses.

      Information about participant's child will be collected from their medical record (such as
      their age, diagnosis, and opioid prescription information).

      Participant will also be given a handout with information about the proper use and disposal
      of opioid medication.

      Length of Study:

      Participation in this study will be over after participant has completed the survey.
