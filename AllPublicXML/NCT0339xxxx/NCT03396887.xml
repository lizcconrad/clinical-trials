  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence poses a major problem for Irish and UK society, placing a huge burden on
      the health system. It is difficult to treat and relapse is common. There is an urgent need to
      develop novel treatment methods. One growing area of intervention is the use of mobile phone
      technology to develop personalised, patient-centred treatments. These can be used in
      outpatient settings, allowing patients to manage their own illness and take control of their
      recovery. In this study the investigators will investigate how a smartphone application,
      UControlDrink, can help alcoholics stay abstinent from alcohol. The application consists of a
      number of features known to aid recovery such as supportive messages and online therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common and difficult disorder to treat. Only a fraction of
      sufferers seek treatment and the rate of relapse is high. There is therefore an urgent need
      for improved methods of promoting long term abstinence and recovery in AUD. This study will
      explore the effectiveness of a smartphone application, UControlDrink, in aiding recovery from
      AUD in patients who have been discharged from an inpatient alcohol treatment programme. The
      application comprises five recovery focused features:

      supportive messages, Computerised-Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a drinking log, activities
      and trigger avoidance log, craving management and gamification. Patients will use the
      application for 3 months. A control group of patients will also be followed over the same
      time period. Cumulative abstinence duration as well as changes in questionnaire measures to
      baseline, time to first drink, proportion of patients continuously abstinent from alcohol,
      levels of activity within the app and patient satisfaction with their overall treatment will
      be measured at 3 months. If successful, this application may offer a unique, patient-centred,
      technology-driven, cost effective method of improving outcomes in AUD.

Drinking days will be calculated by summing the total number of days when alcohol was consumed in the previous 90 days.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive the smartphone intervention along with treatment as usual for 3-months. The smartphone application (UControlDrink) includes twice daily text message recovery support, relapse prevention cognitive behavioural therapy, 12 sessions in total, drinking and recovery activity logs where participants detail their abstinence, drinking and recovery activity engagement on a daily basis. Craving intervention in the form of a &quot;calm button&quot; to deal with cravings and prevent relapse and gamification, a system of encouraging positive behaviour with the awarding of &quot;points&quot; to achieve various &quot;status&quot; levels, is used to increase adherence and compliance with treatment recommendations.</description>
