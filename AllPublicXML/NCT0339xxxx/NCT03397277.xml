    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of a video which teaches 15 safety behaviours for women
      subject to intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy. Half of the women screening
      positive for IPV during pregnancy will view the intervention video. The other half will view
      a control video.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) poses a risk for the health of the woman during pregnancy
      also for the health of the unborn child. Pregnancy is time when nearly all women have regular
      contact with the healthcare system. Pregnancy is also a time during which women consider
      their situation and are open for change.

      Healthcare staff have the opportunity to ask pregnant women if they experience IPV and need
      to know how to respond to women experiencing IPV. Healthcare staff can refer to other
      services. If staff are uncertain if referral is needed or wanted they can teach women how to
      increase their own safety and prepare for leaving through a number of safety promoting
      behaviours.The safety behaviours were originally developed in the USA to counsel women who
      attended a family violence unit and qualified for a protection order.

      Women do not always disclose the true nature of their IPV to staff. However, they could still
      benefit from learning about safety promoting behaviours. Using a video for teaching allows
      for the use of pictures and sound and options for several languages.

    <intervention_model_description>Pregnant women will be screened for IPV using a modified version of the Abuse Assessment Screening. Women who screen positive are randomized into either the intervention video or a control video. Women screening negative for violence will be shown the control video. All women receive standard care and a card with high quality websites about safe pregnancy. Hidden among these is a webside that informs women about IPV (rights, safety etc..). Three months after birth all the women screening positive for violence will receive another questionnaire to fill out. In addition will a random sample of women who screened negative for IPV be asked to fill out a questionnaire at the same time. This group will be double the size of the women screening positive.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>All women will be shown a video (also women not screening positive for IPV). Unless staff ask women about the content of the video or the women discloses this, care providers will not know which film participants have viewed. As we include a group of women who screened negative for IPV in the assessment three months after birth care providers will not know who who screened positive and who screened negative. In the file the variable for control og intervention video will be blinded. Women will be selected for the post-partum questionnaire based on the screening for abuse. All abused women and for each abused woman two without abuse will be selected.</masking_description>
