  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how many patients develop worsening glaucoma in the
      early years (2-4 years) of routine monitoring in hospital eye services. We will study a group
      of patients who were initially diagnosed as having glaucoma, or having high pressure in the
      eye (ocular hypertension) or having been diagnosed as a glaucoma suspect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, patients with possible signs of glaucoma or ocular hypertension (OHT) are usually
      picked up at a routine sight test at their optician or general practitioner. These patients
      are usually diagnosed in secondary care hospital eye services by an ophthalmologist.

      In addition to those diagnosed with OHT and glaucoma there are a large group of patients who
      have ocular characteristics similar to those found in glaucoma patients, but could also
      represent variations in normality. In this group, 'glaucoma suspects', monitoring in
      secondary care for a number of years is recommended in order to establish whether they have
      glaucoma or if after several years of monitoring there are no clear signs of glaucoma the
      patient may be discharged.

      In our study we will conduct a case-note review of a well-defined cohort of patients who were
      first identified through a diagnostic accuracy study (the GATE study). This includes (1)
      patients with OHT, (2) patients identified as glaucoma suspects and (3) patients diagnosed
      with glaucoma. We will investigate how many patients have experience worsening disease and
      how many patients have been discharged due to a low risk of glaucoma. We will also
      investigate the relationship between baseline demographic characteristics and characteristics
      of the eye and progression of disease.

        Eligibility for patients to be recruited into the GATE study was as follows:

        Inclusion criteria:

        - Adults referred from community optometrists or general practitioner to hospital eye
        services with suspected glaucoma, including those with ocular hypertension.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients referred to hospital eye services because of other ocular disease;

          -  patients &lt; 18 years old;

          -  patients who cannot give informed consent,

          -  patients already diagnosed with glaucoma.

        This study cohort is further defined from the GATE population as

        Selection criteria:

          -  GATE study patients with a baseline diagnosis of OHT, Glaucoma suspect or Glaucoma
             (any mechanism);

          -  remaining in secondary care monitoring after first visit;

          -  recruited at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary or Hinchingbrooke Hospital NHS Trust.
