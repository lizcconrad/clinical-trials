  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of JNJ-64407564 and to determine the
      recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and dosing schedule assessed to be safe for JNJ-64407564.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor
      activity of JNJ-64407564 administered to adult participants with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma. The overall safety of the study drug will be assessed by physical
      examinations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, laboratory tests, vital
      signs, electrocardiograms, adverse event monitoring, and concomitant medication usage.
      Disease evaluations will include peripheral blood and bone marrow assessments at screening
      (performed within 28 days) and to confirm stringent complete response (sCR), complete
      response (CR), or relapse from CR. The end of study (study completion) is defined as the last
      study assessment for the last participant in the study.

             Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria

          -  Participants with measurable multiple myeloma who have progressed on, or could not
             tolerate, all available established therapies

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
