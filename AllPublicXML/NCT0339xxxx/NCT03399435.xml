  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neosaxitoxin is a new compound that is in clinical development as local anesthetic for
      surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the systemic and local safety and
      tolerability of ascending doses of neosaxitoxin alone and in combination with fixed doses of
      bupivacaine (with and without epinephrine), following brachial plexus blockade in healthy
      male subjects.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of ascending doses of neosaxitoxin, alone and in
           combination with fixed doses of bupivacaine (with and without epinephrine), following
           brachial plexus blockade.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of neosaxitoxin and bupivacaine after brachial
           plexus blockade with neosaxitoxin alone or different drug combinations: neosaxitoxin and
           epinephrine, neosaxitoxin and bupivacaine, or neosaxitoxin and bupivacaine and
           epinephrine.
