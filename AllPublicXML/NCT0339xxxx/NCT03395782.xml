  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Earlier studies has shown a correlation between older age and longer time for the rise in the
      end-tidal O2 concentration during pre-oxygenation. In this study the investigators aim to
      analyse this correlation more closely and investigate if the arterial partial pressure of
      oxygen (PaO2) as measured before the start of pre-oxygenation, with the patient breathing
      air, is a better predictor than age for estimating the time necessary for achieving the goal
      of pre-oxygenation.

      Before induction of general anaesthesia pre-oxygenation is a recommended procedure to enhance
      the time available for solving a problem with the airway or intubation during induction. This
      can be accomplished by letting the patient breath normal tidal volumes with 100% oxygen for 3
      to 5 minutes during pre-oxygenation. If there is airway closure during tidal volume
      breathing, pre-oxygenation needs longer time to achieve a maximum effect. Airway closure
      increases with advanced age and a few earlier studies has also shown a correlation between
      older age and longer time for the rise in the end-tidal O2 concentration during
      pre-oxygenation.

      Pre-oxygenation is a strongly recommended safety procedure before starting anaesthesia but
      has at least one major side affect: it is the main reason for the development of atelectasis
      in the lungs during anaesthesia. Atelectasis impairs oxygenation during anaesthesia and
      probably increase the risk for postoperative pulmonary complications.

      Postoperative complications are more common with advanced age and it is important to
      understand the mechanisms and risk factors involved.

      In this study, the investigators hypothesise that the PaO2 as measured before the start of
      pre-oxygenation, with the patient breathing air, is a better predictor than age for
      estimating the time necessary for achieving the goal of pre-oxygenation. If this assumption
      is correct it might have implication for how pre-oxygenation should be adjusted with
      advancing age.
