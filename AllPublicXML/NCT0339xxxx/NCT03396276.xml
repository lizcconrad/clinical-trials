      The purpose of this study is understand how many opioid emergencies are in Houston, to
      develop an opioid system of care in Houston, and to evaluate if patients who receive both
      medication assisted treatment (MAT) in the hospital and follow up by emergency medical
      services (EMS) post-discharge will enroll and retain in post hospital outpatient clinic
      recovery. This is a short-term pilot study to assess feasibility and provide initial
      quantification of prevalence.
