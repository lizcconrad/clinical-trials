    <textblock>
      The present randomized study is designed to compare the quality of life between the patients
      undergoing laparoscopy-assisted and totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric
      cancer, and therefore to evaluate the superiority of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy
      to laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy.
