  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who previously took part in an Adaptimmune study and received genetically changed T
      cells (including but not limited to MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T and MAGE-A4ᶜ¹º³²T) are asked to take part
      in this long term follow-up study. Subjects will be asked to join this study once they
      complete the parent interventional study.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the genetically changed T cells that subjects
      received in the parent study have any long-term side effects. No additional study drug will
      be given, but subjects can receive other therapies for their cancer while they are being
      followed for long term safety in this study.

      For a period of 15 years starting from last administration of the genetically changed T
      cells, subjects will visit their study doctor for a check-up and to have blood tests to look
      for any changes that might have happened because of the genetically changed T cells.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who
      have received lentivirus-mediated genetically engineered T Cell Receptors in an Adaptimmune
      sponsored clinical trial. The study is designed in accordance with FDA and EMA guidance on
      gene therapy trials.

      The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed
      to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Adaptimmune clinical studies. The study will include
      subjects who have received various T cell receptors including but not limited to
      MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T and MAGE-A4ᶜ¹º³²T. Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation (i.e., new medical
      history, physical exam, adverse events, and exposure to mutagenic agents, anti-cancer
      therapies and investigational products in other clinical studies) with careful attention to
      adverse events possibly related to gene transfer or lentivirus-induced diseases. Blood
      samples will be collected for evaluating persistence of cells with lentiviral vector
      sequences, the detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), and chemistry and
      hematology laboratory assessments. Subjects will be followed for survival.
