    <description>Appetite will be assessed using a traditional 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) (3) with opposing anchors (e.g., &quot;extremely hungry&quot; or &quot;not hungry at all&quot;) at time points 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min. Questions consisted of: &quot;how hungry do you feel at this moment&quot;, &quot;how full do you feel at this moment&quot;, &quot;how strong is your desire to eat this moment&quot; and &quot;how much food do you think you can eat at this moment.&quot; Participants were asked to place an &quot;X&quot; on the 100-mm VAS in the place that pertained to their perceived appetite feelings at each time point.&quot; Participants were asked to place an &quot;X&quot; on the 100-mm VAS in the place that pertained to their perceived appetite feelings at each time point. The averages for each time point are taken to represent the feeling of appetitive at a particular time point.</description>
