  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although EGFR-TKIs such as gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib are recommended as first-line
      therapy in patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC patients who
      have known active EGFR mutation and achieved response to EGFR TKIs experience disease
      progression eventually with 10-14 moths of median progression free survival.6
      Platinum-doublets combination chemotherapy remains standard of care for patients with
      progressive disease. However, patients may derive benefit from EGFR TKIs after
      RECIST-assessed progression especially for those who experience slow progression. And
      previous report suggested that premature discontinuation of EGFR TKIs has resulted in rapid
      progression in symptoms and tumor growth.7 Recently, a prospective phase II single arm study
      in Asian patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC to determine the continuation of
      erlotinib beyond progression judged by investigators showed that additional PFS of 3.1 months
      can be achieved with continuation of erlotinib without serious additional toxicities.8 Until
      now, no prospective study has been conducted for gefitinib.

      In this study the continuation of gefitinib beyond RECIST progression will be investigated to
      determine the clinical outcomes including the duration of treatment and safety.

      This is a single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuation of
      gefitinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients who experience RECIST progression. Based on the
      results of &quot;ASPIRATION&quot; study, the median PFS for continuation of gefitinib will be around 3
      months. The study treatment will be of no interest if the true median PFS is 2.5 months or
      shorter. In contrast, it will be of interest if the true median PFS is 3.5 months or longer.
      Considering 1 sided alpha of 0.05 and 90% of power, 95 patients are required. A total of 100
      patients will be needed considering 5% of drop-out rate. 6 months of accrual and additional 6
      months of follow-up will be assumed for this study.

      Patients will be treated 250 mg/day of gefitinib orally (1 cycle for 28 days). Cycles were
      repeated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient or the
      investigator requested therapy discontinuation.
