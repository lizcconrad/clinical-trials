  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reusable (RU) flexible bronchoscopes (FB) require intermediate level disinfection operations
      to prevent transmission of infectious agents from patient to patient. These operations have a
      significant material and human cost and impact their availability in case of emergency. One
      alternative is the use of disposable FB.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of FB during procedures carried out with each
      of the two solutions in intensive care unit (ICU), respiratory endoscopy (RE) and anesthesia
      (A) department.

      A prospective non-interventional and non-randomized monocentric study compare the operator
      satisfaction of therapeutic procedures performed with RU FB (EB FujifilmTM range, FB/FI
      PentaxMedicalTM range, StorzTM intubation FB) versus disposable FB (aScope 3® and aScope 4®
      (AmbuTM), Broncoflex® (AxessvisionTM). An evaluation form is completed by the operator at the
      end of procedure. Judging criteria, rated from 0 to 10, concern handling, ergonomics, image
      and suction quality.
