      Use chairside Computer-Aided Design &amp; Computer-Aided Manufacturing(CAD/CAM) system (computer
      aided design / manufacture), using glass ceramic zirconia enhanced lithium silicate glass
      ceramics (VITA, SUPRINITY, VS) material, compare the difference of firmness, comfort and
      durability between two kinds of root canal restoration methods:endocrown and 90° shoulder
      endocrown. Objective to establish the optimal method and material for the restoration of the
      teeth with root canal therapy.

    <measure>USPHS criteria for dental restorations assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>This criteria is composed of three dimensions (biological, functional and esthetic), each consisting of several items that are assessed by clinical and radiographic examination. Some items are evaluated quantitatively, others visually.The score of all items is retained as the overall score of the restoration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Marginal Adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical reevaluations were so far performed at baseline and 24 months after insertion according to modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria by 2 independent evaluators. A: Crown margin not discernible; probe does not catch; B: Probe catches on crown margin but no gap; gap or chipping on probing, with enamel exposed but polishable; C: Gap or chipping, with dentin or liner exposed ; D: Partial fracture, fracture, luxation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Marginal discoloration</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical reevaluations were so far performed at baseline and 24 months after insertion according to modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria by 2 independent evaluators. A: No discoloration on the margin between the restoration and the tooth structure; B: Superficial discoloration on the margin between the restoration and the tooth structure; does not penetrate in pulpal direction; C: Discoloration has penetrated along the margin of the restorative material in pulpal direction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Integrity of restoration</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical reevaluations were so far performed at baseline and 24 months after insertion according to modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria by 2 independent evaluators. A: Intact; B: Crack apparent on transillumination; C: Fracture observable; D: Crown lost(state at which interface debond occurred).</description>
