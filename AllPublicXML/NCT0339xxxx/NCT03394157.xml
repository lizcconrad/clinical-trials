  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigator compare the efficacy of 3 types of metabolic surgery in the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes in obese patients , one of them is SASI bypass which is modification of
      Santoro's operation by performing a loop rather than Roux-en-Y bipartition reconstruction and
      the investigator are reporting the first comparative clinical trial as regard the clinical
      results of the outcomes of SASI bypass as a mode of functional restrictive and neuroendocrine
      modulation therapeutic option for obese type 2 diabetes .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      from 2011 to 2017 , investigators collect data for the 3 operations 9 SASI bypass , Mini
      gastric bypass and Sleeve gastrectomy ) about thorough history, clinical examination and
      laboratory investigations including basic preoperative investigations, lipid profile, thyroid
      and suprarenal hormonal evaluation. In addition, patients may undergo further assessment for
      pulmonary functions or gastroesophageal disease including endoscope. . Abdominal ultrasound
      was done to exclude gall stones and to evaluate the degree of fatty liver. Reduction the size
      of fatty liver was done by putting all patients on low-calorie protein diet for 6 weeks. Deep
      vein thrombosis prophylaxis started 12 h before surgery with low molecular weight heparin
      subcutaneous injections . Preoperative data included age, gender, initial weight, initial
      body mass index (BMI), obesity complications and treatment medications used (chest problems,
      diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiac ischaemia, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep
      apnea syndrome, gall stones, urinary stress incontinence, joint pain, depression, infertility
      and heart burn). Postoperative data included hospital stay, early postoperative complications
      during the first month (e.g. fever, collection, bleeding, vomiting, leak and port site
      problems .Long-term complications more than 1 month after surgery (e.g. nausea, vomiting,
      reflux, stricture, intestinal obstruction , hypoalbuminemia , anemia and calcium or iron or
      vitamin D , vitamin B12 deficiency and), excess weight loss and BMI were collected.
