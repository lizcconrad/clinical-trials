  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is multicenter, double-blinded parallel group design, where participants with
      moderate to severe asthma with AFAD will be enrolled. Participants will receive three doses
      of 10 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) of GSK3772847 every 4 Weeks versus placebo along with
      standard of care. Participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either 10 mg/kg
      GSK3772847 intravenously (IV) or matching placebo IV. Participants will receive study
      treatment on Week 0 (Day 1), Week 4 and Week 8. The total duration of the study will be 28
      Weeks and approximately 46 participants will be randomized.
