  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the only treatment with long standing effect of morbid obesity. The key
      elements to success are the patient-selection, an experienced bariatric team and a completed
      follow-up program. Follow-up programs can consist of, for example, providing social support
      in support groups, teaching psychological skills, such as coping with the body change or
      teaching self-regulation of body weight. Furthermore, follow-up is important for dietary and
      sports counselling. The experience of the team members and coaching skills are essential in
      indicating the suitable procedure if necessary and guide the patients through the process.
      Various studies showed a significant positive effect of a completed follow-up program after
      bariatric surgery on maintaining weight loss. There is a burden for this on site provided
      care as organizational and financial resources are not unlimited. Especially as the follow-up
      period is an obligatory 5 years or if possible life long. Even if this aftercare is provided,
      not all patients complete the complete program. Various reasons are possible for an
      increasing no-show-rate, the loss of enthusiasm for onsite visits could be one of them.
      Analogue to other chronic diseases, the addition of telehealth could be useful. Telehealth is
      the delivery of health-related services and information via telecommunications technologies.
      It encompasses preventative, promotive and curative aspects. Examples are exchanging health
      services or education via videoconference, transmission of medical data for disease
      management (remote monitoring) and advice on prevention of diseases and promotion of good
      health by patient monitoring and follow-up. The participation of eHealth has been
      investigated and considered useful in the treatment of obesity. In a systematic review
      self-measured blood pressure monitoring was associated with better control of hypertension at
      least in the first year. Its value in a bariatric tract has not been investigated. It can be
      hypothesized that self-control by eHealth could enhance clinical outcome as more weight loss
      and comorbidity reduction. Long-term realistic goals setting, consistent use of routines and
      self-monitoring has been proven effective for weight loss maintenance. Patients with higher
      self-control are more certain regarding their abilities, which cause higher commitment and
      adherence to the program. This eventually leads to more weight loss. For this purpose an
      online monitoring program was designed for our Obesity Centre (BePATIENT) to provide
      preoperative information as well as aids in the post-bariatric phase by self-control wireless
      devices for registration of biometric outcomes, teleconference opportunities and access to
      additional information. In a prospective trial the implementation in several degrees is
      evaluated.

The RAND36 scores are divided in 9 subscales: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health and health change. Scores for each subscale are transformed to a linear 0 - 100 score. A higher score indicates a better quality of life in that domain.</description>
