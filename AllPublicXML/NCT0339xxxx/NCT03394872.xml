  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) who were receiving mechanical ventilator
      support, had significant pleural effusion (both transudates and exudates) and drainage plan
      were evaluated. Decision to drain, timing and duration of drainage were made by primary
      physician according to the intensive care unit (ICU) protocols.The estimated amount of
      effusion (mL) was calculated as the maximum pleura-lung distance (mm) x 20 and significant
      effusion is accepted as ≥ 800 mL according to thoracic ultrasonography (USG) performed by the
      intensivist. The amount of effusion drained, mechanical ventilator parameters, arterial blood
      gas results and hemodynamic data were recorded before, at the 1st hour and at the end of
      drainage up to 30 days after drainage.
