  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NuValÂ® shelf nutrition labels rate the nutritional quality of foods on a scale of 1 (worst)
      to 100 (best). In 2014, NuVal updated their nutrient profiling system which changed the NuVal
      score on many foods. The investigators took advantage of this &quot;natural experiment&quot; to assess
      the extent to which a change in the NuVal score at a grocery chain influenced yogurt
      purchases, a category with a wide range of more and less healthy alternatives. The
      investigators supplemented the retail scanner data with a survey of consumers in stores using
      NuVal labels to obtain their experience with the labels and the extent to which they state it
      influences their purchases.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diet quality as measured by the NuVal scores of yogurt purchased</measure>
    <time_frame>From 12/30/12 to 8/22/15</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators measured diet quality using weekly yogurt sales data supplied by a US grocery chain. Using an econometric model of yogurt demand, the investigators associated changes in yogurt sales volume for each product before and after the NuVal score change with the direction and magnitude of the score change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge and stated use of NuVal labels by participants of an online survey</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2016</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators conducted an online survey of 665 adult shoppers of two grocery chains that adopted NuVal. The survey elicited participants' awareness of the label, knowledge of NuVal, and stated use of NuVal and other nutrition labels.</description>
