  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-centre, randomised controlled, double blind study comparing use of the Allay pulsed
      shortwave therapy treatment versus a placebo device or no treatment for management of primary
      dysmenorrhea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women participating in the trial will be randomly allocated to any of the three arms of the
      study.

        -  Treatment for 2 menstrual cycles using the PSWT Allay device (BioElectronics Corp,
           Frederick USA)

        -  Treatment for 2 menstrual cycles using a placebo device

        -  No treatment. If they are allocated to a device both the participant and the clinician
           will be blinded at to weather they are using the active device or the placebo.

      Primary Outcome measures are:

        -  A reduction in dysmenorrhea as measured by the highest pain score on a 10cm visual
           analogue scale.

        -  A reduction in average pain score on a 10cm visual analogue scale

        -  A reduction in use of analgesia as recorded in a pain diary

        -  Improvement in quality of life as measured through a validated quality of life
           assessment tool (SF-36 questionnaire)

           - Improvement in menstrual symptoms as recorded through a validated questionnaire (the
           Modified Menorrhagia Multi-attribute Scale (MMAS)).

        -  Device acceptability as measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;unacceptable&quot;
           to &quot;totally acceptable&quot;.

        -  Impact upon associated cyclical symptoms as recorded in a patient symptom diary

If they are allocated to &quot;no treatment&quot; they will be aware of the management, however if allocated to use of a device the participant and care provider will be blinded to weather it is an active device or placebo device. The outcome assessor will be blinded to the treatment allocation.</masking_description>
