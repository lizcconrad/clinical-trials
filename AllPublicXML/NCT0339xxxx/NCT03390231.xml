  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stem Cell Educator (SCE) therapy circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell separator,
      briefly cocultures the patient's immune cells with adherent Cord Blood Stem Cells (CB-SCs) in
      vitro, and returns only the &quot;educated&quot; autologous immune cells to the patient's circulation.
      Several mechanistic studies with clinical samples and animal models have demonstrated the
      proof of concept and clinical safety of SCE therapy. They suggest SCE therapy may function
      via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in the autoimmune T cells and pathogenic
      monocytes/macrophages when these are exposed to the autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE) in
      the CB-SCs. In this project, the optimized SCE therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D will
      be tested in a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-center study to assess its
      clinical efficacy and related molecular mechanisms in patients with diabetes.

    <description>The Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology involves a closed-loop system that circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell separator, briefly cocultures the patient's immune cells with adherent CB-SCs in vitro, and returns only the &quot;educated&quot; immune cells to the patient's circulation. Several mechanistic studies with clinical samples and animal models have been conducted to demonstrate the proof of concept and clinical safety of SCE therapy. They suggest that SCE therapy may function via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in the autoimmune T cells and pathogenic monocytes/macrophages that are encountered through the action of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) and other molecular mechanisms. Following induction of immune tolerance in the immune cells, the immune balance and homeostasis may be restored when treated cells are returned in vivo.</description>
