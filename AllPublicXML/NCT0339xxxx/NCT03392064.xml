      This is a phase 1, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 119,
      an investigational, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell therapy in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer who progressed after at least 1 platinum based
      chemotherapy regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             activities/procedures;

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old at the time of signing the informed consent; Histologically
             confirmed Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) with radiographically documented disease
             progression or recurrence after at least one platinum-based regimen:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1

          -  At least 2 measurable lesions as defined per modified RECIST 1.1 by CT or MRI
             performed after the last line of anti-cancer therapy within 28 days of enrollment

          -  No evidence of CNS metastasis by MRI or CT of the brain performed within 28 days of
             enrollment 107 -Adequate organ function

          -  Other inclusion criteria may apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of other malignancy within the past 2 years prior to enrollment except:
             Malignancy (other than in situ) treated with curative intent and with no known active
             disease present for ≥ 2 years before enrollment and felt to be at low risk for
             recurrence by the treating physician; Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or
             lentigo maligna without evidence of disease; Adequately treated in situ cancer without
             evidence of disease; Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate
             cancer; Adequately treated urothelial papillary noninvasive carcinoma.

          -  History of organ transplant.

          -  Major surgery within 28 days of enrollment.

          -  Myocardial infarction and/or symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart
