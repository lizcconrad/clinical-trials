  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) study of 100 people
      with a history of opioid use disorder releasing to WA Department of Corrections (DOC)
      community corrections supervision in King County. Half of the subjects will receive treatment
      as usual (e.g. referral to treatment or outpatient drug counseling by DOC community
      corrections staff) and half will receive 6 months of intervention. The intervention involves
      treatment decision making, in which the study interventionists help subjects understand
      treatment choices, decide on the treatment that is best for them, get enrolled in treatment
      and remain in treatment. The study does not provide treatment, but works with treatment
      providers to facilitate access to care.

      The aims of this study are to determine: 1) whether study procedures can be implemented with
      as designed, 2) whether offenders can be enrolled and maintained in the study, 3) which
      medications/treatment options subjects select and their experiences and satisfaction with the
      interventions, and 4) preliminary intervention effect size on outcomes of interest including
      recidivism, drug use, hospitalization, and treatment enrollment and retention.

    <description>Subjects in the intervention arm will begin a discussion with the interventionist about whether they are interested in treatment and medication choices for opioid use disorder. The interventionist will use a decision tool informed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) guide to medication assisted treatment in order to help make an informed decision about treatment choices. Once a decision is reached, the Treatment Navigator will communicate with the subject periodically to assist with entering treatment and help with locating other social services as needed within the community. The Treatment Navigator will emphasize getting into treatment as quickly as possible once a decision is made. The Treatment Navigator and the subject will continue communicating throughout the 6 month study period. Subjects will also receive overdose education and be offered take-home naloxone.</description>
