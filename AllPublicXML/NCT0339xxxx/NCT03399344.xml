  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The only chance of cure for patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer is complete
      cytoreductive surgery (CRS). The only way to determine whether complete CRS can be achieved
      is by a laparoscopy. However, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has a
      very high sensitivity to detect small volume malignant disease, making it a potentially
      suitable staging tool. Aim of this study is to determine the performance of DW-MRI for
      predicting whether complete CRS can be achieved.

    <description>Patients will undergo an additional MRI, besides their regular diagnostic workup, for assessing the extent of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Whether or not complete cytoreductive surgery is feasible will be determined on DW-MRI independently by two radiologists. The outcome wil be defined as the number of cytoreductive procedures correctly predicted by DW-DWI.</description>
