  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster headache is also called suicide headache due to excruciating nocturnal attacks. There
      are few treatment options available. Inhalation of oxygen has shown to abort the attacks.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a machine used during sleep to treat
      respiratory failure. Automatic CPAP machines adjust the air pressure through the night to
      keep the upper airways patent.

      Single reports have shown a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in people suffering
      from cluster headache, and positive effects of CPAP treatment, but no randomized controlled
      trial has been conducted so far.

      If proven effective CPAP would make an affordable treatment option for many patients within
      the existing healthcare system.

      This is a single center study carried out in collaboration between the neurological,
      neurophysiological and thoracic departments at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim.

      Participants will keep sleep and headache diaries in a baseline period of 4 weeks, then
      receive treatment (CPAP or sham-CPAP at nighttime) during 8 weeks, have a 4 week wash out
      period followed by a second treatment period of 8 weeks (CPAP or sham-CPAP). Finally there
      will be follow-up during 1 month.

      Throughout the whole study (7 months) participants keep a headache diary. Participants must
      maintain current preventive and sleep medication regimens during the whole study period, and
      may use acute medication of choice (sumatriptan, oxygen or other).

      Sleep registration in all participants will be done by polysomnography(PSG). An Ultra Wide
      Band radar/movement sensor device will be used to detect sleep patterns, together with wrist
      pulse oximetry and wrist actigraphy during PSG and the last week of each treatment period.

      Neurophysiologic tests such as temperature and pressure thresholds will be measured before
      PSG and after each treatment period.
