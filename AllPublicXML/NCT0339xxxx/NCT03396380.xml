      The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in overweight
      infertile women with PCOs undergoing induction of ovulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include overweight infertile women with PCOS seeking fertility who will
      receive induction of ovulation by clomiphene citrate will be recruited and randomized into
      two groups:

      Group A (study group): 93 women who will receive clomiphene citrate for induction of
      ovulation with vitamin D and calcium supplement

      Group B (control group): 93 women who will receive clomiphene citrate for induction of
      ovulation with placebo and calcium supplement
