      The study is designed as phase III, randomized, two armed, parallel, double blind (patient
      and assessor blinded), active controlled, and equivalency clinical trial with primary
      endpoint of Progression-Free Survival of Cetuximab® (produced by CinnaGen) compared with
      Erbitux® (Cetuximab, the reference drug) in patients with RAS wild-type Metastatic Colorectal
      Cancer with the allocation ratio of 2:1.Patients who met the following criteria could be
      recruited to receive the mentioned intervention randomly. Inclusion criteria: Male or female
      older than 18 years old, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum which
      is metastatic, having one or more bi-dimensionally measurable lesions as defined by RECIST
      criteria, tumor that could not be resected for curative purposes,ECOG performance status
      score of 2 or less,life expectancy of longer than 3 months (clinical assessment),evidence of
      tumor EGFR expression (expanded wild-type RAS),adequate organ and marrow function as defined:

      ANC ≥ 1,500/mm3 Plt ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hb ≥ 9 g/dL (may have had blood transfusions) AST/ALT ≤ 2.5
      IULN or ≤ 5 IULN with known liver metastases Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 IULN Serum Creatinine ≤
      1.5 IULN INR ≤ 1.5 and PTT ≤ 1.5 IULN

      Patients who have previous exposure to an anti-EGFR therapy or irinotecan-based chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, surgery (excluding previous diagnostic biopsy), or any investigational drug in
      the 30-day period before the start of treatment in our trial will be excluded from the study.
      Also, female patients who are pregnant or lactating, and patients with any history of another
      primary malignancy in the past five years, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer,
      and carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix, and patients with inability to comply with the study
      and/or follow up procedures will be excluded.The primary endpoint of the study is
      Progression-Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to disease progression
      or death from any cause. The secondary endpoints of the study are Overall Survival (OS)
      defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) defined as the sum of partial and complete responses, according to RECIST
      criteria and Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) is defined as the time from the date of
      randomization to the date of each of the following:

      The treatment modalities did not destroy or modify the cancer cells, The tumor either became
      larger (disease progression) or stayed the same size after treatment, Discontinuation of
      treatment, Death from any cause

      Safety and Immunogenicity will also be assessed during the study.
