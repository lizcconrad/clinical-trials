  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium frequently occurs in hospitalized older people, and treatment options are limited.
      Acupuncture has been shown to reduce agitation in the setting of dementia. The investigators
      will test the hypothesis that it may also assist in treating delirium.

      This assessor-blinded randomized sham-controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of
      acupuncture integrated with standard care as compared to sham-acupuncture integrated with
      standard care or standard care only for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized older
      persons.

      Patients aged 65 and older, hospitalized in the internal medicine departments of Bnai Zion
      Medical Center and diagnosed with delirium or subsyndromal delirium will be randomized to
      either true acupuncture with usual care, sham procedure with usual care or usual care only.
      Daily treatments and outcomes' follow-up will be conducted up to one week from recruitment or
      until resolution of delirium or subsyndromal delirium for 48 hours.

      The primary outcome will be time to delirium/subsyndromal delirium resolution and/or delirium
      severity's trajectory. Secondary outcomes will include changes between groups in cortisol
      (morning blood cortisol or midnight urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio), T3 levels, as well as
      length of hospital stay, functional status at discharge, destination after hospitalization
      and economic evaluation. All adverse events will be assessed daily.

    <description>Comparison of hospitalization-associated costs in the three study groups. These costs will be determined from individual ledger-level patient charges using cost-center-specific cost-to-charge ratios in year 2018 U.S. dollars. Average costs per hospital stay will be estimated by dividing the total hospitalization cost by the length of hospitalization. These estimates will be further classified into clinically meaningful cost subcategories: bed expenses, diagnostic procedures (laboratory, radiologic, etc.) and treatment-related (medications, physiotherapy, mechanical ventilation, etc.). For the intervention group (true acupuncture), costs associated with each acupuncture session including the expenses of acupuncturist salary (monthly salary divided by mean number of monthly acupuncture sessions) and needles (a mean of five per session) will be added.</description>
