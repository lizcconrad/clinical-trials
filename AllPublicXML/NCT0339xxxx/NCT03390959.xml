  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) can be considered as one of the most important chronic
      diseases in the public health system, presenting a high cost for health services. Along with
      the increase in diagnosed cases of DM, there is a simultaneous increase in DM-related
      manifestations, such as peripheral diabetic neuropathy, diabetic foot ulcers and amputations.
      Decreased plantar sensitivity caused by microvascular complications, reduced sensation of
      vibration and loss of pressure sensitivity may be associated with recurrent falls due to
      reduced proprioceptive feedback. Although much is known about the beneficial results of
      physical exercise on glucose metabolism and insulin action, there are still few studies that
      evaluate the effects of different types of physical exercise, especially proprioceptive
      training, on plantar pressure, balance and posture of individuals.

      Objective: The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of proprioceptive training on
      plantar pressure, postural balance and posture in adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

      Methods: This study is a randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial (evaluator and
      statistician) with individuals of both sexes, with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed for at
      least 3 years, over 45 years of age, that can walk without assistance or supervision of
      others. Two groups will be formed, the Control Group (CG) and the Trained Group (TG), and the
      ideal &quot;n&quot; will be calculated in a pilot study.

    <description>Individuals in the Trained Group will perform the training twice a week for 45 minutes and perform for a period of 12 weeks.
The training is divided into a pre-training phase where general hip dissociation exercises and simple stretching of the hip flexor and extensor muscle groups, knee, foot and paravertebral are performed.
The second phase is the proprioceptive training, where it will involve training of balance, sensitivity and proprioception, being used a circuit composed of 15 stations, whose time of stay in each station is 2 minutes.
And finally the third stage are relaxation exercises, performed with breathing exercises associated with slow active movements of the joints.</description>
