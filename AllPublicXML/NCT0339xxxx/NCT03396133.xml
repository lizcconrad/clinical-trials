  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the Dyno arm were instructed to undertake once-day recording and transmission
      of a 30-second single-lead iECG trace to a secure server, plus additional submissions if
      symptomatic) over a 3-month period. Dyno traces were analyzed by an automated analysis
      software and cardiologists. Clinical review and appropriate care was arranged for those
      clinically significant arrhythmia. Patients in the RC group were followed up as normal
      methods including ECG, Holter.

      Individuals with symptomatic arrhythmia without known arrhythmia were recruited.

      Participants were required to have access to the internet via WiFi and to be able to operate
      the Dyno system after simple instruction. Written consent was obtained, and eligible
      participants were randomized (1:1) to an intervention (Dyno) group or RC group.

    <description>Participants in Dyno group acquired ECG once od according to the rules and transmitted ECG immediately once symptom appeared between 3-month. Patients in the routine treatment (RT) group were administrated normal diagnostic techniques. At 3-month, compared the incidence atrial arrhythmia(atrial premature beats and atrial tachycardia) and ventricular arrhythmia(ventricular premature beats and ventricular tachycardia) between two groups.</description>

    <measure>Evaluating the patients' quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month</time_frame>
    <description>Using RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) 1.0 Questionnaire items assessed the quality of life of participants. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software. Pricing depends on the number of scores that the researcher needs to calculate.
The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general, health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health. The total scale ranges from 35 to 145. The higher the total score, the better the patient's quality of life.</description>
