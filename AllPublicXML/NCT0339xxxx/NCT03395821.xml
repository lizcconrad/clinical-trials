  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will verify if a comprehensive laparoscopic curriculum using virtual reality
      demonstrates skills transfer to the operating room, compared to the traditional teaching
      method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Second-year residents from different programs of residency in obstetrics and gynecology in
      Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, will be invited to participate in this study. they will be
      randomized to receive a comprehensive training in laparoscopy using modern virtual reality
      program or the traditional method of training according to their residency program. After 12
      weeks of training, they will finish their training and they will perform advanced
      laparoscopic surgery in the simulator according to their specific needs, for example,
      salpingectomy, oophorectomy advanced laparoscopic suture or hysterectomy. Data generated from
      the simulator program will be compared between groups.

    <description>The software analyzes the percentage of time the needle-holders' ends are kept outside the operative field (%); total number of entrance and exit points through which the needle has passed; total aggressive tissue handling; total amount of strain applied to tissue during needle passages; total needle loading time; total number of completed knots; total number of needle loadings; total number of needle passages; total number of stitches; total time the needle-holders' ends are kept outside the predefined operative field; total time to accomplish the suture; Total time to form a knot. For salpingectomy: efficiency of cautery (%); number of non-cauterized bleeding; number of serious complications: possible damage to vital structures; safe cautery (%); the time cautery is applied without appropriate contact with adhesions; total number of applied clips.</description>
