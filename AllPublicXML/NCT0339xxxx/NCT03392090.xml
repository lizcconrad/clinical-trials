      This research study is evaluating the usefulness of a video and questionnaire to help cancer
      patients think about the goals of their care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study with patients from Dana Farber Cancer Institute
      (DFCI) and DFCI-affiliate at St. Elizabeth's Hospital who are being treated for their cancer.
      The purpose of the study is to test the implementation of a short video, a brief
      questionnaire, and a wallet card designed to help patients understand and articulate their
      goals and preferences when making decisions about their cancer treatment and communicate
      these preferences to their clinicians.

      The short video and brief questionnaire were developed to help patients with cancer think
      about their goals of care and their treatment and information preferences and to prompt
      discussions with their health care team about these preferences. The wallet card is designed
      to help patients remember some key questions that may be useful as they make decisions about
      future treatments

      A pilot test will be completed to assess the feasibility and usability of the revised &quot;More
      Good Days&quot; video, brief questionnaire and wallet card in helping seriously-ill cancer
      patients think about what a good day means to them and test whether these tools can help
      patients to identify and communicate their medical treatment preferences and goals with their
      care team.

    <description>Participants will watch the More Good Days video and will be given a brief questionnaire and wallet card to help identify their goals and preferences about information and care
The More Good Days video is developed to help patients with advanced cancer think about what a good day means to them and to help them think about questions they may have for their physicians when discussing treatments.
The 3-page brief questionnaire is designed to help patients identify their preferences about information and care and to help encourage a conversation between patients and their doctors and health care team about their goals and preferences
The wallet card will help patients think about questions they may want to ask their providers when considering treatments.</description>
