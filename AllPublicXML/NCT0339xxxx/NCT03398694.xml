      This is a prospective, single arm, phase II trial to determine the local control at 6 months
      utilizing pre-operative stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery within 1 - 3 days in
      subjects with a diagnosis of 1-4 brain metastases and with an indication for surgical
      resection of at least one brain metastasis at the discretion of a neurosurgeon.

      Primary Objective To evaluate 6 month in-brain local control utilizing pre-operative
      stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgical resection for brain metastases.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Overall survival

        -  Distant in-brain progression

        -  Rate of leptomeningeal spread

    <description>Stereotactic radiosurgery will be delivered on all patients utilizing gamma knife technique based on tumor diameter with the exception that the largest lesion diameter to be treated with 15 Gy will be 5 cm. All apparent, previously untreated brain metastases will be treated with radiosurgery at this time. Radiosurgery will be performed 1-3 days prior to surgical resection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Radiographically confirmed solid tumor brain metastases

          2. Criteria for surgical resection of at least one metastasis per neurosurgeon discretion

          3. A diagnostic MRI Brain or CT Head demonstrating the presence of 1-4 solid tumor brain
             metastases and lesion to be resected no more than 5 cm in any direction, performed
             within 30 days prior to stereotactic radiosurgery. If multiple lesions are present,
             then the total brain metastases volume can be no more than 30 cm3 excluding the lesion
             to be resected.

          4. For known primary, ds-GPA estimated median survival no less than 6 months

          5. For unknown primary, GPA estimated median survival no less than 6 months

          6. Surgical candidate per neurosurgeon discretion

          7. Surgical resection able to be performed within 1 - 3 days after radiosurgery

          8. Stereotactic radiosurgery candidate per radiation oncologist

          9. â‰¥ 18 years old at the time of informed consent

         10. Ability to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization

         11. Platelet count &gt; 100 k/cumm, Hgb &gt; 7.5 gm/dL, INR &lt; 1.3, ANC &gt; 1.5 k/cumm

         12. Patients currently on cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy are eligible, not
             including anti-VEGF therapy

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients who received anti-VEGF therapy within 6 weeks prior to enrollment, as there
             is increased risk of fatal brain hemorrhage with surgical resection

          2. Major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments, which in the investigator's
             opinion will prevent administration or completion of the protocol therapy and/or
             interfere with follow-up

          3. Patients with more than 4 brain metastases on MRI Brain or CT Head

          4. Lesion to be resected is more than 5 cm

          5. Total volume of metastatic disease more than 30 cm3 excluding lesion to be resected

          6. Patients with leptomeningeal metastases documented by MRI or CSF evaluation

          7. Previous whole brain radiation therapy

          8. Previous radiation therapy to lesion to be resected

          9. Planned adjuvant focal therapy including additional radiation therapy to the brain

         10. Not a surgical candidate per neurosurgeon's discretion

         11. Not a radiosurgical candidate per radiation oncologist's discretion

         12. Surgery unable to be performed between 1 - 3 days after radiosurgery

         13. Women who are pregnant or nursing are not eligible as treatment involves unforeseeable
             risks to the fetus or child

         14. Patients who have a known primary and have an estimated median survival less than 6
             months per ds-GPA

         15. Patients who have an unknown primary and have an estimated median survival less than 6
             months per GPA
