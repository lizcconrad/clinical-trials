    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, multi-center, single arm study is to obtain further data
      on the safety and performance of the StellarexTM 0.014&quot; OTW Drug-coated Angioplasty Balloon
      in the treatment of lesions in &quot;below the knee&quot; popliteal (P3 segment) and infra-popliteal
      arteries according to the Instructions for Use in Rutherford-Becker Classification (RCC) 3, 4
      and 5 patient populations. This study will be conducted in Europe across up to 10 centers in
      up to 75 subjects. Office visits will occur at 30 days, 6, 12, and 24 months post-index
      procedure.

    <description>Major Adverse Limb Event (MALE) is defined as the composite of either major amputation or major re-intervention through 30 days of the index procedure. Major re-intervention is defined as creation of a new surgical bypass graft, the use of thrombectomy or thrombolysis or a major surgical graft revision such as a jump graft or an interposition graft. This is a single endpoint as it is a composite only subjects who do not have MALE or POD will be counted toward this endpoint MALE is defined as the composite of either major amputation or major re-intervention through 30 days of the index procedure. Major re-intervention is defined as creation of a new surgical bypass graft, the use of thrombectomy or thrombolysis or a major surgical graft revision such as a jump graft or an interposition graft.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects intended to be treated with the Stellarex 0.014&quot; Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB)
             for de-novo or restenotic lesions in native &quot;below the knee&quot; popliteal (P3) segment
             and infra-popliteal arteries ending 1 cm above the ankle, as per the Instruction for
             Use (IFU)

          -  Rutherford-Becker clinical category classification (RCC) 3 patients with claudication
             or RCC 4 or 5 subjects with documented Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) defined as:

          -  RCC 3 subjects: subjects with severe claudication

          -  RCC 4 subjects: persistent, recurring ischemic rest pain requiring analgesia for at
             least two weeks and ankle systolic pressure &lt;70 mmHg, and/or toe systolic pressure &lt;50
             mmHg; or

          -  RCC 5 subjects: minor tissue loss of the foot or toes and ankle systolic pressure &lt;70
             mmHg and/or toe systolic pressure &lt;50 mmHg; or

          -  RCC 4 or 5 subjects with non-compressible vessels: absent pedal pulses with a flat or
             near flat waveform

          -  Age ≥18 years old

          -  Reconstitution of the target vessel at the ankle and run-off into a patent dorsalis
             pedis or plantar arteries defined as &lt;50% stenosis by visual estimate

             follow-up evaluations within the defined follow-up visit windows prior to enrollment
             in the study

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any medical condition that would make him/her inappropriate for
             treatment with the Stellarex balloon as per the Instructions for Use (IFU) or in the
             opinion of the investigator

          -  Has impaired renal function defined as serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dl that cannot be
             adequately pre-treated or subjects on dialysis

          -  Subjects already enrolled in other investigational (interventional) studies that would
             interfere with study endpoints

          -  Subjects that in the judgment of the investigator would require treatment of the
             contralateral limb within 3 days prior to the index procedure or 30 days after. Note:
             Unless contralateral treatment is required to facilitate adequate access to the target
             lesion (e.g. contralateral iliac)

          -  Previous or planned surgical or catheter-based procedure within 3 days before or 30

             attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤ 30% without major vascular complication
             (e.g. absence of flow-limiting dissection, embolic event). These inflow arteries must
             be treated without the need for laser, atherectomy, thrombectomy, cryoplasty,
             brachytherapy and cutting/scoring balloons. Treatment with a Stellarex DCB of the

             heel pressure ulcers, ulcers potentially involving calcaneus region or ulcers in the
             proximal one-half of the foot or higher (from mid-foot and higher going up the leg)

          -  Subjects scheduled to undergo a planned major amputation
