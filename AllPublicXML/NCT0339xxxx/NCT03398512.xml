  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with unresectable peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer is
      poor. These patients may obtain survival benefit from radical colorectal resection and
      cytoreductive surgery (CRS). The response rates of previous conversion therapy are low.
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) and systemic chemotherapy are effective
      methods of reducing peritoneal cancer index (PCI) levels. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of HIPEC and systemic chemotherapy in the conversion
      therapy of peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy and safety of HIPEC and systemic chemotherapy in the conversion
      therapy of peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer, patients undergo HIPEC with
      Raltitrexed at the time of fist surgery and twice repeat within one week after the surgery,
      following 3 cycles of 3-week Oxaliplatin/Capecitabine chemotherapy. The second surgery,
      exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy, is carried out one week later after the series of
      systemic chemotherapy.
