    <textblock>
      This research trial studies the immune changes following trabectedin in patients with sarcoma
      that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Analyzing tumor
      tissue may help to understand the changes in immune cells in or around the tumor or if there
      is an increase in immune cells in the tumor after receiving trabectedin.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the change in T cell fraction as a percentage of tumor tissue in sarcoma
      patients after 2 cycles of trabectedin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: numbers of tumor associated
      macrophage (TAM) in tumor II. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype
      (classically activated macrophages [M1] versus [vs] alternatively activated macrophages [M2])
      as characterized by CD163, CD115, CD206 on infiltrating TAM.

      III. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype of T cells infiltrating
      tumor (CD4, CD8, markers of CD4 phenotype including FoxP3 and memory).

      IV. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: expression T cell inhibitory
      markers (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3).

      V. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: recognition of autologous tumor by
      expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocyte lines.

      VI. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte
      (TIL) expanded from myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, recognition of cancer testis antigens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a biopsy at baseline and then receive trabectedin for up to 4 courses.
      Beginning 1 week after completion of course 2 and prior to course 3, patients undergo a
      second biopsy. Patients who achieve clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial
      response [PR], stable disease [SD]) after the first post-treatment scan and who continue
      trabectedin for 4 courses undergo a third biopsy after course 4.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.
