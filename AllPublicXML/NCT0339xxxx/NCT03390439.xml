  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As atrophic striae are common dermatological conditions. Various therapeutic modalities have
      been employed in the treatment of striae distensae, mainly in striae rubra. There are few
      studies that include the treatment of striae alba.

      The non-ablative fractionated laser and, more recently, microneedling are two distinct
      treatments, but they are widely used in dermatologist practice.

      The present randomized clinical trial is aimed at evaluating and evaluating the response of
      microneedle and fractional non-ablative laser Nd-yap 1340 in the treatment of abdominal
      striae alba.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients will be treated at the dermatologic clinic of the Hospital de Clínicas de
      Porto Alegre (HCPA). Each patient will be treated with laser and microneedle at the same
      time, being applied a therapeutic procedure in each part of the abdomen (divided lengthwise
      and in equal parts). Each part of the abdomen will be randomized for the treatment of laser
      or microneedling with the help of the Excel 2013 program. The investigator responsible for
      procedures and patients are the only ones with unblinded assessment in relation to the side
      of each treatment. There will be 5 sessions with monthly intervals of the proposed
      treatments. The ND-yap 1340-nm laser will be used, and in the other segment of the abdomen,
      the dermaroller 2.5 mm was applied. Photographic records of patients will be performed at
      pre-treatment and 1 month after the third and fifth sessions. The questionnaires will be
      applied to assess the quality of life in dermatology DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index).
      Two independent and blind evaluators for the type of treatment will apply in the Global
      Aesthetic Scale (GAIS) in the evaluation of photographic records. Cutaneous biopsies for
      histopathological evaluation will be performed with a punch 3 mm of each part of the abdomen
      at pretreatment. Two experienced pathologists will evaluate the measurements of the epidermis
      and the collagen and elastic fibers of the skin.

The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.
