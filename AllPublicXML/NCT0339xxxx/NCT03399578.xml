  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered an experimental
      MERS vaccine. The vaccine ChAdOx1 MERS will be administered alone as a single administration.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. Each volunteer will receive three
      vaccinations in total.

      There are three different vaccine schedules:

      Group 1 (n=6) will receive 5 x 10^9 vp ChAdOx1 MERS .

      Group 2 (n=9) will receive 2.5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS.

      Group 3 (n=9) will receive 5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS.

      The study will assess the safety of the vaccines, and the immune responses to the
      vaccinations. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.

      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in Oxford, England.

          1. Healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years

          2. Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all study requirements

          3. Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with
             their General Practitioner

          4. For females only, willingness to practice continuous effective contraception (see
             below) during the study and a negative pregnancy test on the day(s) of screening and
             vaccination

          5. Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study

          6. Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The volunteer may not enter the study if any of the following apply:

          1. Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational
             product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or planned use during the study period

          2. Prior receipt of an investigational vaccine likely to impact on interpretation of the
             trial data (e.g. Adenovirus vectored vaccine).

          3. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months

             history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM injections or venepuncture

         12. Any other serious chronic illness requiring hospital specialist supervision

         13. Suspected or known current alcohol abuse as defined by an alcohol intake of greater
             than 42 units every week

         14. Suspected or known injecting drug abuse in the 5 years preceding enrolment

         15. Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)

         16. Seropositive for hepatitis C virus (antibodies to HCV)

         17. Any clinically significant abnormal finding on screening biochemistry or haematology
             blood tests or urinalysis

         18. Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data

         19. Inability of the study team to contact the volunteer's GP to confirm medical history
             and safety to participate

         20. Prior exposure to MERS-CoV (serology will be requested at the discretion of the
             investigator)
