  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High flow nasal cannula oxygen has been proposed to perform preoxygenation in patients with
      acute respiratory failure requiring orotracheal intubation in intensive care units. However,
      its use for preoxygenation before the induction of general anaesthesia in operating room has
      never been evaluated in term of end tidal oxygen fraction which is the gold standard
      measurement during preoxygenation before general anaesthesia.

      The goal of the present study is to measure end tidal oxygen after 3 min of preoxygenation
      using the recommended method (spontaneous breathing of 100% inhaled oxygen through a face
      mask) and using high flow nasal canula oxygen, in healthy volunteers.

      High flow nasal cannula oxygen has been proposed to perform preoxygenation in patients with
      acute respiratory failure requiring orotracheal intubation in intensive care units. The
      results suggest that high flow oxygen could be superior to bag reservoir face mask in term of
      occurrence of severe hypoxemia during the intubation procedure.

      At the present time its use for preoxygenation before the induction of general anaesthesia in
      operating room has never been evaluated in term of end tidal oxygen fraction which is the
      gold standard measurement ensuring that the functional residual capacity has been filled with
      oxygen.

      We planned a randomised cross over study in healthy volunteers studying efficacy and
      tolerance of preoxygenation using spontaneous ventilation with 100% inhaled oxygen through a
      face mask connected to the anaesthesia machine and preoxygenation using high flow nasal
      cannula oxygen (60l/min).
