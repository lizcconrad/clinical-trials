  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determines the effectiveness of oral nystatin as prophylaxis in order to prevent
      systemic fungal infection in very low birth weight preterm neonates. 47 participants received
      oral nystatin and 48 participants received sterile water as part of oral hygiene.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral nystatin is an effective and safe alternative fungal prophylaxis. Some previous studies
      (1 randomized controlled trial and 4 observational studies) showed that oral nystatin
      prophylaxis reduce fungal colonization and decrease risk of systemic fungal infection in very
      low birth weight infants.

      Nystatin is a non-absorbable antifungal agent with minimal side effects that works by binding
      on the major component of fungus cell membrane and causes death of the fungus. Its efficacy
      as fungal prophylaxis is comparable with Fluconazole but does not linked to drug-induced
      liver injury.

      To determine this effectivity, we recruit eligible neonates who are admitted in our neonatal
      intensive care unit and randomly assign them into 2 groups once noted written parental
      consent. One group is given nystatin via oral and/or orogastric tube and the other group only
      receives sterile water as part of oral hygiene. Weekly fungal surveillance cultures
      (oropharyngeal and rectal) are done to evaluate colonization. Further examinations
      (blood/cerebrospinal fluid/deep tissue/urine culture) are done once noted clinical signs of
      systemic fungal infections.

      Data analysis is conducted with intent-to treat approach. Significance testing is done by
      chi-square or fisher's exact test as needed.
