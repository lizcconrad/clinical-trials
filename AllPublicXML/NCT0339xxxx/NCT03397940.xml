  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Summer vacation is a 3-month window of vulnerability for children from low-income households
      when health behaviors and academic learning decay. The goal of this project is to collect
      information on where low-income children go during summer, what they do when they get there,
      and how their behaviors (physical activity, sedentary, sleep, and diet) differ between the
      summer (unstructured days) and school year (structured days). This study is 1) significant
      because it will provide evidence on potential points of intervention that can reduce or
      reverse the excessive unhealthy weight gains that occur during summer and 2) innovative
      because it will be the first to identify changes in activity, sedentary, sleep, and dietary
      behaviors during prolonged and shorter periodic breaks from school and link these behaviors
      to changes in zBMI over time.

    <textblock>
      For children (5-12yrs) from low-income households, summer vacation is a &quot;window of
      vulnerability&quot; and represents an extended period of time (typically 9-10 weeks) in which
      declines in academic performance occur. For 30 years, empirical evidence has indicated that
      children from low-income households experience greater declines in reading and math skills
      during the summer vacation than their middle-to-upper income peers. Additionally, a growing
      body of evidence demonstrates that the amount of weight gained during summer vacation is 3-5
      times greater than the amount of weight gained during the school year. Moreover, this
      excessive weight gain during summer is more pronounced for low-income, minority children, the
      same children experiencing the greatest summer learning loss. What children eat and drink,
      the types of physical activity opportunities, and the amount of screen-time and sleep (two
      important correlates of weight gain) they engage in during summer vacation is unknown.
      However, a substantial body of literature indicates that children engage in a greater number
      of obesogenic behaviors during less-structured times (e.g., weekend days) compared to
      more-structured times (e.g., week/school days). This phenomenon is refered to as the
      Structured Days Hypothesis. These behaviors include 1) increased time spent sedentary, 2)
      reduced engagement in physical activity, 3) displaced sleep patterns, and 4) unhealthy
      dietary patterns. This study hypothesizes that summer vacation is simply one long weekend
      where the effect of children's obesogenic behaviors on weight are compounded over a three
      month time period. However, should children be involved in a structured program over the
      summer they would not engage in obesogenic behaviors and they would not experience unhealthy
      weight gains and fitness loss. Recently, one school district in the Columbia, SC area adopted
      a year-round calendar for an elementary school. This provides a unique opportunity to conduct
      a natural experiment examining the effects of shorter periodic breaks vs. one prolonged break
      from structured days (i.e., school days) on the obesogenic behaviors, weight gain, and
      fitness. This study will use a two arm accelerated longitudinal cohort design to complete the
      following specific aims: Aim 1: Compare changes in BMI z-scores and fitness during the
      traditional 3-month summer and 9-month school year between children attending a school that
      follows a year-round school calendar to children attending match-paired schools that follow a
      traditional school calendar. Aim 2: Compare changes in sleep, physical activity, sedentary
      behaviors, and diet during the traditional 3-month summer and 9-month school year between
      children attending a school that follows a year-round school calendar to children attending
      match-paired schools that follow a traditional school calendar. This study is significant
      because the reason for children's weight gain and fitness loss during the summer is unknown.
      This study is innovative because no studies have examined the effects of prolonged (9 weeks
      all at once) vs. periodic breaks (3 week breaks distributed throughout the year) from a
      structured environment on children's weight and fitness.

    <description>All students enrolled in the partnering schools will have their height and weight measured using standard procedures, as part of their routine PE class. Height and weight will be collected prior to and following every break lasting 3 weeks or longer. These measures will be collected with the help of trained research staff during regularly scheduled PE classes to ensure data quality. This information will be used to compare the BMI (translated into age/sex z-scores [zBMI] for analytical modeling) over time and between students attending a year-round school and traditional schools. These tests are valid and reliable for this age group.</description>

    <description>Dietary patterns rather than individual foods will be assessed. For the current study, the intent is to estimate less healthful/more healthful foods and beverages consumed and compare these between summer and school. The study will assess child dietary patterns using two approaches. First, a modified dietary screener questionnaire will be completed by a parent/guardian at each measurement (traditional school and summer vacation) each year. Screener items were selected from multiple screeners developed for use in this age group and have been widely used in research. The screeners are the 26-item Dietary Screener Questionnaire,16 items from the National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study, and items from several additional food/beverage validated screeners. These dietary screeners provide accurate estimates of food groups and dietary patterns, to allow for examination of relationships between diet and other variables in this study. These screeners have been tested for validity</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and follow up at 3 months, 12 months, and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time (minutes per day) spent sedentary, and in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity will be collected using a non-dominant wrist-placed ActiGraph Link for 9-days (common timeframe to collect physical activity data). Non-dominant wrist-placement provides an advantage over waist placement by improving compliance and the ability to collect information regarding sleep. The device is water-proof, allowing us to capture water activities during summer. A calibration/validation study was recently published to establish methodology to distill activity-intensities from wrist-placed ActiGraph in children. The widely accepted protocols for a valid day of data will be used. Each parent with receive a logbook to complete each night to report non-wear time. Logs will be cross-referenced with the accelerometer data for quality assurance.</description>

        Three schools (2 traditional and 1 year-round) enrolling 1,279 students have agreed to
        participate. 85.0% of children in these schools qualify for free and/or reduced price
        lunch, and 67.5% of children attending these schools are black, 28.5% are white, and 3.6%
        are Hispanic. The first school was selected to participate because it operates on a
        year-round calendar. The second and third schools were selected because their enrollment
        size and student demographics closely match the enrollment and student demographics of the
        first school. All children in the participating schools will have their height/weight and
        cardiovascular fitness measured.
