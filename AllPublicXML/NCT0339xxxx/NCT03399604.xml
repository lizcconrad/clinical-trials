  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      LIQ861, a dry powder formulation of treprostinil, in patients with Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension (PAH). A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative
      bioavailability of treprostinil between two formulations of inhaled therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the greatest impediments to patient treatment satisfaction with current inhaled
      treprostinil therapy is inconvenience. Currently, PAH patients using inhaled treprostinil may
      require more than 36 breaths per day using a nebulizer requiring daily set up and cleaning.
      The use of a discrete, hand-held dry powder inhaler to deliver treprostinil to the lungs
      could represent a major improvement in convenience and patient satisfaction, thereby
      improving the quality of life for PAH patients. Liquidia is pursuing approval of LIQ861, an
      inhalation dry powder formulation of treprostinil that is produced using Liquidia's PRINT®
      Technology (Particle Replication in Nonwetting Templates), as an alternative to current
      inhaled treprostinil therapy for the treatment of patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).

    <intervention_model_description>The study will evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of LIQ861 in PAH patients transitioning from stable doses of inhaled treprostinil therapy, or who are taking no more than 2 approved, non-prostacylin, oral PAH therapies.
Patients transitioning from inhaled treprostinil will be initiated at a comparable dose of LIQ861, and then titrate in 25ug incremental doses to tolerance and symptom relief. Patients adding LIQ861 to current oral therapies will start at a 25ug dose, and increase in 25ug increments on a weekly basis to tolerance and symptom relief.
A subset of the patients transitioning from inhaled treprostinil will be enrolled in a one-directional crossover to compare the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil as they transition to LIQ861. Serial PK sample collections will be taken on back to back days for transitioning and LIQ861 treprostinil formulations. These patients will then continue to be followed as all other patients enrolled in the study.</intervention_model_description>
