  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long term goals of our research are to establish the best pharmacological treatment for
      NAS and determine how pharmacologic treatment of NAS affects long-term developmental
      outcomes. The objective of this application is to evaluate the effectiveness of clonidine as
      a treatment for neonates with NAS, in a randomized clinical trial. Our central hypothesis is
      that clonidine will effectively treat drug withdrawal manifestations in neonates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this current proposal, the research plan is based on our pilot study, which randomized
      infants with NAS to receive morphine or clonidine. The treatment groups were similar as to
      mean birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, and postnatal age at treatment. Infants
      enrolled had no other medical or surgical complications. Treatment was initiated per our NICU
      standard at the time, and will be continued in this protocol. Total LOS was shorter by about
      1 week in the clonidine (mean of 15 days), compared to 21 days in the morphine group.

      Aims and Objectives:

      To determine whether the treatment of NAS with a non-opiate medication, clonidine, will be
      more effective than morphine

        -  Compare Clonidine and morphine for the treatment of NAS. Compare the efficacy of each
           drug which is determined by duration of treatment in number of days, number of dose
           escalations needed to achieve needed treatment, and the need for second drug treatment.

        -  Evaluate the neurobehavioral performance scores (habituation, orientation, self-
           regulation, motor/reflexes, and stress/ abstinence scales) using the neonatal intensive
           care (NICU) network neurobehavioral scale (NNNS) in both treatment groups. This exam
           will take place after treatment begins, and at one month post-natal age (38-44 weeks
           post menstrual age) or at discharge, whichever comes first.

      To determine whether treatment of NAS with clonidine will result in better early childhood
      outcomes than those treated with morphine • Compare the cognitive, motor and behavioral
      development of children in both treatment groups using the Bayley III Scales of Infant
      Development at 6 months, one and two years of age.

      To build population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models and determine factors that affect
      exposure and response to morphine and clonidine

      • Measure blood levels obtained at random times and correlate to Finnegan scores. The
      pharmacodynamics may help with understanding NAS medications and coping measures in babies.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is intended to treat NAS using a randomized and double-blind study design to compare the use of opiate (morphine) or non-opiate (clonidine). Newborns meeting the study criteria for drug withdrawal and treatment will be randomized to receive one of the drugs (morphine, clonidine). Newborns requiring a second drug to help relieve the symptoms will be treated with phenobarbital for both groups. Randomization, blinding and dispensing will occur in the Investigational Drug Services Unit. Nursing personnel in the NICU will be masked to the treatment administered to each baby.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The study will mask parents and child caregivers, and NICU nurses giving the drug, other personnel, residents and attending physicians, and research staff. Since initial dose is set using weight based-dosing, a physician's order can be entered in the electronic medical record to give the initial study drug with the infant's weight stated in the order. Increase in dosing will be ordered as to increase by 25% of initial dose or decrease of dose by 10% of maximum dose. During the pilot study, masking of treating personnel was maintained while the hospital pharmacist was the only person aware of which study drug the infant was receiving. The examiners for administration of the NNNS and the research nurse and research case worker will be masked to treatment received. Those seeing the infant in the clinic will also be masked to the treatment assignment. Morphine and clonidine are dispensed in identical appearance, color, smell, and volume.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>5-10 days post natal age</time_frame>
    <description>The summary scores from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) give a measure of infant neurobehavior in the following areas (score range): habituation (1-9), regulation (2.20-7.50), attention (1.29-8.4), Handling (0-1), quality of movement (1.20-6.20), Non-optimal reflexes (0-12), Asymmetric reflexes (0-7), arousal (2.43-6.67), hypertonicity (0-8), hypotonicity (0-5.0), excitability (0-11), lethargy (0-11.0), and stress/abstinence (0-0.57). A higher score for each item means a higher level of the construct. For example, a higher score for hypertonicity means the infant is more hypertonic and higher score on hypotonicity means the infant is more hypotonic. No cut-off score published for normal or abnormal behavioral performance. Reference: Lester BM et al.
