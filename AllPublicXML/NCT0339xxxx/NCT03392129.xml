  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has the aim to assess the effectiveness of the Ai Chi method as an adjunct therapy
      in the treatment of children with asthma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children from 7 to 12 years old with asthma diagnosis will be included. Children assigned to
      the control group will receive, along with their parents, educational interventions in
      relation to asthma, based on guidelines of Global Strategy for Asthma Management and
      Prevention Revised 2017.Children in the intervention group will perform 12 sessions (twice a
      week) of treatment with the Ai Chi Method and educational interventions similiar to the
      control group. The investigators will assess pulmonary function (spirometry), asthma control
      by the Childhood Asthma Control Test (c-ACT Questionnaire), quality of life by the PAQLQ
      (Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), anxiety symptoms by the SCAS (Spence
      Children's Anxiety Scale) and Disturbed Sleep by the Sleep Disorders Scale in Children. In
      addition, information will be collected on the numbers of hospitalizations, occurence of
      absence in school due to exacerbation of the disease, asthma symptoms and Beta2-agonists
      usage.
