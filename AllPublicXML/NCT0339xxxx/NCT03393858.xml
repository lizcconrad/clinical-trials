  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of anti-PD-1
      monoclonal antibody plus autologous dendritic cells-cytokine induced killer cell (DC-CIK)
      immunotherapy combined with hyperthermia in advanced malignant mesothelioma
      patients.Furthermore,to characterize response to therapy,the investigators intent to explore
      the predictive biomarker for this regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological confirmed malignant mesothelioma.

          -  Patients who have refused a first line platinum-based chemotherapy, or patients in
             progression of disease after a maximum of one line of platinum-based therapy for
             advanced disease.

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0,1 or 2.

          -  Age 18 to 80.

          -  Patients whose most recent major surgery or drug or radiation therapy for malignant
             tumors, if any, was at least 4 weeks ago at the subject enrollment.

          -  Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             criteria.

          -  Adequate hematologic function, with WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (it is
             acceptable to have had prior transfusion), platelets ≥ 75,000/microliter; PT-INR &lt;1.5
             (unless patient is receiving warfarin in which case PT-INR must be &lt;3), PTT &lt;1.5X ULN
             Adequate renal and hepatic function, with serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin &lt;
             1.5 mg/dL (except for Gilbert's syndrome which will allow bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL), ALT
             and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the
             last 6 weeks.

          -  Patients with a history of autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing
             spondylitis,scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune related thyroid disease and
             vitiligo are permitted.

          -  Patients with known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or
             carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease
             (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal
             Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.

          -  Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the
             protocol should be excluded.

          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection,
             HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot). Patients with HIV are
             excluded based on immuno-suppression, which may render them unable to respond to the
             vaccine;patients with chronic hepatitis are excluded because of concern that hepatitis
             could be exacerbated by the injections.

          -  Patients on chronic steroid therapy (or other immuno-suppressives, such as
             azathioprine or cyclosporin A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune
             suppression. Patients must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy
             (except that used as pre-medication for chemotherapy or contrast-enhanced studies or
             for acute treatment (&lt;5 days) of intercurrent medical condition such as a gout flare)
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Pregnant and nursing women should be excluded from the protocol since this research
             may have unknown and harmful effects on an unborn child or on young children. If the
             patient is sexually active, the patient must agree to use a medically acceptable form
             of birth control while receiving treatment and for a period of 4 months following the
             last therapy. It is not known whether the treatment used in this study could affect
             the sperm and could potentially harm a child that may be fathered while on this study.

          -  Patients evidence of interstitial lung disease will be excluded.
