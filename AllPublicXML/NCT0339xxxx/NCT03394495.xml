  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate the effects of an individualized exercise programme with and
      without BCE strategies for community-dwelling frail older people with general fatigue, so as
      to reduce their fatigue and improve their physical endurance, exercise self-efficacy, and
      habitual physical activity, while reducing their symptoms of frailty.

      Twelve district community health centres will be randomized to one of the three study groups:
      the combined (COMB) group, receiving the 16-week combined intervention consisting of
      individualized exercise training and Behavioural Change Enhancement programmes plus two
      booster sessions at 2 and 6 months after the programme; the exercise (EXER) group, receiving
      exercise training and health talks only; or the control group, receiving health talks only.
      Participants from each centre will be placed in their centre's corresponding group.

      It is hypothesized that the COMB group will achieve a significantly greater reduction in
      fatigue and a greater improvement in their physical endurance, exercise self-efficacy, and
      habitual physical activity, and a significantly greater reduction in their frailty symptoms,
      when compared with the EXER and control groups at 1 week and 6 and 12 months after completing
      the interventions.

      All twelve community centres, which provide similar types of community care and social
      support services for community-dwelling older people, have been invited by a convenience
      method to work as collaborators in this study. The target population of this study are
      community-dwelling frail older people with general fatigue with a nonspecific cause who will
      be recruited through the community centres. Using computer-generated random numbers, a
      biostatistician not affiliated with this study will randomize the centres into either:
      control, EXER, or COMB. The number of participants recruited in each centre will be in
      proportion to the size of the centre.

      Participants allocated to the COMB group will receive a 16-week programme with a combination
      of the BCE programme and exercise training. The BCE programme is designed based on the Health
      Action Process Approach (HAPA) model and was piloted by the principal investigator, which
      aims to motivate the participants to develop the intention to actively manage their fatigue;
      and to encourage them to gradually exceed the perceived limits of their energy and to
      recondition their bodies by participating in exercise according to their individual exercise
      regimens. The BCE programme consists of three phases (the goal initiation, plan formulation
      and action execution) with 6 face-to-face 1-hour sessions plus two booster BCE sessions at 2
      and 6 months after the programme.

      For the exercise training, a weekly 45-60 minute centre-based exercise programme, which is
      designed according to the American Heart Association's recommendations on exercise for older
      people will be arranged from weeks 4-16 during the execution phase. The exercise sessions
      consist of balance training, resistance exercises, and aerobic training. All participants
      will receive circuit training with set exercises, but the dosage of different components will
      be tailor-made for each participant by a physiotherapist after having their physical
      conditions examined.

      The EXER group will receive a 16-week programme with a combination of exercise training and
      centre-based health talks on the management of different health issues with the exception of
      fatigue.

      The control group will attend centre-based health talks only.

      The number and timing of the health talks for the other two groups will be similar to those
      in the BCE sessions.

    <intervention_model_description>A three-arm parallel (single-blinded) cluster randomized controlled trial involves three groups of participants (the COMB, the EXER and the control group). Twelve community health centres that provide similar types of community care and social support services for community-dwelling older people, have been invited by a convenience method to work as collaborators in this study. Using computer-generated random numbers, a biostatistician not affiliated with this study will randomize the centres into either: control, EXER, or COMB group. So during the trial, participants in one group receive combination intervention &quot;in parallel&quot; to participants in the other two groups (the control group and the exercise group).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Physical activity will be assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly-Chinese (PASE-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>To detect the change from baseline PASE-C total score at mid-term programme (wk 8 after commences of the programme),and then 1 week, 6 month and 12 months months after completing the programme</time_frame>
    <description>The PASE-C is a self-reported scale for evaluating the level of physical activity of older people over a 1-week period. It consists of 12-items to explain three levels of activities: leisure time activity, household activity and work-related activity. Basic descriptions are:1) 5-items under the leisure time activity are rated on a 4-point scale; 2) 6-items relate to household activity are rated on dichotomous (yes or no) scale; 3) work-related activity is rated by whether the activity is a paid or volunteer work; 4) The duration (in hours) spent on such activities will be reported by the participants. 5) The total PASE-C score will be calculated by adding the score of each item determined on the basis of the time spent on each activity or the presence or absence of activity over the past 7 days.6) Amount of time spent in each activity multiplied by PASE-C item weights &amp; adding all scores together for the final PASE-C score. A high score indicates a high level of physical activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants' depressive mood will be assessed by the 15-item Chinese version Geriatric Depression Scale (C-GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>To detect the change from baseline C-GDS total score at mid-term programme (wk 8 after commences of the programme),and then 1 week, 6 month and 12 months months after the completion of the programme</time_frame>
    <description>The C-GDS consists of 15 yes/no questions. Each negative answer will be given 1 point, with possible scores ranging from 0-15. The higher score indicates more depressive mood. • Respondents with a score more than 8 are identified as having symptoms of depression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  community-dwelling older people aged &gt; 70 years;

          -  able to communicate in Cantonese to ensure that they understand our instructions;

          -  able to walk with or without an assistive device and able to complete the Time Up and
             Go (TUG) test with no specific cutoff point to ensure that their mobility and balance
             is good enough to join the exercise training; and

          -  in a frail state with exhaustion as determined using the Fried Frailty Index (FFI),
             including: i) an unintentional loss of 10% of body weight in the past year; ii)
             exhaustion: by answering 'Yes' to either 'I felt that everything I did was an effort',
             or 'I could not get going in the last week'; iii) a slow walk time: with an average
             walking speed in the lowest quintile stratified by median body height; iv) reduced
             grip strength: with maximal grip strength in the lowest quintile stratified by body
             mass index quartile; and v) the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly-Chinese
             (PASE-C) score in the lowest quintile (i.e., &lt; 30 for men and &lt; 27.7 for women). The
             presence of &gt; 3 items indicates frailty, and one criterion indicates that they suffer
             from exhaustion.

        Exclusion Criteria: are older people who:

          -  are suffering from any disease in which fatigue is a dominant symptom (such as
             neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and end-stage renal failure cachexia cases;

          -  have been hospitalized for &gt; 5 days in the preceding 3 months, which may lead to
             muscle wasting due to recent bed rest or reduced activity levels during
             hospitalization;

          -  underwent major surgery (such as total joint replacement, major abdominal surgeries)
             during the last 6 months;

          -  are confined to bed or restricted by the permanent use of a wheelchair;

          -  report that they regularly perform moderately intense exercise (such as hiking, Tai
             Chi) for &gt; 3 hours per week;

          -  are terminally ill;

          -  have been diagnosed with major depression entailing frequent adjustments of their
             antidepressants to control unstable depressive moods. The criteria were chosen to
             avoid recruiting people with depression-induced fatigue. However, a consistent feeling
             of fatigue may manifest as a depressed mood. Thus, the participants' mood will be
             assessed using the Chinese-Geriatric Depression Scale (C-GDS).
