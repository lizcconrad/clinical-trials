    <description>In the LOW-ED condition each participant will consume at least 10 low-ED foods/day (ED ≤1.0 kcal/g) and no more than 2 high ED foods/day (ED ≥3.0 kcal/g). Foods with an ED &gt;1.0 kcal/g and &lt;3.0 kcal/g will be unlimited; however, lowering the overall ED of the diet will be encouraged.</description>
