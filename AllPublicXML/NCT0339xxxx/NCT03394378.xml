    <textblock>
      Obesity is a well-established risk factor for acute pancreatitis (AP). As for non-alcoholic
      fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD), it is evident that it is correlated with obesity. This is
      apparently the first study evaluating the association between NAFPD and severity of AP after
      taking into account several covariates.

    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common disease with a highly variable clinical course, which can
      range from a mild, self-limited disease to severe disease with a mortality rate of 10-20%. It
      is vital to distinguish severe cases early because they require more aggressive fluid
      resuscitation and early nutritional support.

      Obesity is a well-established risk factor for acute pancreatitis (AP). It leads to ectopic
      fat accumulation in visceral organs, such as the liver, skeletal muscles, heart and pancreas.

      Assuming that attenuation in the pancreas seen on unenhanced computed tomography (CT)
      scanning is inversely associated with severe outcomes in AP, we investigated the relationship
      between NAFPD and severity of AP and the significance of pancreas attenuation for the
      prognosis and mortality in AP patients. The result of this study suggest that decreased
      pancreas attenuation and P/S ratio are strong predictors of severe pancreatitis, mortality,
      systemic complication.
