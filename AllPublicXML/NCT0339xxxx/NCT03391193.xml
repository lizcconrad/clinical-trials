  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a quadrivalent
      influenza vaccine in a multi-dose presentation compared to a quadrivalent influenza vaccine
      in single-dose presentation, in children aged 6 months to 17 years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants aged 9 to 17 years will receive one dose of either the multi-dose quadrivalent
      influenza vaccine or the quadrivalent influenza vaccine in a single-dose presentation and
      participants aged 6 months to 8 years will receive 2 doses of either vaccine, 28 days apart.

      All participants will provide a pre-vaccination blood sample on Day 0 and a post-vaccination
      blood sample either on Day 28 (participants aged 9 to 17 years) or on Day 56 (participants
      aged 6 months to 8 years) for immunogenicity testing.

      All participants will be followed for safety evaluation up to 6 months after the last
      vaccination.
