  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical significance and current evidence:

      Radiation dermatitis occurs commonly in patients receiving chemoradiation for nasopharyngeal
      cancer; 50 to 60% develop grade 2 or higher dermatitis. This can result in significant
      morbidity, reduced aesthetic appearance, decrease in quality of life and delays in treatment.
      Current literature does not conclusively support the use of one agent over another for
      prevention of radiation dermatitis. The choice of agents used in clinical practice is highly
      variable, with aqueous agents being one of the commonest.

      Specific Aims:

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the investigational product (StrataXRT), a
      silicone-based gel, is superior to standard clinical practice in prevention of grade 2 or
      higher acute dermatitis in patients receiving chemoradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      Trial Design:

      The study will be conducted using a prospective, double-blind randomized control trial in 2
      institutions. Each arm will receive standard radiation to a total dose of 70 Gray (Gy) with
      concurrent chemotherapy. The primary objective is to compare the prevention of dermatitis and
      the primary endpoint is reached when grade 2 or higher dermatitis according to the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 scale occurs. Secondary
      objectives will be evaluation of the time to onset of dermatitis, the time to complete
      recovery from dermatitis and the degree of pain. Assessment of the patient's skin will be
      done at baseline, weekly during treatment, 1 week post treatment and unless the skin has
      resolved to baseline then every week up until 6 weeks post-treatment, which will mark the end
      of follow-up. The safety end-point is reached when grade 4 dermatitis occurs.

      Hypothesis and statistics:

      The investigators aim to demonstrate a 30% reduction in the incidence of grade 2 or higher
      dermatitis with StrataXRT. Using a 2-sided test at significance level 0.05 to detect the
      difference with a power of 80%, the investigators envisage a recruitment of 100-150 patients
      in total. The study duration is estimated to be 2 years.
