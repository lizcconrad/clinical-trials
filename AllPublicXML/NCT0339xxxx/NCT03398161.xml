  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if low dose radiation therapy can help
      to control cutaneous mycosis fungoides.

      Researchers would like to learn the level of effectiveness of this lower dose of radiation
      therapy because it is likely to have fewer side effects than the standard, higher dose.

      This is an investigational study. It is investigational to treat cutaneous mycosis fungoides
      with lower doses of radiation than the standard, higher dose.

      The study doctor can describe how the radiation therapy is designed to work.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Radiation Treatment:

      Radiation will be applied directly to the lesion on the skin. A lower energy form of
      radiation will be used that mostly affects only the first inch of skin. The doctor will use a
      marker to mark the area of the skin that needs to be treated. The radiation team will then
      perform a calculation that determines how long your treatment will last to deliver the right
      dose of radiation. The radiation will then be delivered by a certified radiation therapist
      using a radiation treatment machine.

      Study Visits:

      About 4-6 weeks after completion of radiation, you will have a skin check, and a photograph
      will be taken of the affected area. If you are unable to make this appointment, you may
      submit an electronic photograph taken during this time interval or bring a photograph with
      you to your next follow up visit. You will also complete the symptom questionnaire.

      About 10-14 weeks after completion of radiation, you will complete the symptom questionnaire
      again.

      After this, you will be scheduled to follow up again around 6-8 months after you finish
      treatment, then every 6-12 months until it has been about 2 years since you completed
      radiation. At these visits:

        -  You will have photographs taken of the affected area(s).

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your symptoms.

      Additional visits may be scheduled if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You will be on study for about 2 years, or as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take part if intolerable side effects occur or
      if you are unable to follow study directions.

      After your participation in the study has ended, the photographs taken of you may be used in
      future studies or in future publications. If so, every attempt will be made to edit the
      photographs to remove any features that could be used to identify you.

      If you leave the study and the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will receive the
      standard dose of radiation. In that case you will sign a separate consent that explains the
      procedure, as well as its risks.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 18 years or older at presentation with pathologically confirmed MF with
             cutaneous involvement. *Patients must have clinically measurable disease of at least 1
             lesion on physical (skin) exam. *If a patient has a prior pathological diagnosis of MF
             and is clinically diagnosed with a new lesion, the new lesion is eligible for
             enrollment without additionally biopsy confirmation.

          2. Lesions of any surface span as long as &lt;/= 1 cm in maximal height measured from the
             skin surface for which local control is desired are eligible; a single patient may
             have multiple eligible lesions that are individually enrolled for the study.

          3. All stages of disease (IA through IVB) where radiation therapy is being considered for
             local control are eligible. Patients who are concomitantly undergoing systemic therapy
             for more advanced stage disease are eligible.

          4. Patients who are concomitantly undergoing systemic therapy for more advanced stage
             disease are eligible.

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (betahCG) within 2 weeks of protocol entry if the patient is unsure of their pregnancy
             status. Patient signature declaring that they are not pregnant on the informed consent
             for treatment that is used in the Department of Radiation Oncology is also an
             acceptable substitution for a serum pregnancy test.

          6. Patients who are receiving or are planned to start topical chemotherapeutics,
             retinoids or imiquimod to other lesions that are not planned for enrollment are
             eligible; however, the lesion being considered for enrollment should not be under
             active therapy with these topical agents immediately prior to enrollment. * Use of
             topical chemotherapeutics, retinoids or imiquimod on the lesion that is a candidate
             for enrollment must be halted at least 24 hours prior to enrollment in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant patients do not meet inclusion criteria for radiation therapy. *Patients who
             subsequently become pregnant may continue follow up within the protocol, but a
             negative urine pregnancy test will need to be obtained before additional lesions may
             be enrolled.

          2. Patients with active lupus or scleroderma

          3. Lesions with a height &gt;1 cm measured from the skin surface are not eligible for this
             protocol.
