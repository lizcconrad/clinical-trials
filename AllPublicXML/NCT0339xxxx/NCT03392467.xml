    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PNEUMOSTEMÂ® for the Prevention and
      Treatment of Severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (Severe BPD) in Premature Infants. Half of
      subjects will receive PNEUMOSTEM, while the other half will receive a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in which premature infants and it
      results in significant morbidity and mortality. PNEUMOSTEM is intended to prevent and treat
      BPD by modulating inflammation and repairing damaged lung tissue in premature infants through
      paracrine effects.
