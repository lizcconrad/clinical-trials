  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a frequent condition in patients suffering from cancer,
      especially the elderly. According to some studies, this malnutrition has important
      consequences in this population, by increasing the risk of treatment toxicities, premature
      interruption of chemotherapy, mortality and risks of complications. Identifying cases of
      malnutrition is an objective pursued by the National Nutrition and Health Programme and an
      important task of the &quot;Unités de Coordination en Oncogériatrie&quot;.

      The main goal of this study is to assess the loss of weight over the 6 month-period preceding
      the cancer treatment, regardless of kind (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy,
      immunotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, comfort care), in the elderly suffering from
      cancer.
