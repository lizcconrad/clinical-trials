    <textblock>
      The study objective was to determine the safety and efficacy of aerobic exercise in older
      HIV-infected men in a randomized trial comparing different levels of exercise intensity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized trial of moderate-intensity versus high-intensity aerobic exercise
      (AEX) training in older HIV-infected adults. Funding was provided by K23 AG024896 (PI,
      Oursler) and the UMB Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center P60 AG12583 (PI,
      Goldberg).

      The central hypothesis was that high-intensity AEX training is well-tolerated and
      significantly increases aerobic capacity in older HIV-infected adults.

      The study met its objectives:

        1. Scientific AIMS met:

             1. High-intensity AEX training significantly increases aerobic capacity

             2. Both moderate-intensity and high-intensity AEX training improve ambulatory function
                and endurance.

             3. Activity of skeletal muscle oxidative enzymes is reduced, and associated with
                aerobic capacity.

        2. Feasibility Objectives met:

             1. AEX training is safe and well-tolerated in older HIV-infected adults.

             2. Skeletal muscle punch biopsy is safe and well-tolerated in older HIV-infected
                adults.

             3. Preliminary data was collected on plasma biomarkers of inflammation.

    <description>In the moderate-intensity aerobic exercise group, participants performed a self-paced 1-mile walk (3-5 METs) on an indoor track in the same exercise center as the high-intensity exercise group. Initial sessions lasted 20-30 minutes and were increased weekly to 45 minutes in parallel to the duration of the high-intensity exercise group.</description>

    <description>In the high-intensity aerobic exercise group, exercise training was performed on a motorized treadmill with occasional substitution with the elliptical machine as needed for joint pain. Target heart rate was based on the baseline treadmill test and was calculated as percentage of the heart rate reserve (HRR=maximal HR-resting HR). Initially, participants trained for 20-30 minutes at 50-60% of HRR. Duration and intensity was increased by 10% weekly so that within 5-7 weeks the aerobic exercise sessions lasted 30-45 minutes at 70-85% of HRR and at the end of the 16 weeks lasted 40-45 minutes at 75-90% of HRR.</description>

    <description>Participants attended center-based exercise sessions three times per week at the research exercise training facility located at the Baltimore VA Medical Center. All exercise training was performed under the supervision of research exercise physiologists. Heart rate (HR) was measured continuously during each session using a Polar HR watch and chest strap allowing for assessment and maintenance of treatment fidelity. Exercise logs included details on exercise type, duration, time in target heart rate zone, blood pressure and perceived intensity during each training session.</description>
