      This is a pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of a self-regulation
      theory-based mHealth behavior intervention for overweight or obese older adults with T2DM.
      The main purpose of the intervention is to increase participants' awareness of their behavior
      patterns and to self-regulate their daily lifestyle behaviors using the results of
      self-monitoring of weight and blood glucose. This is a One Group Pretest-Posttest Designed
      study. Ten participants will be recruited from Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA. They will
      receive a 3-month, self-regulation theory-based weight loss intervention (five 60-minute,
      biweekly group sessions) and will be provided with a technology toolkit for self-monitoring
      including an (1) iPhone Plus, (2) the Lose It! app for self-monitoring of dietary intake, (3)
      Fitbit for self-monitoring of physical activity, (4) Bluetooth-enabled scale for daily
      weight, and (5) Bluetooth-enabled blood glucose monitor for testing blood glucose levels.
      There will be a 3-month follow-up after intervention. Assessments will occur at baseline and
      the end of follow-up. The individual interviews will be conducted with the participants to
      learn about their experience of technology use to self-manage their weight and diabetes at
      the end of study.

    <description>Actual Use of Technology will be defined as binary (use vs. nonuse) for each day based on data-stamp information. Then we will calculate percent days of use over time. Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use will also be measured by Technology Acceptance Subscales. Scores for Perceived Usefulness (4 items) and Perceived Ease of Use (4 items) range from 4 to 28, with each item response ranging from 1=very unlikely to 7=very likely. Lower scores indicate higher perceptions. Internal consistency reliability and construct validity has been well established.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c (%) will be collected after a 12-hour fast and will be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography ion capture method (Tosoh Medics, Inc., San Francisco, CA) (reference range 4.0- 6.0%).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiometabolic risk factor_Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) in mmHg. BP assessment will follow the standard AHA guidelines and measured using an Omron BP Monitor with ComFit cuff with the subject in a sitting position after at least a 5-min rest. A 2nd reading is taken 2 min after the 1st. An average of the 2 is recorded. Waist circumference in centimeters will be measured twice with a Gullick II measuring tape.</description>

    <measure>Psychosocial Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Regulation of Eating and Exercise will be assessed by a 10-item Self-regulation Scale,141 a 5-likert scale with scores ranging from 10 to 50, a higher score indicating higher levels of self-regulation skill. Example items: I purposefully address my barriers to eating appropriately; I set physical activity goals. Internal consistency was .82 for the exercise-related scale and .84 for the eating-related scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the step goal</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the end of study (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The data on steps will be obtained from the daily physical activity recordings from Fitbit. Adherence to step goal will be defined as ≥7500 steps per day. If there were no records from Fitbit, adherence to step goals will be coded as non-adherent for that day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the energy intake goal</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the end of study (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The data on energy intake will be obtained from the daily dietary recordings from LoseIt!. Adherence will be calculated by dividing the total number of calories consumed on a specific day by the daily calorie goal, then multiplied by 100 to express the value as a percentage.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a self-regulation theory-based mHealth behavior intervention (5 biweekly group sessions, 60 minutes /session). An experienced Certified Diabetes Educator from the Joslin Diabetes Center and PI (Dr. Zheng) who has been trained using self-regulation for weight loss will co-facilitate group sessions. The intervention combines diet modification and increased physical activity with a weekly weight loss goal as well as focuses on improving participants' three typical self-regulation strategies - self-monitoring, self-evaluation and self-reinforcement. Intervention duration will last 3 months with subsequent 3-month follow.</description>
