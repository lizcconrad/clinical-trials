  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this single-center multi-site retrospective chart review is to
      determine if paliperidone palmitate and/or risperidone long-acting injection can decrease the
      number of psychiatric relapses following their initiation in an inpatient acute psychiatric
      unit compared to oral antipsychotic therapy and determine if one treatment is superior to the
      other in this regard. This study will utilize a mirror-image design and incorporate up to a 3
      years of follow-up following the index admission. Secondary objectives of this study will be
      to determine the change in hospital resource utilization for psychiatric reasons following
      treatment initiation, and to determine the difference in time to relapse.

    <description>Hospitalizations will be used as a proxy for relapse and the primary endpoint will be the number of hospital admissions following the discharge date of the index admission for up to 3 years compared to an equivalent timeframe prior to the beginning of the index admission (and including the 1st day of the index admission). Patients will be considered eligible for the primary objective after 3 months of continued long-acting injection treatment.</description>
