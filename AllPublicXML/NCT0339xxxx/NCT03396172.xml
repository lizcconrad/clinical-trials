  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to assess the &quot;FreeDom&quot; innovative strategy (FreeO2 at
      Domicile) to reduce hospitalization duration in patients with COPD exacerbation. This
      strategy associates early hospital discharge, automated O2 flow weaning with FreeO2 system,
      telemedicine and tele-rehabilitation.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that the FreeDom strategy will reduce the number of
      hospitalization day by 50 percent at day 30.

      The main objective of the study is to assess the &quot;FreeDom&quot; innovative strategy (FreeO2 at
      Domicile) to reduce hospitalization duration in patients with COPD exacerbation. This
      strategy will enable an early return home, patients using an innovative device that
      automatically adjusts and wean the oxygen flow (FreeO2 system) coupled to telemedicine and
      tele-rehabilitation.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that a strategy for an early return home with a home
      hospitalization managed by telemedicine will reduce the length of hospitalization by 50
      percent from 30 days.

    <description>FreeDom strategy (early discharge, automated weaning at home, telemedicine, telereadaptation):
-initial conventional hospitalization before discharge home, O2 flow rate automatically titrated by FreeO2 (based on a SpO2 target). The hospital discharge will be possible if the definite criteria are met.
After hospital discharge, patient will have home hospitalisation. Automated oxygen flow titration, patient education will be conducted for using the telemedicine system, for questionnaires and for the tele-rehabilitation program will be initiated for home hospitalization,</description>
