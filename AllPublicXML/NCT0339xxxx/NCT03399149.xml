  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last two decades, the number of patients with hematological malignancies (HMs)
      admitted to the ICU increased and their mortality has dropped sharply. Patients with HMs
      increasingly require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for life-threatening events
      related to the malignancy and/or treatments, with immunosuppression being a major
      contributor. Whether the increase in ICU admissions is related to increased referrals by
      hematologists and/or to increased admissions by intensivists is unknown. The criteria used
      for ICU referral and admission decisions have not been extensively evaluated. Finally, the
      links between admission policies and treatment-limitation decisions are unclear, but ICUs
      with broad admission policies may change the treatment goals based on the response to several
      days of full-code management.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a systematic evaluation by an intensivist
      of HMs patients presenting with acute respiratory and/or hemodynamic failure.
