    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the value of Gallium-68 labeled PSMA (68Ga-PSMA) for PET/CT imaging of
      prostate cancer recurrence. 68Ga-PSMA is a radioactive molecule, which binds to prostate
      cancer cells. Together with a PET/CT scanner, the distribution of 68Ga-PSMA can be determined
      in the body.

      To test this new drug, participants will receive an intravenous injection of Ga-68-PSMA and
      then have a PET/CT scan. The scan results will be made available to study participants and
      treating physicians.

    <textblock>
      This study evaluates Gallium-68 labelled PSMA-11 (also called Gallium-68 labelled
      PSMA-HBED-CC, or Gallium-68 labelled PSMA
      N,N'-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid), abbreviated here as 68Ga-PSMA.
      This molecule (or radiotracer) binds to receptors that are often present on prostate cancer
      cells. Using 68Ga-PSMA together with a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner (with
      computed tomography, called PET/CT), it is therefore possible to find prostate cancer lesions
      in the body. The study will test whether 68Ga-PSMA will identify prostate cancer more
      precisely than normal imaging methods (for example CT, MRI, or bone scan). A more precise
      identification of the location of the disease is important. Knowing where the disease is
      located will help to decide on the best course of action to treat the disease.

      Men who have elevated tumor markers of prostate cancer are eligible for this study.
      Participants undergo a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan before further treatment. Based on clinical
      information, including any prior imaging and biopsy/surgery information and follow-up
      information, we will determine whether 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging was more accurate than the
      standard imaging. The study team will collect this information for up to 1 year after the
      68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan.

      The results of the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan will be shared with the participating patients.
      Also, results will be entered into the participant's medical record and shared with the
      treating physicians.
