  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to learn more about a potential treatment
      (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) for people with severe hemophilia A. This research study will
      test and confirm the safety and effectiveness of the 4E13 vg/kg dose of the study drug
      (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) that contains the correct gene to make Factor VIII so that the
      body can make its own Factor VIII that functions properly. Only one dose of valoctocogene
      roxaparvovec is being given in this study, and this dose has been previously studied in
      another clinical trial in patients with hemophilia A. This is a phase 3 study which is meant
      to show that the study drug is safe and works to help treat hemophilia A. The study will see
      if liver cells are able to make Factor VIII that functions properly after receiving this
      study drug. The study will also examine the effects that the study drug has on how much
      Factor VIII concentrates patients have to inject into their veins and on their bleeding
      episodes after the study drug has been administered. Finally, the study will see if and how
      the body responds to the study drug - for example, whether liver cells become inflamed or
      whether the body makes antibodies (something the immune system makes to protect itself
      against things like bacteria and viruses) against the vector or the new Factor VIII gene.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males ≥ 18 years of age with hemophilia A and residual FVIII levels ≤ 1 IU/dL as
             evidenced by medical history, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Must have been on prophylactic FVIII replacement therapy for at least 12 months prior
             to study entry. High-quality, well-documented historical data concerning bleeding
             episodes and FVIII usage over the previous 12 months must be available.

          -  Treated/exposed to FVIII concentrates or cryoprecipitate for a minimum of 150 exposure
             days (EDs).

             modification of less than 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) on 2 consecutive occasions (the most
             recent one of which should be tested at the central laboratory) at least one week
             apart within the past 12 months

          -  HIV positive patients may be enrolled, only if the patient has a CD4 count &gt; 200/mm3
             and an undetectable viral load.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Detectable pre-existing antibodies to the AAV5 capsid.

          -  Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder, except for HIV
             infection as described in the inclusion criterion above.

          -  Significant liver dysfunction with any of the following abnormal laboratory results:

               -  Subjects whose liver ALT (alanine transaminase) or AST &gt;2X ULN;

                  liver laboratory assessments fall outside of these ranges may undergo repeat
                  testing and, if eligibility criteria are met on retest, may be enrolled after
                  confirmation by the Medical Monitor. In addition, subjects with abnormal
                  laboratory results related to confirmed benign liver conditions (eg, Gilbert's
                  syndrome) are considered eligible for the study notwithstanding their abnormal
                  laboratory results and may be enrolled after discussion with the Medical Monitor.

             on the Batts Ludwig (Batts 1995) or METAVIR (Bedossa 1996) scoring systems, or an
             equivalent grade of fibrosis if an alternative scale is used.

          -  Evidence of any bleeding disorder not related to hemophilia A.
