  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of maternal physical activity during
      pregnancy on pregnancy outcome. Primary, fetal growth during pregnancy abd birth weight will
      be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this study, the information on maternal physical activity will be collected and the
      impact on delivery and pregnancy complications as well as on neonatal complications will be
      evaluated. From the first visit at maternal care center, the information on socioeconomical
      and maternal characteristics will be collected. During pregnancy, fetal growth will be
      estimated by ultrasound. Physical activity will be measured using free app for measuring
      steps that mothers make during pregnancy. Using logistic regression, the impact of physical
      activity on pregnancy outcomes will be evaluated.
