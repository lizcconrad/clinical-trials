  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer or hematological malignancy are susceptible to present acute
      complications linked to their disease or to their specific treatments (dyspnea, sepsis, coma,
      hemorrhagic syndrome). Emergency physicians are in first line when these complications arise
      and have to face with some complex situations in which informations about patient malignancy
      or prognosis may be lacking. Nowadays, there is very few epidemiological data published
      concerning how cancer patient use Emergency Departments (EDs) and cancer patient care
      delivery in the EDs.

      Thus, an observational multicenter prospective cross-sectional study is conducted to study
      the prevalence of cancer patients admitted to French EDs, and to describe the different
      reasons for cancer patients to seek care in EDs with their prevalence and underscore those
      linked to cancer or treatment complication
