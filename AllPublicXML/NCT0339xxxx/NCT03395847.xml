  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab (when given either
      alone or in combination with ramucirumab) can help to control advanced gastroesophageal
      adenocarcinoma. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of several types of cancer, but not gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
      Ramucirumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of gastroesophageal
      adenocarcinoma. It is investigational to use pembrolizumab alone or in combination with
      ramucirumab to treat gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to 1 of 2 study arms. The first 15 participants will be enrolled in Arm 1 and the
      next 15 participants will be enrolled in Arm 2.

        -  If participant is in Arm 1, participant will receive pembrolizumab alone.

        -  If participant is in Arm 2, participant will receive pembrolizumab and ramucirumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If participant is in Arm 1, participant will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30
      minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

      If participant is in Arm 2, participant will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30
      minutes on Days 1 and 22 of each 42-day cycle. Participant will also receive ramucirumab by
      vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1, 15, and 29 of each cycle.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may receive the study drug(s) for up to about 1 year (17 cycles for Group 1, 8
      cycles for Group 2).

      Participant will no longer be able to receive the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits (for all participants):

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the status of the
           disease, and for tumor marker testing. If participant can become pregnant, part of this
           sample will be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests (Cycles 1, 2, and every even-numbered cycle
           after that [Cycles 4, 6, 8 and so on]).

      At Week 6, participant will have a core biopsy and blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn
      for biomarker testing.

      During the first 6 months, participant will have an MRI or CT scan every 6 weeks. After that,
      this will be done every 12 weeks.

      At any time that the study doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an EKG.

      If participant had a brain scan at screening and the disease appears to completely go away,
      participant will have another brain scan to confirm this.

      If at any time the disease appears to respond to the study drug, blood (about 3 tablespoons)
      will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      Additional Study Visit - Group 1:

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the status of the
           disease, and for tumor marker testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Additional Study Visits - Group 2:

      On Days 8, 15, 22, and 29 of Cycle 1:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease. At Day 22, this will also include tumor marker testing and a pregnancy test
           (if participant can become pregnant).

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Days 15, 22, and 29 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease. At Week 22, this will also include tumor marker testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as possible after participant's last dose of study drug(s):

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker testing.

        -  Participant will have a CT scan or MRI.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after the End-of-Treatment Visit:

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease. If participant can become pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test.

      If participant stops receiving the study drug(s) for reasons other than the disease getting
      worse, participant will move into follow-up and be checked on every 12 weeks. At these
      visits:

        -  Participant's vital signs will be measured, including participant's weight and height.

        -  Participant will have a CT scan or MRI until participant starts a new anti-cancer
           treatment, the disease gets worse, or the study ends.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Participant will be called every 12 weeks and asked about how participant is doing. Each call
      should last about 5-10 minutes.

             informed consent for the trial. The subject may also provide consent for Future
             Biomedical Research. However the subject may participate in the main trial without
             participating in Future Biomedical Research.

          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          3. Male and female subjects who are at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed
             consent with histologically and cytologically documented diagnosis as gastroesophageal
             adenocarcinoma.

          4. Histologically and cytologically documented diagnosis as gastroesophageal
             adenocarcinoma.

          5. Have a documented advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) gastroesophageal
             adenocarcinoma that is incurable and for which prior first-line or later-line SOC
             treatments have failed. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens.
             Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy included in initial treatment may not be
             considered first- or later-line SOC treatment unless such treatments were completed
             less than 12 months prior to the current tumor recurrence.

          6. Have submitted an evaluable tissue sample for biomarker analysis from a newly obtained
             core, incisional, or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated.
             The tumor tissue submitted for analysis must be from a single tumor tissue specimen
             and of sufficient quantity and quality to allow biomarker study. A newly obtained
             tumor specimen, defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to
             initiation of treatment on Day 1, for biomarker characterization will be required for
             enrollment of all subjects. Tissue from tumor progressing at a site of prior radiation
             may be allowed for biomarker characterization upon agreement from Merck. Subjects for
             whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety
             concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Merck

         15. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after
