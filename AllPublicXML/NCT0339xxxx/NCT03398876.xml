  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Part 1, the purpose of this study is to elucidate the single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles
      of 1 spray and 2 consecutive sprays of oromucosal nicotine spray (ONS) in comparison with
      those of nicotine gum and cigarette smoking in healthy Japanese smokers. In Part 2, the
      purpose is to evaluate the multiple-dose nicotine pharmacokinetics of ONS administered
      repeated-dose administration in healthy Japanese smokers.
