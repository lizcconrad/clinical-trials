      The local database results from a joint initiative of anesthesic, cardiology and cardiac
      surgery departements.Its purpose is to record in an exhaustive fashion all the interventions
      of cardiac surgery performed under extracorporeal circulation in adults at Bichat
      hospital.This database includes the preoperative characteristics of the patients, the type of
      surgery, the post-operative complications and the in-hospital mortality. The purpose of this
      observational study is to evaluate in-hospital morbidity and mortality for all types of
      cardiac surgery interventions and to analyze it according to the characteristics of the
      patients and the type of intervention.

      The operative mortality is a key point of the risk-to-benefit ratio analysis before
      considering cardiac surgery. Operative risk evaluation in a single surgical center is a part
      of medical care quality assessment. It must be interpreted in the light of the local
      specificities, in particular the characteristics of the patients and the types of surgery.

      observational study is to evaluate in-hospital morbidity and mortality according to the
      characteristics of the patients and the type of intervention. study population : inclusion
      criteria : patient 18 years or older with legal capacity, patients with non-objection to
      record his/her medical data during hospitalization. Methods: this is an observational
      prospective and monocentric study. The main objective is to report in-hospital mortality for
      all types of cardiac surgery performed in Bichat hospital . The secondary objectives are :1)
      to collect post-operative complications such as hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events or
      surgery site infections; 2) to analyze mortality rate and post-operative morbidities
      according to the type of surgery and the main patients' characteristics . 3) to calculate
      validated and currents risk score such as EuroSCORE I and II for each patient.
