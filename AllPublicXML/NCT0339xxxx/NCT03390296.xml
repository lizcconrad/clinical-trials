  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and tolerability of 8
      different drug combinations when given to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
      Researchers also want to learn if these drug combinations can help to control the disease.

      The drug combinations being studied are:

        -  PF-04518600 (OX40 agonist monoclonal antibody) alone

        -  PF-04518600 and avelumab (anti-PDL1 mAb)

        -  PF-04518600 and azacitidine

        -  PF-04518600 and utomilumab (anti-41BB mAb)

        -  avelumab and utomilumab

        -  PF-04518600, avelumab, and azacitidine

        -  gemtuzumab ozogamicin (anti-CD33 mAb) and glasdegib (smoothened inhibitor)

        -  glasdegib and avelumab

      This is an investigational study. Avelumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of advanced Merkel cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma. Azacitidine is FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
      Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is FDA approved and commercially approved for the treatment of AML.
      PF-04518600, utomilumab, and glasdegib are not FDA approved or commercially available.

      It is considered investigational to use these drugs to treat AML. The study doctor can
      describe how the drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 138 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 8
      study groups based on when you join the study and what the study doctor thinks is in your
      best interest.

        -  Group A will receive PF-04518600.

        -  Group B will receive PF-04518600 and avelumab.

        -  Group C will receive PF-04518600 and azacitidine.

        -  Group D will receive PF-04518600 and utomilumab.

        -  Group E will receive avelumab and utomilumab.

        -  Group F will receive PF-04518600, avelumab, and azacitidine.

        -  Group G will receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin and glasdegib.

        -  Group H will receive glasdegib and avelumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      PF-04518600 will be given by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1 and 14 of each cycle. If
      given with other drugs, PF-04518600 will be given first.

      Avelumab will be given by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1 and 14 of each cycle.

      Azacitidine will be given either by vein over about 10-40 minutes or as an injection under
      the skin on Days 1-7 or Days 1-5 and 8-9 of each cycle. The study doctor will tell you which
      azacitidine administration and schedule you will follow.

      Utomilumab will be given by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1 and 14 of each cycle.

      Gemtuzumab ozogamicin will be given by vein over about 2 hours on Days 1, 4, and 7 of each
      cycle.

      Glasdegib tablets will be taken by mouth with a cup (about 8 ounces) of water every morning.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug(s) for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Two (2) times each week during Cycles 1-3 and then 1-2 times each week after that during
      Cycles 4 and beyond, blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This blood
      draw may be performed at a local doctor's office or lab closer to your home if that is more
      convenient for you. If this is done, the results will be sent to the study doctor.

      On Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 4 and 8, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status
      of the disease. If the disease appears to get worse or at any time the doctor thinks it is
      needed, you will have this test repeated.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 7, 10, 13, and so on), you will
      have an ECHO or MUGA scan.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, PD, and biomarker testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is possible, you will have a core tumor biopsy performed for
           biomarker and PD testing.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Every 3-6 months after your last of study drug(s) for up to 5 years, you will be called by a
      member of the study staff to ask how you are doing and if you have started any new
      medications. The call should take about 15-20 minutes.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Arms A - G: RR AML: Patients with AML who are refractory or relapsed (any salvage)
             with no available therapies or not candidates for available therapies. For patients
             with prior MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or MPN who transformed to
             AML, therapy received for MDS, CMML, or MPN is NOT considered as prior therapy for
             AML.

          2. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g.
             FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is
             permitted in Cohort 1 and 2.

          3. Age &gt;/=18 years

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;/=2

          5. Adequate organ function: total bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 times upper limit of normal (x ULN);
             aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &lt;/=2.5 x ULN

          6. Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance &gt;/= 40 mL/min
             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method)

          7. Patients must provide written informed consent.

          8. In the absence of rapidly progressive disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             the time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 14 days for prior
             anti-leukemic therapy, with the exception of hydrea as noted below, OR at least 5
             half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents, whichever is shorter. The half-life for
             the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature
             (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and
             will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The toxicity from prior
             therapy should have resolved to Grade &lt;/=1, however alopecia and sensory neuropathy
             Grade &lt;/=2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigators judgement is
             acceptable. Since the effect of most IO-agents, HMA-therapies, SMO-inhibitors may be
             delayed, use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed
             before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout.

          9. Concurrent therapy for CNS prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS
             disease is permitted. Patients with a known history of CNS disease or leukemic brain
             metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 3 consecutive LPs with no
             evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment and have no ongoing neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the
             treating physician are related to the CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of
             the treatment of the CNS disease are acceptable).

         10. Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment.

         11. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception
             include: • Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

         12. Continued from No. 11; • Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
             taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment • Male
             sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the
             study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient

         13. Continued from No. 12; • Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c)
             a. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms
             of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
             example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception b. Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) c. Barrier methods of
             contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository In case of use of oral
             contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study
             treatment.

         14. Continued from No. 13; Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in
             conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug
             interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential
             if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
             clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
             considered not of child bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible b. Current use of
             immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following: a. intranasal, inhaled,
             topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection); b.
             Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses &lt;/=10 mg/day of prednisone or

         13. Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trials is
             prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines

         14. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions that is active and not well
             controlled including colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or psychiatric conditions
             including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or
             laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

         15. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

         16. Pregnant or breastfeeding
