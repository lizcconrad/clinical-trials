  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past few years, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA),
      microRNAs, autoantibodies, and T-cell receptor repertoire are new biomarkers of liquid biopsy
      in cancer, which has been demonstrated to have a great value in diagnostics, treatment
      evaluation, and prognosis prediction. However, most of previous data were based on late stage
      tumor patients. This study plans to utilize the minimally invasive method to detect the
      changes of numbers of CTCs, ctDNA hot spot mutations and methylation signals, microRNAs,
      autoantibodies, and T-cell receptor repertoire in early stage lung cancer patients before and
      after pulmonary nodule biopsy, during therapeutic and follow-up periods, in order to evaluate
      the clinical values of above tumor-related biomarkers.
