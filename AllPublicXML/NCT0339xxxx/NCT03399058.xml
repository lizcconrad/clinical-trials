  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is the collaboration with the lead agencies National Institute of Public Health,
      World Vision and Emory University World Vision has a history of successfully implementing
      &quot;Positive Deviance/Hearth (PDH)&quot; programs across the globe. PDH is a community-based
      intervention utilizing locally appropriate health and infant feeding practices to
      rehabilitate underweight children and promote behavioral changes in caregivers. A recent
      systematic review on the PD/Hearth approach found that although some programs show clear
      success in particular settings, overall, the results were mixed for program effectiveness.

      Furthermore, with the growing use of mobile phones and technology in the world, including
      Cambodia, there have been various studies and a systematic review that found SMS reminders
      and voice recordings to have promising impact on behavior change of patients for smoking
      cessation and improved adherence to drugs for asthma patients. Although there are positive
      findings around the use of mobile devices to improve behavior change, there has yet to be a
      study that examines the impact of mobile phones on improving behavior change of caregivers
      related to nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health, and caring practices,
      which as a result, would decrease the prevalence of underweight in children 6-23 months of
      age.

      This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the PDH model in Cambodia compared
      to the current standard of care. Investigators believe the PDH approach will be a powerful
      tool to reduce child malnutrition. In addition, given the intensity and cost burden
      associated with PDH, investigators will simultaneously test if the intensity of the PDH model
      can be reduced by introducing an innovative application of mHealth to replace 50% of
      face-to-face education sessions (5 days) and all follow up visits with mobile support calls.
      Collectively this research will provide critical data to inform program operations on the
      optimal and most effective method to reduce child underweight in Cambodia.

      In Year 1, the purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of contextualized
      messages through PDH programs and a mobile technology (mHealth), to improve knowledge,
      behaviour change, and level of confidence of caregivers with underweight children aged 6-23
      months in feeding, hygiene, health-seeking, and caring practices. In Year 2, the study's aim
      will be to assess the prevention of underweight in the siblings of the children included in
      the three programs outside of the 360 study subjects from Year 1.

    <description>Weight, height/length and MUAC will be measured at Baseline (Month 0), Month 3, and Month 12. The data such as weight, height/length, MUAC, gender, and date of birth are needed to calculate the prevalence of underweight children. These data will be entered into the software ENA2015 to compare the weight-for-age, MUAC, height-for-age, and weight-for-height data to the international WHO reference standards in order to identify the underweight status of the children. The investigators will assess the difference in prevalence of underweight children among the three arms between baseline (Month 0), midline (month 3), and endline (month 12).</description>
