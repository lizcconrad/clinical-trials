  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of diabetes group visits that are led by Community Health
      Workers (CHWs). Half of the subjects will be randomized to receive a 6-month, CHW-led group
      visit program (intervention) and the other half will be randomized to receive 6-months of
      treatment as usual in the clinic followed by the group visit program (wait list control). The
      CHWs will receive training and support via telemedicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of Hispanics diagnosed with diabetes is escalating in the US with
      disproportionately higher prevalence and complication rates than other ethnicities. Community
      Health Workers (CHWs) are a well-established and culturally sensitive means to bridge gaps in
      care to individuals with diabetes. However CHWs are often left unsupported, placing patients
      at risk of substandard care or harm. Telemedicine is a term used to describe a range of
      technologies to support healthcare delivery via communication with the patient or a member of
      the healthcare delivery team. Though telemedicine has been implemented into diabetes programs
      for many years, there is a paucity of data showing the use of telemedicine for CHW training
      and support. In a pilot study, the investigators initiated a CHW-led diabetes program for
      resource-poor Hispanics with in-person support for CHWs. The current study utilizes pilot
      data to evaluate the use of telemedicine support for CHWs who lead diabetes programs for
      resource-poor Hispanics. Specifically, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled
      trial in 4 cohort waves with 176 adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The study will
      compare clinical outcomes and treatment satisfaction of subjects who receive a CHW-led
      diabetes group visit program incorporating telemedicine support (intervention, n=88) to
      subjects who receive usual care (wait list control, n=88). In addition, we will analyze the
      acceptability of telemedicine use for CHWs.
