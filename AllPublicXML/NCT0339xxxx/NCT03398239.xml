  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study; To compare the effects of respiratory support options available
      for NIMV at the emergency department; i.e. AVAPS and ST/T modes, on the patient's pCO2
      values, additional treatment need (another non-invasive ventilation method or endotracheal
      intubation) and the duration of stay in hospital.

      Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIMV) is a life-saving procedure for patients
      with hypoxic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure. AVAPS (average volume assured pressure
      support) is a noninvasive ventilation mode which has been developed to assure volume and
      pressure controlled respiratory support. AVAPS can ensure a constant tidal air volume to the
      patient with variable pressure support. Thus the positive features of the volume and pressure
      controlled support, which have a positive impact on the healing and recovery processes are
      combined.

      This study aims to compare, in a randomized order, BPAP ST/T and BPAP ST / T Mode with AVAPS,
      in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure in the emergency department.

      Subjects: One hundred and two patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure will be included.

      Primary outcome; decrease in the PaCO2 values

      Secondary outcomes are stated as; Failure of treatment options, or change of the NIMV mode
      due to patient noncompliance or the patient's need for intubation and length of hospital stay
      (length of stay in the hospital from the emergency department).
