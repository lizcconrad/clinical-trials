  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has plateaued,
      national data indicate that approximately 35% of children and adolescents continue to
      struggle with overweight/obesity. While considerable attention has been given to
      comprehensive behavioral interventions to address obesity in children, there is less
      empirical evidence demonstrating efficacy of interventions with adolescents. Additionally,
      there is great variability and limited impact of adolescent weight control interventions
      which may be attributable to the failure of these interventions to explicitly address emotion
      regulation abilities that are necessary for weight loss. Notably, adolescents with poorer
      general emotion regulation have been found to consume more snack/junk food and report greater
      amounts of sedentary behavior. Poor emotion regulation among adolescents has also been
      associated with more rapid weight gain and greater BMI. This project adapts a previously
      validated Emotion Regulation intervention (TRAC) for at-risk adolescents, targeting sexual
      risk reduction, to focus on weight loss among a sample of overweight and obese adolescents
      (ages 12 to 18). While sexual risk and weight management are distinct health behaviors, this
      same model of emotion regulation could be applied to overweight/obese adolescents attempting
      to lose weight. In fact, data from overweight/obese adolescents attending a past outpatient
      weight management program (N=124) indicate that 82% of these youth report emotion regulation
      scores that are comparable to youth with significant mental health problems. Furthermore,
      higher levels of emotional dysregulation was associated with greater BMI within this same
      sample. These data suggest that emotion regulation is related to health decision making and
      will be relevant to the majority of overweight/obese adolescents seeking to lose weight. The
      current study will be carried out across Phase 1a and 1b. During Phase 1a, the initial
      acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention (HEALTH TRAC) with eight
      adolescents in an open pilot trial will be evaluated. During Phase 1b, 48 adolescents between
      the ages of 13-17 years will be randomized to receive either the HEALTH TRAC or standard
      behavioral weight control intervention (SBWC) and examine the impact on emotion regulation
      abilities and BMI status over an eight-month period. The information gained in this project
      will improve understanding of strategies to improve weight loss outcomes among
      overweight/obsess adolescents and how improving emotion regulation abilities can enhance
      these interventions.

    <description>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)- a 36-item questionnaire designed to assess multiple aspects of emotion regulation (scale: 1 strongly disagree- 5 strongly agree). Measure yields a total score as well as six scales derived through factor analysis: (1. Nonacceptance of emotional response, 2. Difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior [goals], 3. Impulse control difficulties [impulse], 4. Lack of emotion awareness [awareness], 5. Limited access to emotion regulation strategies [strategies] 6. Lack of emotional clarity [clarity] ).</description>

    <description>Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)- &quot;20 item instrument that is one of the most commonly used measures of alexithymia. Alexithymia refers to people who have trouble identifying and describing emotions and who tend to minimize emotional experience and focus attention externally.
3 subscales: 1-difficulty describing emotions (5 items-2,4,11,12,17), 2- difficulty identifying emotions (7 items-1,3,6,7,9,13,14), and 3- the tendency of individuals to focus their attention externally (8 items-5,8,10,15,16,18,19,20) &quot;

    <description>Behavior Indicator of Resiliency to Distress (BIRD)- Manipulation/measure of distress-tolerance. The first level of the BIRD test lasts 3 minutes. The level begins with a 5 second latency between dot presentations and changes this latency based on performance (correct answers will reduce the latency by 0.5 seconds whereas incorrect answers or non-responses increase the latency by 0.5 seconds). At the conclusion of this level an average latency is calculated to index skill level. The second level lasts five total minutes. Following a brief rest period the final level begins and lasts for 5 minutes. At all points in the final level the participant will have an escape option. The &quot;quit game&quot; on the screen can be clicked at any time. Therefore making the total time for this game roughly 10-15 minutes long. (Amstadter et al, 2011)</description>

    <description>Emotions as a Child scale- &quot;examines parental emotional socialization from both parent and child perspectives across 45-items.

    <description>Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC)- &quot;is an instrument for the hetero-evaluation of the level of emotion regulation of children by means of two scales, Emotion Regulation (ER) and Emotional Lability/ Negativity. 24 items that are assessed on a four point Likert scale (1=never, 2=sometimes, 3=often, and 4= almost always). The ERC comprises two scales: one scale contains 8 items to assess ER, while the other scale contains 15 items that measure emotional liability/negativity, including lack of flexibility, emotional activation, reactivity, anger dysregulation, and mood reliability. (L/N α = .96; ER α = .83), and the two scales are signiﬁcantly correlated (r = -.50, p &lt; .001). One single measurement of ER is generated from the overall scores in both sub-scales (α = .89; Shields &amp; Cicchetti, 1997).&quot;</description>

    <description>Emotional Eating Scale (EES)- &quot;25 item self report measure used to assess the propensity to cope with negative affect by eating. Subjects rate their desire to eat in response to each emotion on 5 point scale from &quot;1&quot;I have no desire to eat&quot;&quot; through &quot;5&quot;I have a very strong desire to eat&quot;&quot;&quot; (Range 25- 125, with higher scores indicating more coping with affect by eating)</description>

Used to measure eating disorder psychopathology, with higher scores indicating higher eating disorder psychopathy. Provides a measure of the range and severity of eating disorder features. Also has the ability to generate operational eating disorder diagnoses. Used to screen potential participants [Subscales: Restraint (items 1,2,3,4,5), Eating concern (items 7,9,19,20,21), Shape concern (items 6,8,10,11,23,26,27,28), Weight Concern (8,12,22,24,25) ]</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the Standard Behavioral Weight Control and Emotional Regulation (SBWC+ER) condition receive a 14-session intervention that is comprised of 12 consecutive weekly sessions and 2 booster sessions delivered at weeks 14 and 16. They receive the same information as the Standard Behavioral Weight Control group, but weekly sessions also include elements of TRAC, and it is designed to help teach emotion regulation skills to decrease overeating and sedentary behaviors and increase the likelihood of maintaining diet and exercise behaviors that are taught as part of SBWC interventions.</description>
