  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if treatment results obtained with R-CHOEP in young high-risk
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can be further improved by the addition of
      ibrutinib to this regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Encouraging results have been achieved in younger high-risk patients with newly diagnosed
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOEP. However, more than one fourth of patients
      still relapse or show primary progressive disease. The outcome of such patients is poor, in
      particular if first-line therapy contained rituximab. In order to avoid such detrimental
      situations, we seek to further improve progression-free survival and overall survival by
      combining R-CHOEP with ibrutinib.

      Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, orally administered, potent, small-molecule inhibitor of
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a mediator of critical B-cell signaling pathways implicated in the
      pathogenesis of B-cell cancers.
