  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New trauma alert criteria has been introduced in Sweden, and our aim in this study is to
      evaluate the outcome of the old and new trauma alert criteria in a cohort of 1.300.000
      inhabitants at six hospitals regarding over- and undertriage and number of alerts initiated.
      The Swedish trauma registry is used to identify eligible patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Swedish trauma registry (SweTrau) was initiated in 2011, and has up to date 40.000
      registered patients. In order to evaluate trauma alert criteria implemented during 2017, we
      plan a prospective stepped wedge trial at six hospitals in the Uppsala/Örebro region. These
      hospitals register in SweTrau and all had the same alert criteria prior to the implementation
      of new alert criteria.

      A power estimation show the need for 588 patients in each group in order to show a
      statistical difference between 2-5% undertriage at a 95% CI.

      The including hospitals has a population base of 1.300.000 inhabitants, and the annual number
      of trauma alerts has been about 3.000.

      The registry has information about time of trauma, initiated alerts, Injury Severity Score
      and mechanism of injury suitable for analysis for our hypothesis.
