      The study evaluates the safety of IV tramadol managing post-operative pain following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (Non-clinical summary) Tramadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic of the
      aminocyclohexanol group with opioidlike effects. Tramadol is extensively metabolized
      following administration, which results in a number of enantiomeric metabolites that display
      different opioid-receptor binding properties, and monoaminergic reuptake inhibition.

          -  The patient is taking herbal or dietary supplements or medications that are moderate
             or strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, amitriptyline,
             quinidine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, grapefruit juice) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.,
             carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John's Wort) and cannot go through a minimum washout
             period of 7 days prior to surgery.

          -  The patient cannot be withdrawn from medications (at least 7 days prior to surgery)
             that may lower the seizure threshold (e.g. anti-psychotic agents, MAOI inhibitors) or
             which increase serotonergic tone (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
             (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic
             antidepressants, triptans, amphetamines).

             that may confound the assessments of efficacy or safety.

          -  The patient has cirrhosis, moderate or severe hepatic impairment or an alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value &gt; 3X upper limit of
             normal (ULN) at Screening.

          -  The patient has severe renal impairment or a serum creatinine value of &gt; 2x upper
             limit of normal (ULN) at Screening.

          -  The patient has potassium, sodium, calcium or magnesium levels outside of the normal
             range at Screening.

          -  The patient has a hemoglobin level at screening which, in the judgment of the
