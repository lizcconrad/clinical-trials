  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly-diagnosed GBM will be given personalized exercise regimes during
      concurrent chemo-radiation and up to 3 months later. Study aims are to investigate the
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the exercise program on progression free survival.
      Secondary outcomes of interest include cognition, fatigue, and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant glioma in adults, with a very
      poor prognosis, limited new treatment options, and neurological sequelae, including physical
      and cognitive decline that adversely affect quality of life (QOL). Physical activity may be
      an intervention that attenuates the cognitive and physical decline associated with GBM.
      However, few studies examine physical activity in brain tumor patients, perhaps due to
      challenges in trial design, measuring outcomes, and complexity of care. Aims of this work are
      to develop and implement an individualized exercise intervention for GBM patients to support
      functional independence, and to delay tumor progression and cognitive decline. Methods: GBM
      patients scheduled to be treated with concurrent radiation and chemotherapy will be recruited
      from the neuro-oncology clinic at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Participants will
      receive an individualized, home-based exercise program that includes aerobic and resistance
      training, tailored to prior level of fitness, current physical status, and individual
      interests. They will undergo 1-hr standardized, validated assessments of physical and
      neurocognitive functions, mood, fatigue, and QOL, prior to radiation, and then 3, 6, 12, and
      18 months later. Significance: Identifying interventions that preserve or improve mobility
      and cognitive function will enhance QOL and may lengthen progression-free survival in brain
      tumor patients. Moreover, finding ways to help patients maintain self-care will lessen the
      strain on the health care system (e.g., fewer hospitalizations, delayed utilization of
      palliative care hospice).
