  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ne of the most common cancers in women worldwide is breast cancer. A common used therapy in
      early-stage and metastatic breast cancer involves chemotherapy. Taxanes,
      microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs), are one of the most used chemotherapeutic agents in
      breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this treatment comes with many unfortunate side
      effects. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of these common side
      effects. This condition involves paresthesia, numbness and/or burning pain in distal limbs.
      Eventually, loss of temperature sensation, loss of tendon reflexes and pain sensation can
      occur. Yet, no therapies have been developed to treat CIPN. At the moment, only symptom
      management is possible. Not only will this condition affect the patients' daily activities,
      but a chemotherapy dose reduction could also be necessary, influencing the outcome and
      overall survival rate of the patient.

      A new and emerging treatment for CIPN is photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) or low-level laser
      therapy. During PBMT, visible and/or (near)-infrared laser light is used at the affected area
      to improve tissue repair and thereby promote functional recovery of peripheral nerves.
      Studies have shown positive results for patients with diabetic neuropathy. However, no
      studies have been undertaken specifically for taxane-induced neuropathy (TIN).

      We hypothesize that PBMT is an effective treatment strategy to prevent sensory symptoms
      associated with TIN. This can lead to an improved quality of life for the patient and no need
      for a chemotherapy dose reduction.
