  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of cancer immunotherapy
      ECI-006 and to determine its ability to induce a measurable immune response against the tumor
      associated antigens.

      ECI-006 will be administered 5 times by injection in a lymph node in the groin or armpit.

      ECI-006 activates key immunologically active cells to direct the immune system against the
      cancer. Expected potential risks for ECI-006 are non-serious and related to the local
      administration of the product. Hence, the therapy suggested here has the promise to offer
      considerable benefit to patients without any major risk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 80 years.

          2. Patients must have histologically proven primary malignant melanoma of skin which has
             been surgically removed (see exclusion criterion on patients with primary uveal
             melanoma or melanoma of the mucosae).

          3. Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIc, III or IV.

          4. Patients must have no evidence of disease as evidenced by a whole body 18F
             fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]
             scan to be done at maximum 2 weeks before Visit 2. To exclude the presence of tumor
             lesions in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed.

          5. Full recovery from all prior therapies. A maximum period of 12 weeks following major
             surgery, or any other major invasive procedure is allowed before start of the study
             medication; at least 4 weeks should be between major surgery and the start of the
             immunotherapy

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy test
             at Visit 1 (Screening) and should use an efficient method of birth control from
             screening until the first menses after a 4 week period after the last dose of study
             medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with primary uveal or mucosal melanoma.

          2. Patients who have received prior systemic therapy and/or active immunotherapy for
             melanoma, such as antigen loaded dendritic cells or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T
             cells, are excluded. Systemic adjuvant treatment for melanoma that is more than 5
             years ago and prior local treatment of primary and metastatic tumor lesions (e.g.,
             surgical resection, isolated limb perfusion radiotherapy) are allowed.

          3. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease such as, but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Vitiligo is not an exclusion
             criterion

          4. Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness such as pulmonary [asthma
             or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] or cardiac (New York Heart
             Association [NYHA] class III or IV) or hepatic disease or other illness considered by
             the investigator to constitute an unwarranted high risk for investigational drug
             treatment.

          5. Concurrent second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, or controlled
             superficial bladder cancer. In the event of prior malignancies treated surgically, the
             patient must be considered NED (no evidence of disease) for a minimum of 3 years prior
             to enrolment.

          6. Patients on steroid therapy &gt; 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) or other
             immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or cyclosporine A (but not limited to
             these) are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. Patients must have
             had 8 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy exceeding &gt; 10 mg prednisone (or
             equivalent) before first dose.
