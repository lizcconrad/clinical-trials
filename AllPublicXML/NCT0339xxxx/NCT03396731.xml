        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects are required to meet all of the following criteria for enrollment into
        the study and subsequent randomization.

          1. Male or female aged ≥ 18 years and able to provide written informed consent.

          2. Intact healthy skin at the site of gekoTM device application.

          3. Patients who have a chronic venous leg ulcer determined to be due to underlying venous
             disease following evaluation in a multidisciplinary clinic setting.

          4. A VLU ≥ 2 cm2 and ≤ 20 cm2 in diameter at the study randomisation visit, i.e.
             Treatment Phase Visit 1 (TV1). The largest ulcer will be designated the study ulcer
             and the only one included in the study. If other ulcerations are present on the same
             leg they have to be more than 2 cm apart from the study ulcer.

          5. Study ulcer (current episode of ulceration in case of ulcer recurrence) has been
             present for at least 6 weeks but no more than 5 years prior to study entry (i.e. RV1).

          6. Study ulcer has been treated with Standard Care (SC), i.e. multilayer, multicomponent,
             high level compression therapy, at one of the study sites during a minimum duration of
             four weeks prior to study entry (i.e. RV1).

          7. Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) of 0.8-1.2 inclusive measured at study entry or
             within 4 weeks prior to study entry (i.e. RV1).

          8. No active local or systemic infection for a minimum of 48 hours prior to study entry
             (i.e. RV1).

          9. No systemic antimicrobial treatment for a minimum of seven days prior to study entry
             (i.e. RV1).

         10. Patient understands and is willing to participate in the study and is able to comply
             with study procedures and visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment
        and subsequent randomisation:

          1. Known allergy to any of the protocol-stipulated treatments, or non-tolerance of high
             level multilayer, multicomponent compression therapy.

          2. History of significant haematological disorders (e.g. Sickle Cell disease).

          3. History of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) within six months preceding study entry (i.e.
             RV1).

          4. History of Pyoderma Gangrenosum or other inflammatory ulceration.

          5. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          6. Use of investigational drug or device within four weeks prior to study entry (i.e.
             RV1) that may interfere with this study.

          7. Use of any neuro-modulation device.

          8. Surgery during three months prior to study entry (such as abdominal, gynaecological,
             hip or knee replacement) (i.e. RV1).

          9. Trauma to the lower limbs that would prevent geko™ from stimulating the common
             peroneal nerve.

         10. No involuntary movement of the lower leg/foot at the maximum tolerable device setting.

         11. Any medication deemed by the Investigator to potentially interfere with the study
             treatment (e.g. systemic steroids).

         12. Participation in any other clinical study.
