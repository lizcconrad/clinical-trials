  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the reprogramming of myeloid cells in patients with thyroid
      carcinoma. The investigators hypothesize that tumor-derived factors change the function of
      myeloid cells in such a way that these immune cells promote tumor growth rather than combat
      the tumor.

        Subject has TC with evidence of distant metastases (either newly diagnosed or therapy-naive
        or patients with persistent or recurrent disease); at least 4 months since the previous
        treatment with RAI if applicable

        Subject is diagnosed with MNG, is euthyroid, and is planned to undergo surgery - Group 4:
        Subject is diagnosed with MNG, is euthyroid, and is planned to receive RAI treatment

        - Group 5: Healthy individuals who are euthyroid and have no evidence of thyroid disease
