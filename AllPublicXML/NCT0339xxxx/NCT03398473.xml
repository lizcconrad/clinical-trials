             criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses
                  for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
                  physiological cause; a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming
                  the postmenopausal state.

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure.

          2. Body Mass Index of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt; 50 kg (110 lbs).

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological,
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing), cancer, (except for basal cell carcinoma of
             skin), erythrocytosis, or seizures.

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g. gastrectomy).

          3. History of bleeding ulcer, bleeding abnormalities or coagulation abnormalities.

          4. A positive urine drug screen.

          5. Use of tobacco or nicotine-containing products within 3 months of Screening or a
             positive urine cotinine test (ie, active smokers and those who currently use
             nicotine-containing products are excluded from participation in this study).

          6. Significant drug sensitivity or a significant allergic reaction to any drug, as well
             as known hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to epoetin (or its excipients,
             including benzyl alcohol and any other related drugs).

          7. Any previous use of epoetin.

          8. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for female subjects or
             14 drinks/week for male subjects (1 drink = 5 oz. [150 mL] of wine or as oz. [360 mL]
             of beer or 1.5 oz. [45 mL] of hard liquor) within 6 months before Screening.

          9. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceeding the fits dose of investigational product
             (whichever is longer).

         10. Screening supine BP &gt;= 140 mmHg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mmHg (Diastolic), following at
             least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP &gt;= 140 mmHg (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mmHg
             (Diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

         11. Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval&gt; 450 msec or
             a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.

         12. Subject's with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             Screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) OR alanine aminotransferase (ALT) leve l&gt;= 1.5 X
                  upper limit of normal (ULN);

               -  Total bilirubin level 1.5 X ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome
                  may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided
                  the direct bilirubin level is &lt;= ULN.

         13. Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; fertile male subjects and
             female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use 2 highly
             effective methods of contraception as outline in the protocol for the duration of the
             study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of investigational product.

         14. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product.
             As exceptions, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of &lt;= 1 g/day and
             hormonal contraceptives will be allowed. Limited use of nonprescription medications
             that are not believed to affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may
             be permitted on a case-by-case basis following approval by the sponsor.

         15. A subject who has been administered a drug by depot injection within 30 days prior to
             the initial study drug administration or 6 half-lives of that drug, whichever is
             longer and at the discretion of the investigator, or who has received a recent (6
             weeks prior to admission to the CRU) live or attenuated vaccination, or exposure to
             communicable viral diseases such as chicken pox, varicella, and measles.

         16. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) or approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 60 days prior to dosing.

         17. History of HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C
             antibody (HCVAb).

         18. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Requirements section
             of the protocol.

             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.

         20. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgement of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

         21. May not be able to comply with the requirements of this clinical trial or be able to
             communicate effectively with study personnel, or is considered by the investigator,
             for any reason, to be an unsuitable candidate for the study.
