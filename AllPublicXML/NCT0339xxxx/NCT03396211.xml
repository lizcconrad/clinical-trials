  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, single-center, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and efficacy of adding apatinib to ongoing nivolumab treatment in patients with unresectable
      or metastatic cancer. Approximately 9-18 subjects in Phase I dose escalation phase and up to
      12 additional subjects in Part II expansion phase. Total study duration will be approximately
      12 months: 6 months of recruitment plus 6 months of treatment.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apatinib with nivolumab in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic cancer

        -  To assess efficacy by objective response rate (ORR), best overall response (BOR), time
           to response (TTR), and duration of response (DoR) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST

        -  To assess disease control rate (DCR), and duration of disease control (DDC) by RECIST
           v1.1, and iRECIST

      Secondary objectives:

      • To evaluate the efficacy of apatinib with nivolumab in patients with unresectable or
      metastatic cancer as measured by:

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  Event-free survival (EFS)

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  Tumor mutational burden and mutations at baseline and at the time of progression

        -  Changes in serum cytokines pursuant to treatment response

        -  Changes in PBMC subsets and MDSC populations as determined by flow cytometry

    <intervention_model_description>This protocol contains two parts: 1) a classic 3+3 dose escalation period to evaluate the safety of apatinib in combination with nivolumab, and 2) an expansion period with open-label administration of apatinib at a dose up to 700 mg qd (as 869 mg apatinib mesylate) or at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) obtained from Part I of this study. Subjects for both Part I and Part II will be enrolled after informed consent and deemed eligible following screening procedures.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>28 days (1 cycle (28days) of apatinib; 2 doses of nivolumab (q 2wks))</time_frame>
    <description>A traditional escalation rule, also known as &quot;3 + 3&quot; rule, will be used for this study. Subjects are treated in sequential groups of 3 with each receiving the same dose. If none of the 3 subjects experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) within Cycle 1, the next group of 3 subjects receives the next higher dose. If 1 of the 3 subjects treated at that dose level experience a DLT within Cycle 1, the group will expand to 6 subjects treated at the same dose level. If no additional DLT occurs, the next dosing group will begin. If two or more subjects experience a DLT at the dose level within cycle 1, then escalation stops at that level and the prior dose level will be considered the MTD. The highest dose with only one DLT in 6 subjects or no DLTs with 3 subjects will be considered the MTD.</description>

          8. History of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric stress ulcerations, or peptic ulcer
             disease within the past 3 months prior to enrollment that, in the investigator's

             anti-angiogenesis class drug effects that were related to ramucirumab or bevacizumab
