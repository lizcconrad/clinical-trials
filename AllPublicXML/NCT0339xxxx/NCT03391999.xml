    <textblock>
      The Child Health Utility 9 Dimension (CHU9D) is a relatively new health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL) instrument for use in children and young people. CHU9D has recently been
      translated and linguistic validated into Danish.

      The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, the investigators wants to examine the
      feasibility of using the Danish version of CHU9D to assess the HRQoL in young adults.
      Secondly, the investigators wants to analyse the association of wellbeing, happiness with the
      school and the learning environment with the students HRQoL in the Northern Danish Region of
      Denmark.
