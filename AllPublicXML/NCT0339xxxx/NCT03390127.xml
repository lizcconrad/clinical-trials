      The purpose of the present study is to compare the effect of PEEP on arterial oxygen partial
      pressure in elderly patients undergoing urologic surgery using LMA supreme™ in a lithotomy
      position.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation
      is routinely used as a standard lung protective strategy to prevent postoperative pulmonary
      complications including atelectasis.

      In urologic surgery, elderly patients are common. Since aging decreases the elasticity of
      lung tissues and allowing the collapse of small airways, old age is a risk factor for
      postoperative atelectasis. Lithotomy position is the preferred position in urologic surgery.
      However, it causes the abdominal viscera to displace the diaphragm cephalad, reducing lung
      compliance and resulting atelectasis. Therefore, in elderly patients undergoing urologic
      surgery with lithotomy position, PEEP may be essential to prevent postoperative atelectasis.

      Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) has been widely used in urologic surgery with lithotomy position
      because of short surgical time and no necessity of administration of muscle relaxant.
      However, application of PEEP when using LMA is still controversy. Therefore, in the present
      study, we aimed to compare the effect of PEEP on arterial oxygen partial pressure in elderly
      patients undergoing urologic surgery using LMA supreme™ in a lithotomy position.
