  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periorbital hyperchromia (POH) or periorbital hyperpigmentation, commonly known as &quot;dark
      circles&quot;, is a relatively common condition and a frequent reason for dermatological
      consultation. It is defined as brown-colored pigmentation, ranging from light to dark, which
      mainly involves the lower eyelids. POH affects individuals over a wide age range, including
      both sexes and all ethnicities, and is associated with a tired and aged facial appearance.
      The most commonly affected people are those with the highest skin phototypes. Although the
      prevalence is similar between sexes and age groups, POH is a more frequent complaint in
      women. The dark circles characteristic of POH can negatively impact patients' quality of
      life, although it is not a condition associated with morbidity. Popularly it is believed that
      the poor quality of sleep is a factor responsible for its appearance, but there is no
      consistent data in the literature that prove this.

      We aim to compare the quality of sleep through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-BR)
      already translated and validated in Portuguese for patients with periorbicular hyperchromia
      (cases) with patients without this complaint (controls) and to compare dermatological quality
      of life through the Quality of Life in Dermatology Index (DLQI) already translated and
      validated for Portuguese patients with periorbicular hyperchromia (cases) with patients
      without this complaint (controls). Patients and / or family members who consult in the
      Dermatology of the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre (preferably), but also other patients
      and / or relatives with outpatient care in this institution will be invited to participate in
      the control group.

      The WinPepi program, version 11.32, was used to calculate the sample size. This objective
      predicts a Pareto Control Case study by age, with a ratio of 1: 1. The sample size was 252
      subjects, 126 cases and 126 controls. Adding 10% to possible losses and refusals the sample
      size should be 280 subjects, with 140 cases and 140 controls. This value was stipulated
      taking into account the mean of 5.9 in the PSQI-BR of the cases already collected (n = 148
      subjects) and corresponds to a difference of almost 3 points in the index ranging from zero
      to 21, corresponding to approximately 15% difference between groups. For this calculation was
      considered 80% power and significance level of 5%.

    <description>To evaluate the sleep quality in patients with periocular hyperpigmentation comparing with patients without periocular hyperpigmentation. The questionnaire consists of 19 questions, which are grouped into 7 components, with values distributed on a scale of zero to 3. These components are subjective quality of sleep, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency , sleep disorders, use of sleeping pills, and daytime dysfunction. The scores of these components are summed to form a global score, ranging from zero to 21. The higher the score, the worse the quality of sleep. A PSQI score&gt; 5 indicates that the individual is experiencing major difficulties in at least 2 components, or moderate difficulties in more than 3 components.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the impact of periocular hyperpigmentation on patients' dermatological quality of life comparing with patients without periocular hyperpigmentation. this is a score used to evaluate the damage caused by dermatological diseases. It consists of 10 questions, with four alternative answers, corresponding to scores from 0 to 3. The maximum score is 30 and the minimum is zero, with 30 being the highest loss in the dermatological quality of life.</description>
