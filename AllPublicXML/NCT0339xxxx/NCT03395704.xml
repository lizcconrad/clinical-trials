  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind study. The
      primary objective of the study is to compare the effect of weekly dosing of LJPC-401
      (synthetic human hepcidin) versus placebo on transferrin saturation (TSAT) in an adult
      hereditary hemochromatosis patient population.
