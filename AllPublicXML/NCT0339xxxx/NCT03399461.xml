  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WAS is a rare primary immune deficiency disease caused by genetic mutation and is more common
      in males than females. The purpose of this study is to understand experiences of WAS subjects
      and caregivers to identify important concepts of interest that could be measured in future
      Phase IIIb trials. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study that will include a sample of
      approximately, 8 subjects with WAS and 13 caregivers of subjects with a diagnosis of WAS in
      the United States, United Kingdom and France. A 60 to 90 minute open-ended interview will be
      conducted over the telephone or video conference that will be audio-recorded for subsequent
      transcription. The aim of these interviews is to obtain subject and caregiver perspectives on
      the impact of WAS and its associated treatments on quality of life and experiences of living
      with WAS.
