  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a significant number of patients suffering from back pain, even basic daily activities
      become impossible. It is at this time that spinal surgery becomes necessary in order to
      improve the patient's quality of life. To combat these symptoms, surgical implants (e.g.
      pedicle screws, rods, etc.) are used to aid in stabilizing and correcting the deformities of
      the spine, particularly after spinal decompression. The clinical need for spinal surgery is
      compounded by current and continuing demographic trends. As the general population continues
      to age, the number of orthopaedic surgical interventions is expected to rise drastically.
      Therefore, a significant opportunity exists for the implementation of surgical guidance
      technologies, for orthopaedic procedures, to combat this overwhelming health care burden.

      The hypothesis is that optical visualization of surgically exposed anatomy with the
      Biophotonics and Bioengineering Lab (BBL) surgical navigation prototype, when registered with
      pre-operative imaging (CT or MRI), can accurately estimate subsurface anatomy and allow
      tracking the position of surgical instruments in real-time, using an intraoperative
      non-contact optical imaging system during spinal surgical procedures.
