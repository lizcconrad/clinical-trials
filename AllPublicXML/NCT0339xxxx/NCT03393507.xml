      Ovarian cancer and fallopian tube cancer are common gynecological malignancies in our
      country. Ovarian cancer ranks the second in the incidence of gynecologic malignancies. The
      mortality rate is the highest. The following three major characteristics exist: First, 70% of
      the patients are advanced patients; 70% of the patients Easy to relapse after treatment;
      Third, 5-year survival rate of about 30%, a serious threat to women's health. Our hospital
      ovarian cancer, tubal cancer patients because of regional constraints, the economy is poor,
      the more the past, the use of simple chemotherapy, relapse rate and mortality were higher.

      In the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, bevacizumab plus CP is
      recommended for patients with stage II, III, and IV ovarian cancer and fallopian tube cancer,
      and clinical trials of new drugs are recommended for recurrent / metastatic ovarian cancer.
      Apatinib mesylate is a small molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor authored by Jiangsu
      Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., whose chemical name is N- [4- (Cyanocyclopentyl)
      phenylmethane sulfonate ] [2 - [(4-picolyl) amino] (3-pyridyl)] carboxamide of the formula
      C25H27N5O3S with a molecular weight of 493.58 (mesylate salt).Apatinib can effectively
      inhibit VEGFR-2 at a very low concentration, while higher concentrations can inhibit the
      action of apatinib, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), c-Kit and c- The
      site is the intracellular ATP binding site of the protein tyrosine receptor. Pharmacodynamic
      studies show that apatinib can inhibit the VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity, blocking VEGF
      signaling after binding, resulting in inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Preclinical studies
      have shown that apatinib has a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of many human nude mice
      xenografts such as sarcoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer and
      liver cancer and is a broad-spectrum anti-tumor drug.
