      -  From parents collected during semi-structured interviews.

        -  To highlight the social, environmental and economic difficulties that parents have
           encountered in the context of the premature birth of their child (before birth, during
           hospitalization and return home).

        -  Determine the possible help they need in the psychosocial and environmental field.

        -  Difficulties of the parents we expected:

             -  Pre-existing child birth: poor socio-economic environment, unstable social, family
                and / or occupational status, poorly followed pregnancy, etc.

             -  After the birth: professional break-up, custody of other children of the siblings,
                balance of the couple, financial loss, isolation, transportation problems to get to
                the hospital, etc.

        -  Needs we expected :

             -  Before birth: measures to prevent prematurity, social and/or psychological support,
                information, etc.

             -  After the birth: support of the entourage, interview with a social worker, help to
                come in hospital, help to live near the hospital, parental leave, project and
                long-term support, doctor referred, relationship with professionals in ambulatory
                (psychologist, Infant and Maternal Protection ...), preparation of the arrival of
                the child at home +/- home improvement, etc.

    <description>Semi-structured interviews of the parents of preterm infants. 3 weeks after their child has left hospital. They will be made either at the University Hospital of Besançon. They will take place in a dedicated hospital ward to ensure the confidentiality of the statements made between the investigator and the parent.
They will follow a predefined questionnaire. They will be fully recorded on a dictaphone with note taking during the interview by the investigator and will be transcribed in writing anonymously and confidentially on Word.
The content of the interviews will be analyzed:
As a first step, it will be a vertical analysis of the thematization of each interview
Then, in a second step, a transversal analysis between the contents of the different interviews.</description>
