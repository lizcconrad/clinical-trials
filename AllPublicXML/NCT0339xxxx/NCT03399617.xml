  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to prevent undernutrition and obesity in children under two
      years old in rural areas of Guatemala. This study is designed to evaluate whether the
      proposed treatment reduces the prevalence of overweight, underweight and low height-for-age
      indicators in the rural environment of Baja Verapaz. This study design has been developed in
      conjunction with colleagues from Fundazúcar, a local foundation in Guatemala.

      SPOON Guatemala is an innovative strategy to prevent undernutrition and obesity in children
      aged 0-24 months living in high-poverty areas of Guatemala. SPOON focuses on improving
      feeding practices for infant and young children, including exclusive breastfeeding during a
      child's first six months, and promoting the use of peanut-based SQ-LNS (Small Quantity,
      Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements), for children 6 to 24 months of age.

      The SPOON intervention consists of two different experimental arms: one control group and one
      treatment group. Communities in the intervention area will be randomly assigned to the
      control or treatment group. The control group will receive the standard services provided by
      their local health services, which include the provision of micronutrient powder. This powder
      is a package of vitamins and minerals that are sprinkled onto the child's food to increase
      his or her consumption of micronutrients. The treatment group will receive the SQ-LNS
      supplement in addition to a social communication strategy called Mejores Familiias. Mejores
      Familias teaches various lessons to the children's caregivers. The lessons include the
      importance of breastfeeding exclusively before the child is 6 months of age, maintaining
      hygienic practices in the home while preparing food, and providing nutritious food to the
      child mixed in with the SQ-LNS supplement.

      Measuring the differences in outcomes between the participants in the control and treatment
      group will enable us to measure the combined impact of the Mejores Familias program and the
      SQ-LNS supplement.
