  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence, concerns and satisfaction with information in German patients with adrenal
      insufficiency as well as the influence of a standardized education program will be assessed
      by a compared cross-sectional and longitudinal study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) require a lifelong replacement therapy with
      glucocorticoids (GC). To avoid over- and under- replacement, an individual daily dose scheme
      and adequate dose adjustment during stressful events is essential. Recent patient surveys
      revealed nonadherence to treatment, concerns about GC and dissatisfaction with the provided
      information.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the adherence, concerns and satisfaction with
      information in German patients with primary and secondary AI (PAI/SAI) and the influence of a
      standardized education program.

      Patients with AI on GC therapy will be assessed by questionnaire, including the Medication
      Adherence Report Scale* (MARS), Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire* (BMQ, adapted for AI)
      and Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale* (SIMS).*©Professor Rob Horne.

      The study includes one cross-sectional-analysis and one longitudinal study (patient survey
      before and after participation at the standardized education program in Germany).

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of &quot;Beliefs about Medicines&quot; by BMQ-questionnaire (modified BMQ AI Specific© by Prof Rob Horne). The modified BMQ AI Specific© comprises: a 5-item Glucocorticoid-Necessity subscale assessing the participant's views about their personal need for the glucocorticoid medication and an 11-item Glucocorticoid-Concerns subscale assessing participants' concerns about the potential adverse consequences of taking glucocorticoids. For each BMQ statement, participants indicated their agreement on a 5-point Likert scale (range 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). GC-Necessity and GC-Concerns scores are computed by summing all subscale responses, then dividing by the number of items (range 1-5). Scores near five indicate high Necessity. Scores near one indicate high Concern.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale (SIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of &quot;Satisfaction with Information about Medicines&quot; by SIMS-questionnaire (Prof Rob Horne). Participants complete the SIMS© to indicate their satisfaction with the information they had received about their glucocorticoids. The SIMS has two subscales. The first assesses satisfaction with the information received about the Action and Usage of glucocorticoids (SIMS AU 9-items). The second assesses satisfaction with information about dealing with Potential Problems associated with glucocorticoids (SIMS PP 8-items). For each subscale item, participants state whether they were satisfied with the amount of information they had received (about right, none needed) or dissatisfied (too much, too little, none received). Subscale scores are calculated by counting the total number of 'satisfied' responses.</description>

    <measure>Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS)</measure>

    <description>Evaluation of &quot;Adherence&quot; by MARS-questionnaire. Participants rate their adherence to glucocorticoids on an 8-item Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS)© (Prof Rob Horne), modified for AI. Participants rate the frequency with which they perform each type of nonadherent behaviour on a 5-point scale (1=very to 5=never). Scores are summed to give a total score (range 8-40); higher scores indicate higher reported adherence.</description>
