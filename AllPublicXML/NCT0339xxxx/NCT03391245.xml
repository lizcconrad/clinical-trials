  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that vitamin D has an important role in calcium metabolism and bone
      mineralization. Its deficiency is related to rickets and osteomalacia in children and adults
      respectively. Vitamin D had a role in innate and acquired immunity. It increases innate
      defense and modulates lymphocytes activation, leading to a change toward a T2 helper response
      ).

      The role of vitamin D deficiency on the risk of bacterial infection among patients in
      intensive care units has been reported. An observational studies in children reported an
      association between low 25-OH vitamin D level and infectious viral diseases .

      The deranged metabolism of vitamin D in liver cirrhosis was first reported in the late '70s
      and was attributed mainly to impaired 25(OH)-vitamin D hydroxylation of the precursor vitamin
      D caused by impaired liver function. Low level of vitamin D was found independently to be
      associated with increased risk of bacterial infections in patients with liver cirrhosis.

      The observed relationship between the lack of vitamin D and the increase risk of mortality in
      cirrhotic patients could be attributed to bacterial infections. Thus, the association of low
      vitamin D levels with liver insufficiency and infections supports the use of vitamin D as a
      prognostic marker in the population of cirrhosis.

      Studies on the role of vitamin D as a risk factor for infections in patients with liver
      cirrhosis are not well studied in our locality(Upper Egypt).
