      To assess the efficacy, safety and Population Pharmacokinetic (PPK) of morinidazole and
      sodium chloride injection with levofloxacin hydrochloride and sodium chloride injection
      sequential of levofloxacin hydrochloride tablets in women with pelvic inflammatory disease:

      Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a spectrum of upper genital tract inflammations
      comprising endometritis, salpingitis, parametritis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess and/or
      pelvic peritonitis. The objectives of administering antimicrobial therapy in patients with
      PID are to control the symptoms and to prevent the late sequelae of the disease. Because
      anaerobe infections (e.g., Bacteroides fragilis infections) are associated with tubal and
      epithelial damage, anaerobic coverage is routinely recommended in women with pelvic
      infection. Guidelines have been developed in both the USA and Europe with regard to PID
      management. Metronidazole, a member of the nitroimidazole drug class, is included in the
      regimens recommended for improving anaerobic bacteria coverage. The sideeffects of
      metronidazole include a metallic taste, nausea, transient neutropenia, and peripheral
      neuropathy. Antimicrobial resistance to metronidazole has emerged after several decades of
      worldwide use of the drug. Morinidazole, a National Class I Antimicrobial, is a new type of
      third-generation nitroimidazole antimicrobial that is used for treating amoebiasis,
      trichomoniasis, and anaerobic bacterial infections, and which exhibits greater activity and
      less toxicity than metronidazole.

      Morinidazole and Sodium Chloride Injection used in PID or appendicitis cases had been
      approved by CFDA in 2014. This phase 4 study is to assess the efficacy, safety and Population
      Pharmacokinetic (PPK) of morinidazole in PID.
