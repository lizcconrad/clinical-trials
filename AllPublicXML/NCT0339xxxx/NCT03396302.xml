  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe a totally self-applied online program to promote healthy
      lifestyles (nutritional education and exercise practice) for obese participants with
      hypertension. Participants will be recruited from users of a hypertension unit of a public
      hospital and will be randomized into two groups: experimental group and control group
      (treatment as usual). The experimental program (3 months) will be composed by 8 modules aimed
      for promoting healthy eating habits and increase physical activity. Assessment will include:
      body composition (BMI), blood pressure, glucose metabolism variables, and physical activity
      level (measured with accelerometers).

      Design: Randomized Controlled Trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy eating and regular exercise play an important role to maintain health while ageing.
      Nutritional education and exercise practice could be monitored by different means, such as
      Internet, face to face and/or through exercise diaries. Information and Communication
      Technologies (ICTs) could be a useful tool to promote health, and could be used to work on
      barriers, such as low motivation and difficulties to maintain exercise or diet. ICTs also
      have other important advantages, especially their good cost-benefit relationship and the
      possibility of increasing the efficiency of interventions, allowing them to reach a wider
      audience at a lower cost. This study aims to describe a totally self-applied online program
      to promote healthy lifestyles (nutritional education and exercise practice) for obese
      participants with hypertension. Participants will be recruited from users of a hypertension
      unit of a public hospital and will be randomized into two groups: experimental group and
      control group (treatment as usual). The experimental program (3 months) will be composed by 8
      modules aimed for promoting healthy eating habits and increase physical activity. Assessment
      will include: body composition (BMI), blood pressure, glucose metabolism variables, and
      physical activity level (measured with accelerometers).
