  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study whose purpose is see how useful investigational drug, avelumab, is in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic penile cancer who are unfit for or progressed on
      platinum-based chemotherapy.

      The usefulness of avelumab in this study population will be determined by anti-tumor activity
      assessed by objective response rate.

      Avelumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called programmed death-ligand 1
      (PD-L1) and blocks its communication with another protein called programmed death protein 1
      (PD-1). The communication of these proteins are thought to be important in the growth of
      tumors. Blocking these proteins from communicating may stop or shrink tumors.

    <description>Avelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 isotype. Avelumab selectively binds to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and competitively blocks its interaction with programmed death protein 1 (PD-1).</description>
