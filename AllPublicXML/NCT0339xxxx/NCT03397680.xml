  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H.pylori is an organism which causes gastric inflammation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), mucosa
      associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and gastric cancer.

      Practical guideline for treatment of patients with dyspepsia and H.pylori eradication
      recommended the 14-day triple therapy regimen which had curable about 70% by using proton
      pump inhibitor (PPI) combined with antibiotics including amoxicillin, clarithromycin and
      metronidazole.

      Up to date, there has been no evidence about the cure rate for H.pylori eradication with
      once-daily dose regimen of high dose rabeprazole and levofloxacin based therapy. This
      research is to study the 7-day and 14-day cure rate of H.pylori eradication treatment with
      once-daily regimen of high dose rabeprazole-levofloxacin based quadruple therapy.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants with positive rapid urease test or pathologic findings were divided into 2 groups and enrolled into randomization with 1:1 block of four methods. Each participant in group1 received 7-day once daily dose regimen of 1-tablet 750-mg Levofloxacin after meal, 2-tablet 500-mg Clarithromycin MR after meal, 3-tablet 20-mg Rabeprazole before meal and 1-tablet 1,048-mg Gastro bismol after meal.
Meanwhile, each participant in group2 received 14-day once daily dose regimen of 1-tablet 750-mg Levofloxacin after meal, 2-tablet 500-mg Clarithromycin MR after meal, 3-tablet 20-mg Rabeprazole before meal and 1-tablet 1,048-mg Gastro bismol after meal.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants with positive rapid urease test or pathologic findings evidenced for H.pylori received 14-day once daily dose regimen.

Eradication rate was defined as proportion of post-treatment cases with negative urea breath test compared to pre-treatment cases with positive rapid urease test or pathologic findings evidenced for H.pylori.</description>
