  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to establish the primary hypothesis that Optical coherence tomography-guided
      Percutaneous coronary intervention(OCT-guided PCi) is superior to Intravascular ultrasound
      guided Percutaneous coronary intervention(IVUS-guided PCI) regarding the target vessel
      failure at 1 year.
