  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Egypt has a very high prevalence of HCV and a high morbidity and mortality from chronic liver
      disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Approximately 20% of Egyptian blood donors
      are anti-HCV positive. Egypt has higher rates of HCV than neighboring countries as well as
      other countries in the world with comparable socioeconomic conditions and hygienic standards
      for invasive medical, dental, or paramedical procedures.

      Donor safety is on the top of our priorities as a team and it is widely recognized
      intraopertively during hepatectomy, there are several potential risks during the
      Perioperative period .

      to a conclusion that intraoperative fluid management aids to the reduction of the
      intraoperative bleeding during the procedure, adequate and guided fluid management is
      considered one of the important strategies to reduce the blood loss besides of the other
      anesthetic techniques like hemodilution, normovolemia, cell salvage usage , high Stroke
      volume variation (SVV) method ,and low CVP technique , the last method is considered the most
      applicable, simpler, and cost effective technique which could be easier to be performed.

    <description>diagnostic criteria for volume assessment were heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), central venous pressure (CVP), and urine output hourly (UOP) in ml/hr. During period of hypovolemia, all enrolled patients had left IJV scanned (T0) and measured by one anesthesiologist experienced in point-of-care ultrasound. This point-of-care anesthesiologist is not involved in the anesthetic management of the patient and blinded to the volume status of the patient values. Hypovolemic patients were given a fluid bolus in the form of ringer acetate 5 ml / Kg. Ultrasonic and hemodynamic measurements are reassessed 10 minutes (T 10) after the fluid resuscitation.</description>
