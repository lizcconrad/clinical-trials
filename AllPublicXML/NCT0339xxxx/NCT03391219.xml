    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to compare the effect of combined intravitreal Bevacizumab and Fasudil
      injection with Bevacizumab only injection in patients with persistant macular edema secondary
      to ratinal vein occlusion.

      Methods:

      In this study patients with retinal vein occlusion patient who had at least three or more
      intravitreal AntiVEGF injection with persistence of macular edema at funduscopic examination
      is recruited. The eligible patients in randomized in two groups &quot;Bevacizumab&quot; and
      &quot;Bavacizumab + Fasudil&quot; and in injected intravitreally for 3 times monthly. In
      &quot;Bevacizumab+Fasudil&quot; group patients receive two injections at each session Bavacizumab and
      Fasudil. In &quot;Bevacizumab&quot; group patients receive only Bevacizumab. The patients are followed
      for 6 months and central macular thickness and visual acuity is measured at baseline and
      monthly for 6 month. Baseline ancillary exams include Fluorescein Angiography and
      OCT-Angiography which is performed at the final exam as well. Patients needing any
      therapeutic intervention is addressed during the 6 month follow up period.
