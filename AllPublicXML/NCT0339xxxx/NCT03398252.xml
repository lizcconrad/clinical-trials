    <textblock>
      Participants (N=10/group) will consist of non-treatment seeking individuals with AUD.

      Following informed consent and baseline screening, participants will partake in 3 stress
      induction sessions to assess their stress levels and cravings for alcohol. Participants will
      be randomized to receive either increasing doses of doxazosin XL (0, 4, and 8 mg) or placebo
      in a double-blind manner.

    <description>Delay discounting will be assessed for both money and alcohol using a computerized task at weekly clinic visits. Delays will range from 1 day to 25 years, and monetary values will range from $0 to $1,000. In the case of alcohol discounting, the unit of alcohol (e.g., bottle, shot, glass, etc.) and cost of alcohol will be individually assessed in order to present choices that are monetarily equivalent to the money discounting task.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet DSM-5 criteria for AUD;

          -  Report excessive alcohol use as defined by CDC guidelines in the past month (&gt;7
             drinks/week for woman, &gt;14 drinks/week for men, &gt;3 drinks/occasion for women&gt;4
             drinks/occasion for men)3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physical dependence on alcohol assessed using the SCID and Clinical Institute
             Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWAA)41.

          -  Presenting an Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory (AUDIT) score indicative of severe
             alcohol dependence (≥13 for women, ≥15 for men);

          -  Meeting criteria for substance use disorder on drugs other than alcohol and nicotine;

          -  Currently taking a prescribed psychoactive medication (e.g., atomoxetine for ADHD). In
             addition, exclusion for those individuals taking CYP3A4 inhibitors. Most participants
             will not be taking any concomitant medications (including over-the-counter
             supplements). For those who are taking an allowed medication, the study physician will
             determine if the medications are CYP3A4 inhibitors.

          -  Medical conditions contraindicating doxazosin XL pharmacotherapy (e.g., postural
             hypotension);

          -  Taking contraindicated medications such as blood pressure medications;

          -  Be pregnant, nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant during the course of the study;

          -  Have any other illness, condition, or use of medications, which in the opinion of the
             PI and/or admitting physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion of the
             study.
