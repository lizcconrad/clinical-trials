      This study will investigate the prevalence of Shanghai area's infant with FGIDs symptom and
      contrast for the FGIDs symptoms by using different intervention means, and evaluate the
      effectiveness of FGIDs symptoms in infants by using partially hydrolyzed whey protein and low
      lactose infant formulation.
