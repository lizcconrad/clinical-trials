    <textblock>
      In addressing the need for effective post treatment support for men (and their partners)
      following treatment for prostate cancer, the investigators will employ an innovative
      SHAReClinic (Sexual health and Rehabilitation eClinic Program) that emphasizes: 1) a
      bio-medical component (erectile rehabilitation), focused on the long term return of erectile
      functioning firm enough for penetration with or without erectile agents/devices; and 2) a
      psychological component (intimacy maintenance), involving the maintenance or restoration of
      couples' intimacy. Through comparison research, the eClinic will be analyzed and made
      comparable in quality to the programs offered currently at leading institutions in major
      metropolitan areas, thus providing personalized, comprehensive cancer care to all Canadians.

    <textblock>
      The considerable prevalence of sexual dysfunction (SD) after prostate cancer treatment,
      coupled with the severity/breadth of impact and lack of successful intervention makes SD
      post-treatment one of the most substantial health-related quality of life burdens in all of
      cancer survivorship. In 2014, it is estimated that 24,000 Canadians will be diagnosed with
      prostate cancer (PC) and 4,100 men will die of the disease. Accordingly, 19,900 men will be
      added to the pool of Canadian prostate cancer survivors in just one year. Today, there are
      approximately 250,000 prostate cancer survivors across Canada. Research with men in
      post-radiation therapy indicates that 24-59% suffer SD, while 40%-75% of men in post-radical
      prostatectomy suffer SD. Sixty percent of men experience significant distress in response to
      SD. Distress is especially elevated in younger men and evidence suggests that partners may
      experience even greater distress than patients. Research examining the nature of the distress
      reveals that the significance of SD reaches far beyond the ability to have an erection, and
      resides in its complex psychosocial implications, including intimacy loss, low self-esteem,
      guilt, depression, anxiety, and anger. Additional evidence suggests that patients' SD-related
      distress can lead to long-term maladjustment in their overall relationships with their
      partners. The burden of SD following treatment for prostate cancer is responsible for the
      single greatest impact on patient/partner/couple health-related quality of life;
      substantially more so than concern for cancer recurrence. Unfortunately, there are no
      reported interventions to date that have been successful in reducing the impact of SD
      following treatment, on long-term couple health-related quality of life. Accordingly, given
      the extensive impact of SD on patient/partner health-related quality of life (HRQOL) there is
      an existent need for restorative/rehabilitative intervention.

      The current study proposes the application of an online bio-psychosocial intervention to
      address sexual dysfunction following treatment for prostate cancer. The bio-medical approach
      will apply a broader definition of penile rehabilitation which will focus on applying a
      systematic pro-erectile aid regimen to assist patients in achieving long-term return of
      erectile functioning, firm enough for penetration, with or without the use of pro-erectile
      agents/devices. The investigators have termed this bio-medical rehabilitation approach,
      Erectile Rehabilitation. As such, the rehabilitation algorithm includes but is not limited to
      the goal of return of natural functioning. Overall, the investigators endeavour to help
      patients find and adapt to the least invasive pro-erectile agent /device that is successful
      in achieving desired erections. The investigators justify this approach through extensive
      research that demonstrates that, following prostate cancer treatment, patients who use
      pro-erectile agents report better erectile functioning versus those who do not use
      pro-erectile agents. In addition to addressing Erectile Rehabilitation, this intervention
      will offer psychosocial support, with the goal of helping couples maintain or restore
      intimacy after treatment for prostate cancer. Health coach interventions aim at improving
      sexual satisfaction following prostate cancer treatment have been shown to improve distress
      and sexual function, and provide patients with the information on pro-erectile aids and
      couples' experiences.

    <description>Female Sexual Function Inventory (FSFI): the FSFI is a brief, 19-item self-report measure of female sexual function that provides scores on six domains of sexual function (Desire, Arousal, Lubrication, Orgasm, Satisfaction, Pain) as well as a total score. The full scale score is obtained by adding the six domain scores. It should be noted that within the individual domains, a domain score of zero indicates that no sexual activity was reported during the past month.

    <description>Prolonged Grief about the Loss of Sexual Function (PGLSF) is adapted from Prigerson's measure of prolonged grief in bereavement. Combinatoric analyses identified the most sensitive and specific Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) algorithm that was then tested to evaluate its psychometric validity. Criteria require reactions to a significant loss that involve the experience of yearning (e.g., physical or emotional suffering as a result of the desired, but unfulfilled, reunion with the deceased) and at least five of the following nine symptoms experienced at least daily or to a disabling degree: feeling emotionally numb, stunned, or that life is meaningless; experiencing mistrust; bitterness over the loss; difficulty accepting the loss; identity confusion; avoidance of the reality of the loss; or difficulty moving on with life. The PGLSf consists of 22 items with a Likert scale of 1 to 5: higher score indicates a higher grief level.</description>

    <measure>Change of Sexual desire and activity from different time points</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire will be completed by all participants at T1 (pre-treatment), T2 (6 weeks after treatment), T5 (6 months after treatment) and T6 (12 months after treatment) online visits.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Sexual Interest and sexual activity are used were to measure sexual activity and sexual desire in this study. For patients with cancer who may or may not have sexual dysfunction, the PROMIS SexFS measures provide a comprehensive assessment of key domains of sexual function and satisfaction. The questionnaire has 13 items in total with Likert scale of 1 to 5. Higher score indicates a higher sexual activity/desire level.</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that participants are experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each question has a scale of 0 to 3 and the total score can be calculated for the two domains (anxiety and depression) by adding the scores together. For each domain, a score of 0-7 = Normal level of anxiety/depression; a score of 8-10 = borderline case of anxiety/depression; 11-21 = case of anxiety/depression.</description>

    <description>Sexual Distress Scale (SDS) is used in this study to measure sexual distress. SDS was created and validated to assess sexually related distress—that is, distress associated with inadequate or impaired sexual function. It has 13 items in all with a Likert scale from 0 to 4; higher score indicates a higher distress level.</description>

    <description>Patient Oriented Prostate Cancer Utility Survey (PORPUS) was used in this study to measure quality of life for patients after prostate treatment. The PORPUS contains 10 questions. There are 5 general questions (pain, energy, emotional well-being, social well-being, and relationship with physician) and 5 prostate cancer-specific questions (sexual function and desire, urinary frequency and incontinence, and bowel function), each with four to six possible answers, scoring 1 to 4 (6). Higher score indicates a better function in the respective domain.</description>

The version we used contains 26 item and the 5 domains: Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal.
