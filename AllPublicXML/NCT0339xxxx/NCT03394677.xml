    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, vehicle controlled, double-blind Phase 2 study in
      pediatric patients age 2-17 years old with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of a 0.5% BID
      concentration of RVT-501 in pediatric patients 2-17 years of age with mild to moderate atopic
      dermatitis. The pharmacokinetics of RVT-501 will also be evaluated in patients 2-11 years of
      age.

    <measure>Efficacy - Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be assessed by determining the proportion of patients who achieve an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 and at least a 2-point improvement in IGA at Week 4. The IGA will be assessed at every study visit. The IGA is a 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity and will be determined according to the following categories: 0-clear; 1-almost clear; 2-mild disease; 3-moderate disease; 4-severe disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy - Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be assessed by determining the proportion of patients who achieve a 50% reduction in Eczema Area Severity Index score (EASI-50) at Week 4.The EASI will be assessed at every study visit. It quantifies the severity of a patient's atopic dermatitis based on both lesion severity and the percent of body surface area affected. The EASI is a composite score ranging from 0-72 that takes into account the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored from 0 to 3 separately) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region relative to the whole body.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy - Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be assessed as change from Baseline to Week 4 in peak pruritus as measured with the 24-hour Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Peak Pruitus NRS will be measured at each visit. The assessment consists of a patient-rated scale of 0-10, where 0 is &quot;No itch&quot; and 10 is the &quot;Worst itch possible.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy - Whole body surface area (BSA) affected</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>This exploratory endpoint will be evaluated as the change in total score from Baseline at all visits in whole body BSA (body surface area) affected. Whole body BSA affected will be assessed at every visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency and severity of adverse events (local and systemic)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be coded using the most current release of MedDRA® (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). The number and proportion of subjects with adverse events will be summarized by treatment, system organ class, and preferred term for all adverse events, all adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to study drug, all serious adverse events, and all adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female pediatric patients ages 2-17 years of age with confirmed diagnosis of
             atopic dermatitis by Hanifin and Rajka criteria [Hanifin, 1980].

          2. Patients with atopic dermatitis covering 5% to 40% of the body surface area (BSA) and
             with an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of 2 or 3 (mild or moderate atopic
             dermatitis) at Baseline. Scalp, palms, and soles should be excluded from the BSA
             calculation to determine eligibility at Baseline.

             Note: Patients with mild disease (IGA = 2) will be limited to approximately 25% of
             total enrollment.

          3. Females of childbearing potential and male patients who are engaging in sexual
             activity that could lead to pregnancy must use the following adequate birth control
             methods while on study and for 2 weeks after stopping the study drug. Acceptable
             contraception methods are:

               -  Male or male partner with vasectomy, OR

               -  Male condom AND partner use of one of the contraceptive options below:

               -  Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1%
                  rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label;

               -  Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets effectiveness criteria
                  including &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label;

               -  Percutaneous contraceptive patches.

             These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently,
             correctly, and in accordance with the product label. The Investigator is responsible
             for ensuring that patients understand how to properly use these methods of
             contraception.

             Non-child-bearing potential is defined as pre-menarchal or pre-menopausal females with
             a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries)
             or hysterectomy, or hysteroscopic sterilization. Documented verbal history from the
             patient is acceptable.

             Patients who are abstinent are eligible, but they must agree to use of one of the
             birth control methods listed above if they start engaging in sexual activity that
             could lead to pregnancy during the study.

             Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             Screening and Baseline (Day 0).

          4. History of atopic dermatitis and stable disease for at least 1 month according to the
             patient/caregiver.

          5. Patient, patient's parent(s), or legal representative must be capable of giving
             written informed consent or verbal assent, as applicable, which includes compliance
             with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent/assent form; written
             informed consent must be obtained prior to any study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:
