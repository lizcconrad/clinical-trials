    <description>postoperative CRT: Treatment including postoperative radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent chemotherapy of Raltitrexed. Radiotherapy will be delivered to a planning target volume with a dose of 45-50.4Gy (1.8-2.0Gy daily) using with Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy technique. During the radiation treatment, concurrent chemotherapy will be delivered (Raltitrexed, intravenous infusion, 3 mg/m2, on w1 and w4).</description>
