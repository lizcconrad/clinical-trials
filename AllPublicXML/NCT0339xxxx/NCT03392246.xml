  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of two targeted therapies as a possible
      treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR mutation.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Osimertinib (Tagrisso)

        -  Selumetinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drugs work in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.

      The EGFR gene produces a protein that helps cells divide. Specific changes or a mutation in
      the genetic information causes abnormal cell division and can lead to lung cancer. Patients
      who have NSCLC with an EGFR gene mutation can be treated by drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). They may stop (or &quot;inhibit&quot;) the effect of the mutation in the EGFR
      gene.

      Osimertinib alone has been shown to benefit some patients who have received prior treatment
      for their EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      the combination of Osimertinib and Selumetinib as a treatment for any disease, but it has
      been investigated in other clinical trials.

      The main purpose of the study is to look at information on any potential side effects that
      this drug combination may cause and collect data about how your cancer responds to the
      combination of drugs.

      Specific TKIs have been approved by the FDA for first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with
      an EGFR mutation.

                  for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and
                  with LH and FSH levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution.

               -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  EGFR targeted therapy (TKI or antibody) or any other targeted therapies targeting the
             ERBB family

          -  Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or anticancer drugs for the
             treatment of advanced NSCLC

          -  No uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease, including parenchymal brain
             metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or spinal cord compression. Patients with
             asymptomatic untreated brain metastases are eligible. Patients with treated CNS
             disease will be allowed to enroll provided they have clinically confirmed stable
             disease with ≥2 weeks since definitive CNS therapy (radiation or surgery) and ≥2 weeks
             without systemic steroids. Patients may undergo either whole brain radiation or
             stereotactic radiosurgery prior to study entry.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds, or any of its excipients, of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to osimertinib or selumetinib.

          -  Patients currently receiving and unable to stop using medications known to be potent
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. The full list of medications that would make a
             patient ineligible are provided in Appendix B, along with indicated washout times.

          -  Patients currently receiving and unable to stop high doses of supplemental vitamin E.
             Selumetinib capsules contain vitamin E and high doses of vitamin E have been reported
             to cause bleeding and interfere with blood coagulation processes.

          -  Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria
             for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment.

          -  Malignancies within the past 3 years excluding adequately treated basal or squamous
             cell carcinomas of the skin without local or distant metastases.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, previous
             significant bowel resection, or any process that compromises the ability to swallow or
             absorb oral medication

          -  Significant medical history or unstable medical comorbidities, including:

          -  heart disease including congestive heart failure (NYHA Grade II or greater); unstable
             angina; prior myocardial infarction (NSTEMI or STEMI) within 6 months prior to study
             enrollment; hypertension with a systolic blood pressure of &gt;150 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure of &gt;100 mm Hg while on antihypertensive medication

          -  any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting
             ECG, e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third-degree heart block, second-degree
             heart block, QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) of &gt;/= 450 ms in
             males or &gt;/= 470 ms in females

          -  any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events
             such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of
             long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree
             relatives, or any concomitant medication known to the prolong the QT interval and
             listed in Appendix B that a patient is unable to stop.

          -  past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of
             clinically active interstitial lung disease

          -  active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable
             for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with
             the protocol

          -  active infection or ongoing antiviral medication for viral infections including
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic
             conditions is not required. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             selumetinib or osimertinib.

          -  left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt; 45%

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding
             diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to
             participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol

          -  Known to be T790M+ (on pre-treatment tumor or plasma) or known germline T790M.

          -  Ophthalmological conditions as follows:

          -  Current or past history of retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED)/central serous
             retinopathy (CSR) or retinal vein occlusion

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP)

          -  Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using an effective method of
             birth control and females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or have a positive (urine
             or serum) pregnancy test prior to study entry.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of selumetinib and
             osimertinib on the development of the fetus are unknown, and there is potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             selumetinib or osimertinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with these agents.
