  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, open-label, dose-finding study of PRN1008 in patients with ITP who are
      refractory or relapsed with no available and approved therapeutic options, with a platelet
      count &lt;30,000/μL on two counts no sooner than 7 days apart in the 15 days before treatment
      begins.

      This is an adaptive, open-label, dose-finding study of PRN1008 in patients with ITP who are
      refractory or relapsed with no available and approved therapeutic options, with a platelet
      count &lt;30,000/μL on two counts no sooner than 7 days apart in the 15 days before treatment
      begins. The active treatment period is 12 weeks and the post-treatment follow-up period is 12
      weeks. Each patient enrolled in the study is allowed to up-titrate their dose after 28 days
      of PRN1008 therapy, if they do not experience a platelet response or a dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT) at the last dose level.
