  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) has been used for the modulation of stroke patients' motor function by
      altering the cortical excitability. Recently, more challenging approaches, such as
      stimulation of two or more sites or use of dual modality have been studied in stroke
      patients. In this study, simultaneous stimulation using both inhibitory rTMS (1Hz) and anodal
      tDCS (dual-mode stimulation) over bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) was investigated to
      compare its modulatory effects with single inhibitory rTMS stimulation in subacute stroke
      patients.

    <description>Dual-mode stimulation is applied over the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) using active rTMS and active tDCS. 1 Hz of rTMS is applied over the contralesional M1 for 20 minutes with simultaneous application of anodal tDCS on the ipsilesional M1.
Each participant's total FMA score is assessed and their resting-state fMRI data at two times: prior to stimulation (pre-stimulation) and 2 months after stimulation (post-stimulation) are acquired.</description>

    <description>Single sham stimulation is applied over the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) using active rTMS and sham tDCS. 1 Hz of rTMS over the contralesional M1 was applied for 20 minutes with simultaneous application of tDCS with sham mode (no stimulation) on the ipsilesional M1.
Each participant's total FMA score is assessed and their resting-state fMRI data at two times: prior to stimulation (pre-stimulation) and 2 months after stimulation (post-stimulation) are acquired.</description>
