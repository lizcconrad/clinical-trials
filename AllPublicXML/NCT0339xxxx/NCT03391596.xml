  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether an Internet-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
      intervention is effective, firstly, on reducing depressive symptoms, and, secondly, on
      improving well-being of elderly family caregivers. In our study, we will compare 1) the
      experimental Internet-based ACT group to 2) standardized institutional rehabilitation carried
      out in rehabilitation centers and to 3) support provided by voluntary family caregiver
      associations

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well-known that stress, low quality of life and depression are relatively common
      problems among family caregivers. The proportion of elderly family caregivers is rapidly
      increasing which emphasizes the need for new support systems. Internet-delivered
      psychological interventions are one possible approach, offering benefits as they are more
      easily to achieve for family caregivers who often are home-bound with their relatives.

      This study will examine whether an Internet-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      intervention would be effective, firstly, on reducing depressive symptoms, and, secondly, on
      improving well-being of elderly family caregivers.The family caregivers' depressive symptoms,
      perceived burden, anxiety, quality of life, psychological flexibility, personality and
      physical performance will be studied by a quasi-experimental study design comparing three
      groups of family caregivers (Group 1, experimental: Internet-based ACT intervention; Group 2,
      active comparator: Standardized institutional rehabilitation in a rehabilitation center;
      Group 3, other: Support given by voluntary family caregiver associations). Data collection
      will be performed at three time points: pre, 4 months and post (10 months).

      Secondly, we also aim to examine demographics and psychological variables that could predict
      change in depression and perceived burden over time (pre, 4 months and post (10 months). A
      further aim of the study is to examine potential mediators on the effect of the interventions
      including psychological flexibility and suppression of thoughts. Moreover, we aim to study
      user experiences and satisfaction of the Internet-based program, i.e., how the family
      caregivers experience and accept the web-based ACT intervention.

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale: change from baseline to 4 months and 10 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, post (10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) is a self-reported questionnaire for screening and severity measuring of the four most common anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). GAD-7 has seven items, which measure severity of various signs of GAD according to reported response categories with assigned points (Not at all: 0 points; Several days: 1 point; More than half the days: 2 points; and Nearly every day: 3 points). Assessment is indicated by the total score (min 0, max 21). Higher GAD-7 scores correlate with disability and functional impairment. 5-9 points indicate moderate anxiety, 10-14 moderate and &gt;15 severe anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Sense of Coherence (SOC-13): change from baseline to 4 months and 10 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, post (10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The SOC-13 is derived from the original 29-item scale measuring different aspects of sense coherence. Responses are made on a 7-point scale.The SOC-13 scale has three components: Comprehensibility (items 2, 6, 8, 9, 11; min 5, max 35), Manageability (items 3, 5, 10, 13; min 4, max 28) and Meaningfulness (items 1, 4, 7, 12; min 4, max 28) with higher scores indicating better outcomes. This scale is rated on a 7-point likert scale, a total score can also be used and the coding for items 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 should be reversed. The subscales are combined to compute a total score. SOC scores range from 13 to 91 with higher scores indicating a better outcome: more sense of coherence.</description>

Active Avoidant Behaviors, 2) Intolerance of Negative Thoughts and Emotions Towards the Relative and 3) Apprehension Concerning Negative Internal Experiences Related to Caregiving. The questionnaire consists of 15 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Each statement can be answered by 1: not at all, 2: a little, 3: somewhat, 4: often and 5: a lot. Factor 1 is made up of 6 items that measure caregivers' behaviors for avoiding negative thoughts related to caregiving (min 5, max 25). Factor 2 include 4 items with content related to rigid verbal thinking about negative emotions/thoughts with regard to the care-recipient (min 4, max 20), the factor 3 composes of 5 items referring to reluctant attitudes towards negative thoughts regarding the relative (min 5, max 25). The subscales are summed to compute a total score. Higher values represent more avoidance, e.g. worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI): change from baseline to 4 months and 10 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, post (10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The WBSI is a 15-item questionnaire that is designed to measure thought suppression. Chronic thoughts suppression is related to obsessive thinking and negative affect associated with depression and anxiety. The scoring of the WBSI is based on a 5 point scale from Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5). The total score (range from 15 to 75) is obtained by summing up the responses that are provided by respondents. Higher scores on the WBSI indicate greater tendencies to suppress thoughts.</description>

    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests (Guralnik et al., 2000). It has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance). The SPPB has been shown to have predictive validity showing a gradient of risk for mortality, nursing home admission, and disability.</description>
