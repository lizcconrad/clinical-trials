  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine whether patients at high risk to develop breast cancer having received
      at least 6 cumulative dosages of macrocyclic Gd-based contrast media in the context of breast
      cancer screening by means of contrast-enhanced MRI.

      Methods: Diagnostic study encompassing two arms: first, 50 patients having received ≥6
      dosages of macrocyclic Gd-based contrast media in the course of MRI-based breast cancer
      screening will undergo brain MRI assessment for signal alterations due to Gd-deposits. The
      second arm consists of 50 healthy volunteers that never received Gd-based contrast agents,
      and undergoes the same brain MRI assessment as the patient-based arm 1 of the study. Signal
      intensities will be compared to assess the potential presence or absence of macrocyclic
      Gd-based contrast agent deposits in the brain.

      In case of presence of signal alterations in arm 1 these will be further stratified by number
      of previously administered macrocyclic Gd-contrast agent doses.

      Projected outcome: High cumulative dosages of macrocyclic Gd-based contrast agent either
      result or do not result in brain MRI signal alterations in healthy women participating in a
      high-risk screening program for the early detection of breast cancer that necessitates
      Gd-contrast agent enhanced breast MRI at regular intervals.
