    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of a nutraceutical as a non-antibiotic
      treatment to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections in women that have completed
      menopause and are on vaginal estrogen therapy. An additional group of women with recurrent
      urinary tract infections that have completed menopause but are not using vaginal estrogen
      therapy will be followed while taking the nutraceutical. The study length is ninety days from
      the date that the study participant will be instructed is day 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a nutraceutical as a
      non-antibiotic prophylaxis for postmenopausal women on vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) with a
      history of symptomatic, culture-proven recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) by means of a
      randomized, controlled trial. Recurrent urinary tract infections have a significant impact on
      patient health, quality of life, and finances (personal and societal).

      The most common uropathogen for both acute and recurrent UTIs is Escherichia coli.

      Historically, patients with rUTI have been placed on long-term prophylactic antibiotics to
      prevent recurrence. Long term antibiotic use can lead to antibiotic resistance, collateral
      damage to normal flora, and organ damage, such as pulmonary and hepatic toxicity with
      long-term nitrofurantoin use. There is an increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance of
      uropathogenic E. coli and other uropathogens. Antibiotic resistance and its consequences have
      resulted in a need for non-antibiotic prophylaxis regimens.

      A growing body of literature supports the use of vaginal estrogen therapy as a first-line
      non-antibiotic UTI prevention strategy in postmenopausal women. While VET has been shown to
      significantly reduce the risk of rUTIs, some women continue to have rUTIs. Other
      non-antibiotic strategies have been utilized including D-mannose, a nutraceutical. Three
      prior studies examined D-mannose as an isolated therapy with promising results, but in our
      experience, a multimodal approach has often been needed. Therefore, additional studies, such
      as this proposed research, are needed to determine the potential additive effect of a
      nutraceutical as a non-antibiotic prophylaxis for postmenopausal women using vaginal estrogen
      therapy.

    <gender_description>This study will involve only adult, postmenopausal women as recurrent UTI predominantly affect this population. Recurrent UTI in men would be considered complicated and would not be addressed with a prophylactic treatment like d-mannose.In addition, men do not go through menopause and do not have a vagina and would thus not be treated with vaginal estrogen therapy.</gender_description>
