  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, multi-center study in which patients will receive KZR-616, administered
      as a subcutaneous injection weekly for 13 weeks.

      The study consists of 2 parts. Part 1, the Phase 1b, is an open-label multiple dose
      escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KZR-616 in patients with systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) with and without nephritis. Part 2, the Phase 2, is a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KZR-616 in
      patients with active proliferative lupus nephritis (LN).
