  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the abuse potential of CBD to determine whether it
      should remain as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, or be recommended for
      decontrol.

      This is a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled crossover
      study that evaluates CBD in comparison with THC, alprazolam, and placebo in healthy

    <description>Subjects will complete 13 scales. Each Visual Analog Scale is a self-administered assessment evaluating the subjective effects of a study agent. Subjects will be instructed to respond to the questions with regards to how they feel at that moment of the assessment on a 100 mm Likert Scale with 0 being &quot;Not at all&quot; and 100 being &quot;Very&quot; or &quot;Extremely&quot;. All scales are unipolar or bipolar.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must understand and provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of any
             protocol-specific procedures.

          -  Male or female subjects 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range of 19.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive, and a minimum
             weight of at least 50.0 kg.

          -  Healthy, as determined by no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination,

          -  12-lead ECG, vital signs or laboratory (including hematology, clinical chemistry
             biochemistry, urinalysis, and serology) findings at Screening, as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Must be a recreational drug user, defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

               -  ≥10 lifetime non-therapeutic experiences (i.e., for psychoactive effects) with
                  CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates, zolpidem, eszopiclone,
                  propofol/fospropofol, gamma-hydroxy-butyrate).

               -  ≥10 lifetime non-therapeutic experiences with cannabinoids (e.g., cannabis,
                  hashish, THC, nabilone).

               -  At least 3 non-therapeutic uses of a sedative, and at least 3 non-therapeutic
                  uses of a cannabinoid, within the 3 months prior to Screening.

          -  Must pass Qualification Phase eligibility criteria.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are not abstinent must be using and
             willing to continue using medically acceptable contraception throughout the trial and
             for 30 days after last dose. In the context of this trial, highly effective methods of
             contraception are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Such
             methods include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices/hormone-releasing
             systems, double-barrier methods, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, or
             sexual abstinence. Abstinence is only acceptable as true (total) abstinence, when this
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Non-vasectomized male subjects must agree to a highly effective method of
             contraception with female partner(s) of childbearing potential and may not donate
             sperm throughout the trial and for 90 days after the last study drug administration.

          -  Able to speak, read, and understand English sufficiently to allow completion of all
             study assessments.

          -  Must be willing and able to abide by all study requirements and restrictions.
