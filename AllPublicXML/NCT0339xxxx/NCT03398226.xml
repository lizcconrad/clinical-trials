      Osteoporosis after gastrectomy, which is characterized by both the loss of bone mass and the
      deterioration of bone architecture, is a serious complication in the long course after
      gastrectomy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate osteoporosis by using
      high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in the long course
      after gastrectomy. In total gastrectomy and distal gastrectomy groups, at least 5 years
      should have elapsed since gastrectomy.

      The patients after gastrectomy loss appetite and decrease the weight. Total gastrectomy
      especially cause severe sarcopenia and metabolic change. Osteoporosis after gastrectomy,
      which is characterized by both the loss of bone mass and the deterioration of bone
      architecture, is a serious complication in the long course after gastrectomy. The primary
      tools for assessing volumetric density and bone structure are quantitative computed
      tomography (QCT) and more recently, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
      tomography (HR-pQCT). However the validation of osteoporosis with HR-pQCT before and after
      gastrectomy remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to evaluate osteoporosis by
      using HR-pQCT before and after after endoscopic resection, distal gastrectomy, and total
      gastrectomy in the patients with gastric cancer.
