      Single-arm phase 2 study to examine pembrolizumab and concurrent radiation to induce an
      abscopal effect in patients with previously treated carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP16-268)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-principle single-arm phase 2 study in patients with previously treated
      CUP. All patients receive pembrolizumab combined with RT to a metastatic site, so as to
      induce an abscopal tumor response. The treatment combination will be repeated with RT
      delivery to a second metastatic site in a non-overlapping RT field.

      The results will be compared with historical control. The primary endpoint is the confirmed
      response rate (RR) in a non-irradiated site based on best responding abscopal lesion. This
      study will also evaluate the following secondary endpoints: RR in a non-irradiated site based
      on RECIST 1.1, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
      time-to-progression (TTP), and disease control rate (DCR).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information prior to registration. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the
             informed consent or obtained separately.

          -  Archival tissue must be available and identified during screening and shipped prior to
             Day -21. If archival tissue is not available and the subject is not undergoing a
             standard of care biopsy, the subject must undergo a research biopsy to obtain fresh
             tissue prior to start of treatment.

          -  Carcinoma of unknown primary after the following diagnostic procedures have been
             performed if clinically indicated and are unrevealing of the primary site:

               -  Complete history and clinically appropriate physical

               -  CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis

               -  Directed evaluation of symptomatic areas

             cell carcinoma, or poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma. NOTE: Pathology
             consultation at Mayo Clinic is recommended if clinically indicated. One scenario is
             where unknown primary is the most likely diagnosis but immunostains show relatively
             site-specific marker staining (e.g., CD45, TTF1, chromogranin, GATA3, PAX8, PSA,
             melanocytic markers). Information provided for pathology consultation should include
             recent H&amp;P and imaging reports.

             FDG avidity via PET or repeat biopsy).

          -  Radiation oncology consultation at enrolling site ≤ 56 days prior to registration to
             confirm at least two metastatic lesions which are targetable by RT at doses and

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72
             hours prior to registration. NOTE: If the urine test is positive or cannot be
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. NOTE: breast milk
             cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study

          -  Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to abstain from
             heterosexual activity (abstinence) or use effective methods of contraception as
             described in Section 5.5 from the time of informed consent until 120 days after
             treatment discontinuation. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential
             unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least
             12 consecutive months

             criteria.

          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens.

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a

               -  Significant underlying liver disease such as cirrhosis or severe hepatic
                  impairment

               -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
                  cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

          -  For patients in whom planned RT fields will include the heart, any of the following
             heart conditions, if in the opinion of the investigator they pose unacceptably high
             risk when combined with study treatment:

               -  Prior symptomatic congestive heart failure

               -  Documented myocardial infarction ≤6 months prior to registration (pretreatment
                  ECG evidence of infarct only will not exclude patients)

        NOTE: As part of history and physical, all patients must be assessed for signs or symptoms
        of cardiac disease, or for prior history of cardiac disease. These conditions include but
        are not limited to diseases related to cardiac valves, pericardium, myocardium,
        atrioventricular delays or arrhythmias. It is strongly recommended that signs or symptoms
        of potentially clinically significant disease be evaluated with comprehensive cardiac echo.
