  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of pilot studies had shown high rate of complete resection after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy alone for local advanced rectal cancer(LARC), but they did not increase the
      ratio of pathological complete response (pCR) which was associated with improvement of
      overall survival (OS). On the other hand,some clinical trials show that triple active
      cytotoxic agents (Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, FOLFOXIRI) combined with cetuximab
      for EGFR wild type metastatic colorectal cancer had more effective than double
      agents.Therefore,a hypothesis is the FOLFOXIRI+Cetuximab as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      regimen might improve the patient's ratio of pCR.

      This is a multicenter, phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of triplet regimen
      (FOLFOXIRI) combined with cetuximab for patients with EGFR wild type LARC. After 4 cycles of
      FOLFOXIRI+cetuximab and 2 weeks later, the patients will be evaluated by senior radiologist,
      oncologist and surgeon through pelvic MRI, CT and Positron Emission Computed Tomography
      (PET-CT). The patients will go to surgery (TME) if the tumor response is good enough to have
      complete resection under the decision of the multidisciplinary team (MDT),otherwise, the
      patients will receive pelvic radiotherapy(45Grey/25Fraction and 5.4Grey/3Fraction boost to
      the tumor bed) combined with capecitabine(625 mg/m²,bid po,d1-5,qw), and additional four
      cycles of modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) or Oxaliplatin 135mg/m²plus Capecitabine 1.0/m², bid
      po(XELOX) of each 3 weeks cycle for 2 cycles chemotherapy before TME. All patients will
      receive 6-8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 or 4-5 cycles XELOX as adjuvant chemotherapy after TME.

      FOLFOXIRI+Cetuximab Irinotecan 165 mg/m² + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² + leucovorin 200 mg/m² + 5-FU
      2800 mg/m² cont. inf. 46h + Cetuximab 500 mg/m²,all on day 1 of each 2 weeks cycle for 4-6
      cycles,
