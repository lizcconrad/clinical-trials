      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given
      together with ixazomib citrate and dexamethasone and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with multiple myeloma that has come back. Venetoclax and ixazomib citrate may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving venetoclax together with ixazomib citrate and dexamethasone may work better
      in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax in combination with ixazomib
      citrate (ixazomib) and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). (Phase
      1) II. To evaluate therapeutic activity of venetoclax in combination with ixazomib and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe toxicities associated with venetoclax, in combination with ixazomib and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM. (Phase 1) II. To describe toxicities associated
      with venetoclax, in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM.
      (Phase 2) III. To evaluate progression free survival following treatment with venetoclax,
      ixazomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM. (Phase 2) IV. To evaluate
      therapeutic activity of venetoclax in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone in subset
      of patients with relapsed MM and t(11;14) translocation. (Phase 2)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore levels of BCL-2 family member proteins (BCL-2, BCL-x, MCL-1) on bone marrow
      biopsies using ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNASeq) and immunohistochemistry.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-28, ixazomib citrate PO once weekly
      on days 1, 8, and 15, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for courses 1-12. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for 3
      years.
