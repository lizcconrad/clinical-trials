    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the optimizing parameters of long pulse Nd:YAG Laser for reducing the
      size of hair shaft diameter of the donor for hair transplantation. All participants will
      receive long-pulsed Nd-YAG laser treatments with three different parameters at the occipital
      area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of hair transplantation era, hair transplant technique has been greatly
      improved to achieve the best natural looking of hairline and hair density. Most Asians tend
      to have large size of hair shaft at the donor area, which often cause unnatural look of the
      hairline at the frontal area after hair transplantation due to the contrast between the
      transplanted hair and the original hair.

      The idea of reducing the size of the hair shaft in the certain part of donor area before
      being transplanted to the frontal hairline becomes appealing. This transection is being
      practiced extensively in the field of cosmetic medicine by using long-pulsed
      Neodymium-Doped:Yttrium Aluminum Gamet (Nd:YAG), a laser treatment for permanent hair removal
      and vascular lesions.
