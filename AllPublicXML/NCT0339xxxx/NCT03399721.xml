  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which
      patients diagnosed with non-allergic rhinitis will be randomized to either intranasal
      stimulation, or placebo treatment with the Chordate System at two occasions.

    <description>Active treatment: The controller creates air-mediated kinetic oscillations with regulated pressure and frequency during a preset treatment time Placebo treatment: Placebo treatment is similar to active treatment, but with no oscillations. It is difficult to discern any difference between active and placebo treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with persistent (&gt;12w) symptoms of non-allergic rhinitis dominated by nasal
             congestion (Â± secretion) for an average of at least 1 h per day for at least 5 days
             during a period of 14 days.

          2. Having nasal congestion as major symptom, and a median nasal congestion score of at
             least 2 (scale 0-3)

          3. Male or female 18 - 65 years

          4. Judged by the Investigator as suitable for participation in the study without safety
             concerns based on medical history and physical examination.

          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the
             clinical investigation

          6. Willing and able to comply with all study related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Allergic rhinitis, demonstrated by either positive skin prick test,
             Phadiatop or RAST during the last year.

          2. Ongoing respiratory tract infection including nasal cavity at inclusion

          3. Systemic steroid treatment less than 4 weeks before the inclusion in the study

          4. Patients with a history of nasal surgery like: septoplasty, cosmetic surgery, conchal
             surgery or any other nasal surgery except closed reposition for nasal fracture during
             last year

          5. History of frequent nose bleeds or a condition that increases the risk of excessive
             bleeding

          6. Pronounced anterior septal deviation or other significant nasal pathology at
             endoscopic examination

          7. Current malignancy of any kind

          8. Known allergy to polyvinylchloride or medicinal liquid paraffin

          9. Any disease, condition (medical or surgical) or drug or alcohol abuse which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, might compromise the study results, or would place the
             patient at increased risk.

         10. Any implant with an electrical and/or neurostimulator device, including but not
             limited to cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, vagal neurostimulator, deep brain
             stimulation, spinal stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or cochlear implant or any
             other implant in the head-, and neck region.

         11. Previous treated with radiation on the face, head or neck regions

         12. Female patients who are pregnant or become pregnant at any time from inclusion of the
             study until end of the 8 week follow-up visit

         13. Received study drug in a clinical trial for an investigational drug within the
             previous 30 days, or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer
