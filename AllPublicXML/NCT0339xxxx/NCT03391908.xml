    <textblock>
      The aim of Multiplaque clinical study is to assess the vulnerability degree of the
      atheromatous plaques, before and after a myocardial infarction (MI), based on multiomics
      analysis, associated with invasive and non-invasive data. In this study, a multi-parametric
      model for risk prediction will be developed, for evaluation of the risk that is associated
      with the vulnerable coronary plaques in patients that have suffered an acute coronary
      syndrome.

      In the study, evaluation of the imaging characteristics of these coronary plaques will be
      performed with the use of CT, OCT, IVUS and invasive angiography. We will study the
      correlation between plaque evolution and (1) the degree of vulnerability at baseline, (2)
      multiomics profile of the patients and (3) clinical evolution during follow-up.

      Also, new techniques for evaluation of the functional significance of coronary stenoses will
      be studied and validated, such as calculation of the fractional flow reserve or determination
      of shear stress in areas that are localized within the near vicinity of the vulnerable
      coronary plaques.

      This is a prospective cohort monocentric study.

      The primary objective of this study is to research the vulnerability degree of ateromatous
      plaques before and after a myocardial infarction, based on multiomics data, invasive and
      non-invasive imaging data, in order to characterize the vulnerable coronary plaque and the
      vulnerable patient, in patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina
      or acute myocardial infarction).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  Evaluation of factors associated with the risk for reinfarction in patients with
           vulnerable plaques, according to their imaging characteristics of vulnerability.

        -  Evaluation of predictive factors for reinfarction in patients with vulnerable plaques,
           according to the multiomics profile of the patient.

        -  Determination of the rate of adverse events and MACE rates (Major Adverse Cardiac
           Events) according to the vulnerability degree of the coronary plaque at the index
           moment.

        -  Evaluation of the efficiency of new methodologies for assessing vulnerable plaques:
           coronary shear stress determination, trans-stenotic contrast gradient, quantification of
           coronary plaque components through CT, OCT and IVUS.

        -  Evaluation of the efficiency of non-invasive methodologies for assessment of the
           hemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses.
