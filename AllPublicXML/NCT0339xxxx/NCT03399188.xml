      Fecal microbiome of donor and recipient will be analyzed before and after fecal microbiota
      transplantation in IBD patients.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation will be performed to the IBD patients, and microbial
      analysis will be done for donor and recipient feces. Fecal microbiota transplantation will be
      done twice via colonoscopy, with one month of duration. During the early stage of Fecal
      microbiota transplantation, recipient feces will be analyzed for the intestinal microbiota
      frequently.

      Clinical outcome will be assessed 1month, 2month, 6month, and 1 year after the
      transplantation.

      Relevance of intestinal microbial change and clinical outcome after transplantation and
      factors associated with successful clinical outcome will be investigated.
