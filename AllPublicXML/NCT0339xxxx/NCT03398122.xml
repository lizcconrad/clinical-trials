      HCC The is a common malignancy in the world, especially in China. Advanced HCC treatment is
      difficult and the prognosis is poor, which is still a great challenge and threat to the
      medical profession. The advent of the molecular targeted drug, Sola, has made the treatment
      dilemma of advanced HCC a breakthrough, but the efficacy and economic health ratio is far
      from satisfactory. After Sola, many new molecular targeted drugs were studied, but failed.

      Although multiple treatment options, but for HCC Patient-recommended treatment programs
      require systematic treatment and surgery, TACE , local ablation and radiotherapy and other
      multidisciplinary means of combination, the selection of appropriate patients, appropriate
      means and timing to achieve individualized treatment.

      1. Aptinib Union TACE can be generated through embolization and angiogenesis by the dual
      target of vascular suppression;2. TACE induces hypoxia, leading to an increase in the number
      of hypoxia-inducing factors that increases VEGF and PDGFR , while VEGF the and PDGFR may be
      important factors that induce tumor recurrence by stimulating tumor angiogenesis.
