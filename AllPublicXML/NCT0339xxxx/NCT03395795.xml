  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new NAVA® ventilatory mode with the SERVO-i ventilator (Maquet®) uses the electrical
      activity of the diaphragm (EADi) as a marker for triggering the respiratory cycle. The EADi
      is captured by the electrodes of a specific catheter (the Edi® catheter) placed in the
      esophagus as a regular gastric feeding tube, and relayed to the SERVO-i who displays it and
      delivers respiratory assistance according to measured Edi signal which allows synchronous
      assistance, proportional to the respiratory efforts of the patient.

      To date, no measure of the effectiveness of NAVA NAV has been performed in children with
      neuromuscular pathology whereas this technique could reduce the use of invasive ventilation,
      very iatrogenic in these fragile subjects.

      This is a prospective, interventional, sequential, open-label research involving ASI II
      children with acute respiratory decompensation requiring ventilatory support by NIV. Airway
      pressure, transcutaneous CO2 monitoring and hemodynamic parameters will be recorded
      continuously during the study, after inclusion of the patient.

    <description>The study has 3 phases:
Phase 1:
The patient is connected to the SERVOi® ventilator in classic VNI mode, which is parameterized according to the patient's needs and then maintained for 30min for measurements.
Phase 2:
Switch to NAVA mode (1h).
Definition of NAVA parameters: The positive expiratory pressure will not be modified. The NAVA level (the proportionality factor that converts the EADi (microV) to the pressure level in cmH2O was first adjusted according to the actual assisted pressure in the patient in the normal VNI mode.
NAVA period: The ventilatory pressure, as well as the EADI is recorded continuously for 30min after a NAVA adaptation period of about 30min.
Phase 3:
The patient returns to classic VNI mode with Phase 1 ventilatory settings for a 30 minute recording.</description>
