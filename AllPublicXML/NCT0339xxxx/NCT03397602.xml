  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval
      training (HIIT) compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training (MICE) and
      standard care on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with persistent or
      permanent atrial fibrillation. Positive findings are vitally important for these patients,
      given the condition's substantial morbidity, mortality and high economic costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recommended standards of care do not include the prescription of exercise to target and
      ameliorate the progressive health decline and overall feeling of well-being in patients with
      atrial fibrillation. Recent Standards for the Provision of Cardiac Rehabilitation of Ontario
      are calling for the consideration for referral and enrollment of patients with atrial
      fibrillation in cardiovascular rehabilitation - evidence is needed to support and confirm
      these efforts. The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the effects of high-intensity
      interval training (HIIT) compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training (MICE)
      and standard care on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with persistent or
      permanent atrial fibrillation. Positive results from this study will identify a new
      intervention that: produces important improvements in patient-rated clinical, behavioural and
      exercise outcomes; provides mechanistic insight into the role of exercise training in the
      management of atrial fibrillation; requires minimal equipment; and, is appealing to patients
      with atrial fibrillation.

    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes atrial fibrillation specific quality of life measured by the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFEQT). The AFEQT assesses 4 domains: symptoms, activities, treatment concern, treatment satisfaction, and a summary score that includes the first 3 domains. Patients will assess the impact of AF on their health status during the previous 4 weeks. Responses are presented as a 7-point Likert scale. Raw scores within each domain are transformed to a 0 (most severe symptoms) to 100 scale (no limitations or disability). The AFEQT is valid, reliable and sensitive to clinical change in patients with AF undergoing different therapeutic interventions.</description>

    <description>Changes atrial fibrillation specific quality of life measured by the University of Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS) from baseline to 12 weeks. The AFSS is a disease-specific quality of life measure used to capture subjective and objective ratings of disease burden in patients with atrial fibrillation. It assesses atrial fibrillation burden (score 1-30; higher scores indicate higher burden); Global Well Being (a visual analogue scale ranging from 1-10, indicating a patient reports as having a worst possible life [0] to the best possible life[10]); AF symptom score (score of 0-35; higher scores indicate more bothered by AF symptoms); and health care utilization (score of 0-21; higher scores indicate greater health care utilization).</description>

    <description>Changes in symptom burden measured by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity of Atrial Fibrillation Scale from baseline to 12 weeks.The CCS-SAF is a simple, concise, symptom-based severity scale to assess patient status. CCS-SAF scores range from 0 to 4, with highest values denoting severe impact of symptoms on quality of life and activities of daily living. The CCS-SAF has been validated in patients with atrial fibrillation.</description>

    <description>Changes in quality of life measured by the mental component summary (MCS) measure of the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) from baseline to 12 weeks. The SF-36 is a widely used and thoroughly validated, standardized, generic health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale (physical functioning; role-physical; bodily pain; general health; vitality; social functioning; role-emotional; and, mental health) profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores.</description>
