  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability globally with increasing concern about
      its impact in low-income countries especially where health care services are less extensive.
      This is true especially to developing nations like Africa where prevalence of LBP seems to be
      on the increase and more specifically, Nigeria is no exception. According to previous studies
      in Nigeria, the burden of LBP among rural Nigerians is greater compared to urbanites but
      unfortunately lack access to physiotherapy services. While both biomechanical and
      psychosocial factors are known to be important issues, current approach to LBP mainly focus
      on purely biomedical model in this context.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the combined effects of supervised graded motor
      control exercise (MCE) and patient education (PE) program in the management of chronic
      nonspecific LBP (CNLBP) among rural community-dwelling individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that combination of MCE and PE will be more effective than
      using either MCE or PE alone among rural community-dwelling individuals with CNLBP following
      8-weeks of therapeutic session, at 3-month follow-up.

      Participants will be recruited and assigned to one of four intervention groups that include
      combined MCE and PE group, MCE group, PE group and a control group using simple random
      technique based on an electronic randomization table generated by a computer software
      program. Blinded assessment of all clinical outcomes will be performed at baseline, 8 weeks
      after randomization and at 3 months follow up.

      Primary outcomes will be pain intensity and functional disability. Secondary outcomes will be
      quality of life, fear avoidance beliefs, pain catastrophizing, global impression of recovery
      and physical performance (finger-floor test, repeated sit-to-stand test, and the 50-foot walk
      test) Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and MANOVA. All
      statistical analyses will be performed on SPSS (version 24.00) at alpha level of 0.05.

    <measure>Change in pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity will be measured by an 11-point (0-10) Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability will be measured by Oswestry disability index (ODI). The questionnaire consists of 10 items with each item having six statements. All scores are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100) with higher score indicating greater disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the SF-12 health survey. The questionnaire consists of 12 items questioned weighted and summed to provide physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS). The two composite scores are computed using the scores on twelve questions that range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fear avoidance beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Fear avoidance beliefs will be measured by the fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). The questionnaire consists of 16 self-response items, rated on a seven-point ordinal scale from 0 to 6. It also contains two subscales, a 7-item subscale concerning work, and a 4-item subscale concerning physical activity. Each subscale scores are summed giving possible ranges for the physical activity subscale of 0-24 and for the work subscale between 0-42. Higher score indicate greater fear and avoidance beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain catastrophization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophization will be measured by the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS). The scale consists of 13 items rated on 5-point ordinal scale (0-5).The total score ranges from 0-52 with higher score indicating more catastrophic thoughts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in global impression of recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Global impression of recovery will be measured by an 11-point Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPES). it range from -5 (vastly worse) to 0 (unchanged) to +5 (completely recovered). Higher scores indicate better recovery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility of the spine and pelvis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3 months follow up</time_frame>

    <description>Participants will receive patient education session once a week at interval of 1-week over 8-weeks (4 sessions). The program will be aiming to provide non-threatening information to enable patients to better understand their pain, change any unhelpful beliefs about LBP, decrease fear avoidance behavior and catastrophic thought, promote positive attitude, self-management, and active coping strategies.
