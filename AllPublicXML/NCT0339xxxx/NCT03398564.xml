  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a widely employed procedure in ambulatory surgery. Pain after
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy arises significantly from port site incisions in the anterior
      abdominal wall. Innervation of the anterior abdominal wall is segmentally supplied by pain
      afferents in the plane of fascia between transversus abdominis and the internal oblique
      muscles. Opioids analgesia is used to control postoperative pain, but it carries the risk of
      increased nausea and vomiting, ileus and sedation that may delay hospital discharge.

      Several techniques have been tried as.neuroaxial narcotics, intraperitoneal lavage of local
      anesthetic and transversus abdominis plan (TAP) block and successfully reduced opioid use and
      improve postoperative analgesia.

      The ultrasound-guided erector spinae plan(ESP) block is a recently described technique which
      produces reliable unilateral analgesia at thoraco-lumbar dermatomes. ESP block carries the
      advantages of being simple, safe, easily recognizable by ultrasound, and a catheter can be
      threaded to extend the duration of analgesia.

      Few case series reported the efficacy of (US)-guided ESP blocks in reducing postoperative
      pain and opioids consumption.

      Because of that, the investigators aimed to test the hypothesis that US-guided ESP blocks can
      decrease opioid consumption during the first 24 h after of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in
      comparison with the conventional systemic analgesia.

    <description>The trocar site incision was done 15 minutes after the block in the two groups. The skin was disinfected with chlorhexidine solution, and the high-frequency transducer was isolated with a sterile disposable plastic cover and gel. The patient was placed in lateral position. A high-frequency linear ultrasound probe was placed longitudinally lateral to the T8 spinous process by 3 cm. After identification of the 3 muscles superficial to the hyperechoic transverse process shadow as follows: trapezius, rhomboid major, and erector spinae. The needle was introduced in a cephalo-caudal orientation. The needle tip was positioned fascial plane between rhomboid major and erector spinae muscles. Hydrodissection by 1-2 ml of normal saline to visualize the plan, then deposition of local anesthetic was done. A total of 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected here. The same procedure was repeated on the other side.</description>
