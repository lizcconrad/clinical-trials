  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoregulation is defined as the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance
      to changes in perfusion pressure. In the eye, several studies have reported that retinal
      blood flow is autoregulated over a wide range of ocular perfusion pressures. Large scale
      studies have shown that reduced ocular perfusion pressure is an important risk factor for the
      prevalence, the incidence and the progression of primary open angle glaucoma. There is also
      evidence that autoregulation is impaired in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.

      To gain more insight into these phenomena in humans is the primary goal of the present study.

      The present study aims to investigate the pressure/flow relationship as a measure for retinal
      blood flow autoregulation during an experimental increase in intraocular pressure by the use
      of the suction cup technique. Retinal blood flow will be measured by Doppler OCT.
