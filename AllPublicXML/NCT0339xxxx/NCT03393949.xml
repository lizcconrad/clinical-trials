  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer, of which incidence has been on the top of the list of male tumors, is a familiar
      carcinoma in respiratory system.Resection surgery has been the best approach for patients in
      early period. However, long duration and huge operative trauma lead to the decrease of
      immunological function of cancer patients, in addition, stress reaction in perioperative
      period, application of different anaesthetics during general anesthesia and postoperative
      pain can also affect the immunological function in varying degrees, increase the incidence of
      postoperative adversities.This study aims at discussing the effects on immunological
      function, cognitive function and postoperative adversities of elderly lung cancer patients
      after resection surgery caused by different doses of methylprednisolone in the single use.

      80 cases of patients undergoing general anesthesia during radical resection of lung cancer by
      thoracoscope, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status II~III, male or
      female, age between 65 and 85 years old,randomly divided into 2 groups (M and C) ,each group
      with 40 cases. In group M, each one was given methylprednisolone at 1mg•kg-1 before surgery,
      dexmedetomidine i.v at 1ug/kg was conducted 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, and
      pumped in at 0.5ug•kg-1h-1 constantly during the surgery, withdrew the drug 30 minutes before
      the surgery was done. In group C, methylprednisolone was administrated at 0.5 mg•kg-1 before
      surgery, dexmedetomidine i.v at 1ug/kg was conducted 10 minutes before anesthesia induction,
      and pumped in at 0.5ug•kg-1h-1 constantly during the surgery, withdrew the drug 30 minutes
      before the surgery was done. Assessed postoperative cognitive function of patients by
      Mini-mental State Examination Score marking scales on the day before surgery, the first day
      and third day after surgery, decided whether postoperative cognitive dysfunction was
      happened, postoperative adversities such as vomit, nausea and other special circumstances
      were recorded. Drew venous blood before the induction (T0), right after surgery (T1), 24h
      after surgery (T2), tested the levels of T cell subsets such as CD3+、CD4+、CD8+ with flow
      cytometry, calculated the ratio of CD4+/CD8+. Tested concentration of NSE、s100βin serum.
