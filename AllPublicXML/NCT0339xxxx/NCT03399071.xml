    <textblock>
      A single centre phase II trial of peri-operative chemo-immunotherapy in operable
      gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma (GOA). This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of administering Avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, with cytotoxic FLOT
      chemotherapy for patients with operable GOA treated according to a peri-operative protocol.

      This trial is in 2 stages: the first stage will establish the safe and tolerated maximum
      administered dose (MAD) of Avelumab in combination with FLOT and the second stage will assess
      the efficacy of this combination therapy in achieving pathological complete response (pCR)
      and peri-operative safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive chemo-immunotherapy consisting of FLOT chemotherapy (Folinic acid
      200mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Docetaxel 50mg/m2 iv day
      1, Fluorouracil 2600mg/m2 over 24 hours iv) and the PD-L1 inhibiting monoclonal antibody
      Avelumab. The safe dose of Avelumab in combination with FLOT will be established in a safety
      run-in phase with a standard 3+3 design, starting with the recommended dose of 10mg/kg iv
      Avelumab (dose level 0) in which a dose reduction to 7mg/kg iv (dose level -1) may occur.
      Four cycles of two-weekly chemo-immunotherapy will be administered before surgery and four
      further cycles post-operatively in patients who are fit enough to receive further
      chemo-immunotherapy after surgery. Resectional surgery will take place 4-8 weeks following
      the last dose of chemo-immunotherapy in patients who remain fit.

      Study Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety, efficacy and toxicities and to explore biomarkers of peri-operative
      chemo-immunotherapy with Avelumab and FLOT.

    <description>The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of FLOT-A in the peri-operative setting in patients with operable GOAs. We aim to increase the pCR rate after peri-operative treatment from 10% (minimum expected path CR rate for peri-operative FLOT chemotherapy), to a superior pCR rate of &gt;25%, by adding Avelumab to FLOT.
Complete histopathologic response is defined by no vital tumour cells neither in the oesophagus, the stomach nor in the regional lymph nodes. In cases of residual tumour, the response assessment will follow criteria described by Mandard et al.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male/female patients aged ≥18 years

          2. Histologically confirmed gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction or oesophageal
             adenocarcinoma (referred to as gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma (GOA) in this
             protocol).

          3. Oesophageal and gastric tumours should be TNM7 stage T1-3 and N0-N2, with no evidence
             of distant metastases (M0) where the MDT believes that an R0 resection can be achieved
             at the outset. T4 tumours will be excluded due to the variable need to prolong
             pre-operative chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy as part of locally advanced protocol
             to reduce margin involvement and improve resectability.

          4. Absence of distant metastases on CT scan and PET scan and staging laparoscopy (where
             indicated) prior to study entry

          5. No prior therapy for GOA

               -  Serum bilirubin &lt;22 umol/L

               -  ALT/AST ≤2.5x ULN

         15. Willingness and ability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including scheduled visits, examinations, investigations and treatment plans
