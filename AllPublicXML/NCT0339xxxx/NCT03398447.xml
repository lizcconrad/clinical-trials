  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to show Endocuff Vision could improve insertion because during loop
      withdrawal the cuff tends to stabilize the position of the tip, preventing its backward
      movement and speeding loop removal. Similarly, during inspection the main goal is to evaluate
      the proximal sides of folds and flexures. The process is made easier and quicker by the
      device. Third, during polypectomy, Endocuff Vision helps to stabilize the position and the
      scope tip.

      This will be a prospective, randomized controlled study. Subjects referred for screening or
      surveillance colonoscopy will be prospectively enrolled. They will be randomized to one of
      two arms, i.e High Definition colonoscopy or High Definition colonoscopy with Endocuff
      Vision.
