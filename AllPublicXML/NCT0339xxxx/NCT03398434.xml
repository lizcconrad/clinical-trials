             new oral anticoagulant (NOAC) over the 8 weeks prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of stroke, transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism

          -  History of major bleeding during treatment with an anticoagulant or antiplatelet
             therapy in the last 12 months

          -  History of traumatic or non-traumatic intracranial, intraspinal or intra-ocular
             bleeding

          -  Known bleeding diathesis or any known active bleeding site at screening or baseline

          -  Family history of bleeding disorder

          -  Known active GI lesions predisposing to bleeding events

          -  Myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as SBP/DBP ≥ 160/100 mmHg at the screening visit

          -  Heart failure NYHA class IV in the 3 months prior to the screening visit

          -  Dual antiplatelet therapy. Treatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor or low dose aspirin (≤ 100
             mg/d) is allowed but not both.

          -  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min) at the screening visit
