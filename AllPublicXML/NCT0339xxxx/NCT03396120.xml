  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common disorder among patients with interstitial lung
      disease (ILD). The symptoms are usually nonspecific and overlooked. Thus, a noninvasive
      screening modality is recommended for early detection of PH because of its potentially
      significant impact on treatment strategy and clinical outcomes.

      Objectives: To evaluate the usefulness of assessing forced vital capacity (FVC%), diffusion
      capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%), and FVC%/DLCO% ratio to predict pulmonary
      hypertension among patients with ILDs.
