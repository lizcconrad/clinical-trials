    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety
      of tabelecleucel for the treatment of Epstein-Barr Virus-associated post-transplant
      lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) in the setting of solid organ transplant (SOT) after
      failure of rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety
      of tabelecleucel for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD in the setting of SOT after failure of
      rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy.

      Tabelecleucel cell products will be selected for the subject from a bank of available
      tabelecleucel cell products based on matching ≥ 2 HLA alleles, at least one of which is a
      restricting HLA allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+ PTLD.

      Subjects will be enrolled into one of two cohorts based on therapy prior to enrollment:
      Cohort A, for those who have failed rituximab alone; and Cohort B, for those who have failed
      rituximab and have also received chemotherapy for the treatment of PTLD. Study procedures and
      product administration will be the same for each cohort.

      Tabelecleucel will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle,
      subjects will receive IV tabelecleucel at a dose of 2×10^6 cells/kg on Days 1, 8, and 15,
      followed by observation through Day 35.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior SOT of kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, small bowel, or any combination of
             these

          2. A diagnosis of locally-assessed, biopsy-proven EBV+ PTLD with a pathology sample
             available for central review

          3. Availability of appropriate HLA partially-matched and restricted tabelecleucel cell
             product

          4. Measurable, 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-avid (Deauville score ≥ 3) systemic disease (using
             Lugano Classification response criteria) by positron emission tomography
             (PET)-diagnostic computed tomography (CT). For subjects with treated central nervous
             system (CNS) disease, a head CT and/or brain/spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             as clinically appropriate will be required to follow CNS disease response per Lugano
             Classification response criteria.

          5. Treatment failure of rituximab monotherapy (Cohort A) or rituximab plus any concurrent
             or sequentially administered chemotherapy regimen (Cohort B) for treatment of PTLD.
             Note: Subjects with CD20 negative disease are eligible to enroll without prior
             anti-CD20 therapy after failure of first-line treatment (reduction of
             immunosuppression is not considered first-line therapy) and discussion with the
