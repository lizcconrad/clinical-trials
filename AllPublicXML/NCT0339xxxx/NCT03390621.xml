      Investigators will use an existing data set collected between 2007 and 2009. The purpose of
      the larger data set including 177 families was to examine parent - child interactions during
      dinner meals in low-income Hispanic and African-American families participating in Head Start
      programs. Data was collected on parent-child interactions and information regarding the food
      served and consumed by children during dinner meals. The specific aims included: 1) examining
      the overall diet quality using the Healthy Eating Index of Head Start preschool dinner meals
      by parent feeding styles, an 2) the diet quality of the dinner meal served to that of the
      meal consumed and within each of the parent feeding styles.
