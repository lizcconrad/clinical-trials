  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to incurable and prevalence has increased steadily,
      chronic respiratory disease is considered hazardous to health and quality of life of the
      disease. GOLD treatment guidelines (global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease
      guideline) pointed out the pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the non-drug treatment in
      patients with severe COPD, shown to improve exercise capacity and reduce the short of
      breathing, improve the quality of life and reduce the anxiety associated and depression and
      improved survival advantages. Meanwhile, a few studies have examined effect the exercise
      training in severe COPD patients' symptom distress and quality of life, so as to make severe
      COPD patients to improve the effectiveness of the campaign to ongoing regular pulmonary
      rehabilitation movement, is considered an important issue.

      It has been proposed that physical activity enhancement or exercise training can be effective
      in improving symptoms and quality of life in these patients. However, it has not been
      examined systematically. Therefore, the main purposes of this study are: 1.Prevalence of
      symptom distress; 2.The physical preferences; 3.The relationship between quality of life and
      physical activity; 4.Effects of Comprehensive Health coaching exercise training on improving
      fatigue, sleep disturbances, quality of life, readmission, and survival. In the first year of
      this study, a descriptive-correlational design will be used and in the second and third years
      of study, the experimental design and prospective longitudinal study will be undertaken.
      Instruments include motion sensors, physical activity scale, Physical Activity Preferences,
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality of Life Index. Statistical analyses include descriptive statistics,
      t-test, one-way ANOVA, latent growth modeling, Logistic models, GEE, and survival analysis.
      Results from this study will provide important implications for improving symptom management
      and quality of life for sever chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.
