      The aim of this study is to determine if adding manual therapy to care as usual reduces the
      discomfort from chronic migraine compared to care as usual alone

    <description>Headache Impact Test (HIT6). The six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) provides a global measure of adverse headache impact and is used in screening and monitoring patients. The HIT-6 items measure the adverse impact of headache on social functioning, role functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning, psychological distress and the severity of headache pain.
The final HIT-6 score is obtained from simple summation of the six items and ranges between 36 and 78, with larger scores reflecting greater impact. The categories used for interpretation of impact are: little or no impact (49 or less), some impact (50-55), substantial impact (56-59), and severe impact (60-78).</description>

    <measure>Change in Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Score (MSQoL 2.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item instrument measures how migraines affect daily functioning across three domains: Role function Restrictions (7 items assessing how migraines limit one's daily social and work-related activities); Role function prevention (4 items assessing how migraines prevent these activities); Emotional Functional (3 items assessing the emotions associated with migraines). It uses a 6-point scale: &quot;none of the time,&quot; &quot;a little bit of the time,&quot; &quot;some of the time,&quot; &quot;a good bit of the time,&quot; &quot;most of the time,&quot; and &quot;all of the time,&quot; which are assigned scores of 1 to 6, respectively. Scores are computed as a sum of item responses and rescaled from a 0 to 100 scale such that higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
