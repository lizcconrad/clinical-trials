    <textblock>
      This study evaluates in a dose-escalation manner, the safety, and preliminary impact on
      bleeding, and the preliminary effect on coagulation measures of increasing doses of
      allogeneic Thrombosomes in thrombocytopenic patients.

    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial, conducted in thrombocytopenic patients with modified World
      Health Organization (WHO) Grade 1* or 2 bleeding, assessing the safety of infusing increasing
      doses of allogeneic Thrombosomes in WHO bleeding and measures of coagulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults up to 68 y/o with any of following: acute leukemia (ALL or AML),
             myelodysplasia, aplasia, and/or therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) induced bone
             marrow aplasia or hypoplasia with thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≥ 5,000 and ≤
             70,000/μL) for a minimum of 2 days. May include bone marrow transplant or peripheral
             or cord blood stem cell recipients, but not subjects with Graft-vs-Host disease.

          -  Hospitalized patients (or willing to be hospitalized for 24 hours after Rx) with
             Modified WHO Grade 1 (subset) or Grade 2 Bleeding Score or at risk for same within 4
             weeks of screening. The Grade 1 subset includes patients who have either epistaxis,
             hematuria, oral petechiae, or bleeding at invasive or other wound sites.

          -  No platelet inhibitor drugs within 5 days prior to infusion and during the immediate
             study 6 Day follow-up period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hx or condition related to thrombosis, embolism or vascular occlusion/ischemia,
             including but not limited to: TIA, stroke, MI, stent placement, valve replacement
             and/or repair

          -  Currently with an active acute infection, or suspected infection, a single oral
             temperature of ≥ 101° F or a temperature of ≥ 100.4°F sustained over a 1 h period in
             past 24 h. Subjects on prophylactic antibiotics are not excluded from study

          -  Coagulopathy or receiving anticoagulants that result in PT or aPTT values greater than
             1.3 X upper limit of normal or elevated D-dimer of decreased fibrinogen

          -  History of any inherited coagulation or platelet function, disorder or ITP, TTP, or
             HUS

          -  Receipt of tranexamic acid or other antifibrinolytics within 48 hrs prior to infusion

          -  Rx with an investigational drug w/in 1 month of infusion, other than for treatment of
             their underlying disease
