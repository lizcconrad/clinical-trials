  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, open-label, single arm pilot study of Metformin in patients
      with Fanconi Anemia (FA) and cytopenias with the primary endpoint of hematologic response.
      This study will also assess safety, tolerability, and the biologic effects of Metformin in
      patients with FA.

    <description>Hematologic response is defined by specific increases in erythroid, platelet, and neutrophil counts.
Erythroid response: Hemoglobin (Hgb) increase by &gt;1.5g/dL for non-transfusion dependent patients and for patients who are transfusion dependent: Transfusion independence Only transfusions given for Hgb ≤8g/dL or for symptoms will be counted in the response evaluation
Platelet response: If initially &lt;20k/uL to start, then must increase to &gt;20k/UL with an absolute increase of 100%. If initially ≥20k/uL to start, then must have an absolute increase of &gt;30k/UL
Neutrophil response: If initially &lt;500/uL to start, then must increase to &gt;500/uL with an absolute increase of &gt; 250/uL. If initially ≥500/uL to start, then must have an absolute increase of &gt;500/uL</description>

               -  Hepatic Function : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal for age; alanine
                  aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 135 U/L

               -  Renal Function: A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:

        Age Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Male Female

          1. to &lt; 2 years 0.6 0.6

        AND

        • Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above
        institutional normal

          -  Normal cardiac status as documented clinically, otherwise they will need an
             echocardiogram prior to enrollment

          -  Serum bicarbonate must be &gt;17.

          -  Participants of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal birth control; intrauterine device; double barrier method; or

             last dose of Metformin.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow pills.

          -  Ability to understand and/or the willingness of the patient (or parent or legally

          -  Patients must not have very severe aplastic anemia at the time of enrollment which
             would require bone marrow transplantation (as defined by at least 2 out of the
             following 3: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &lt;200k/uL, platelets &lt;20k/uL, absolute

             androgens.

          -  Pregnant participants will not be entered on this study given that the effects of
             Metformin on the developing human fetus are unknown.

          -  Breastfeeding mothers are not eligible because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with

             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients must not have prior history of symptomatic hypoglycemia over the past year or
             hypoglycemia with glucose &lt;50mg/dL on screening and baseline laboratory assessments.
