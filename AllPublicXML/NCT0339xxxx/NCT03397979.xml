  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few studies evaluating best bathing practices in the management of pediatric atopic
      dermatitis (AD). Trans-epidermal water loss plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD. In
      concert with application of topical corticosteroids (TCS), we sought to investigate whether
      frequent soaking baths (i.e. twice daily for two weeks), followed immediately by application
      of an occlusive moisturizer (i.e. soak-and-seal), would be more effective than infrequent
      soaking baths (i.e. twice weekly for two weeks) in the management of AD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of twice daily soak-and-seal baths for improving severity of
      disease in children with AD, we implemented a randomized clinical trial using a single-blind,
      crossover-controlled design. Patients received the same moisturizer, cleanser, and class VI
      topical corticosteroid (TCS), and only bathing varied. After a 1 week run-in, children were
      randomized 1:1 into 2 groups: Group 1 underwent twice weekly soak-and-seal baths for 2 weeks
      (&quot;dry method&quot;) followed by twice daily soak-and-seal baths for 2 weeks (&quot;wet method&quot;), and
      group 2 did the converse. A single treating physician assessed outcomes and, along with those
      analyzing the data, was masked to group assignment. Participants and their caregivers could
      not be masked. Analyses were based on intention to treat.

    <description>Infrequent soaking baths, in this study, is defined as twice a week soaking baths for 10 minutes or less, over 2 weeks. However, this is a crossover study design with two interventions: 1) Infrequent soaking baths, as defined above, and 2) Frequent soaking baths (defined as twice daily soaking baths for 15-20 minutes, over 2 weeks). All subjects in the study will undergo both interventions, but in different order. Thus, this is a study comparing Infrequent Versus Frequent Soaking Baths. Each subject serves as their own control.</description>
