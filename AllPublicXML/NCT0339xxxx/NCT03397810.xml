  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac amyloidosis is responsible for significant morbidity associated with heart failure,
      and carries a poor prognosis. Currently there are very limited treatment options for this
      condition. Radiotherapy has been used successfully to treat amyloidosis elsewhere in the
      body, however has not been trialled in cardiac amyloidosis. Therefore this study aims to
      assess the effect of radiotherapy on cardiac amyloidosis, to evaluate whether it can
      successfully reduce the burden of amyloid deposits in the myocardium as assessed by
      18F-Amyloid PET.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will involve administration of external beam radiotherapy (5 fractions of
      2Gy) focused to the heart.

      Measurements of effect will be assessed at 12 weeks by:

      Amyloid PET Cardiac MRI with administration of gadolinium and ultrasound A blood venous
      sample (cardiac biomarkers) Quality of life assessments
