    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate anatomical and functional changes during RT for patients
      receiving fractionated RT for brain tumors. Anatomical changes during RT will be registered
      and analyzed and if needed the radiotherapy plan will be modified for the individual patient.
      This means that the &quot;to be irradiated volume&quot; will be modified according to the shape changes
      of the tumor. The functional MRI sequences will be used to evaluate what parameters, and at
      which time point, are important for radiotherapy outcome.

    <description>The difference is position shape and size in the target volume before and during fractional radiotherapy treatment. In case there is no macroscopic extension beyond the clinical target volume the new target volumes (gross target volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV).) will also (but later) be delineated for analysis of volume changes, center of mass changes and distance measurements between the delineation on planning MRI versus repeated MRI.</description>

        Patients with metastasis in the brain from extracranial solid tumors or patients with

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary brain tumor (WHO IV, GBM); treated with fractionated radiotherapy with or
             without preceding surgery. Systemic treatment is allowed before and during
             radiotherapy.

          -  Brain metastasis (from a solid extracranial tumor) eligible for treatment with
             fractionated radiotherapy with or without preceding surgery. Systemic treatment is
             allowed before and during radiotherapy.

        Also, postoperative patients with a macroscopic residual tumor lesion can be included (the
        diagnosis of residual diseases is defined by the treating neurosurgeon or on the MRI
        executed within 24 hours after the surgery, the diagnosis of residual macroscopic disease
        should always be confirmed during the neuro-oncology multidisciplinary meeting).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving Whole Brain RT (WBRT)

          -  Patient with a poor kidney function (GFR &lt; 30 mL/min; CKD 4 and 5; patients on
             dialysis and patients with acute kidney insufficiency)

          -  None, doubtful or very small (&lt;5 mm in its largest dimension) contrast enhancing
             lesion

          -  Patients with a contraindication for MRI
