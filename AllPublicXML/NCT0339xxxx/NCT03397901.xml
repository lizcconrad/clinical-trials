  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory rectal bleeding of chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) is still problematic and does
      not respond to medical treatments including reagents, endoscopic argon plasma coagulation
      (APC) or topical formalin. We proposed this prospective cohort study, to assess the efficacy
      and safety of colostomy in treating refractory hemorrhagic CRP with moderate to severe
      anemia, to provide higher-quality evidence of colostomy in these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) is a common complication after radiotherapy of pelvic
      malignancies, accounting for 5%-20% of cases. Rectal bleeding is the most common symptom,
      which accounts for &gt; 80% of CRP patients. Mild to moderate bleeding can be controlled by
      medical agents like sucralfate, endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or topical
      formalin. Severe and refractory bleeding is still problematic and refractory to these above
      medical treatments. Our previous retrospective study found that colostomy obtained a higher
      rate of bleeding remission (94% vs 12%) in 6 months, especially in control of
      transfusion-dependent bleeding (100% vs0%), when compared to conservative treatments.
