  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior maxilla (Esthetic zone) is very challenging area because of thin buccal plate of
      bone. After tooth extraction physiological process occur causing alteration of bone and soft
      tissue so, delayed placement of implant lead to loss of bone height and width. Immediate
      placement of implant is become essential to preserve the bone and soft tissue from loss.

      Socket shield technique is a recent technique which is by sectioning the root and extraction
      of palatal part and leaving buccal part of the root with its attachment of periodontal
      ligament and vascularization still intact then placing implant in palatal socket. This
      technique allow preservation of buccal plate of bone and soft tissue with minimum loss
      allowing better result in esthetic zone.
