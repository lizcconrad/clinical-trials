      This prospective observational cohort study will investigate the impact of a bundle of nine
      preventive measures (Assessment, prevention and management of pain; spontaneous awaking
      trial; spontaneous breathing trial; choice of sedation and analgesia; delirium assessment,
      prevention and management; early mobility; family communication and ICU Diary) on the
      incidence and severity of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) and clinical outcomes in
      critically ill patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study. It will include all adult patients,
      admitted to a surgical ICU (13 beds) and a medical ICU (10 beds), with a length of ICU stay
      of at least 2 day, from January 01 to December 31 2018. Patients with severe cognitive
      deficits prior to admission, identified by clinical history obtained by the psychology or
      through the Mental State Mini Exam (MMSE), traumatic brain injury and stroke patients with
      Glasgow coma scale &lt;14, will be excluded. On admission to the ICU, risk factors for PICS will
      be identified.

      During ICU stay, the patients will be submitted to nine interventions aiming at the
      prevention of PICS: Assessment, prevention and management of pain; spontaneous awaking trial;
      spontaneous breathing trial; choice of sedation and analgesia; delirium assessment,
      prevention and management; early mobility; family communication and ICU Diary. At ICU
      discharge, the physical, psychiatric and cognitive components of PICS will be evaluated using
      the following tools: FSS-ICU, dynamometry and nutritional indicators (physical component),
      HADS (Anxiety and Depression), MOCA (cognitive dysfunction) and PCL -C (posttraumatic stress
      disorder). The duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of sedation, ICU LOS and hospital
      mortality will also be evaluated. Reassessments will be done 5 days after discharge from the
      ICU or at hospital discharge (what happens first) and 3 months after the randomization at the
      follow-up clinic. Patients identified with PICS at discharge from the ICU will be compared
      with those who did not develop the syndrome. The investigators will specifically evaluate the
      percentage of adherence to preventive measures, the presence of risk factors and clinical
      outcomes.
