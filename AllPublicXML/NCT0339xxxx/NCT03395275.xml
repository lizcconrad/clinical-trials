  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the retrospective study ont he effectiveness of the microdose method of IT morphine
      therapy, the investigators are interested in measuring the sensory changes at 4 time points
      during the microdose method. The microdose method involves weaning the patient off oral
      opioids and maintaining an opioid-free period prior to initiating a very low opioid dose in
      IT therapy. The microdose method is a standard of care. The study involves measuring sensory
      changes to hot, cold, and pressure. Data collection will be performed at regularly scheduled
      clinic visits, examining range of doses, pain scores,dose escalations, quantifiable
      psychosocial factors ( not captured in previous retrospective study), and changes in sensory
      thresholds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of intrathecal (IT) drug delivery systems for the management of chronic non-cancer
      pain has been in practice for over 30 years. A recently published study from the University
      of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) performed a retrospective review on the morphine microdose
      method in community-based clinics. The goal of the study was to examine the morphine
      microdose method in an outpatient setting and assess success of therapy, pain scores and dose
      escalation. Patients were successfully weaned off their systemic opioids, maintained in an
      opioid-free period for 4-6 weeks, and then underwent a microdose trial and implantation. The
      majority of patients were successfully managed on morphine monotherapy, with a significant
      reduction in pain scores, and dose escalations comparable to prior studies. No prospective
      studies have examined the microdose method in correlation with changes in pain sensitivity.

      Several studies have looked at the use of various pain testing models to investigate the
      effects of chronic opioid therapy and changes in pain perception. A systematic review of the
      literature identified clinical studies incorporating measures of hyperalgesia in patients on
      chronic opioid therapy. This review was aimed at finding the optimal testing modality to
      evaluate pain threshold and tolerance to external stimuli, including mechanical (pressure,
      touch, injection), thermal (cold/heat), and electrical. Although the results did not reveal
      any one method with sufficient power, several prospective studies evaluating hyperalgesia
      with heat pain ratings have shown some promising results; two studies revealing significant
      changes in heat responses for opioid treatment groups, and one study demonstrating lower heat
      pain perception values following an opioid taper. The latter study of research pertaining to
      pain sensitivity changes following an opioid taper is lacking, and only recently was a study
      performed investigating changes in pressure threshold following transition from full mu
      agonist to buprenorphine. Little is known at this juncture how pain thresholds change due to
      opioid dose changes and/or route of delivery changes such as oral to intrathecal routes.

Hot threshold test: The hot threshold method we will be utilizing has been described in the literature with good reproducibility and reliability. [Dyck 1996] We will be using a similar system and have reproduced the program using a non-invasive device.
Cold threshold test: the same non-invasive device will be used to test cold detection and pain threshold levels. This method is previously described. [Wright 2017]
Pressure threshold: Mechanical testing (pressure pain threshold) will be assessed utilizing an algometer. We have used this method in a previous study and published results. [Wilkes 2017]</description>
