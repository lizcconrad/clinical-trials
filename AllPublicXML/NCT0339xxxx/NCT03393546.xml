  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is considered as one of the most important causal factors of behavioral and
      psychological symptoms in patients Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). The
      investigators plan to examine the effectiveness of pain relief, pain sensory change (measured
      by quantitative sensory testing) and immune biomarkers change (measured by serum biomarkers)
      after the auricular point acupressure (APA). A waitlist and education control will be used to
      examine the feasibility of a 4-week APA intervention. The investigators will also explore
      potential analgesic pathways and underpinnings of APA on pain relief.

      A waitlist and education control pilot study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of
      a 4-week APA intervention. This study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, following
      the baseline assessment (1st home visit), participants will wait one month and will be
      randomized to an APA or education control group (to control time and attention). For the
      education control, each participant will be given 3 Alzheimer's Association publications
      (i.e., Basics of AD; Take Care of Yourself; and Behaviors). Both groups will have 1st office
      visit at pre-intervention, followed by three home visits weekly, 2nd office visit
      (post-intervention). After post-intervention assessment, the education control participants
      will cross over to the APA protocol. Participants at both groups will have three monthly
      follow-up (3 home visits) after the completion of APA. In Phase 2, all participants will be
      reassessed every three months for 6 months (2 follow-up phone surveys).

    <description>It will be measured using Zarit Burden.The Zarit Burden Interview, a popular caregiver self-report measure used by many aging agencies, originated as a 29-item questionnaire . The revised version contains 22 items. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a scale. Response options usually range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always) The score ranges from 0 to 48.the greater the score, the higher the burden.</description>
