  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrophic acne scars are a common and important sequelae of acne that affect up to 43-55% of
      patients with acne. Scarring impacts quality of life with reports of diminished self-esteem
      and frustration/sadness; additionally, some individuals report that their appearance even
      interferes with their professional lives. Though many treatments for acne scarring exist
      including ablative and nonablative lasers, subcision, and peels, none is without risk of
      adverse effects of pain, post-procedure redness or pigmentary changes. There have been no
      randomized studies directly comparing the effectiveness and safety profiles of microneedling
      (Dermapen) to 1,540nm nonablative fractional lasers (Palomar StarLux) in the treatment of
      atrophic acne scarring in skin of color. This clinical trial aims to determine which
      treatment modality -- microneedling or nonablative fractional laser -- is safer and more
      efficacious in the treatment of acne scarring in patients with skin of color.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective clinical trial of 30 healthy patients with Fitzpatrick skin
      phototypes III-V with atrophic acne scars on the face who desire treatment of their scars.
      Subjects with skin phototypes III - V are being studied because this population has been
      underrepresented in literature on treatment of acne scarring and also has been shown to have
      a higher incidence of adverse effects including post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from
      established treatments for acne scarring such as ablative laser resurfacing. Each treatment
      group of 15 subjects will be composed of 5 patients each with skin type III, IV, and V.

      Participants will have a total of 7 visits lasting between thirty minutes to one hour in
      duration. The first visit will be an assessment for inclusion in the study. Once consented
      participants will randomized to either the laser arm that will be treated with a 1,540nm
      fractional nonablative laser (Palomar StarLux) or the microneedling arm that will be treated
      with a microneedling device (Dermapen 3MD). The precise laser or microneedling settings will
      be tailored to each participant. After enrollment and prior to the first treatment session,
      participants in both groups will pretreat with adapalene 0.1% gel, hydroquinone 2% cream, and
      sunscreen to the face daily for 4 weeks prior to first treatment. This is an acceptable
      pre-treatment protocol in the treatment of acne scarring.

      Participants will receive a series of 5 treatment sessions of either the laser or
      microneedling per randomization protocol at 4-6 week intervals. At each visit, participants
      will be asked about any adverse effects and also examined by either the PI or
      co-investigator. If any adverse effects are noted, subjects will have the option of either
      continuing or discontinuing their involvement in the study. Standardized high-resolution
      digital photographs of all patients will be taken at baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months
      after the last treatment session. At that 3 months follow up participants will also be asked
      to complete a questionnaire about their treatment experiences and satisfaction with the
      outcome and the Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire. If the study reveals that one
      treatment modality is far superior to the other treatment, participants randomized to the
      inferior treatment modality will be offered the superior treatment at no cost.

    <description>The Goodman and Baron score considers type of scar, number of scars, and severity of scarring and assigns a grade 1-4 with grade 1 representing mild, macular disease and grade 4 representing severe scarring that is obviously visible at social distances of 50cm, is not easily covered by makeup, and is not able to be flattened by manual stretching of the skin. Lower scores are favorable.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire with questions about participant satisfaction with the treatment, perceived improvement, and perceived adverse effects will be administered at the last visit, 3 months after the treatment is complete.

    <measure>Impact of skin disease on the quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after the last/5th treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Impact of skin disease on the quality of life will be assessed using the Dermatology life Quality Index (DLQI) which is a ten-question questionnaire with responses options of: Very much=3, A lot=2, A little=1, Not at all=0, or Not relevant=0. Range of scores are from 0 to 30 and interpreted as: 0 - 1= no effect at all on patient's life, 2 - 5= small effect on patient's life, 6 - 10= moderate effect on patient's life, 11 - 20= very large effect on patient's life, and 21 - 30= extremely large effect on patient's life. Responses will be compared between the two treatment arms.</description>
