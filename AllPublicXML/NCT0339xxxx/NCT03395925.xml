  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid nodules are among the common alterations of the thyroid. Depending on the detection
      method the prevalence is between 20% and 50%, whereas the incidence increases with
      improvement of ultrasonic technology. The CelonPro Surge bipolar coagulation electrode
      operated with the compatible power control unit and compatible tube pump is indicated for
      ablation and coagulation of soft tissue, including thermal inactivation and/or volume
      reduction of locally defined tissue areas, such as tumors and metastases.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the influence of radiofrequency ablation due
      to thyroid volume after 24 hours, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
