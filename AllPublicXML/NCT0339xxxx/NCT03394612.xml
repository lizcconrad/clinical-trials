  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EHSG-KF (synonym denovoSkin)
      in comparison to meshed STSG in adults and children with full-thickness Skin defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre phase II clinical trial will target adults and children with fullt-thickness
      skin defects to elucidate the benefit of a tissue-engineered autologous skin substitute.
      Particular emphasis, apart from safety, will be placed on efficacy, e.g. scar quality, in
      comparison to meshed STSG.
