      Comparison of OCTA to conventional imaging modalities for the diagnosis of eye diseases in

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new non-invasive imaging technique that
      employs motion contrast imaging to high-resolution volumetric blood flow information. OCTA
      compares the decorrelation signal between sequential OCT b-scans taken at precisely the same
      cross-section in order to construct a map of blood flow. At present, level 1 evidence of the
      technology's clinical applications doesn't exist. The investigators plan to compare OCTA as
      an imaging modality to conventional imaging modalities used in clinical routine.

    <description>The primary objective of this observational study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity to diagnose vascular abnormalities with OCTA compared to conventional imaging methods. The main parameter that will be assessed is area of nonperfusion of the retina. The incidence (binary) of nonperfusion areas will be assessed in OCTA and compared to conventional imaging methods such as fluorescein angiography.</description>
