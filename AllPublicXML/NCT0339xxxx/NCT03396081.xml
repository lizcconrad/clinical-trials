  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure (IC), after hospitalization, have a marked fragility: in France,
      in the first year, 29% die and 45% are readmitted to IC. Interventions improving the
      coordination of care providers at the time of discharge from hospitalization were tested;
      they showed a reduction in readmissions for IC (relative risk (RR) from 0.51 to 0.74) and
      all-cause mortality (RR 0.75 to 0.87). The Patient Return Program IC (PRADO IC), set up by
      the Health Insurance, offers assistance in the initiation of outpatient medical monitoring,
      and a nursing follow-up of 2 to 6 months depending on the patient's severity. The trial of
      PRADO began in the second half of 2013, and the first evaluation showed that the time to
      first treatment was significantly shorter, and that the readmissions rate and the 6-month
      death rate were unchanged.

      This study was of epidemiological type, comparative before-elsewhere. The difficulty of
      controlling for confounders in this type of study limits the scope of these conclusions. The
      efficacy hypothesis of PRADO IC is therefore always posed in the French context
