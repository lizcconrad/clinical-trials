  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The identification of a high atropine load of treatment received during hospitalization as a
      predictor of postoperative confusion could have various benefits:

        -  Pharmacoepidemiological: identify factors associated with postoperative confusion

        -  Clinics: by favoring treatments with a low atropine load during anesthesia, the
           management of patients hospitalized in orthopedics. Similarly, stopping or re-evaluating
           treatments with a high atropine weight for scheduled surgery is an easy step to take.

        -  Socio-economic: by reducing the costs related to the occurrence of a confusional
           syndrome (over-treatment, prolonged hospital stay, loss of autonomy,
           institutionalization of patients...).

      In total, the present study would improve the daily management of hospitalized patients and
      the practices of clinicians, by offering a decision-making aid.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Association between atropine load of medications on the risk of postoperative confusion</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of a postoperative confusion syndrome performed by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) scale once a day. The CAM is a validated scale as a diagnostic scale for confusional syndrome at the patient's bedside with four parts : 1) confusion and fluctuation of symptoms, 2) inattention, 3) disorganization of thought, 4) disorder of consciousness.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Atropinic load of drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The DURAN scale is the most recent and most comprehensive atropine load evaluation scale. This scale classifies the evaluated drugs into three categories: no anticholinergic power (atropine weight = 0), low anticholinergic activity (atropine weight = 1), high atropinic power (atropine weight = 3). All drugs received by the patient during 7 days will be classified with the Duran scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to discharge, an average of ten days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days of hospitalization (days) between surgery and discharge. Association between atropinic load of drugs and duration of hospitalization will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Autonomy</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Description of autonomy of the patient at three months of surgery evaluated by the Activity Daily Living scale (ADL). The ADL scale evaluates activities of daily living: washing, dressing, going to the bathroom, ensuring transfers, continence and food. Each item is rated according to a level of dependence: independent (1 point), with assistance (0.5 points), unable to achieve (0 points). A total of 6 points indicates a total autonomy, and 0 a total dependency.</description>
