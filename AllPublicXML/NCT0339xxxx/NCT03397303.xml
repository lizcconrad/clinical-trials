  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to understand how nerve mechanical properties are altered in patients with
      rare peripheral neuropathies . Stiffness of various peripheral nerves will be measured using
      ultrasound shear wave elastography. Patients will be compared with age-matched controls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following nerve will be studied bilaterally, in a randomised order: Median, ulnar,
      Radial, Sciatic and Tibial.

      Participants will be asked to remain relaxed during elastography measurements.
