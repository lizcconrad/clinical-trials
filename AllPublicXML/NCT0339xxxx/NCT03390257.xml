  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      3NT flexible endoscope is a single-use disposable handheld endoscope that provides a means to
      visualize the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus space and deliver irrigation to treat the
      sinus ostia and spaces within the paranasal sinus cavities for diagnostic and therapeutic
      procedures
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind this feasibility study is to show that access and visualization of the
      nasal anatomy and paranasal sinuses (Maxillary, Frontal and Sphenoid sinuses) in conjunction
      with Balloon Sinus Dilation in patients suffering from symptoms attributable to sinusitis is
      feasible in the office and operating room settings; This is an essential step in the
      development of a combined dilation and visualization system that will allow visualization,
      dilation and lavage of the sinuses via their natural ostia during an office visit, and
      minimize radiation exposure, antibiotic use, multiple office visits, and cost.
