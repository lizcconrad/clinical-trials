  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A withdrawal time of at least 6 minutes has been considered to be necessary to guarantee the
      adenoma detection rate and the critical quality criterion of colonoscopy. However, several
      large observational investigations demonstrated that 9 minutes will be in favor of higher
      adenoma detection rate and lower risk of interval colorectal cancer, when compared with
      6-minute withdrawal. Meanwhile, a few studies also indicated that no significant benefit were
      observed in longer withdrawal time. Up to now, no randomized controlled trials have been
      conducted to give a definitive conclusion. Therefore, we performed a multicenter,
      prospective, randomized Controlled trial to compare adenoma detection rate of 6-minute and
      9-minute withdrawal in colonoscopy.
