  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about preventive strategies with immediate public health impact for cognitive
      functioning in the oldest-old (OO). Cognitive training improves cognitive functioning in the
      young-old (YO; 60 to 84), yet has not been examined in the OO.

      Clinical trials are needed to determine if computerized cognitive training is effective at
      preventing or delaying cognitive decline in the OO. In order to develop such trials,
      information regarding use of computers and internet by the OO, and the ability and interest
      in such a program, must be determined.

      This study will examine the effects of a computerized cognitive training program, CogniFit™,
      with a &quot;classic&quot; computerized games program, on cognitive functioning in cognitively healthy
      OO subjects. Information regarding use of computers and internet by the OO will be collected.
      Interest in and ability to complete a computerized cognitive training program will be
      examined, along with the cognitive, demographic, biological, and lifestyle characteristics
      related to this interest and ability.

      Efficacy of the CogniFit™ and games programs will be assessed immediately following the
      training and four months after completing the training. The researchers expect that those who
      use the CogniFit™ program will have greater improvements than those using the games program.
      Finally, the participants' characteristics related to the efficacy of the programs will be
      examined.

      Subjects recruited for this project will include those already participating in several
      studies of aging and cognition at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Recruiting from this
      pool of subjects will provide this program with baseline information regarding numerous
      subject characteristics, including cognition, family history, lifestyle, and cardiovascular
      information.

      This study will inform future large-scale clinical trials of computerized cognitive training
      programs in the elderly, as well as provide information regarding the efficacy of such
      training in the OO. In addition, the study will identify characteristics affecting efficacy
      of computerized training, and thus, may suggest mechanisms through which cognitive training
      improves cognitive functioning in the most senior citizens of our society.

      Specific Aim 1- To estimate, in cognitively normal OO, rates of 1) computer and internet use,
      2) willingness to participate in a computerized cognitive training program, 3) ability to
      comply with the program to its completion.

      Specific Aim 1a- To explore the relationships of baseline global cognition, sociodemographic,
      ADL/IADL, lifestyle, and biological characteristics with willingness to participate in, and
      with completion of a computerized cognitive training program.

      Specific aim 2 - To compare the effectiveness of the CogniFit. and games programs 2 months
      after initiation of the intervention (corresponding to the time to complete the
      intervention).

      Specific aim 2a - To compare the effectiveness of the CogniFit. and games programs 6 months
      after initiation of intervention Specific aim 3- To explore the relevance of the wide range
      of already available sociodemographic, lifestyle, ADL/IADL, and biological characteristics of
      subjects with the differential effectiveness of the programs.

      Results of this study will provide essential information for planning a large-scale trial of
      computerized cognitive training program for the OO.

      The current lack of disease modifying treatment to delay onset of slow progression to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the robust epidemiologic evidence suggesting modifiable
      protective life-style factors (eg. cognitive and physical activity have led to particular
      interest in life-style interventions that delay the onset or slow the progression of
      cognitive decline.

    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of program (approximately 7-8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item word list is presented over 3 trials (at the rate of 1 every 2 seconds) with a different word order each trial. The participant reads each word aloud as it is presented and then asked to recall as many words as possible. The range is 0 - 10 for each trial, with a Trial Total of 30. After a short delay the participant is asked to recall as many of the 10 words as they can. Word List Recognition: Immediately after the Delayed Recall task, the participant is asked to identify the 10 words from the list of target words and ten distractor words. There is a max of 10 correct 'Yes' responses and 10 correct 'No' responses. To adjust for chance, the score is calculated as the total number of correct answers minus 10. A Savings score is calculated to reflect the ability to recall learned information after a delay; this score is obtained by dividing the number of words recalled after the delay by the total number correct on Trial 3 and compared at completion of program to baseline.</description>
