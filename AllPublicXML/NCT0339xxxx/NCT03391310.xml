    <textblock>
      The enrolled children would be randomized to one of the groups 'study group' or 'Honey
      dressing group' or 'Group I' (honey dressing containing Active Leptospermum Honey also known
      as Manuka honey would be used), changed every alternate day for a maximum period of upto 8
      weeks (in cases of stage IV ulcers) or till healthy granulation tissue appears, whichever is
      earlier and 'control group' or 'Standard treatment group ' or 'Group 2' (paraffin gauze is
      applied after application of povidone iodine). Randomization will be performed as per
      protocol. Primary outcome will be reduction in time to healing of any stage of pressure ulcer
      and secondary outcomes will be treatment failure and new onset infection of ulcer.

      Children admitted to the PICU would be eligible for inclusion. The interventions will be
      initiated within the hospital itself. All children will be managed as per standard treatment
      protocols of the unit for various disease conditions. The enrolled children would be
      randomized to one of the groups 'study group' or 'Honey dressing group' or 'Group I' (honey
      dressing containing Active Leptospermum Honey also known as Manuka honey would be used),
      changed every alternate day for a maximum period of upto 8 weeks (in cases of stage IV
      ulcers) or till healthy granulation tissue appears, whichever is earlier and 'control group'
      or 'Standard treatment group ' or 'Group 2' (paraffin gauze is applied after application of
      povidone iodine). Randomization will be performed as per protocol. Primary outcome will be
      reduction in time to healing of any stage of pressure ulcer and secondary outcomes will be
      treatment failure rate and new onset infection of ulcer. The investigators ICU is a fully
      equipped 8 bedded ICU with all ventilated beds. There are 2 full time consultants, residents
      and staff with nurse patient ratio of 1:1 to 1:2. Therefore, the investigators are well
      equipped to treat critically ill children. There will be an in-built mechanism of assuring
      quality of processes at different steps.
