  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current spine procedures can suffer from a variety of complications resulting in a high
      incidence (up to 55%) of misplaced screws and implants. This can lead to devastating clinical
      consequences, including neurologic and vascular injury, and extensive physical, mental, and
      economic damage. Surgical navigation has a great potential to reduce these risks through
      accurate guidance; however present technologies rely on intraoperative imaging that uses
      ionizing radiation (e.g. computed tomography, or fluoroscopy), which limits surgical anatomy
      registration updates to less than 3-4 time points during surgery. They also require
      cumbersome and lengthy set-up and registration of fiducial markers and have limited abilities
      to account for motion that occurs during surgery and patient positioning. Therefore, the
      investigators propose a real-time intraoperative optical topographical imaging based surgical
      guidance system capable of accurately guiding the placement of implanted devices such as
      screws.

    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that optical visualization of surgically exposed anatomy with the
      Biophotonics and Bioengineering Laboratory (BBL) surgical navigation prototype, when
      registered with pre-operative imaging (CT or MRI), can accurately estimate subsurface anatomy
      and allow tracking the position of surgical instruments in real-time, using an intraoperative
      non-contact optical imaging system during spinal surgical procedures. This is based on the
      completed preliminary study of 40 spinal procedures. The specific research aim is as follows:
      Validate the ability of the BBL surgical navigation prototype to function as the sole
      navigation system during spinal surgical procedures. The study will focus on testing the
      robustness of the system to appropriately function on a variety of spinal surgeries.
