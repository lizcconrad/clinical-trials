  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the western world. Myocardial
      infarction pathogenesis usually involves the development of an atherosclerotic plaque and
      thrombus.

      Past research has shown a correlation between thrombin generation values and ischemic heart
      disease, however, to our knowledge no investigation has been done into the correlation of
      thrombin generation and cardiac catheterization results in ischemic heart disease patients.

      In the current research the investigator will investigate the correlation of thrombin
      generation values using calibrated automated thrombogram and cardiac catheterization results
      in active ischemic heart disease patients.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the correlation of thrombin generation values using
      calibrated automated thrombogram and cardiac catheterization results in active ischemic heart
      disease patients.

      In total 340 patients are planned for inclusion in this trial. After signing an informed
      consent a blood sample will be obtained from each participant. the investigators will measure
      the thrombin generation over time in plasma assessed by the calibrated automated thrombogram
      (CAT). In addition information about the course and results of cardiac catheterization will
      be collected.
