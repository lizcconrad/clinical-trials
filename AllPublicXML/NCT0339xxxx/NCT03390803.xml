  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four consecutive patients with Hemifacial spasm and 25 age and gender-matched randomly
      selected eyes of healthy volunteers underwent corneal pachymetry and intraocular pressure
      measurements using Goldmann Applanation Tonometer and non-contact tonometer. An interval of
      15 minutes was maintained between Goldmann Applanation Tonometer and non-contact tonometer
      measurements. Intraocular pressure measurements were performed before (during hemifacial
      spasm) and 2 weeks after Botox injections in Hemifacial spasm patients and in healthy
      volunteers without Botox injections. All the measurements with Goldmann Applanation Tonometer
      were carried out by a single physician while those with the non-contact tonometer were done
      by another physician who was masked to the results of the Goldmann Applanation Tonometer. All
      measurements were taken between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m.

        Twenty-four consecutive patients with Hemifacial spasm (study group) and twenty-five
        age-matched and gender-matched healthy volunteers (control group) will be prospectively
        included in the study. Intraocular pressure measurements will be performed before and 2
        weeks after Botox injections in patients with HFS (involved and uninvolved eyes of HFS
        both) and in healthy volunteers without Botox injections.
