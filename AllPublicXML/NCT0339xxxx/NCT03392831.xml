  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infusion therapy comprises the parenteral administration of solutions, through peripheral or
      central vascular access. Some solutions and drugs are highly irritating to the vascular
      endothelium and therefore cannot be administered in peripheral vessels, because increase the
      risk of phlebitis and/or tissue necrosis. Thus, the alternative is the central venous
      catheter (CVC) where the access can be by direct puncture of a central vessel or peripheral
      vessel puncture with progression of the catheter until central positioning, through a
      peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC).

      We must take into account that indication, insertion, handling and maintenance must be
      balanced with risks, benefits and costs. The insertion and maintenance of both catheters are
      not free of complications. Among the most frequent are: Infection, thrombosis, lumen
      occlusion and accidental early removal of the catheter. This often implies in the need for
      new vascular access, impacting on morbidity and increased treatment costs.

      The PICC has some advantages over CVC, for example: avoids repetitive punctures and
      consequently decreased handling/pain; a lower risk of infection; avoids the use of venous
      dissections; reduces the risks of pneumothorax/hemothorax; reduces the risk of infiltration,
      extravasation, necrosis tissue and chemical phlebitis. Further, the PICC can be used as a
      long-term catheter with easy handling in extra-hospital condition. All these advantages
      suggest that this technology offers lower cost to the health system and more benefits for
      patients. However, PICC is not available for use in infusion therapy in patients of the
      Brazilian public health system, except for neonates.

      The available literature does not address cost-effectiveness studies of this technology in
      the international scope comparing the PICC versus CVC. And, similarly, we do not have studies
      conducted in Brazil to incorporate this technology into our public health system, based on
      its benefits and potential cost reduction.

      In order to fill this gap, this study aims to test if the use of PICC in patients with
      infusional therapy equal or superior to 10 days (Intervention Group), will show a lower
      incidence in the outcomes (infection, thrombosis or mechanical complications), besides being
      more cost-effective when compared to the use of CVC of short stay (Control Group).

      Patient recruitment: Adult and pediatric patients will be included during hospitalization in
      the clinical/surgical units at the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre.

      Variables of registry: Clinical data (diagnosis, reason for indication of catheter, site of
      insertion, vessel size, pharmacological treatment); Socio-demographic (age, sex, education,
      income); Ultrasonography (vessel evaluation); Radiography (to ensure the correct positioning
      of the catheter); economic variables (costs of all inputs used).

      Data collection: All variables will be recorded in an instrument developed by the authors.

      Statistical analysis: Continuous variables will be described using means and standard
      deviations or median and range in case of asymmetric distribution of data. Categorical
      variables will be presented using frequency distribution. Analyses will be conducted using
      chi-square and t tests for independent samples. P values &lt;0.05 will be considered
      statistically significant. A Statistical Package for Social Sciences v.20.0 will be used. The
      Cox Regression Analysis and Log-rank test will compare the groups in relation to
      complication-free survival.

      Cost-effectiveness analysis: The cost-effectiveness analysis will be measured by the
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), showed by the difference in cost between
      intervention and control group, divided by the difference in their effect. It represents the
      average incremental cost associated with 1 additional unit of the measure of effect. The
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be based on the cost estimate for insertion and maintenance
      of the catheter, including values of the inputs used, medicines, costs with professionals,
      surgical environment, laboratory and imaging exams.
