  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of health education in improving the
      knowledge and practices of female teachers regarding screening tools and the early detection
      of breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two-group quasi-experimental design was conducted among 150 female teachers, who were
      selected from 75 schools of the Jazan General Administration of Education. Schools were
      chosen by a simple cluster randomization method. Schools were non-randomly assigned to either
      the intervention or control group. Eligible participants were recruited by a simple
      randomization method, proportional to the total number of teachers at each school. Those in
      the intervention group (n=75 teachers) were compared to the control group (n=75 teachers) at
      baseline, as well as at 6 weeks and 3 months post-intervention.

      Study aim:

      Assess effectiveness of health education on improving knowledge and practices regarding
      Breast cancer(BC) early detection and screening tools among female teachers after six weeks,
      three months in health education group in compare with control group.

      Specific objectives:

      Estimate level of awareness among female teachers regarding knowledge and practices of BC
      early detection and screening tools in Jazan area schools.

      Measure the impact of health education on female teachers knowledge and practices regarding
      BC early detection and screening tools in health education group in compare with control
      group. So Research questions are:

      What is the current awareness level of female teachers in Jazan area schools regarding
      knowledge and practices of BC early detection and screening tools? Does health education
      improve knowledge and practices regarding BC early detection and screening tools among female
      teachers in Jazan area schools in health education group more than control group?

    <description>Researchers assessed knowledge regarding BC detection and screening tools,through modified version of BCK test questionnaire which originally developed by Kathryn L.McCance,1989, USA, it contains nineteen questions. BSE knowledge and practices were assessed through BSE scale which developed by Champion,V.L.,1984, it contains fifteen questions.
Researchers assessed clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography practice through questions from ''Detection of Breast Cancer: Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Family Health Strategy Women'' questionnaire by de Oliveria RD and ''Intervention Tailoring for Chinese American Women: Comparing the Effect of Two Video on Knowledge, Attitudes, Intentions to Obtain a Mammogram'' questionnaire by Wang JH, it contains 4 questions.All previous questionnaires are valid and reliable instruments.</description>

    <description>SHEP included a comprehensive lecture about BC, with a generally deep focus on detection and screening tools, which were illustrated by a PowerPoint presentation with pictures and videos. The program also included a practical session about BSE (on breast silicon model). At the end of SHEP, a focused group discussion was conducted to answer participants' questions, and to discuss important barriers regarding BSE practice and visiting primary health care centers or clinics to undergo CBE and mammography. Different scientific and administrative solutions were discussed. SHEP materials were distributed as a hard copy (booklet) and in electronic format (CD) for all participants in the health education group at the end of training.</description>
