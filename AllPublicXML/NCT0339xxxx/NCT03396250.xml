    <textblock>
      To evaluate the relative bioavailability of Naproxen Sodium 220 mg and diphenhydramine
      hydrochloride (DPH HCL) 25 mg soft capsules (Test) versus Naproxen Sodium 220 mg and
      diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 mg tablets (Reference) after a single oral administration
      under fasted condition in healthy adults subjects.

      To assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational products in terms of advent
      events (AEs) and clinical parameters.
