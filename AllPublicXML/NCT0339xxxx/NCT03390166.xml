      The study is aim to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety with two groups of participants
      who will received a seasonal trivalent split, inactivated influenza vaccine (A/H1N1; A/H3N2
      and B) or an active comparator (licensed influenza vaccine

      This is a phase II/III, non-inferiority double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of
      immunogenicity and safety with two groups of participants who will received a seasonal
      trivalent split, inactivated influenza vaccine (A/H1N1; A/H3N2 and B) or an active comparator
      (licensed influenza vaccine).

      A total of about 945 healthy Thai male and female adult volunteers 18 through 49 years of
      age; 630 participants will be randomized to receive the GPO Tri Fluvac and 315 will receive
      an active comparator (a 2:1 ratio) (inclusion of ~7% lost to follow-up).

      Safety will be assessed for all participants through Day 90 after vaccination. Immunogenicity
      will be assessed in serum samples obtained at baseline and 21 days after vaccination in a
      subset of at least 586 individuals randomized to study vaccine and 293 active comparator
      vaccine recipients.

    <description>Seroconversion is defined as a serum HI antibody titer meeting the following four fold rising criteria.
1a. Pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and a post-vaccination titer measured on Day 21 of ≥1:40; or
1b. Pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination measured on Day 21.
1c. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) of serum HI antibodies pre- (Day 0) and post-vaccination (Day 21) for each of the three vaccine antigens.
Note that titers below the lowest limit of quantitation (i.e., below the starting dilution of assay reported as &quot;&lt; 10&quot;) will be set to half that limit (i.e., 10/ 2 = 5). If a titer is reported as greater or equal to the upper limit of the assay, it will be set to that limit.
The analyses will be performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort (ITT) and According to Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity. The primary immunogenicity analysis will be based on the ATP cohort.</description>

    <description>2a. Solicited local adverse events, including redness/erythema, swelling/induration, pain and limitation of arm movement within 30 minutes of vaccination and over the 3-day period post vaccination (Day 0-3).
2b.Solicited systemic adverse events, including fever, fatigue/malaise, muscle aches, joint aches, chills, nausea and headache within 30 minutes of vaccination and over the 3-day period post vaccination (Day 0-3).
2c. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) occurring within 90 days post vaccination. 2d. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) occurring during the entire study period (Days 0-90).
Percentage of participants experiencing each reaction will be calculated along with two-sided exact 95% CIs.</description>
