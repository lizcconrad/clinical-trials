  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of escalating
      single- and multiple-oral doses of ZSP1601 on fasted condition, and characterize PK of
      ZSP1601 on an empty stomach (fasted condition) and following a high fat, high calorie meal
      (fed condition) in a 2-period, 2-sequence manner. The study will be conducted in 3 parts
      (Ascending single dose, multiple dose and food effect). Participants will receive either
      ZSP1601 or placebo .

    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind phase 1 trial including 3 parts: single ascending
      dose(SAD) part,multiple ascending dose(MAD) part and postprandial pharmacokinetics part.The
      primary aims of the study as below:

      Evaluating the safety and tolerance of single and multiple dose of ZSP1601 in healthy
      volunteers.

      Evaluating the fasting and postprandial pharmacokinetic parameters of ZSP1601 in healthy
      volunteers.

      Eligible participants will be admitted to the trial center on Day -1. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to either experimental groups or placebo groups, according to a
      randomisation schedule in a (4:1) ratio (8 in per experimental group). Subjects in SAD will
      receive 25、50、100、200、300、450、600 mg once daily respectively.Each dose will be administrated
      after assurance of safety for the former dose. Subjects in MAD will be given a dose from SAD
      once daily for 7days.The treatment in food effect consists of 2 periods,and subjects will
      receive 300mg on fasting and postprandial states respectively. There will be a 7-day wash out
      period between treatment periods.To monitor AEs,record abnormalities (12-lead ECG,Vital
      signs,Physical examination,Clinical Laboratory),and detect the pharmacokinetics of ZSP1601.
