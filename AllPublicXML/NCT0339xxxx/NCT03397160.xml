      This clinical trial evaluates the use of novel decision support educational materials and
      services using health coaches. The study includes men newly diagnosed with low-risk prostate
      cancer. A 160 men will be recruited. Half of the men will receive a call from a health coach
      before their initial consultation visit with their urologist to review their treatment
      concerns and questions. The other half will receive usual care provided by the urologist,
      such as educational materials and services provided by the urologist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A critical public health need exists for improved prognostic tools to distinguish aggressive
      from slow growing prostate cancer at diagnosis, and for better support systems to guide
      patients in decision-making regarding management options.

      Decision support interventions that are tailored to specific clinical conditions are known to
      have increased patient self-efficacy, knowledge, question-asking, and satisfaction; and
      decreased decisional conflict, regret, anxiety, and distress.

      To reduce the risk of over-treatment, our team has developed individual risk prediction
      models that we have now integrated into our decision support intervention (DSI).

      Delivering such decision support intervention should increase patient knowledge and
      question-asking by the patient to their doctor.

      The decision support intervention can be delivered by telephone and or the Internet.

    <description>Participants assigned to the intervention will receive Decision Support Intervention in the form of a decision aid plus health coaching. The decision aid (delivered by internet and as a PDF document) provides participants with a report on options and outcomes as described in the literature; along with more tailored risk information. The tailored risk information will include their estimated risk of harboring more aggressive prostate cancer based on their clinical/pathologic features (i.e., &quot;My Clinical Risk&quot;). The DSI was developed and piloted at UCSF according to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (see http://ipdas.ohri.ca/) (IRS# 14-13332), and incorporates tailored risk models developed and validated.</description>

    <description>A question list (QL) that includes areas of patient concern are created by the health coach for use by the patient and the urologist at their first consultation visit where they discuss the extent of their cancer and consider treatment options. The coach uses the Prostate Cancer SCOPED model to complete a &quot;Prostate Cancer SCOPED Model Form&quot;. The SCOPED model uses concepts such as the situation, choices (treatment), objectives (personal goals and priorities), people (involved in supporting a treatment decision), evaluation and decisions (clarifying which choice is best and next steps).</description>
