  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic testing can be associated with mild discomfort, particularly at the time of
      insertion, repositioning, and removal of the bladder catheter (a tube inserted into the
      bladder via the urethra). Few studies have investigated ways to improve patient comfort
      during this procedure. In this study, the investigators want to see if applying external
      lidocaine (a numbing gel) prior to the procedure can help to minimize patient discomfort.

      Urodynamic testing can be associated with mild discomfort, particularly at the time of
      insertion, repositioning, and removal of the bladder catheter (a tube inserted into the
      bladder via the urethra). Few studies have investigated ways to improve patient comfort
      during this procedure. In this study, the investigators want to see if applying lidocaine (a
      numbing gel) prior to the procedure can help to minimize patient discomfort.

      Participation in this study will involve only 1 clinic visit (for urodynamic testing), plus 2
      phone calls to ask participants about pain (1 at 4-6 hours after testing; and 1 at 24 hours
      after testing). Additionally, the investigators will record any adverse effects (such as an
      allergic reaction to the gel or new irritation/pain) that happen within 2 weeks after
      testing.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either lidocaine gel or placebo gel for
      their urodynamic testing. The placebo gel will be a standard lubricant gel, meaning that it
      contains no active drug. The assigned study regimen will be chosen by chance, like flipping a
      coin. Participants will have an equal (50/50) chance of being given either study regimen.
      Neither the participant nor the study doctor or nurse practitioner will know which study
      regimen the participant is getting. Additionally, a member of the study team will ask
      participants about their pain level before and after the testing. The rest of the urodynamic
      testing procedure will take place exactly as it would if the participant was not in this
      research study.
