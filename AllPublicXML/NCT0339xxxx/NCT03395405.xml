    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and
      safety of nitazoxanide for the treatment of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant recipients with symptomatic diarrhea due to Norovirus. The study duration is 60
      months and subject participation duration is 6 months.

      160 male or female Hematopoeitic Stem Cell or Solid Organ transplant recipients, equal to or
      greater than 12 years of age with diagnosis of Norovirus will be selected for this study.
      Primary objective is 1) to assess the clinical efficacy of nitazoxanide for the management of
      acute and chronic Norovirus in transplant recipients.

      This is a phase 2 multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and
      safety of nitazoxanide for the treatment of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant recipients with symptomatic diarrhea due to Norovirus. The study duration is 60
      months and subject participation duration is 6 months.

      A total of 160 subjects &gt; / = 12 years of age will be selected. Upon enrollment in the study,
      subjects will be randomized into two treatment groups: active nitazoxanide and placebo.
      Randomization will be stratified by age group (pediatric (12-17 years) vs. adult &gt; / = 18
      years)), chronicity of Norovirus-associated symptoms (acute (&lt;14 days) vs. chronic (&gt; / = 14
      days)) and transplant type (solid organ (SOT) vs. hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)).
      Enrolled subjects will participate in 2 phases of the study: Treatment Phase, which will
      include dosing with the assigned study agent for 28 days and study visits on study day 1, 7 ±
      3 days, 14 ± 3 days, 21 ± 3 days, and 28 ± 3 days; Longitudinal Monitoring Phase which will
      include telephone call on day 35 study visits on study day 60 ± 14 days, 120 ± 14 days and
      180 ± 14 days.

      Primary objective is 1) to assess the clinical efficacy of nitazoxanide for the management of
      acute and chronic Norovirus in transplant recipients. Secondary Objectives are 1) to assess
      the virologic efficacy of nitazoxanide and 2) to assess the safety of nitazoxanide for the
      management of acute and chronic Norovirus in transplant recipients

             the protocol.

          3. Subjects receiving oral or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy concurrently or in the
