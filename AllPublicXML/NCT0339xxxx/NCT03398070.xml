    <textblock>
      Functional Neurological Disorder (FND/ Conversion Disorder) is a highly prevalent and
      disabling neuropsychiatric condition. Motor FND symptoms include Nonepileptic Seizures,
      Functional Movement Disorders and Functional Weakness. Clinical research across these motor
      FND subtypes, including research studies from the candidate's laboratory, suggest that these
      populations share many clinical and phenotypic similarities that warrant increased research
      integration. Furthermore, despite the prevalence of motor FND, little is known about the
      underlying neuropathophysiology of this condition, which is a prerequisite for the
      development of biologically informed prognostic and treatment response biomarkers. Across 3
      published neurobiologically focused articles, the candidate proposed a framework through
      which to conceptualize motor FND. It is suggested that motor FND develops in the context of
      structural and functional alterations in neurocircuits mediating emotion
      awareness/expression, bodily awareness, viscerosomatic processing and behavioral regulation.
      The overall goal of this project is to comprehensively investigate structural and functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of prognosis across motor FND. Multimodal
      structural and functional MRI techniques (including voxel-based morphometry, cortical
      thickness, resting-state functional connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging tractography)
      will be used to systemically probe brain-prognosis relationships. Novel aspects of this
      proposal include the study of the full spectrum of motor FND, consistent with a
      trans-diagnostic approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) (Conversion Disorder) is a poorly understood and
      prevalent somatoform disorder, making up 16% of outpatient neurology referrals. Patients with
      motor FND (mFND) are difficult to treat, result in major morbidity, and are costly to the US.
      An estimated $256 billion is spent annually treating this population. mFND includes
      Nonepileptic Seizures (NES), Functional Movement Disorders (FMD) and Functional Weakness
      (FW). An impediment to managing mFND is the lack of a neurobiological understanding for this
      disorder. The diagnosis of mFND is currently based on qualitative aspects of behaviors, which
      may be difficult to interpret, and the absence of findings characteristic of other
      neuropsychiatric disorders on laboratory studies such as electroencephalography (EEG) and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      A major step forward would be the identification of neuroimaging biomarkers for mFND. mFND is
      understudied compared to other disorders, but recent studies point to distributed
      neurocircuit alterations associated with mFND. This project aims to advance our biological
      understanding of mFND by investigating neuroimaging biomarkers linked to prognosis. An
      improved understanding of the neuropathophysiology of mFND will provide a critical step in
      elucidating diagnostic, prognostic and treatment response biomarkers.

      Aim:

      Identify structural and functional biomarkers of prognosis at 6-months in patients with motor
      functional neurological disorders receiving an updated standard of care.

      H1: Favorable mFND prognosis at 6 months post initial evaluation will be predicted by the
      degree of preserved baseline gray matter in limbic-paralimbic regions, particularly those
      part of the salience network.

      H2: Favorable mFND prognosis at 6 months post initial evaluation will be predicted by the
      degree of preserved baseline resting-state functional connectivity in limbic/paralimbic
      areas, particularly those part of the salience network.

      H3: Favorable mFND prognosis at 6 months will correlate with the degree of preserved baseline
      cingulum bundle and cingulo-insular tract integrity.
