      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dapivirine gel administered rectally to
      HIV-1 seronegative adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: Sequence A or Sequence B. Participants
      in Sequence A will receive 2.5 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via an applicator,
      followed by a 2- to 4-week washout period. Participants will then receive a second dose of up
      to 10 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via a coital simulation device. Participants
      in Sequence B will receive up to 10 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via a coital
      simulation device, followed by a 2- to 4-week washout period. Participants will then receive
      a second dose of 2.5 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via an applicator.

      Participants will be in the study for approximately 1 month and will attend 7 study visits.
      Study visits may include behavioral assessments, physical examinations, blood and urine
      collection, throat and anorectal sample collection, and PK sampling.
