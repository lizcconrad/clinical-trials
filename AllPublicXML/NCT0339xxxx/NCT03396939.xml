  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interventional study aims to increase the knowledge on arm and hand rehabilitation after
      stroke within community-based services. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      feasibility and clinical usefulness of the arm and hand training program (focusing on
      functional goal- and task-oriented daily life exercises) in combination with the use of an
      orthotic device in terms of patient compliance and improvement of outcomes. The secondary
      objective is to compare the effectiveness of the program with or without the use of an
      orthotic device in a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two third of all persons with stroke have a reduced arm and hand function in the acute stage.
      Three months after the debut of stroke event, 50% of these patients will still have a
      remaining disability with chronic problems of hand function (Kwakkel et al., 2003; Lawrence
      et al., 2001). The consequences are grave for these individuals, considering arm and hand
      function to be important for independent living and related quality of life. In this context,
      an intervention, combining functional goal- and task- oriented exercises with a supportive
      orthotic device in the community-based rehabilitation unit and home environment, is
      hypothesized to increase perceived goal achievement, repetition, as well as the intensity of
      exercises. An initial feasibility study followed by a pilot randomized controlled trial could
      strengthen the evidence for the arm and hand interventions after stroke, and support the
      generalizability of the results to a larger sample.

      The exercise program is outlined in accordance with the Frequency, Intensity, Type and Time
      (FITT) principles of training. The proposed training adopts a task-oriented approach as
      practised today in the participating facilities. The program is standardized in close
      collaboration with physio- and occupational therapists on the basis of contemporary motor
      learning and exercise theories. An orthosis supporting the wrist will be used as supporting
      device, hypothetically enhancing the performance of the exercise groups.

      The intervention will be performed individually and will run for 12 weeks both at the
      community rehabilitation unit (3 times week for 3 weeks) and at home (9 weeks).

      Time: one session at the community rehabilitation unit is approximately 60 minutes with a
      focus on trunk, arm and hand training. Exercises at home will be carried out in minimum 2
      hours per day.

      Frequency: 5 days per week at home-exercises with/ without the orthotic device.

      Intensity: moderate to maximal in view of strength, muscle endurance and concentration, as
      evaluated individually by use of Borg scale.

      Type:

        1. fine motor coordination exercises such as pinch grip, writing, handling objects and
           stretching of fingers, hand, and wrist;

        2. various combined activities such as turning pages, distributing cards, washing up,
           folding laundry, sweeping floor;

        3. strengthening exercises such as gross motor exercises for trunk, arm, hand and fingers
           with and without weights.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a two-step trial: first with the feasibility trial in a cohort of stroke patients regardless of location and temporal evolution then followed by a pilot randomized controlled study (RCT).
The feasibility study will include 30 stroke patients with reduced arm and hand functions to explore and establish a target group for whom the intervention may be best suitable in terms of compliance and improvement of perceived use.
The pilot RCT will include 30 first-time stroke patients with reduced arm and hand functions. The experimental group (15 patients) will receive an orthotic device for use during the exercises, while the control group (15 patients) will not. Both groups will receive the same amount of a study-specific training program.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be tested at baseline, week 3 and week 12.</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT is a 19 items arm- and hand-specific measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale. The total score on the ARAT ranges from 0 to 57, with the higher scores indicating better performance. A minimal clinical change of 10% on total score of ARAT will be considered as clinically relevant.</description>
