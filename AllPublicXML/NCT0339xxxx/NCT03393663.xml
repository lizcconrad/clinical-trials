  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease has become an important Public Health issue in most developed and
      developing countries, with increasing incidence and prevalence rates. The cost associated
      with chronic kidney disease patients is very high, derived from renal replacement therapy and
      the cost associated with the high cardiovascular risk of this population. Primary and
      secondary preventive measures are imperative. In this sense, the comprehension of mechanisms
      and biomarkers associated with CKD progression and mortality risk in this population is an
      important area of research. Cohort studies are important tools for testing risk factors and
      biomarkers. Currently, CKD cohorts, particularly of those not on dialysis, are few and
      restricted to North America and Europe.

      The present study established a cohort of 454 CKD participants (not on dialysis) in Sao
      Paulo, Brazil, who will be followed for 7-10 years. Baseline data collection was wide,
      including medical history, diet (food frequency questionnaire), calcium score,
      echocardiography, pulse wave velocity, cardiac frequency variability, carotid intimal media
      thickness, retinography, and an extensive biobank. Follow-up is ongoing and made through
      annual telephone interviews including questions on death, hospitalizations, and need of renal
      replacement therapy (RRT). Vital status is investigated periodically by a hot-pursuit
      strategy.

        Patients attending the outpatient service of Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, a public
        university facility providing quaternary-level care for patients with chronic diseases,
        were invited to participate in this study. Initially, from the outpatient records, all
        patients aged

        ≥ 30 years and at least two measurements of creatinine (with a minimum interval of 3
        months) ≥ 1.6 mg/dl for men and ≥ 1.4 mg/ dl for women were considered potential
        candidates. Patients attending oncology, psychiatry, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
        immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), viral hepatitis and glomerulonephritis services were
        excluded. The remaining candidates were then contacted by phone and were invited to
        participate if they did not meet any exclusion criteria.
