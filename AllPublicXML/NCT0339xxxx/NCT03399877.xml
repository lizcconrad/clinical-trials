  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uroflowmetry(UF) has been the standard first-line diagnostic tool for the evaluation of
      pediatric voiding dysfunction. But recently, UF combined with pelvic flow
      electromyography(EMG) is emphasized and recommended to analyze the separate contributions of
      the detrusor and bladder outlet and sole UF is discouraged except for the follow-up study
      after abnormal UF/EMG result(Bauer et al., 2015). However, electrode itself can disturb
      pelvic floor relaxation and there is no evidence about necessity of consecutive UF/EMG test.
      Therefore, we are going to compare three different methods (Primary-Secondary: UF/EMG-UF/EMG,
      UF/EMG-sole UF, sole UF-UF/EMG)

    <intervention_model_description>Children who meet the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are assigned to perform one of the three test protocols in order of registration according to a computer gererated randomization list. Children who assigned group A perform uroflowmetry-electromyography for the first and subsequently perform uroflowmetry-electromyography again. Children who assigned Group B perform uroflowmetry-electromyography for the first, and subsequently perform sole uroflowmetry. Children who assigned Group C firstly perform sole uroflowmetry and subsequently perform uroflowmetry-electromyography.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Uroflow curve pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Uroflow curve pattern: There are 5 uroflow curve patterns, bell-shaped, tower-shaped, interrupted-shaped, staccato-shaped and plateau shaped by uroflowmetry. The shape is determined by detrusor contractility and influenced by abdominal straining, coordination with the bladder outlet musculature and any distal anatomic obstruction.</description>

    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>post-void residual(cc): ultrasonographic bladder scan machines calculates bladder volume. PVR measurements in neurologically intact children are highly variable. PVR must be obtained immediately after voiding(&lt;5min)</description>
