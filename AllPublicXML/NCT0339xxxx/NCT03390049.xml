  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvodynia is a debilitating chronic vulvar pain lasting at least 3 months without a clear
      identifiable cause that is challenging to treat effectively. Vulvodynia is a common pain
      condition: its prevalence is estimated at 7-8% in women between the ages of 18 and 40.
      Vulvodynia that is provoked and localized to the vestibule (provoked vestibulodynia [PVD])
      appears to be the most commonly seen in clinical practice. The current treatment approach for
      PVD follows a trial-and-error strategy from one intervention to another if symptoms fail to
      remit. Treatment options include reducing vulvar irritation (e.g., by stopping the use of
      detergents), topical agents (e.g., lidocaine), oral medications, pelvic floor physical
      therapy, psychotherapy, locally injectable agents (e.g., botulinum toxin A), and surgery
      (vestibulectomy). Despite the number of available treatment options, treatment failure is
      common.

      Fractional carbon-dioxide (CO2) laser is a technology widely used in dermatology for the
      treatment of various skin conditions. It has also been found to be an effective and safe
      treatment modality for symptoms of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause. A recent pilot
      study explored the use of fractional CO2 laser for the treatment of vestibulodynia in 37
      subjects, 67.6% of which reported that their symptoms were &quot;improved&quot; or &quot;very improved&quot;
      after 3 fractional CO2 laser sessions. In addition, the subjects reported
      statistically-significant decreases in vulvar pain and dyspareunia scores. Though the results
      of this pilot study are promising, it was of small sample size and did not control for the
      placebo effect. In cases of PVD, the placebo effect has been found to have a significant
      impact on self-reported outcomes. Sham procedures, when performed correctly, can be ethically
      administered and can significantly reduce study bias.

      The primary aim of this study, therefore, is to assess the difference in vulvar pain
      intensity scores, at baseline and at 6, 12, 16, and 24 weeks post-randomization, in women
      with refractory PVD assigned to fractional CO2 laser vs sham laser. This study will provide
      information about the efficacy of this treatment modality in women with a challenging
      clinical condition. Hypothesis: Administration of 3 sessions of fractional carbon-dioxide
      laser to the vulvar vestibule of women with refractory provoked vestibulodynia will result in
      a clinically-significant greater reduction in vulvar pain intensity scores than placebo (sham
      laser).

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in subjects' vulvar pain NRS scores</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the mean change from baseline in subjects' vulvar pain NRS scores at 6, 12, 16, and 24 weeks post-randomization. At baseline and at each of these time points, subjects will be asked to rate their vulvar pain in the previous 4 weeks. The question posed to subjects will be worded as follows: &quot;Please indicate, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst pain you have ever felt, the number that best describes the intensity of your vulvar pain with intercourse, on average, in the past 4 weeks. If intercourse has not been attempted, then indicate the number that best describes the intensity of your vulvar pain with other activities that elicit pain (for example, tampon insertion) in the past 4 weeks.&quot; NRS - Numeric Rating Scale - widely used clinically for the assessment of pain. A higher score would represent more pain and a poorer outcome than a lower score.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in subjects' scores on pain severity subscale VPAQ</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Vulvar Pain Assessment Questionnaire (VPAQ) was developed to assess the dimensions of the pain experience in studies of chronic pain. It consists of 6 primary (pain severity, emotional response, cognitive response, and interference with life, sexual function, and self-stimulation/penetration) and 3 supplementary subscales (pain quality, coping skills, and partner factors). The pain severity subscale of the VPAQ consists of 3 pairs of verbal rating scales (VRS) that test both pain intensity and pain affect (i.e., the emotional response generated by the feeling of pain). Each VRS is a 5-point scale with the following options: none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3, and worst possible=4, with a mean being calculated to produce the overall score for this subscale. The scale is 0-4 with 4 being the worst possible outcomes.</description>

It consists of 6 primary (pain severity, emotional response, cognitive response, and interference with life, sexual function, and self-stimulation/penetration) and 3 supplementary subscales (pain quality, coping skills, and partner factors). The pain descriptors subscale of the VPAQ tests pain quality (i.e., how the pain is described in terms of sensory descriptors). It consists of 10 adjectives rated on a 5-point VRS (not at all=0, a little=1, somewhat=2, a lot=3, very much=4) to yield a total score from the mean of the adjectives to represent this subscale. The scale is 0-4 with 4 being the worst outcome.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in subjects' scores on the SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) consists of 36 questions assessing physical functioning, role functioning difficulties caused by physical problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role functioning difficulties caused by emotional problems, and mental health. Scoring the SF-36 is a two-step process. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered. High scores are representative of a great health status and better outcomes, while low scores are representative of a poor health status.</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), also a generic measure, assesses the degree to which a chronic pain condition interferes with 7 general life domains: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The scale goes from 0-10 with 10 being the worst. It assesses pain at its worst, lease, average, and now (current pain).The mean score for the interference of all of the activities for each severity item (worst, least, average, now) is calculated with a higher score (near 10) being a worse outcome.</description>

It consists of 6 primary (pain severity, emotional response, cognitive response, and interference with life, sexual function, and self-stimulation/penetration) and 3 supplementary subscales (pain quality, coping skills, and partner factors). The life interference subscale of the VPAQ tests interference of pain with normal life activities. It consists of 11 everyday activities that could be interrupted by pain rated on a 5-point VRS (not at all=0, a little=1, somewhat=2, a lot=3, very much/I avoid because of pain=4) to yield a total score from the mean of the activities to represent this subscale. The scale is 0-4 with 4 being the worst outcome.</description>

    <description>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the most-commonly used generic measure of sexual function in women in PVD studies, consists of 6 subscales related to sexual desire (2 Qs scale 1 worst - 5 best), arousal (4Qs 0 worst - 5 best), lubrication (4Qs 0 worst - 5 best), orgasm (3Qs 0 worst - 5 best), satisfaction (3Qs 0 worst - 5 best), and pain (3Qs 0 worst - 5 best). The sexual function interference subscale of the VPAQ assesses the impact of chronic vulvovaginal pain on sexual function. Higher scores indicate higher sexual functioning, with an overall range of 2-36.. A score of 26.55 has been clinically selected as the cut-off for sexual dysfunction, with a score lower than that indicating this problem.</description>

    <description>Fractional CO2 laser will be applied to the entire vestibule, anteriorly to the fourchette, and laterally to the labia majora. This takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. A treatment cycle will consist of three laser sessions separated by 6 weeks +/- 1 week. The procedures will take place in the outpatient clinic. EMLA cream will be applied to the introitus for 20 minutes and wiped clean and dried prior to each laser session. Subjects will be advised to avoid intercourse for at least 3 days after each laser session because a mild inflammatory reaction may last up to 48 hours after a laser session. Topical lidocaine 5% ointment may be used for any vulvar discomfort post-procedure.</description>
