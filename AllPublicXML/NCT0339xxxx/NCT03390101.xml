  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BCD-085 is an innovative drug, monoclonal antibody against interleukin-17. The toxicity,
      safety, and pharmacokinetics of BCD-085 was investigated in animals, in phase I clinical
      study in healthy volunteers, and in phase III clinical study in patients with moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis. This clinical study aims at investigating the efficacy and safety of
      BCD-085 every other week regimen (after induction for first 3 weeks) versus BCD-085 one per
      month regimen (after induction for first 3 weeks) versus placebo in patients with moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis.

      Study purpose:

      To investigate the efficacy and safety of BCD-085 versus placebo and Cosentyx® in patients
      with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris)

      Study objectives:

        1. To compare the efficacy of BCD-085 every 2 weeks versus BCD-085 every 4 weeks versus
           placebo, based on the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI75, target sPGA score,
           and on other secondary efficacy measures.

        2. To evaluate the proportion of patients in each study arm who develop adverse events with
           multiple injections of BCD-085 and placebo. Compare the safety profiles of BCD-085 when
           used every 4 weeks and when used every 2 weeks.

        3. 4. To assess the immunogenicity of BCD-085 defined as the proportion of patients who
           develop anti-drug antibodies (binding or neutralizing).

    <description>PASI 75 is a sensitive indicator for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It should be noted that a treatment duration of 12 weeks with an assessment of the proportion of PASI75 responders is widely used in clinical development to evaluate the efficacy of psoriasis drugs and is also recommended in the EMA's guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated for the treatment of psoriasis [EMEA/CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr, 2004].</description>
