    <textblock>
      This study is to find a more effective treatment for itchy, painful or unsightly
      dermatofibromas, that will improve symptoms of itch and/or pain and/or improve the appearance
      of dermatofibromas. This is an open-label study where subjects will receive a laser treatment
      at week 0, and week 4, and then 2 additional follow-up visits. Photographs will be taken at
      each visit and rated by blinded reviewers after the study to determine efficacy.

      The main objective of this study is to find a more effective treatment for itchy, painful or
      unsightly dermatofibromas, that will improve symptoms of itch and/or pain and/or improve the
      appearance of dermatofibromas. A secondary objective of this study is to better understand
      the 1540 nanometer Erbium glass laser and its impact on the skin.

      This is an open-label study where subjects will receive a laser treatment at week 0, and week
      4, and then have 2 additional follow-up visits (no laser treatment at these visits).
      Photographs will be taken at each visit and rated by blinded reviewers after the study to
      determine efficacy.

    <masking_description>Outcome assessors are masked and will not know which photos are pre-treatment or post treatment, however, they do know that all subjects received treatment at some point. They will rate the dermatofibromas to determine efficacy. However, there is only one arm of this study. All patients are receiving the same treatment. Outcomes assessors are the only masked roles.</masking_description>
