  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defects in the abdominal wall (incisional hernia) is a frequent negative outcome after
      surgery. Reinforcing the incision with mesh seem to lower the incidence but in surgery that
      includes bowel resection a simple alternative, cheaper and less prone to infection than a
      synthetic mesh, would be of interest. The primary aim of this multicentre randomized
      controlled trial is to compare the incisional hernia incidence one year after planned
      colorectal cancer surgery performed through a midline incision which is closed either by a
      standardized small stitch 4:1 technique (the incision is closed with the use of suture of 4
      times the length of the incision) or with the same technique plus a reinforced tension-line
      suture (a suture is applied in the fibrous tissue parallel to the incision which is then
      embraced by the 4:1 suture when the incision is closed). A difference in incisional hernia of
      10% (15% without and 5% with reinforced tension-line suture) is assumed. Secondary aims are
      to evaluate incidences of wound dehiscence, other wound complications and incisional hernia
      after 3 years. Furthermore we aim to evaluate costs for incisional hernia treatment during 3
      years as well as patient satisfaction and quality of life.

      The primary aim of this multicentre randomized controlled trial is to compare the incisional
      hernia incidence one year after planned colorectal cancer surgery performed through a midline
      incision which is closed either by a standardized small stitch 4:1 technique or with the same
      technique plus a reinforced tension-line suture. A difference in incisional hernia of 10%
      (15% without and 5% with reinforced tension-line suture) is assumed and requires inclusion of
      169 patients in each group (significance level=5%, power=80% and compensation for a 20%
      drop-out). Patients planned for colorectal surgery due to a cancer are eligible for
      inclusion. Exclusion criteria are: age below 18, ASA&gt;3, former operation for incisional
      hernia in the midline, present hernia, perop findings of peritoneal carcinomatosis eligible
      for peritonealectomy, patient unable to take part in planned follow-up and patient not
      willing to take part in the study.

      Secondary aims are to evaluate incidences of wound dehiscence, other wound complications and
      incisional hernia after 3 years. Furthermore we aim to evaluate costs for incisional hernia
      treatment during 3 years as well as patient satisfaction and quality of life.

      Patient base-line characteristics, operative and postop characteristics will be recorded in
      inclusion- and op-protocols and protocols for clinical follow-up at 1 month, 1 and 3 years.
      Standard 1 and 3 years CT-scans will be examined for incisional hernia. At 1 and 3 years the
      patients will be asked to fill out an abdominal wall discomfort enquiry as well as the QoL
      questionnaire EQ-5D-5L.

      The study will be performed at 3 surgical clinics in the Region of Skane in Sweden: Malmö,
      Kristianstad and Ystad. Inclusion started this autumn and are estimated to be completed after
      somewhat more than 2 years. The last follow-up will thereby take place after an additional 3
      years (2022).
