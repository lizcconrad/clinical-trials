  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of intralymphatic allergen-specific immunotherapy
      given to adolescents and young adults who are allergic to grass or Birch pollen and have mild
      or moderate asthma. Patients will be treated with three intralymphatic injections; 1000 SQ-U
      x3 with 4-5 weeks interval, or placebo with 4-5 weeks interval. The patients receiving
      treatment will be given a fourth injection one year after the initial injections. The study
      is conducted in collaboration between Professor Lars Olof Cardell (ENT), prof Gunilla Hedlin
      (Pediatrics) and prof Marianne van Hage (Immunology)&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      26 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to birch or grass pollen are included. Study
      subjects are randomized to intralymphatic injections with placebo or ALK Alutard 5-grasses /
      birch or placebo. The patients receiving treatment will be given a fourth injection one year
      after the initial injections

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergic rhinitis due to grass or Birch pollen

          -  Mild to moderate asthma with a positive methacholine challenge

          -  Accepted and signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) with total symptom relief.

          -  Previously SCIT but no symptom improvement at all.

          -  Sensitizations to house dust mite or furry animals, with ongoing exposure and
             symptoms.

          -  Severe atopic dermatitis.

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than allergic rhinitis. A significant disease
             is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the
             patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence
             the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Patients with a respiratory tract infection in the past 4 weeks prior to Visit 2.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm, or subdermal implants).

          -  Known autoimmune or collagen disease

          -  Cardiovascular disease

          -  Hepatic disease

          -  Known renal insufficiency

          -  Cancer

          -  Hematologic disease

          -  Chronic infectious disease

          -  Any medication with a possible side-effect of interfering with the immune response

          -  Previous immuno- or chemotherapy

          -  Disease or conditions rendering the treatment of anaphylactic reactions difficult
             (symptomatic coronary heart diseases, severe arterial hypertension and treatment with
             β-blockers)

          -  Major metabolic disease

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the study product

          -  Obesity with BMI &gt; 30 since subcutaneous fat makes ultrasound imaging of lymph nodes
             harder which may risk the correct placement of injection.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, abuse alcohol or drugs within 2
             years prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within 1 month or six half lives,
             whichever is greater, prior to Visit 1.

          -  Mental incapability of coping with the study

          -  Withdrawal of informed consent
