      This is a two arm, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion clinical study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous CCT301-38 or CCT 301-59 T cells in adult
      subjects with relapsed and refractory stage IV metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Subjects with
      ROR2 positive biopsy will receive CCT301-59. Subjects with AXL positive biopsy that are ROR2
      negative will receive CCT301-38.
