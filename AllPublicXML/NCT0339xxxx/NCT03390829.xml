  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consultations in general medical practice concerning the follow-up of the patients receiving
      opiate substitution treatments are not exceptional.

      It is nowadays agreed that addictive pathology goes far beyond the issue of product
      dependence, in favor of a pathology in itself. Centered on problems of attachment, of
      framework, of trust. The implementation of the opiate substitution treatments and the lifting
      of the product dependence appears only as a preliminary to the background work with the
      patient ex-user of opiate.

      Finally, the literature provides little information on the experience of general
      practitioners and their patients under opiate substitution treatments regarding follow-up
      consultations in the stability phase.

      The objective of this work is therefore to study the feelings on follow-up consultations,
      general practitioners and their patients under opiate substitution treatments considered
      stabilized.
