  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relatively high rates of bulimia nervosa (BN) in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) cohorts suggest a relationship between the two disorders. Interestingly, case studies
      involving this comorbid population have observed improvements in BN symptoms when given
      psychostimulants for ADHD. Case studies involving BN patents without this comorbidity have
      also demonstrated BN symptom improvements upon psychostimulant initiation. Recent studies
      have also found support for the use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a psychostimulant
      approved for ADHD, for treating moderate to severe binge eating disorder, an eating disorder
      akin to BN. Given these findings, there is reason to believe that psychostimulants may also
      be capable of treating bulimia nervosa.

      Ultimately, the investigators would like to conduct a large study that examines whether
      people who are diagnosed with BN will have fewer episodes of binge eating and purging when
      they are treated with the psychostimulant medication, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX).
      However, preliminary data would be helpful prior to undertaking such a large project. To this
      end, the aim of the current study is to learn more about a) enrolment rates, b) dropout
      rates, c) the applicability of our eligibility criteria, d) the potential effects of LDX on
      novel outcome measures for studying decision-making in BN, e) preliminary safety data, and f)
      estimates of treatment effect.

      Participants (n = 30) will be instructed to take LDX once daily for two months while
      undergoing routine testing and monitoring to gather preliminary safety and treatment data.
      The research will take place at the Nova Scotia Health Authority Eating Disorder Clinic.

    <time_frame>Up to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician-observed measure designed to assess suicidal ideations and suicidal behaviours since the last visit in clinical trials. The scale consists of 4 sections. Section 1 regards suicidal ideation and consists of 5 &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions. Section 2 regards the intensity of ideation and asks the patient to describe their most severe ideation. In regard to that ideation, the patient then indicates frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation. Section 3 regards suicidal behaviour, and indicates if there has been an actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, or preparatory acts/behaviour since the last visit. Additionally, there is a section to indicate if there was suicidal behaviour during the assessment or if there was a suicide since the last visit. Section 4 specifies information about actual attempts only (actual lethality/medical damage and potential lethality).</description>

    <description>A clinician-administered scale that assesses the severity of 4 areas of eating disorder psychopathology over the past 4 weeks (28 days): Eating Concern, Weight Concern, Dietary Restraint, and Shape Concern. Overall eating disorder severity is also assessed. A higher score indicates increased severity. To obtain a particular subscale score, the ratings for the relevant items are added together and the sum divided by the total number of items forming the subscale (i.e., the mean of all subscale items). To obtain a global score, the four subscales scores are summed and the resulting total divided by the number of subscales (i.e., the mean of all items). The scale consists of 28 items.</description>
