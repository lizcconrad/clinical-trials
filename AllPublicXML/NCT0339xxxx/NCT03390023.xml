      Focus groups for Hispanic women who are pregnant and their close family members to assess
      attitudes, barriers and cultural beliefs involved in participation in clinical trials
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a qualitative study conducted with Hispanic pregnant women and their families. Focus
      groups for Hispanic pregnant women will run concurrent to groups for their close family
      member, but in separate rooms. Each focus group session of approximately 8-10 participants is
      expected to last 60-90 minutes and will be led by an experienced moderator who is fluent in
      Spanish. All discussions will be audio taped and will be kept confidential. Information
      learned will be used to refine clinical trial procedures and ensure our model of recruitment
      and retention in the parent ADORE Trial (NCT02626299) is culturally and linguistically
      acceptable and feasible.
