  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recently introduced toric V4c toric ICL (STAAR Surgical Company, Monrovia, CA, USA) has
      been designed with a 360-Âµm central hole to allow aqueous humor to flow without the need for
      an iridotomy. As far as the investigators certain, there have been not well-established
      prospective studies on the role of the V4c toric ICL for myopic astigmatism correction.
      Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes and rotational
      stability and to analyze factors that influence the rotational stability in V4c toric ICL
      implanted eyes prospectively.

    <description>Rotational stability of the toric ICL was measured using the OPD-Scan III (NIDEK Co. Ltd., Gamagori, Japan). The rotation was defined as the difference between the intended axis and the achieved axis at each follow-up. Assuming that the adjusted axis was identical to the intended angle, postoperative rotation was automatically measured by determining the angle between the adjusted axis and alignment axis. Each measurement was performed three times by one physician, and the average of the three measurements was used in the analysis.</description>

    <description>The size and power of the V4c toric ICL were determined following the manufacturer's guidelines using a modified vertex formula. Emmetropia was the target refraction following surgery in all cases. Before surgery, three centration points were marked using the slit lamp while the patient, in sitting position, fixated on the center of the slit-lamp beam, which was narrowed as much as possible.</description>
