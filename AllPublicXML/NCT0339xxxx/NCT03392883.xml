      Conduct systematic, multi-site mental health implementation research in both rural and urban
      primary care settings with a broad group of stakeholders in the US and Latin America.

    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to launch and evaluate a new mental health service delivery model in
      Latin America. Specifically, in this new multi-component, mental health service delivery
      intervention, the investigators propose to: (1) harness mobile behavioral health technology
      for mental health (with a primary focus on depression and a secondary focus on problematic
      alcohol and other substance abuse), (2) launch new workforce training and service delivery
      models (including the integration of technology into service delivery), (3) launch and evolve
      an integrated data management system for systematic data tracking and outcomes assessment,
      and (4) launch and grow a learning collaborative of organizations integrating mental health
      into primary care. The investigators will launch this project at multiple primary care sites
      in various parts of Colombia, with a plan to inform subsequent adoption in several other
      Latin American countries, including Chile and Peru.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will initially pilot test this mental health service delivery model at a single primary care site and then refine the model based on pilot data. The investigators will then expand implementation across 6 Colombia-based healthcare sites in urban and rural communities (including approximately 2000 participants). Consistent with a modified stepped wedge design (multiple baseline design), the investigators will implement the model across sites on a staggered basis and expand the number of sites in which the investigators implement over time. By conducting this multi-site implementation research project, the investigators can assess the extent to which the implementation model and associated outcomes are replicable across sites and/or the extent to which the model needs to be modified for differing contexts.</intervention_model_description>
