      What are the effects of transient insulin deprivation on brain structure, blood flow,
      mitochondrial function, and cognitive function in T1DM patients?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is associated with impaired cognition, abnormal brain development in children, and
      dementia in older adults, however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Little is known
      about the brain-specific effects of acute insulin deficiency. Our recent studies in diabetic
      mice show an overall down regulation of brain mitochondrial ATP production and up regulation
      of several key mitochondrial proteins, indicating that insulin withdrawal has a profound
      effect on brain mitochondria as well as proteins implicated in neurodegeneration.
      Hyperglycemia is known to alter cognitive function, but it is unclear if insulin deprivation
      independently alters cognitive function and has not been assessed in humans.

      In order to investigate the effects of insulin deprivation on the human brain, we propose a
      study involving temporary insulin deprivation in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes
      (T1DM). We will perform brain MRI, phosphorus31 spectroscopy, cognitive testing, circulating
      blood exosome measurements, and proteomics from muscle biopsy; comparing these measures
      during insulin treatment and deprivation between diabetic patients and age-, sex-,
      BMI-matched controls.

      Specific aim 1: Determine whether transient insulin deprivation in T1DM adults and
      adolescents alters brain structure, functions and blood flow as assessed by
      structural/functional MRI.

      Specific aim 2: Determine whether transient insulin deprivation in T1DM adults and
      adolescents alters cognitive function.

      Specific aim 3: Determine whether transient insulin deprivation in T1DM adults and
      adolescents alters the circulating blood exosome contents and metabolome that can potentially
      impact brain functions.

      Specific aim 4: Determine whether transient insulin deprivation in T1DM adults alters the
      skeletal muscle proteome homeostasis especially those involved in fission and fusion
