  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the expanded access program is to allow physicians to provide treatment with
      investigational drug, AB-PA01, for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, for which no alternative treatment(s) are currently
      available, and who meet the criteria for treatment under FDA's Expanded Access regulations
      and criteria set forth by AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation.

      To be considered for expanded access, the request should be submitted to AmpliPhi by a
      qualified and licensed physician with expertise and facilities appropriate for the
      administration of the investigational medicine. Treating physicians should contact AmpliPhi
      by emailing expandedaccess@ampliphibio.com with &quot;Expanded Access Request&quot; in the subject
      line, and include in the email the treating physicians name,
      organization/hospital/institution, physical address, email address, telephone number, and a
      brief description of the indication/condition.

      Any approval of expanded access to investigational medicine must always comply with the
      applicable laws and regulations.
