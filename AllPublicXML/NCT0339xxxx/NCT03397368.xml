    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) has an observed prevalence of between 4%and 35%.Identified
      risk factors are aging, obesity and repeated pregnancies and deliveries.

      Urodynamic remains the gold standard for diagnosis in the past years. Trans labial ultrasound
      appears to have a good role in diagnosing stress incontinence
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A comparative observational cross sectional study will be conducted .

      The symptom, or &quot;subjective indicator of disease,&quot; of SUI is described as &quot;the complaint of
      involuntary leakage on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing.&quot; 1 Stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI) has an observed prevalence of between 4% and 35%.

      It's a social problem that causes hygienic problem that s distressing for females.

      Urodynamic study is the gold standard for diagnosis of most types of urinary incontinence
      with some limitations as it's not done routinely in all cases of urinary incontinence
      according to the NICE guidelines 2 Translabial ultrasound is a simple, noninvasive,
      available, and reproducible method for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the lower
      urinary tract in females.
