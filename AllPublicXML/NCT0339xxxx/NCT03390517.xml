  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, parallel study to determine the difference in
      post-operative anastomotic leak rate of colorectal anastomosis where colon and rectal tissue
      perfusion is evaluated using fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green and without this
      method.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design involves random allocation of eligible patients to operation with colorectal
      anastomosis and intraoperative fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green and operation
      alone. After surgery on 7-8 POD patients are examined to two sides X-Ray proctography
      performed by introducing 100 ml of water-soluble liquid contrast material through the anus
      over the anastomotic line by a Foley catheter for diagnosis of anastomotic leakage.

    <description>The fluorescence angiography was performed after mobilization of the bowel, transection of the rectum, division of the rectal and colon mesentery and central vessels, before specimen extraction or resection and creation of the anastomosis. This site was selected by the surgeon using his or her best judgment and typical standard of care assessment. After this selection, the anesthesiologist administered a bolus of 1 to 2 ml indocianyne green intravenously. Perfusion of the colon was visualized and assessed via fluorescence angiography and the line of demarcation between perfused and nonperfused tissue was noted and compared with the initial planned transection point.</description>
