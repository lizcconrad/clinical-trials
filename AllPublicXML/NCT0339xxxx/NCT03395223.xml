  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, uncontrolled, Phase 4 study including 10 patients who present in
      hospital/urgent care setting with acquired methemoglobinemia. The population may include
      pediatric and adult patients (males and females of all ages are included).

      The study will run in both the EU and the US. The aim of the study is to confirm safety and
      efficacy of ProvayBlueTM for the treatment of acquired methemoglobinemia and has been
      requested by the US-FDA as a Post-Marketing requirements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric or adult patients (males and females of all ages are included) diagnosed
             with acquired methemoglobinemia and receiving treatment with ProvayBlue™ as per the
             treating physician's diagnosis and hospital standard of care.

        Acquired methemoglobinemia is defined as a level of methemoglobinemia &gt;30% or ≤30% in case
        of clinical symptoms (e.g. sleepiness, cyanosis, dizziness, etc.).

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any data collection (retrospective and
             prospective) for this study and study specific assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to methylene blue or any other thiazine dye;

          -  Known deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) due to the risk of
             hemolytic anemia as well as lack of therapeutic effect;

          -  Known deficiency in Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Hydrogen (NADPH)
             reductase.

          -  Known use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and
             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), MonoAmine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or
             drugs metabolised via CYP isoenzymes anticipated during the treatment phase of the
             study.

          -  Women who refuse to stop breastfeeding for up to 8 days after receiving the last dose
             of ProvayBlueTM.
