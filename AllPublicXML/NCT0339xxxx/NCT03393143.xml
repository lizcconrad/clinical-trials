  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is one of the most common reasons patients seek medical care, and it can have a big
      impact on patients' quality of life and functioning. Patients and providers are becoming more
      frustrated with common back pain treatments like the long-term use of opioid medications and
      steroid injections, which have been shown to have limited long-term impact on patients' pain
      and day-to-day functioning and can have safety risks.

      The State of Oregon is in the process of changing what back and neck pain treatments they
      will cover for its Medicaid enrollees. This started to affect those insured by Medicaid in
      July 2016 and will be completely implemented by January 2018. These changes will end payments
      for treatments like chronic opioid therapy and injections. They also increase the use of
      nondrug treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, supervised exercise therapy,
      intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, physical/occupational therapy, and complementary
      medical approaches (acupuncture, osteopathic/chiropractic manipulation, yoga, and massage).
      While experts agree that opioid use must be reduced, Oregon is among the first states to try
      such strong measures to promote nondrug treatments and prevent the use of chronic opioid
      treatment for back and neck pain.

      The Oregon Medicaid reimbursement changes for back and neck pain treatment create the
      opportunity for a &quot;natural experiment.&quot; In this mixed-methods, observational study, we will
      evaluate the impact of the reimbursement changes by comparing outcomes among patients with
      back pain in Oregon who will have access to these expanded nondrug treatments to similar
      patients seen in comparable clinics in California where expanded services for back and neck
      pain are not covered by the type of comprehensive payer incentive undertaken in Oregon.

      Specifically, we will use electronic health record, Medicaid claims data, and data obtained
      from a longitudinal patient survey to assess the impact of the changes on:

        -  Opioid prescribing

        -  Patients' use of pain-related health care services

        -  Patients' pain severity, pain related functioning, and satisfaction with care

        -  Adverse events, such as the use of illegal and other recreational drugs (While we expect
           the Oregon Medicaid change to result in many positive changes, limiting the use of
           opioids and pain reducing procedures like injections may motivate some individuals to
           use drugs that were not prescribed by their doctor.)

      In addition, we will use qualitative research methods to characterize the facilitators and
      barriers experienced by patients, health care providers, and clinic administrators and staff
      in adopting the Medicaid reimbursement changes and their satisfaction with the constellation
      of available and utilized services.

      Thus, this study has three components: 1) patient survey, 2) electronic health record-based
      study, and 3) qualitative evaluation.

        Patient survey: Medicaid-insured adults age 18-65 years who are diagnosed with back or neck
        pain and receive their primary health care from participating OCHIN member
        federally-qualified health centers in Oregon and California. Patients may have acute or
        chronic pain and may be receiving chronic opioid therapy or not receiving chronic opioid
        therapy.

        EHR and Medicaid claims-based study: Medicaid-insured adults age 18-65 years who are
        diagnosed with back or neck pain in Oregon and California.

        Qualitative evaluation: Patients, clinicians, administrators, and other professionals who
        have experience with the Oregon Medicaid reimbursement or other pain practice changes in
        health care services for back and neck pain. This may include patients and staff at the
        participating health centers in Oregon and California, and other health care providers such
        as chiropractors, acupuncturists, or mental health therapists who are not employed by those
        health centers but treat their patients.
