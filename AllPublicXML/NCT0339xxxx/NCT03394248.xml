    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine early detection of concussion for those at risk of
      developing symptoms and to be able to detect subconcussive cerebral impairment, and thus
      gaining a better understanding of the injury patterns for concussions in Men's and Women's
      Collegiate sports.
