  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study is to
      characterize and compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and evaluate the safety of the
      AG-348 tablet and capsule formulations after single-dose administration in healthy adult
      subjects. Pharmacokinetic sampling will take place serially at specified times during conduct
      of the study.
