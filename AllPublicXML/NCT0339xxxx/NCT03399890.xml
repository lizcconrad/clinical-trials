      Neurological physical exam is a very important outcome that should be evaluated as soon as
      possible after every lumbar procedures. By that early postoperative neurological
      complications can be revealed and early interventions planned. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the neurological physical examination time after lumbar procedures. Two routinely
      used different reversal agents (neostigmine or sugammadex) were compared according reversal
      times and muscle strength on PACU admission.
