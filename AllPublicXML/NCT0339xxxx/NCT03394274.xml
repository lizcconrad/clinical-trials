      Investigators aimed to compare the restrictive and liberal blood transfusion methods applied
      in major surgical operations performed in Anesthesiology and Reanimation Clinic and
      investigate their effects on postoperative transfusion needs, morbidity and mortality.

      The test subjects consisted of 892 patients, who belong to ASA (American society of
      Anesthesiology) I -IV groups, underwent elective major surgery between the
      01/01/2016-31/12/2016, and are over the age of 18 years. The demographic data (Age, sex, ASA
      (American society of Anesthesiology) scors, surgery type) were also recorded. we evaluated
      the value of Hemoglobin, platelet, APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), INR
      (international normalized ratio) preoperatively and postoperatively. In this study,
      restrictive and liberal blood transfusion groups were investigated.restrictive and liberal
      transfusion hemoglobin threshold value respectively before perioperative transfusion was 8 g
      / dL. were defined as restrictive blood transfusion group and perioperative transfusion was
      over 8 g / dL were defined as liberal blood transfusion group. Adverse events (tachycardia,
      hypotension, the value of lactate and metabolic acidosis). Postoperatively, the amount of
      postoperative transfusion unit, duration of hospital stay, requirement of intensive care unit
      and mortality rate.
