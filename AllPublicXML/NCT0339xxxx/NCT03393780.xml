  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the use in routine clinical practice of REKOVELLE®.
      This study will collect information from patients who never underwent previous in vitro
      fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatments for up to three
      consecutive treatment cycles.

      The ovarian stimulation protocol with REKOVELLE®, a new recombinant human Follicle
      Stimulating Hormone (FSH) prescribed for ovarian stimulation, is individualised with a dosing
      regimen that is based on two parameters: the body weight and the level of a hormone, the Anti
      Müllerian Hormone, (AMH), a parameter used to predict how the ovaries will respond to the
      ovarian stimulation.
