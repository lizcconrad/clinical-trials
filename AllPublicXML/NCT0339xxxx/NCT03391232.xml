    <textblock>
      TREOS' Phase I clinical trial will investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      of a single dose of PolyPEPI1018 CRC Vaccine as an add-on treatment to the standard-of-care
      maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This study will also
      explore the accuracy of prediction of pre-existing and newly induced CD8+ T cell responses in
      each patient using the PEPI Test and T lymphocyte infiltration detected in accessible biopsy
      sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of PolyPEPI1018 as
      an add-on immunotherapy to the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in approximately 10
      subjects with mCRC.

      The study is composed of a 3‑week Screening Period, the administration of a single dose
      vaccine (Day 1, Week 0), and a 12‑week Follow‑up Period. The study will be conducted on an
      outpatient basis.

      Screening should be performed in parallel with the subject's completion of the
      standard-of-care first-line treatment and initiation of the standard-of-care maintenance
      treatment.

      The single dose of PolyPEPI1018 will be administered after the subject initiates the
      maintenance regimen, and within 3 weeks after the eligibility CT scan was performed (should
      be performed at the completion of the first-line treatment).

      Subjects will be monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks after administration of PolyPEPI1018
      (i.e. Weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12).

    <description>The vaccine contains 6 synthetic peptides mixed with the adjuvant Montanide™. The peptides were selected to induce T cell responses against 12 epitopes from 7 cancer testis antigens (CTAs), which are the most frequently expressed CTAs in colorectal cancer. The 6 peptides were optimized with the PEPI biomarker to induce long lasting CRC specific T cell responses.</description>
