      Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the short term effects of Propanolol on heart
      rate variability in patients with hyperthyroidism.

      Design: In ten patients newly diagnosed as having hyperthyroidism and naïve of all treatment
      specific for hyperthyroidism, we evaluated the short term effects of Propanolol on heart rate
      variability (HRV).

      Methods: We measured heart rate variability by power spectral analysis during 2 hours of rest
      and during Ewing's tests before and after the administration of Propanolol 40mg/12 hours
      orally for 72 hours.

      and during Ewing's tests before and after the administration of Propanolol 40mg/12 hours
      orally for 72 hours. Other outcomes included mean heart rate, mean R-R interval during 2-hour
      rest.

      The study questions the systematic adjunction of Propanolol early in the treatment of
      hyperthyroidism.
