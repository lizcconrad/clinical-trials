    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, single-arm, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of Epstein-Barr Virus-associated post-transplant
      lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplant (HCT) after failure of rituximab.

      This is a multicenter, open label, single-arm, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD in the setting of allogeneic HCT after
      failure of rituximab.

      Tabelecleucel will be selected for the subject from the bank of available tabelecleucel cell
      products based on matching ≥ 2 HLA alleles, at least one of which is a restricting HLA
      allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+ PTLD. Sites will
      provide high resolution subject and subject's graft donor HLA typing results and other
      information as required by the protocol.

      Tabelecleucel will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle,
      subjects will receive intravenous (IV) tabelecleucel at a dose of 2×10^6 cells/kg on Days 1,
      8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant

          2. A diagnosis of locally-assessed, biopsy-proven EBV+ PTLD with a pathology sample
             available for central review

          3. Availability of appropriate partially HLA-matched and restricted tabelecleucel cell
             product

          4. Measurable, 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-avid (Deauville score ≥ 3) systemic disease (using
             Lugano Classification response criteria) by positron emission tomography
             (PET)-diagnostic computed tomography (CT). Baseline scans must be of acceptable
             quality to the central radiology laboratory prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          5. Failure of rituximab for first-line treatment of PTLD. Note: Subjects with CD20
             negative disease are eligible to enroll without prior anti-CD20 therapy after failure
             of first-line treatment (reduction of immunosuppression is not considered first-line
             therapy) and discussion with the sponsor's medical monitor.

          6. Males and females of any age

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 3 for subjects aged &gt;
             16 years; Lansky score ≥ 20 for subjects from birth to 16 years

          8. Underlying primary disease, for which the subject underwent transplant, is in
             morphologic remission

          9. Adequate organ function

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/µL, with or without cytokine support

               2. Platelet count ≥ 50,000/µL, with or without transfusion support; platelet count &lt;
                  50,000/µL but ≥ 20,000/µL, with or without transfusion support, is permissible if
                  the subject has not had Grade ≥ 2 bleeding in the prior 6 months (where grading
                  of the bleeding is determined per the National Cancer Institute's Common
                  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 5.0)

               3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total
                  bilirubin (TBILI) each &lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); however, ALT, AST,
                  and TBILI each ≤ 5 x ULN is acceptable if the elevation is considered by the
                  investigator to be due to PTLD involvement of the liver

               4. Creatinine &lt; 3 x ULN

         10. Subject or subject's representative is willing and able to provide written informed

          3. Grade ≥ 2 graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) per the Center for International Blood and
             Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) consensus grading system at enrollment

          4. Ongoing or recent use of a checkpoint inhibitor (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab,
             ipilimumab) within three drug half-lives from the most recent dose to Cycle 1 Day 1

          5. Active adenovirus viremia

          6. Need for vasopressor or ventilatory support

             (CAR)-T cells directed against B cells, or unselected donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)
