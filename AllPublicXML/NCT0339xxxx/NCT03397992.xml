      Objectives: This study is evaluating the hemodynamic effects of lowering the dialysate
      temperature in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients submitted to sustained low efficiency
      dialysis (SLED) in a single large center.

      Methods: Participants will be randomly assigned to two treatment groups. One group will be
      started treatment with low temperature (set point 5 on the machine which is around 35°C) for
      one treatment and then alternate between high and low temperatures for a maximum of 8
      treatments. The other group will be started with high temperature (set point 9 on the machine
      which is around 37°C) for the first treatment then alternate between high and low
      temperatures for a maximum of 8 treatments. Each participants will need at least two
      treatments, one with each temperature to be included in the analysis. The investigators will
      be looking for the number of events during a SLED treatment. Events will be defined as drop
      in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg or drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥10 mmHg,
      requirement of resuscitation with IVF after initiation of SLED, initiation or increase
      requirement of vasoactive drugs.

    <measure>Number of intradialytic hypotension episodes with different dialysate temperatures</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants who are enrolled are monitored during SLED treatment which can run from 8 to 14 hours for maximum of 8 treatments or till participant is switched to a different dialysis modality</time_frame>
    <description>Hypothesis is that low dialysate temperature will decrease the number of hypotensive episodes during SLED treatment, hypotensive episodes are defined as drop in SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg or MAP ≥ 10 mm Hg, decrease in ultrafiltration rate, increase or start of vasoactive agents or termination of treatment because of hypotension.</description>
