  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial of DCR-PHXC in Normal
      Healthy Volunteers (NHVs) and patients with Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH). Once safety has been
      established in NHV, PH patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PH1 and PH2 will be enrolled
      across multiple dosing cohorts. The study design will allow enrollment of PH patient cohorts
      at a given dose level once safety has been demonstrated in NHV at that dose level. The study
      will be conducted in two parts: Part A: Single ascending dose (SAD) in NHV; Part B: SAD in
      patients with PH1 and PH2 (lagging Part A by 1 dose level cohort).
