  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy on recurrent
      glioblastoma(GBM). Immune adjuvants will be injected intratumorally and systemically to
      induce antitumor-specific immunity after radiation induced immunological tumor cell death
      (ICD). With radiation, tumor cells release tumor antigens that are captured by antigen
      presenting dendritic cells. Immune adjuvants promote the presentation of tumor antigens and
      the priming of antitumor T lymphocytes. The combined treatment induces and amplifies the
      specific antitumor immunity in recurrent GBM patients, prolonging survivals for GBM patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GBM is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. The current strategy for newly
      diagnosed GBM patients includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After recurrence,
      there is no standard therapy and survival is less than 9 months. Recently, personalized
      cancer immunotherapy has shown great promise in treating different types of cancers. However,
      effective immunotherapies for recurrent GBM have yet to be established. Newly diagnosed GBM
      patients experience recurrence in five or seven months after standard treatment. We will
      investigate whether combining radiotherapy with intratumoral and systemic administration of
      immune adjuvants will improve the treatment outcome of recurrent GBM. We will use several
      immune adjuvants that activate innate and adaptive immunity.
