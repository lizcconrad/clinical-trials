  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite emergence of new anticoagulants over the last few years, patients with advanced
      chronic kidney disease still have limited options and are usually managed with warfarin after
      venous thromboembolism or diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. The use of all direct oral
      anticoagulants is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min.
      Apixaban has the lowest fraction of renal excretion (27%) and is sometimes used in patients
      with CKD V (GFR &lt; 15 mL/min/BSA) and end stage renal disease (ESRD). Until recently, data on
      apixaban use in this population were limited to pharmacodynamics as patients with severe
      renal impairment were excluded from clinical trials. In a 2016 study, it was found that ESRD
      resulted in 36% increase in apixaban AUC but no increase in Cmax, and that hemodialysis had a
      limited impact on apixaban clearance.1 There are now data available on inpatient use of
      apixaban vs.coumadin in patients with creatinine clearance below 25 ml/min.2 There was no
      significant difference in bleeding events between the two groups but the study period was
      limited to a hospital admission and may not reflect bleeding risk of long-term
      anticoagulation.

      Use of warfarin in patients on hemodialysis entails several disadvantages in this population.
      The need for INR monitoring adds clinic visits for patients that already spend a great
      portion of their time in healthcare facilities. Numerous drug interactions, involving
      warfarin, complicate management of ESRD patients that are often on many medications. The
      reduced risk of intracranial bleeding on apixaban, compared to warfarin, in the ARISTOTLE
      study, is an important consideration in patients that may already be at increased risk due
      other factors such as uremia and concurrent antiplatelet agents.

      This is a retrospective cohort study. The investigators will use Clinical Looking Glass (CLG)
      to identify all adult patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/min who were treated with
      apixaban or warfarin, for at least 1 month, between 3/1/2013 and 3/1/2017. The investigators
      will then review electronic charts in Carecast and Epic to gather data about bleeding and
      thrombotic events.Primary outcome: clinically significant bleeding, per Control of
      Anticoagulation Subcommittee criteria: 1) fatal bleed; 2) symptomatic bleed at anatomically
      critical sites such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, or pericardial hemorrhage;
      3)symptomatic noncritical bleeds resulting in transfusion of 2 units or more of red blood
      cells or drop in hemoglobin of at least 2.0 g/dl.4 Secondary outcomes: venous
      thromboembolism, cerebrovascular accident, intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding related to HD
      access
