  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of progestin-only methods of contraception has been increased obviously and
      progressively over the world in the last few years. Progestin-only contraception is an option
      for women in whom an estrogen-containing contraceptive is either contraindicated or causes
      additional health concerns.

      Progestogen-only pills are contraceptive pills that contain only synthetic progestogens
      (progestins) and do not contain estrogen . The progestin-only pill is recommended over
      regular birth control pills for women who are breastfeeding because the mini-pill does not
      affect milk production.

      The most common progestin-only method used is the injectable depot medroxy-progesterone
      acetate which had been approved by Food and Drug Administration since 1992 . depot
      medroxy-progesterone acetate provides reliable, private, long-acting (three months) and
      reversible contraception. Users of depot medroxy-progesterone acetate don't need daily taking
      as well as it doesn't affect the intercourse by any mean.

      The etonogestrel implant (Implanon) is a single-rod progestin contraceptive method placed
      subdermally in the inner aspect of upper non dependant arm for three years. Much evidence
      supports the safety, efficacy, reversibility and acceptability of this contraceptive method.

      A common reason women choose to discontinue progestin-only contraception is dissatisfaction
      with its effects on uterine bleeding which occurs in a significant number of users.
      Information revealed from many clinical trials shows that abnormal uterine bleeding with
      progestin-only contraception ranging from 10 to 25 % at first year of use.
