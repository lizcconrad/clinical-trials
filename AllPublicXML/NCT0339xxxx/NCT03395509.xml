    <textblock>
      This is an intersectional and interdisciplinary screening program in Viborg Municipality,
      including 67 years old citizens. This observational study will estimate the
      cost-effectiveness of a combined screening program for the following conditions: Abdominal
      aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, carotid plaque, hypertension, arrhythmia, and
      type-2-diabetes. Furthermore, the incidence of the outlined conditions will be described and
      so will the result of the intervention initiated (secondary medical prophylaxis, smoking
      cessation, introduction to nutritionally deficient diet etc.)

      Description of the cohort: All Viborg municipality citizen are invited to the combined
      screening program around there 67th birthday. Participants with positive screening results
      are offered following up consultations and prophylactic interventions are initiated
      (secondary medical prophylaxis, smoking cessation, introduction to nutritionally deficient
      diet etc.)

      67 years-old citizens from the surrounding municipalities without the offer of the combined
      screening are used as a control group (1 case: 5 controls).

      There are no exclusion criteria.

      The screening examination includes: Blood pressure in both arms, ankle brachial blood
      pressure index (ABI), ultrasound for carotid plaque and abdominal aortic aneurysm, HbA1c and
      pulmonary function test. Furthermore, a questionnaire on lifestyle parameters, BMI, medical
      history, walking-related pain and self-rated quality of life (EQ-5D).

      One year after the screening examination, the participants will receive a questionnaire in
      order to evaluate the effect from a participant perspective. The cost(-effectiveness) of the
      screening program will be estimated after 5 years based on prevalence of diseases, response
      rate, data extraction from nationwide registries and existing evidence of disease prevention.
