  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to work out the effectiveness (effect size) of the musical training
      intervention in reducing depressive symptoms, improving self-esteem and quality of life among
      childhood brain tumour survivors and to examine the feasibility, appropriateness, and
      acceptability of implementing musical training intervention in clinical practice. Subjects in
      the experimental group will receive weekly 45-minute lessons on musical training for one year
      (52 weeks), while those in the control group will receive usual care.

    <textblock>
      Musical training has been increasingly implemented to promote one's psychological well-being
      and cognitive functioning. For instance, to reduce depression, anxiety in psychiatric
      patients, to improve self-esteem and mood recognition in hospitalized adolescent patients
      diagnosed with &quot;adjustment reaction to adolescence&quot;, to improve social skills of children
      with autism, to enhance reading skills and academic achievement in young poor readers, and to
      facilitate children's cognitive development. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of musical
      training in promoting psychological well-being, particularly to reduce their depressive
      symptoms and enhance self-esteem, and enhancing quality of life among the childhood brain
      tumour survivors is remain underexplored. It is of paramount importance to examine the
      effectiveness of musical training so as to ameliorate adverse disease- and treatment-related
      late effects, such as depression and low self-esteem, hence enhancing childhood brain tumour
      survivors' quality of life.

    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms from baseline at 12-month follow-up between intervention and control group.</measure>
    <time_frame>12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' depressive symptoms will be assessed at 12-month after starting the intervention using the Chinese version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC).
The CES-DC is a commonly used tool in assessing the number of depressive symptoms of children and adolescent (Radloff, 1977). It consists of 20 items which are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3 (0= &quot;not at all&quot;, 1 = &quot;a little&quot;, 2 = &quot;sometimes&quot;, 3= &quot;a lot&quot;) regarding the subjects' feelings and experiences of last week. A possible scores ranging from 0 to 60 will be obtained after summing up all the items. Higher scores indicate greater number of depressive symptoms experienced. The cut-off score of this scale is 16, which indicates the children or the adolescents are currently experiencing a significant level of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>The subjects' quality of life will be assessed at baseline, using the Chinese version of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scale (PedsQL 4.0). The PedsQL is designed to measure children's health-related quality of life. The scale consists of 23 items which are categorized into four dimensions, namely physical functioning (8 items), emotional functioning (5 items), social functioning (5 items) and school functioning (5 items). All items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always) by which the participants will be asked how much of a problem has been experienced over the last month. A total possible scores ranging from 0 to 100 will be obtained, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. Subjects will be asked to respond to the Chinese version of the PedsQL 4.0 at baseline.</description>

    <description>Apart from receiving scheduled medical follow-up, the subjects in the experimental group will receive a weekly 45-minute lesson on musical training for 52 weeks. The musical training will be conducted by the Music Children Foundation and be implemented in a ratio of one subject to one qualified orchestral performer at the subjects' homes. A musical instrument will be assigned to each subject based on their interests and the results of the prior assessment of subjects' expiratory function and fine motor skills. The musical training will start at the lowest level, such as hitting simple notes and end at the highest level, such as playing an entire song.</description>
