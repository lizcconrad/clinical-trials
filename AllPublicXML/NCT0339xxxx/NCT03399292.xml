  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a common ocular disease, especially in the elderly population.
      Despite many treatment approaches, instillation of topical lubricants remains the mainstay of
      therapy. However, most of the topical lubricants available are not very well characterised
      and data about efficacy is sparse.

      The aim of the present pilot study is to investigate the effect of topically administered
      lipid based eye drops on tear film lipid layer thickness in subjects with dry eye disease,
      Meibomian gland dysfunction, blepharospasm and healthy subjects.

      Tear film lipid layer and tear film thickness will be assessed using the Lipiview II
      interferometer and OCT. Measurements will be performed before instillation of the eye drops
      and every 10 minutes after instillation for one hour. One eye will receive lipid based eye
      drops, the other eye will receive no eye drops and will be used as control. The study eye
      will be chosen randomly. In addition, Dynamic Meibomian gland imaging, Schirmer I test,
      corneal fluorescein staining and determination of tear break up time (BUT) will be performed
