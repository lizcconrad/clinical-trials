  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will i) evaluate the efficacy and the safety of bendamustine-based
      combination chemotherapy and ii) investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK)of bendamustine in
      plasma and CSF when given as salvage treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory
      primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A relatively high proportion of patients diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma will experience
      recurrent disease, yet therapy options are limited in salvage therapy. Based on the
      demonstrated activity and proposed additive mechanisms of the chemotherapeutic agents
      included in the bendamustine-based combination regimen, the efficacy and safety of R-B(O)AD
      will be evaluated for treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) primary CNS lymphoma. Evidence
      from previous preclinical tissue distribution studies and single agent intravenous drug
      therapy trials in CNS malignancies suggests that bendamustine penetrates brain and tumor
      tissue, however there are no clinical data available on the PK of bendamustine in the CSF.
      This study will evaluate the PK of plasma and CSF drug levels through a population based
      nonlinear mixed-effects model approach in a R/R PCNSL cohort with the goals to define the
      currently unknown PK profile of bendamustine in the CSF and to further characterize the
      relationship between plasma and CSF drug levels, and the influence of exposure on response to
      therapy.
