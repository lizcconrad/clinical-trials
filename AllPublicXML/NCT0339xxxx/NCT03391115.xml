  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop patient-centered palliative care interventions to
      improve patient-provider communication and Quality of Life (QoL) of ethnic and racial
      minority patients living with life-limiting illnesses. Eliciting personal experiences is an
      effective way for patients to communicate their cultural values and beliefs. This study will
      assess how to integrate the patients' personal experience narratives into the electronic
      health record (EHR). The primary hypothesis is that the implementation of a patient-centered
      intervention to elicit personal experiences that are included in the EHR will improve
      patient-provider communication and patients' QoL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Racial and ethnic minority patients with a Life Limiting Illnes (LLI) in the United States
      are underserved in many ways, including quality of palliative care. Specific disparities have
      been reported in palliative care for minority patients, including sub-optimal
      patient-provider communication and resulting lower QoL. A potential approach to improve
      communication is to elicit patients' personal narratives that address their cultural or
      spiritual values and beliefs, and include them in the EHR. The objective of this
      observational study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a palliative care nursing
      intervention designed to 1) identify barriers and facilitators for eliciting and recording
      relevant narratives from the perspectives of the key stakeholders: minority patients with
      LLI; 2) to conduct usability testing, applying a user-system-environment evaluation process
      to determine essential requirements for integration of the patient-centered narratives into
      the EHR; and 3) identify barriers and facilitators of integration of the patient's narrative
      into daily workflow from the perspectives of key stakeholders: acute care bedside nurse.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This study will utilize an observational design to define and refine the storytelling intervention, seeking input from the key stakeholders: providers (acute care bedside nurses).The SUS scale is a 10 item Likert scale which gives a global view of subjective assessment of usability with five item responses options from strongly agree to strongly disagree. SUS yields a single number representing a composite measure of the overall usability of the system being studied. Note that scores for individual items are not meaningful on their own. To calculate the SUS score, first sum the score contributions from each item. Each item's score contribution will range from 0 to 4. For items 1,3,5,7, and 9, the score contribution is the scale position minus 1. For items 2,4,6,8, and 10, the contribution is 5 minus the scale position. Multiply the sum of the scores by 2.5 to obtain the overall value of the SUS, with the higher the number, the better the outcome.</description>

    <description>The storytelling intervention consists of an audio-recorded interview with each patient participant prompted the participant to share their story with questions such as: tell me about your illness, tell me how your illness has affected your emotions, relationships, and spirituality. The interview transcripts will be used to co-create a 1 page patient story using these criteria:1) written in the first person; 2) nonjudgmental; 3) captures the participant's voice; 4) accurately reflects content of the interview; and 5) non-labeling. Once the story has been approved by the participant, I will upload it to the EHR.</description>

    <description>Once the patient's story is uploaded to the EHR, automatic alerts will be sent to the participant's EHR-assigned nurses. For usability testing, nurse participants will 1) provide content expertise of the workflow processes, and 2) put the storytelling intervention through in-house usability testing to check the &quot;strength&quot; of EHR features and user-friendliness. Data will be collected with exit interviews and completion of a questionnaire: the System Usability Scale which asks them to rank their satisfaction with specific elements such as: how the story is labeled and presented in the EHR, any technical navigation EHR difficulties, and use of the material.</description>
