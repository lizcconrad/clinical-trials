  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether overall survival of newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with lysate-loaded, mature dendritic cell vaccines as
      add-on to the standard of care consisting of resection, radiotherapy with concomitant
      temozolomide chemotherapy and subsequent adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy is superior to
      the treatment with the standard of care alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, phase 2 study, integrating vaccination with
      tumorlysate-loaded mature dendritic cells into standard radio/temozolomide-chemotherapy of
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with near-complete resection after fluorescence-guided
      resection. Only patients with confirmed gross-total resection and a residual tumor volume
      below 5 ml will be eligible for the trial. Vaccination will be performed after radio- and
      concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy and during the first three cycles of adjuvant TMZ.

             collection, transfer and processing, central neuropathological evaluation of Tumor
