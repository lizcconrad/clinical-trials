  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Financial incentives for motivating health change have been increasingly employed in various
      healthcare sectors. They can be a potentially effective approach to promote smoking
      behavioral change and increase the use of evidence-based counseling and pharmacotherapy.
      Smoking cessation randomized clinical trials (RCT) incorporating financial incentives have
      been conducted in different populations; however, there has not been a randomized clinical
      trial coupled with a financial incentive with Asian American cigarette smokers. The purpose
      of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility of implementing an incentivized smoking
      cessation program among Asian American smokers in New York City.
