      This is a randomized study with two treatment arms: 'initial Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty
      (SLT) followed by conventional medical therapy as required' ('Laser-1st') and 'medical
      therapy without laser ('Medicine-1st'). It compares quality of life in the two arms at three
      years, while also examining the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of Laser-1st versus
      Medicine-1st.

      Subjects are randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms that examine treatment pathways,
      rather than comparing single treatments alone: 'initial Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT)
      followed by conventional medical therapy as required' ('Laser-1st') and 'medical therapy
      without laser ('Medicine-1st'). We compare quality of life in the two pathways (arms) over
      three years, while also examining the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of Laser-1st
      versus Medicine-1st.

      A 'Treat in Pursuit of Control' design (TPC) compares two different routes to a pre-defined
      target Intraocular pressure (IOP) (pathways). It is a pragmatic study that uses published
      guidelines to make the complex clinical treatment choices faced in managing glaucoma,
      standardised between treatment arms by use of computer treatment algorithms. A UK National
      Institute for Health and care Excellence (NICE)-compliant evidence-based IOP Treatment Target
      1 is set for each patient, according to the study treatment algorithms. They then proceed
      through stepped increments of treatment intensity (up to and including surgery) until a
      predetermined Target IOP is reached. Target IOP is reassessed in the light of objective
      clinical evidence of stability of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) and visual function
      using visual field tests and automated optic nerve evaluation. Health Related Quality of Life
      (HRQL) and secondary outcomes are compared for patients in each pathway.

    <description>Initial Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) [PROCEDURE] followed by conventional medical therapy (eye-drops) as required.
All participants in this arm start their treatment pathway with SLT. If this does not reach the predefined, patient-specific target IOP then repeat laser (once only) is given. If the IOP target is then not reached additional treatment with all standard medications may be used and ultimately surgery (trabeculectomy with mitomycin C) as needed.</description>

If the IOP target is then not reached, additional treatment with all standard medications may be used and ultimately surgery (trabeculectomy with mitomycin C) as needed.
During this pathway of treatment all commercially available medical treatments (eye-drops) are permitted according to a pre-specified step-wise intervention protocol described in detail in the publicly available trial protocol. This begins with prostaglandin analogues, then beta-blockers followed by alpha agonists or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The full range of available doses, treatments and drugs is beyond this short summary.</description>
