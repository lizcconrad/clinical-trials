  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Views on vaccines range from those who are strongly supportive to those who are stridently
      opposed and will not budge from identity-based core beliefs about vaccines. In between these
      poles are numerous others who can delay, be reluctant (but still accept), or refuse/accept
      some vaccines for their children but not others. It is for these vaccine-hesitant parents
      that constitute the 'middle ground' of this spectrum where the most immediate and productive
      gains can be made towards enhancing vaccination acceptance and improving uptake. However,
      navigating this noisy communications environment is difficult, given the array of confusing
      and conflicting information available from multiple and competing sources. To date, there is
      no consensus on how best to use communication to respond to vaccine hesitancy. Building on
      two Canada-wide surveys of parents, the goal of this research is to identify which
      communication strategies show the greatest impact in reducing parental vaccine hesitancy and
      improving vaccination intentions.

      The specific objectives are to:

        1. Develop and pre-test four variations of news media stories that vary by source (parent
           versus physician) and content (intuitive versus deliberative);

        2. Examine the impact of vaccine hesitant parents' exposure to vaccine communications that
           vary in source (parent versus physician) and content (intuitive versus deliberative) on
           primary (vaccine hesitant attitudes) and secondary (vaccine intentions) outcomes; and

        3. Explore which media story variation may be more effective in improving vaccination
           attitudes and intentions for different parental decision-making styles (deliberative
           versus intuitive).
