    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multi-center study of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin (NGC
      triple regimen) as preoperative therapy in potentially resectable pancreatic cancer patients.

      DISEASE STATE

        -  Potentially operable or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma as assessed by
           standard CT criteria and histologically confirmed.

        -  Staging by pancreatic protocol, helical abdominal computed tomography (with contrast) or
           MRI (with contrast) required (endoscopic ultrasound is not required).

        -  No evidence of metastatic disease. Lymphadenopathy (defined as nodes measuring &gt;1 cm in
           short axis) outside the surgical basin (i.e., para-aortic, peri-caval, celiac axis, or
           distant nodes) is considered M1 (unless nodes are biopsied and are negative, then
           enrollment can be considered after review with the study PI).

      Potentially Resectable Pancreatic Cancer

        -  No involvement of the celiac artery, common hepatic artery, and superior mesenteric
           artery (SMA) and, if present, replaced right hepatic artery.

        -  No involvement or &lt;180° interface between tumor and vessel wall of the portal vein
           and/or superior mesenteric vein (SMV-PV) and patent portal vein/splenic vein confluence.

        -  For tumors of the body and tail of the pancreas, involvement of the splenic artery and
           vein of any degree is considered resectable disease. Borderline Resectable Pancreatic
           Cancer

        -  Tumor-vessel interface ≥180° of vessel wall circumference, and/or reconstructible
           occlusion of the SMV-PV.

        -  Tumor-vessel interface &lt;180° of the circumference of the SMA.

        -  Tumor-vessel interface &lt;180° of the circumference of the celiac artery.

        -  Reconstructible short-segment interface of any degree between tumor and hepatic artery.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the study drugs nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and
      gemcitabine given together are safe and effective. The combination of nab-paclitaxel plus
      gemcitabine has been studied in treating patients with pancreatic cancer, and as of
      September, 2013 is approved for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. In this study,
      cisplatin will be added to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, and tested in people who have not
      yet had any cancer therapy for the diagnosis of localized pancreatic cancer, as treatment
      prior to surgery, with the goal of improving response.

      Another name for nab-paclitaxel is Abraxane®. Nab-paclitaxel contains the same medication as
      the prescription chemotherapy drug Abraxane®. Nab-paclitaxel is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of advanced breast cancer, and in September, 2013 nab-paclitaxel, combined with
      gemcitabine, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Cisplatin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, advanced
      ovarian cancer, and advanced testicular cancer and other childhood cancers. However,
      cisplatin is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Gemcitabine was approved by the FDA in 1996 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. It is
      also an approved treatment for ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.

      Nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine will be given weekly for 2 weeks followed by a
      week of rest, for a total of 3 cycles. A cycle is defined as one set of 3 weeks of
      chemotherapy treatment. Patients will undergo surgery after a minimum of 3 weeks after Cycle
      3 of chemotherapy. Following surgery, patients mayl be treated for up to 3 cycles of this
      same chemotherapy combination.
