  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of three-dimensional conformal external-beam
      photon radiotherapy (3D-CRT), proton, or brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation
      (APBI) in treating patients with breast cancer that has or hasn't spread from where it began
      in the breast to surrounding normal tissue. Radiation therapy such as photon and proton
      partial breast external beam radiotherapy, uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and
      shrink tumors. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.
      Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed
      directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether photon or
      proton partial breast external beam radiotherapy or partial breast brachytherapy works better
      in treating patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the rate of adverse cosmesis (defined as fair or poor cosmesis) with
      accelerated 3 fraction APBI at 3 years, compared to baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the acute and late toxicities of accelerated 3 fraction APBI. II. To evaluate
      local disease control of accelerated 3 fraction APBI. III. To assess the rate of patient
      reported adverse cosmesis at 2 years, compared to baseline.

      IV. To assess quality of life and other patient reported outcomes following accelerated 3
      fraction APBI.

      V. To compare the local control, acute and late toxicities, cosmesis, quality of life and
      other patient reported outcomes between the three radiation therapy techniques (3D-CRT,
      proton, brachytherapy).

      VI. To evaluate clinical features, dose-volume parameters, and genetic variants associated
      with fair and poor cosmetic outcome.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients undergo 3D-CRT APBI for 3-5 days.

      COHORT II: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy APBI for 3-5 days.

      COHORT III: Patients undergo brachytherapy ABPI for 3-5 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 weeks, 12 months, and
      annually for 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following because this study involves therapy that has known genotoxic,
             mutagenic and teratogenic effects:

             prescribed regimens

          -  Active collagen-vascular disease that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would
             make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient

          -  Paget?s disease of the breast

          -  Proven multicentric carcinoma (DCIS or invasive) in more than one quadrant or
             separated by 4 or more centimeters or diffuse (&gt; 1 quadrant) suspicious calcifications

          -  Pathologic tumor &gt; 2.5 cm in size

             the study

          -  Breast implants (patients who have had implants removed are eligible)

          -  Extensive intraductal component
