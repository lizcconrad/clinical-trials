  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quantification of the proteomes : L-plastin, lipocalin and adiponectin was analysed in
      the subgingival tissue samples of generalized severe chronic periodontitis patients with and
      without diabetes mellitus.The demographic and the periodontal parameters were assessed and
      the correlated with the quantification of the proteins. The mRNA expression was analyzed with
      RT-PCR and the quantification of protein was done using ELISA.

      The quantification of the proteomes : L-plastin, lipocalin and adiponectin was analysed in
      the subgingival tissue samples of generalized severe chronic periodontitis patients with and
      without diabetes mellitus.A total of 70 subjects with generalized severe chronic
      periodontitis were selected and divided into two groups. Group I comprised of 35 subjects who
      were diagnosed with generalized severe chronic periodontitis without any systemic conditions.
      Group II comprised of generalized severe chronic periodontitis patients with type II diabetes
      mellitus. Demographic variables such as age, weight, height, BMI and income and the clinical
      parameters such as plaque index, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and clinical
      attachment level were recorded. Subgingival tissue samples were collected from both the
      groups from the periodontal surgical site. The collected samples were subjected to further
      molecular analysis for the mRNA expression of L-plastin, lipocalin and adiponectin using
      RT-PCR and for their protein quantification using ELISA.The elevated levels of mRNA
      expression and elevated quantification of L-plastin and Lipocalin proteins in the subgingival
      tissue samples of generalized severe chronic periodontitis subjects with diabetes denoted the
      localized involvement of these molecules in the pathogenesis of both periodontitis and type
      II diabetes mellitus. Since adiponectin was reduced in periodontitis patients with type II
      diabetes mellitus, it can be used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic biomarker for the
      early identification of patients at risk for diabetes mellitus and periodontitis.
