      Study the incidence and outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in ICU patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective multicentre case-control registration study in Dutch and Belgian ICUs will
      assess the difference in incidence and outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in
      ICU patients with severe influenza compared with influenza-negative control patients with
      severe community-acquired pneumonia during the coming three influenza seasons (2017-2020).
      The study will further assess the differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors
      between influenza patients with and without invasive aspergillosis.

      All consecutive patients aged 18 or older admitted to ICU during the inclusion period with
      respiratory distress due to influenza positive/negative community acquired pneumonia (CAP)
      will be included.

    <description>incidence of mycological evidence of Aspergillus and at least one Aspergillus compatible sign or symptom and radiological abnormalities based on Chest CT or Chest X ray. Mycological evidence can be provided by either (A) a positive culture of Aspergillus cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample, (B) ≥2 positive cultures of Aspergillus cultured from a sputum or a bronchial aspirate or (C) a galactomannan (GM) optical density of ≥1 in BAL or ≥0.5 in serum. Aspergillus compatible signs or symptoms are defined as at least one of the following:
Worsening respiratory insufficiency in spite of proper antibiotic and ventilator support
Dyspnea
Haemoptysis
Fever refractory to at least 3 days of appropriate antibiotic (AB) therapy. Recrudescent fever after a period of defervescence of at least 48 h while still on AB without apparent cause.
The presence of hyphae in lung biopsy or autopsy are also considered as sufficient evidence for IPA.</description>

      <textblock>
        All consecutive patients admitted from home to ICU with respiratory distress, with
        documented pulmonary infiltrates and initiation of antimicrobial therapy because community
        acquired pneumonia is the primary diagnosis or in the differential diagnosis.

        Confirmation of presence or absence of influenza is based on probe-based
        reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for influenza A or B directly on
        sputum, bronchial aspirate, broncho-alveolar (BAL) fluid or a nasopharyngeal swab.
