    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect
      of preoperative budesonide inhalation on arterial blood oxygenation and intrapulmonary shunt
      in patients received one-lung ventilation

      Population:

      The target population comprises all adult aged 45-65 years who was diagnosed lung cancer and
      to receive video-assist thoracoscopic lobectomy under general anethesia.The study sample will
      include 50 subjects of both gender and any race or ethnicity.

      Procedures:

      Eligible and consented patients will be enrolled into the study if all eligibility criteria
      are met and will be randomly allocated to one of the two study arms:Budesonide inhalation
      group vs Normal saline inhalation group

      Study Duration:

      Overall duration of the study is 10 months.
