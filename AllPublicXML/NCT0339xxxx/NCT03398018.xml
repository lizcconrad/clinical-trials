  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess repository corticotropin injection (RCI) in the
      form of H.P. Acthar Gel in patients with severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS, or dry eye
      disease). This pilot study is a non-randomized, open-label, interventional study to assess
      the efficacy and timeline of RCI for the treatment of severe KCS recalcitrant to conventional
      therapy. The purpose is to acquire preliminary data to support and guide the design of a
      future, double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, interventional pilot study with sixteen weeks
      (112 days) of active treatment, a possible twelve-week treatment extension, and twenty-four
      weeks of washout follow-up. Intervention is with HP Acthar Gel dosed at 80 U BIW SC indicated
      for use in anterior segment disease and keratitis. Data will be collected from five subjects.
      All subjects will be treated with 80 U BIW SC and clinically examined at two, four, six,
      nine, twelve, and sixteen weeks with a potential extension of up to twenty-eight weeks.
      Extension will be contingent upon specific outcome criteria defined in this protocol. Four
      clinical visits will occur at two, four, eight, and twelve weeks after initiating the drug
      taper to assess for regression of the signs and symptoms of KCS.
