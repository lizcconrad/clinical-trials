  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2696274 is autologous cluster of differentiation 34+ (CD34+) cells transduced with
      lentiviral vector containing human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) complementary deoxyribonucleic acid
      (cDNA) used for the treatment of MLD. MLD is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
      disorder (LSD) characterized by severe and progressive demyelination affecting the central
      and peripheral nervous system. This study will assess safety and efficacy of treatment using
      cryopreserved formulation of GSK2696274 in pediatric subjects with pre-symptomatic Early
      Onset MLD (Late Infantile (LI) to Early Juvenile (EJ) MLD). Up to 10 subjects may be included
      in the study. A minimum of 3 subjects are planned to assess the primary endpoint. Subjects
      will be followed up for a minimum period of 8 years post treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented biochemical and molecular diagnosis of MLD, based on ARSA activity below
             the normal range and identification of two disease-causing ARSA alleles, either known
             or novel mutations. Novel mutations will be analyzed with in silico prediction tools
             and excluded from being known common polymorphisms. In the case of a novel
             mutation(s), a 24-hour urine collection must show elevated sulfatide levels.

          -  Eligible subjects must have EITHER

               1. an older sibling affected by MLD (index case), whose age of symptom onset was &lt;=6
                  years of age (i.e., had not celebrated 7th birthday). Subjects will be classified
                  as LI, EJ or intermediate LI/EJ based on age of symptom onset in the index case
                  and their ARSA genotype; LI: symptom onset in index case &lt;=30 months of age and
                  genotype typically 0/0; EJ: symptom onset in index case &gt;30 months and &lt;=6 years
                  of age with genotype typically 0/R; Intermediate LI/EJ: symptom onset in index
                  case &lt;=6 years of age but unable to unambiguously characterize index case as LI
                  or EJ OR

               2. if MLD is diagnosed in a pre-symptomatic child without an older affected sibling,
                  (e.g.) incidentally or via newborn screening) and the totality of the data
                  available to the investigator strongly suggest that the subject has an early
                  onset variant of MLD likely to benefit from gene therapy, and the subject is &lt;=6
                  years of age (i.e. has not celebrated 7th birthday), the subject may be
                  considered eligible after discussion and approval by the GlaxoSmithKline medical
                  monitor (GSK-MM).

          -  Parental/guardian signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms of MLD, defined as either of the following:

               1. delay in expected achievement of independent standing or independent walking,
                  together with abnormal signs at neurological evaluation OR

               2. documented neurological signs and symptoms of MLD associated with cognitive,
                  motor, or behavioral functional impairment or regression (substantiated by
                  neurological examination and/or neuropsychological tests appropriate for age).

          -  Documented HIV infection (positive HIV RNA and/or anti-p24 antibodies).

          -  Malignant neoplasia (except local skin cancer) or a documented history of hereditary
             cancer syndrome. Subjects with a prior successfully treated malignancy and a
             sufficient follow-up to exclude recurrence (based on oncologist opinion) can be
             included after discussion and approval by the GSK-MM.

          -  Myelodysplasia, cytogenetic alterations characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome
             (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or other serious hematological disorders.

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in other interventional trials.

          -  Has previously undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and has
             evidence of residual cells of donor origin.

          -  Previous gene therapy.

          -  Has symptomatic herpes zoster, not responsive to specific treatment. Subjects with a
             recent history of herpes zoster may be included in the study. In such cases,
             inclusion, additional monitoring and treatment of the condition must be discussed and
             approved by the GSK-MM.

          -  Evidence of active tuberculosis (TB) based upon medical examination, chest imaging and
             TB testing i.e. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and microbiological evidence. Subjects with
             latent tuberculosis, as documented by medical history and/or TB testing may be
             included in the study if receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. isoniazid). Inclusion,
             monitoring and treatment of TB in such subjects must be discussed and approved by the
             GSK-MM.

          -  Acute or chronic stable Hepatitis B as evidenced by positive Hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg) test result at screening or within 3 months prior to onset of
             conditioning and/or positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Subjects with positive
             Hepatitis B core antibody due to prior resolved disease may be enrolled, only if a
             confirmatory negative Hepatitis B surface antigen and negative Hepatitis B DNA test
             are obtained. Inclusion, monitoring and treatment of hepatitis in such subjects must
             be discussed and approved by the GSK-MM.

          -  Presence of positive Hepatitis C RNA test result at screening; subjects who have
             previously tested positive for antibodies against hepatitis C can be treated, provided
             they demonstrate absence of ongoing infection using a nucleic acid test with a limit
             of quantification of &lt;=15 international units/milliliter (IU/mL). Negative test
             results are required on at least 3 sequential occasions over a period of at least 4
             weeks, after completion of treatment for hepatitis C, with the final test conducted no
             more than 3 days prior to cell harvest. Inclusion, monitoring and treatment of
             hepatitis in such subjects must be discussed and approved by the GSK-MM.

          -  End-organ dysfunction, severe active infection not responsive to treatment, or other
             severe disease or clinical condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. In addition to the potential
             infections the PI should consider testing for other transmissible infectious agents
             listed in the EU Cell and Tissue Directive as clinically appropriate and results
             discussed with the GSK-MM prior to cell harvest.

          -  Subjects with alanine transferase (ALT) &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN may be included only after discussed and agreed with the GSK-MM and
             considered in the context of the criterion for excluding subjects with other severe
             disease.

          -  Isolated elevation of total bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35 percent of total.
