  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe brain disorder characterized by the recurrence of mood
      episodes. Depressive episodes in BD are frequently refractory and clinicians have few
      treatment options. Bright light therapy (BLT, also named phototherapy) is a promising
      emerging antidepressant strategy that is lacking evidence-based guidelines for its
      prescription in BD, including to avoid side effects such as manic switches. In this context,
      this study aimed to evaluate modalities of the BLT dosage (time of exposure) escalation
      depending on the tolerance (manic symptoms) in two groups exposed either during the morning
      or at mid-day.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe brain disorder characterized by the recurrence of mood
      episodes. Patients presenting with BD spend more time with depressive symptoms than with
      manic ones, which have a major impact on the quality of life and is associated with poorer
      outcomes including recurrences and suicide. In addition depressive phases in BD are
      frequently refractory and clinicians have few treatment options. Bright light therapy (BLT,
      also named phototherapy) is the first line treatment for depression with seasonal patterns
      and show promising results in the treatment of non-seasonal depressions. More evidence in
      non-seasonal depressions is expected, especially in BD. Moreover, some specificities linked
      to BD, such as the manic switch, warrant evidence-based therapeutic guidelines and so deserve
      more studies in BD. Preliminary reports suggest that morning exposure may induce manic
      switches, and that mid-day exposures may be associated with a decreased risk of manic switch.
      Different dose-titration protocols have also not been compared, and data are lacking. In this
      context, this study aimed to evaluate modalities of the BLT dosage (time of exposure)
      escalation depending on the tolerance (manic symptoms) in two groups exposed either during
      the morning or at mid-day.
