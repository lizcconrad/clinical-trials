  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development and improvement in Preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (PGS) in
      association with the efficacy and security of vitrification and trophectoderm biopsy, more
      efficient stimulation schemes and laboratory improvements in culture and embryo selection
      have contributed to high success of the assisted reproductive technologies(ART). Transferring
      an euploid embryo avoids one of the main reasons of miscarriage and implantation failure (
      Rubio et al, 22016) and overcomes one of the most important confounding factors. Usually, the
      transfer of euploid embryos is performed under standard hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
      are referred to as FET-PGS cycles( Frozen embryo transfer). The study of FET-PGS cycles with
      the transfer of a single euploid blastocyst is the best model for evaluation of the impact of
      the endometrial preparation . Among factors influencing FET outcomes, patient's age,
      endometrial preparation, endometrium thickness, endometrial pattern, number and quality of
      embryos transferred , difficulty at ET, recently P4 have received more attention .

      The importance of Progesterone (P4) in embryo implantation has been widely studied. P4 plays
      an important role in endometrial gland formation, embryonic implantation and pregnancy
      maintenance, both in natural and artificial cycles.

        Women who underwent blastocyst trophectoderm biopsy and PGS and frozen-thawed embryo
        transfers(PGS-FET) performed after the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) .

        PGS was implemented as 46-chromosome screening, using array comparative genomic
        hybridization (aCGH) from Day 5 trophectoderm biopsy. Whole-genome amplification,
        processing and analyses were performed using the kits, software and protocols for array
        Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (aCGH) analysis provided by the manufacturer (SurePlex速
        DNA Amplification System, 24Sure速 Microarray Pack, Bluefuse速, Illlumina速).
