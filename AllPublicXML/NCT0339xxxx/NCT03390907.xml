      The purpose of this study to evaluate and examine, weather use of Hybrid Argon Plasma
      Coagulation (APC) as adjunct to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) will reduce the risk of
      residual or recurrent neoplasia at 6 months. Hybrid APC is an existing FDA approved device
      for assist of ablation of abnormal tissue anywhere in GI tract.

      Colon Cancer is a major disease that effecting more than 1 million people per year globally.
      Adenomatous polyps have been identified as the main precursor in lesions leading to
      colorectal cancer.Colon cancer screening the best way to detect and remove large, often
      asymptomatic polyps. Early detection and resection of these colorectal polyps can prevent the
      development of colon cancer. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a technique used for
      resection of medium to large colon polyps. In this technique, fluid is injected into the
      submucosal creating a cushion between the mucosa and the muscularis propria. An
      electrocautery snare is then deployed to resect the polyp in a single (en-bloc) or multiple
      (piecemeal) pieces. Most of polyps &gt;2 cm are resected in piecemeal way. Although EMR is now
      considered standard of care with successful rate resection of 85 % and low risk of
      complication (3-10% bleeding and 1% perforation), this technique has inherent deficiencies,
      especially piecemeal EMR. Recurrence rates following piecemeal EMR can be as high as 20%.
      Resection of scarred polyps using this technique is particularly challenging due to the
      non-lifting of the polyp. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an alternative approach
      that aims to remove non- pedunculated precancerous or cancerous lesions over 20 mm in one
      piece (en-bloc resection rate of 89.95% and lesion recurrence rate of 0.7%). However, due to
      its technical complexity and high complication risk (mainly bleeding and perforation, with
      complication rates approximately 8%), it is not the current standard of care and only
      performed by experts in the technique.

      Hybrid Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a new technique in which the endoscopist reinject
      the submucosal with fluid to create a cushion (normal saline/ diluted adrenaline and /or
      sodium hyaluronate solution) to protect the muscle layer and is then ablated using spray
      argon coagulation to treat any microscopic residual disease that is the seed for local
      recurrence. Previous studies have shown that this technique is a safe and easily applicable
      technique to complete resection for recurrent polyps after first EMR.

      Investigators hypothesis that with Hybrid APC assisted EMR there will be a decrease in
      recurrence rate after 6 months and it would be more effective compare to the standard EMR
      procedure.

      This is a pilot study which patients with non-pedunculated large polyps ≥ 20mm undergoing
      endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Following standard EMR all patients will undergo adjuvant
      Hybrid Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) of the base and edges of the polypectomy site to
      fulgurate any potential microscopic residual disease. Resected polyps will be sent to the
      pathology laboratory where pathologist determine the final diagnosis of the polyps as per
      standard of care.
