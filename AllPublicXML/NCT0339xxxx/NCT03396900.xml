  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      rhBMP-2 has the potential to function as a regenerative material in periodontally accelerated
      osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO). This study aimed to assess the effects of PAOO with BMP-2 on
      outcomes such as treatment period, bone density, healing and pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomly assigned into each of the following experimental groups; C+BMP:
      corticotomy with 0.5 Î¼g/mL rhBMP-2 and C: corticotomy only. Clinical parameters included
      recording the duration of treatment period, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and early
      healing index (EHI) scores. The evaluation of bone density was performed at baseline, 3
      months and 6 months by using RVG.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial where systemically healthy individuals undergoing orthodontic therapy and willing to participate in the study were referred from the Department of Orthodontics and were followed up over a 6 month period after treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>The orthodontist (HA) who performed the relevant treatment after PAOO was different from the orthodontist (MRR) randomizing the subjects into C or C+BMP groups and hence was blinded to the treatment received by the patient. One periodontist performed the PAOO surgeries (KM) and another periodontist (RVC) blinded to the therapy received by the subjects recorded the clinical and radiographic data pertinent to the study. The blind was not broken until the end of study period.</masking_description>

    <description>Periodic recall of patients for every two weeks was done to assess the amount of crowding relieved by using digital Vernier calipers and photographs.

    <description>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a category of proteins that are involved in bone formation and repair. Among these, BMP-2 is one of the most potent members of the BMP family and has been used for correcting intrabony, supraalveolar, furcation, and fenestration defects due to its osteoinductive property. BMP's are also essential for differentiation of osteoclasts, but their role in this process remains unclear. Treatment of osteoclasts with exogenous BMP-2 directly enhances RANKL-stimulated differentiation of osteoclast precursors in vitro and stimulates survival and resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts that accelerates the tooth movement.</description>
