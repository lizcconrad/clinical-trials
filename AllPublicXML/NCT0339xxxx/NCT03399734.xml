             written informed consent. To be considered non-smokers, participants must have
             discontinued smoking from Screening before first dosing.

          -  Body Mass Index ≥18.5 and &lt;25.0 kilograms per meters squared at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria

        Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline

          -  Clinically significant illness that requires medical treatment within 8 weeks or a
             clinically significant infection that requires medical treatment within 4 weeks before
             first dosing

          -  Evidence of disease that may influence the outcome of the study within 4 weeks before
             first dosing

          -  Any history of gastrointestinal surgery that may affect pharmacokinetic profiles of
             perampanel at Screening

          -  Any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found by medical history at
             Screening, and physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) finding, or
             laboratory test results that require medical treatment at Screening

          -  A prolonged QT/QT corrected interval (QT interval, Fridericia correction &gt;450
             milliseconds) as demonstrated by a repeated ECG at Screening or Baseline
