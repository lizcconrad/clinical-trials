  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1B study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of LYC-55716 given in
      combination with pembrolizumab to subjects with metastatic NSCLC, and to assess the
      combination for biologic and clinical activity in NSCLC.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 18 subjects across 5 US sites will be enrolled in the study.

      Subjects will enter a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by continuous twice daily
      administration of LYC-55716 in 28 day treatment cycles. Subjects will also be administered
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks as prescribed as standard of care by the Investigator in
      accordance with the package insert.

      The study will begin with a run-in cohort of 3 subjects to assess the safety and tolerability
      of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination. Subjects in the run-in cohort will be enrolled
      singly at intervals of not less than 7 days in order to monitor for adverse reactions to the
      combination. If no subjects in the run-in cohorts has a DLT, then the study may proceed to
      the main cohort (15 subjects).

      Subjects will receive combination treatment until clinically significant disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity, or up to a maximum of 24 months.

      Primary Study Objectives:

      Run-in Cohort

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination

        -  Determine the dose of LYC-55716 that is adequately tolerated when used in combination
           with pembrolizumab

      Main Study Cohort

      • Further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination

      Secondary Study Objectives:

      Main Study Cohort

        -  Evaluate the cellular immune response in paired tumor biopsy samples

        -  Evaluate effects on circulating biomarkers in the blood of LYC-55716 with pembrolizumab

        -  Determine the objective response rate

        -  Determine the duration of response

        -  Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has histologic or cytologic confirmation of metastatic NSCLC. Subjects must
             have a TPS score available as determined by an FDA approved test. Subject has stable
             disease or disease progression and is being treated with pembrolizumab therapy as
             standard of care by the Investigator.

          -  Subject is male or female and at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject has at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 criteria by computed
             tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance image (MRI).

          -  Subject provides consent for fresh paired tumor biopsy samples to be obtained at
