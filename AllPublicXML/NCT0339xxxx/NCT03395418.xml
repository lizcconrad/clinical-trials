  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and COPD have a significant impact on public health, affecting about 8 million people
      in France and generating health care costs of 5.5 billion euros, almost 50% of which are
      dedicated to long-term treatments are essentially inhaled therapies.

      The good control of the disease depends on the patient's compliance, but also on the proper
      use of the devices used for the administration of inhaled drugs under penalty of the
      degradation of the control of the disease with major medical and medico-economic
      consequences.

      Thus, education of these patients in the use of devices must be an integral part of medical
      care. It comes up against the complexity of the therapeutic arsenal on the one hand and on
      the other hand with its time-consuming nature: this makes it incompatible with a realization
      in consultation.

      The &quot;ARGOS&quot; process is a telemonitoring project for the support of therapeutic education,
      consisting in setting up a concrete and real-time relay between prescribers and patients for
      the education of inhaled therapeutics.

      Its objective is to provide the answer to what is currently an &quot;unmet need&quot; in the management
      of asthma and COPD, with the prospect of a positive impact on the observance of these
      treatments and by consequently their clinical and economic efficiency.
