  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent, non-progressive disorder in which the immature brain is
      affected by various causes in the prenatal, perinatal or postnatal period. Damage to the
      central nervous system in children with CP causes motor problems, balance and postural
      disorders. It is reported in the literature that the effects of balance and the effects of
      balance exercises in children with CP, similarly respiratory effects were also investigated.
      Balance and balance responses are especially important in children with ambulatory SP and
      balance problems are seen in most CP children. Insufficient control of respiratory muscles
      affects pulmonary ventilation negatively in children with CP. However, it seems that CP has
      limited articles in which respiratory muscle strength is investigated, and also limited
      studies involving inspiratory muscle training. Inspiratory muscle training is shown to
      improve pulmonary function and diaphragm (which is one of the core muscles) strength and have
      an effect on balance. Studies showed that respiratory muscle strength in children with CP is
      lower than in children with normal development. Nevertheless, there was no study showing the
      effects of respiratory muscle training on functional capacity and balance in children with
      CP. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of balance training and inspiratory
      muscle training on functional capacity, balance, respiratory function and respiratory muscle
      strength in children with CP.
