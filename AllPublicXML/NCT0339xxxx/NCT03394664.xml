      This study will evaluate the effects of dietary carbohydrate and sugar consumption,
      independent of energy content, on body fatness and metabolism in a rigorous feeding study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many people with obesity can lose weight for a few months, but most have difficulty
      maintaining weight loss over the long term. Extensive research has shown that weight loss
      elicits biological adaptations - including a decline in energy expenditure and an increase in
      hunger - that promote weight regain. However, this observation leaves unanswered why average
      body weight has recently increased among populations that are mostly genetically stable.
      According to the Carbohydrate-Insulin Model, increased consumption of processed carbohydrates
      during the low-fat diet era of the last 40 years has raised the average body weight being
      defended by biological mechanisms on a population basis. Specifically, the investigators
      hypothesize that diets high in total carbohydrate (with or without added sugar) acting
      through increased insulin secretion, alter substrate partitioning toward storage in body fat,
      leading to increased hunger, slowing metabolism, and accumulation of body fat.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators plan a randomized-controlled feeding study
      involving 125 adults with obesity. During the run-in phase, participants will be given a
      hypocaloric very-low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet, with adjustment of energy intake to produce 15
      ± 3% weight loss over approximately 3 months on an outpatient basis. After weight
      stabilization, participants will be admitted to a residential center for 13 weeks. During the
      first 3 weeks, energy intake and expenditure will be closely monitored during weight-loss
      maintenance. Then, energy intake will be individually &quot;locked&quot; at levels equal to energy
      expenditure and participants will be administered one of three randomly-assigned test diets
      for 10 weeks. The test diets include VLC, High Carbohydrate-Low Sugar (HC-LS), and High
      Carbohydrate-High Sugar (HC-HS).
