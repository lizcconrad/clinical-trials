  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to analyze the esthetic outcome of the first surgical repair of cleft
      lip and palate (CLP) patients.

      The aim of the study is to identify differences in the aesthetic evaluation of full-face and
      nasolabial region 3-D images of CLP patients following primary lip repair by laypeople.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of cleft lip and palate patient's generally involves the soft palate
      reconstruction as well as the repair of lip and nasal soft tissue defects.

      From an esthetic point of view, the primary repair, usually performed between 9 and 18 months
      of age, prepares the patients to grow into childhood and succeed in life without focusing on
      their deformity.

      An increasing number of outcome measure rating systems has been raised, suggesting a lack of
      consensus to a reliable, validated and reproducible scoring system for facial aesthetics in
      cleft patients. Many templates and lay panel scoring systems have been described, yet never
      fully validated. Advanced 3D imaging technologies may produce validated outcome measures in
      the future, but presently there remains a need to develop a robust method of facial aesthetic
      evaluation based on standardised patient photographs.

      The aim of the study is to to determine and compare the level of agreement among examiners'
      subjective aesthetic evaluation of full-face and nasolabial region 3-D images of CLP patients
      following primary lip repair by laypeople, developing some recommendations for a consistent
      scoring protocol.

    <description>The rating process is biphasic: firstly a 3-D model is showed to the raters, who can orientate the vultus, familiarize with the 3-D technology and have a first glance evaluation. Secondly, the judges are asked to rate each of the following patient views: right profile, left profile, frontal, neck hyperextension and hyperflexion views Two weeks after the first assessment, the same judges assessed the same number of pictures, once again in random order.</description>

        The lay panel consisted of 50 undergraduate students who had little or no training in cleft
        palate or cranio-facial treatment. All panelists were recruited from the Catholic
        University of Sacred Heart. The participation of the study is voluntary. A preliminary
        assessment of raters' knowledge has been performed through an oral examination.
