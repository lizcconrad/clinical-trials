  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many intrathoracic procedures demand optimal collapse of the operative lung to facilitate
      surgical exposure. Single-lung ventilation can be achieved using a double-lumen tube (DLT), a
      Univent tube, or an independent bronchial blocker. Insertion of a DLT using a direct
      laryngoscope can be more difficult than that of single-lumen tube (SLT), especially in
      patients for whom airway difficulty is anticipated. The safest of the proposed methods
      involves the placement of an SLT with the aid of an fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB), following
      which the SLT is replaced with a DLT using an airway exchange technique in these patients.
      HumanBroncho® (Insung Medical, Seoul, Korea) is a new silicone DLT with a soft, flexible,
      non-bevelled, wire-reinforced tip. The oval shape, obtuse angle, and short lateral internal
      diameter of the bronchial lumen and its flexibility may allow for advancement to the trachea
      over the FOB with as much as ease as a standard SLT. In the present study, the investigators
      aimed to test the hypothesis that the HumanBroncho® DLT would be non-inferior to a standard
      SLT with regard to intubation time over an FOB in patients with semi-rigid neck collar
      simulating difficult airway.
