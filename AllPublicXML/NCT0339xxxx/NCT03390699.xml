  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients after maxillecotmy develop gum disease and teeth decay often. these two diseases are
      caused by bacteria. In addition, these patients may have oral infections such as candida .
      The therapeutic approach now days to these diseases (dental decay and periodontal disease)
      can change following the results of the study.

      the purpose of the study is to examine whether the connection between the oral cavity and
      anatomical structures exposed by maxillectomy procedure causes a change in the level of
      microbes examined. To the best of our knowledge, there are not yet studies examined the
      clinical and microbiological changes in the oral cavity before and after surgery.

      This study will include 15 patients who are scheduled to undergo partial maxillectomy as part
      of a prescribed treatment program prior to their eligibility for the study. The patients will
      undergo the surgery at the Department of Otolaryngology or Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and
      will be given an obturator during surgery by a physician from the Internal and Maxillofacial
      Rehabilitation Department of the School of Dentistry .

      demographic data on the patient's age and gender, general medical history, smoking habits,
      oral and periodontal and clinical examination (presence of periodontal disease) and
      microbiological testing will be preformed.
