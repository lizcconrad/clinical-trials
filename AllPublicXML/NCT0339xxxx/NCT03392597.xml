      This research will examine if participation in a strengths-based curriculum, the Brothers as
      Allies program adapted from the Council for Boys and Young Men, reduces risk for future
      sexual violence perpetration among middle school-aged boys in New York State.

    <textblock>
      Using a longitudinal waitlist control design, this study will evaluate the efficacy of a
      strengths-based curriculum, the Brothers as Allies program from the Council for Boys and
      Young Men, to reduce risk for future sexual violence perpetration with middle school-aged
      boys (ages 12-14) in New York State. This research will examine if participation in the
      program decreases negative behaviors (such as later sexual violence perpetration and sexual
      aggression) and increases positive behaviors (such as bystander intervention and
      caring/cooperative behaviors) amongst program participants, in comparison to participants who
      participate in programming-as-usual. Other potential moderators and outcomes linked to sexual
      violence victimization and sexual assault perpetration (including attitudes related to gender
      roles, acceptance of sexual violence, and interpersonal relationships) will also be measured.
      The research team will also assess the extent to which the curriculum, when implemented with
      fidelity and quality, leads to improved relationships and stronger connections with adults in
      afterschool or other community-based youth-program settings. All participants will complete
      surveys at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention.
      Finally, the investigators will also assess the implementation factors which impact the
      efficacy of this program, such as fidelity and quality of program delivery. The research team
      hypothesizes participants in the Brothers as Allies program will show post-intervention
      decreased sexual violence perpetration, less acceptance of sexual violence, less stereotypic
      gender role attitudes, greater youth-adult connectedness, and increased bystander
      intervention, caring, and cooperation behaviors compared to peers in the non-intervention
      group. In order to complete this work, the research team is collaborating with the New York
      Rape Prevention and Education (RPE)-funded Regional Centers for Sexual Violence Prevention
      and a Research Advisory Board of community members and professionals from New York State.

    <description>Brothers as Allies is a strengths-based group approach to promote boys' and young men's safe and healthy passage through the pre-teen and adolescent years by addressing rigid beliefs and norms about masculinity that are harmful to the health, safety, relationships and opportunities of boys and young men. Groups of six to ten boys of similar age and development meet weekly with one or two facilitators for 1.5 to 2 hours for ten or more weeks. Meetings include warm up activities, an opportunity for check-in, experiential activities that address gender relevant topics (e.g., group challenges, games, skits, role plays), and a reflection and group dialogue component.</description>
