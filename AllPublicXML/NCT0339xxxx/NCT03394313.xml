  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are closely related. T2DM
      risk equivalent for CVD and it remains the major cause of death in T2DM. Thus, patients with
      T2DM and CVD disease are at very high-risk of CVD-related mortality. Therefore, more
      aggressive metabolic and hemodynamic control is required in such patients to improve the
      prognosis. We recently initiated a cardio-metabolic clinical service at the Heart Hospital,
      where T2DM patients with existing CVD are simultaneously examined by Cardiologist and
      Diabetologist for optimal metabolic and hemodynamic control. We would like to start a
      clinical registry for all patients who attend this clinical service to collect import
      clinical data about this population. This registry will serve an important source for future
      clinical research in the field.

    <textblock>
      Various investigators have shown that type 2 diabetes is associated with out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest and mortality due sudden cardiac arrest [1,2]. In comparison to non-diabetic
      patients, those with T2DM possess greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity and deaths, and
      are considerably influenced by cardiovascular disease [3]. To assess the potential benefit of
      T2DM prevention and treatment, as well as the future burden of T2DM-associated diseases can
      help in better understanding of the T2DM and the risk of chronic cardiovascular
      manifestations is warranted [4]. Herein, we would like to start a clinical registry for all
      patients who attend this clinical service to collect import clinical data about this
      population. This registry will serve an important source for scientific information that can
      be used in future to design clinical research studies for better patient care and management.

      The cardio-metabolic clinic has been recently established in the Heart Hospital to provide
      state-of-the-art care for patients with T2DM and established heart disease, e.g. ischemic
      heart disease, heart failure, etc. the health information of all patients attending the
      cardio-metabolic Clinic for the care of their disease who provide their consent for the use
      of their health information in the registry will be added to the registry.

      A data base for this registry will be created in Cerner which will be password protected.
      Clinical information about patients attending the cardiometabolic clinic in the Heart
      Hospital will be collected. Data will include demographics (age, gender, and nationality),
      vital signs (Pulse rate, blood pressure), waist circumference , Weight, Canadian
      Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Class, New York Heart Association ( NYHA) class, history of
      hospitalization for chest pain, shortness of death, Stent thrombosis, syncope or Dizzy

      Study population:

      Inclusion criteria: patients with T2DM and established heart disease, such as ischemic heart
      disease, heart failure, etc. will be included in the study after obtaining the informed
      consent.

      Exclusion criteria: Subjects who do not have T2DM and existing heart disease will be excluded
      from the registry.

      The treating physicians will enter the list of patients attended his clinic to Power Trial.
      The study investigators will update the list of the patients attended the cardio-metabolic
      clinic on daily basis and the registry will transfer the information from the Cerner to the
      registry database. The clinical service has been start from September 15, 2017, and each
      patient who attended the clinic will be added to the registry.

      This registry is prospectively collecting the information from Cerner Clinical Viewer. For
      future research the investigators who wish to utilize the registry data for their research
      will have to seek Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for their research proposal.

      Informed Consent Informed consent will be obtained from each patient who will attend the
      cardiometabolic clinic to allow us to capture his clinical information into the registry
      database.

      Subject Withdrawal/ Withdrawal of Consent If the subjects withdraw his consent, the
      information about his future follow-up visits in the clinic will not be added to the
      registry. However, previous data added to the registry will continue to be available.
