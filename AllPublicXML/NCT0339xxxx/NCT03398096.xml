  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is a noninvasive new therapeutic option in the treatment of
      chronic refractory angina pectoris. Many domestic and international researches have revealed
      that CSWT contributes to revascularization by stimulating angiogenesis. We were aimed to
      evaluate the safety and efficiency of CSWT in the treatment of refractory angina.

    <description>Ultrasound guided cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is a new treatment method offering an alternative to revascularization by stimulating angiogenesis. Subsequent clinical trials showed that CSWT could reduce symptoms of myocardial ischemia and improve cardiac function in patients with severe coronary artery disease.</description>
