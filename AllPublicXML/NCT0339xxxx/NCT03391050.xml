    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of a combined
      APR-246 and dabrafenib therapy regimen in patients with BRAFV600 mutant unresectable and/or
      metastatic cutaneous melanoma resistant to the dabrafenib/trametinib combination. In
      addition, the study aims to assess the safety profile of the combined APR-246 and dabrafenib
      therapy regimen, to explore potential biomarkers, and to further describe the anti-tumour
      activity of the combination of APR-246 and dabrafenib. The trial will enroll up to 31
      evaluable patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable and/or metastatic
             malignant cutaneous melanoma, as determined locally by a validated test and treated
             with dabrafenib/trametinib first line combination therapy or second line after first
             line immunotherapy.

          -  Patients that have progressed according to RECIST 1.1 after at least 4 weeks of
             treatment with dabrafenib/trametinib and remained on dabrafenib full dose (150mg bid)
             treatment for the study.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. For phase II only, metabolic
             measurable disease (according to PERCIST).

          -  Availability of tissue from a metastatic lesion. A new biopsy is required unless

             of this study and at least six months after the last administration of the study

             potential.

          -  Adequate organ system function.

          -  Signed informed consent before any study specific procedure and/or treatment happens.

          -  History of familial long QT, serious ventricular arrhythmia (no VT &gt; 130 bpm and &gt; 5
             extra beats per minute), no QTc ≥ 480 msec calculated from a single ECG reading or a
             mean of 3 ECG readings using Fridericia's correction (QTcF = QT/RR0.33) or bradycardia
             (&lt; 45 bpm).

          -  Untreated or symptomatic brain metastasis, leptomeningeal disease or spinal cord
             compression. Patients who are on a stable dose of corticosteroids &gt; 1 month or off

          -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina), coronary angioplasty,
             or stenting, or thrombo-embolic event within the past 24 weeks from signature of ICF.

          -  Class II, III, or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
