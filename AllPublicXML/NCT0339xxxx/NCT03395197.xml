    <textblock>
      This study compares rPFS in men with DDR deficiency(ies) mCRPC treated with talazoparib plus
      enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide after confirmation of the starting dose of talazoparib in
      combination with enzalutamide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 is an open-label, non-randomized, safety and PK run-in study designed to confirm the
      starting dose of talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide through assessment of target
      safety events and PK at select sites. Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multinational study comparing talazoparib plus enzalutamide vs. placebo
      plus enzalutamide in patients with DNA damage repair-deficient mCRPC.
