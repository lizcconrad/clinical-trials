    <textblock>
      Probiotics, which are part of the human body, are microorganisms, which are known to have
      beneficial effects when consumed in a certain amount, and have the function of controlling
      intestinal flora and inhibiting inflammation. Recently, probiotics have received much
      attention in the treatment of hypersensitivity syndrome. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effect of probiotic strains, ID-JPL934, in the diagnosis of irritable bowel
      syndrome.

      Overall satisfaction with improvement of bowel habits such as diarrhea and constipation as
      well as abdominal discomfort and abdominal discomfort in the group receiving ID-JPL934
      capsules (test food group or test group) and control group (control food group or control
      group) (0-10 point visual analogue scale) for each symptom before and after ingestion to
      evaluate the degree of improvement of the symptoms. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the relationship between bacterial composition changes in the stool and the
      improvement of symptoms in the patients before and after ingestion.
