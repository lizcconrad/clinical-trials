  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this imaging study is to evaluate and improve the treatment planning techniques
      for abdominal radiation therapy. To accurately treat a tumor with radiation, Computed
      Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are used to distinguish a tumor from
      normal, healthy tissue. However the quality of these images can be distorted by motion from
      breathing. To decrease motion, a patient may be asked to hold their breath or compress the
      abdomen, but currently there is no standard or best management option for all patients.

      This study will explore the use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a pressurized
      breathing mask, during MRI or CT imaging to decrease motion in the abdomen and produce higher
      quality images. With these additional images, we will also explore the feasibility of
      creating treatment plans using the CPAP MRI images alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have liver or pancreas tumors (either primary tumors or metastases) and are
             scheduled to be treated with radiotherapy (either 3D conformal or intensity-modulation
             radiotherapy (IMRT) with conventional or hypo- fractionation).

          -  KPS &gt; 70

          -  If a biopsy is performed, the patient is at least 1 week post-biopsy.

          -  The patient's age must exceed 18 years.

          -  The patients must be able to commit to T1-weighted, T2-weighted, Dixon fat and water,
             ultrashort-TE, and other clinical or research MR sequence images prior to treatment.

          -  CPAP Eligibility: CPAP is a safe, effective form of therapy with rare complications.
             Relative contraindications include patients with bullous lung disease, fibrotic lung
             disease, Claustrophobia and recurrent sinus or ear infections. The absolute
             contraindications include obtundation /unconsciousness, chest wall trauma, suspected
             pneumothorax, persistent nausea/vomiting, active upper GI bleeding, history of recent
             gastric surgery, facial anomalies/trauma [15,16]. If there is any question about the
             above history and medical problems, the subject will be referred to a pulmonologist
             for consultation.

          -  The patients with above contraindications are not CPAP eligible and are enrolled in
             Arm 1 for the protocol without CPAP

          -  The eligible patients are enrolled in Arm 2 for the protocol with CPAP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition, which would make the imaging studies unsafe or poorly tolerated

          -  Known allergic reaction to contrast or shellfish

          -  Implanted metal devices or foreign bodies that serve as a contraindication to MR
             imaging

          -  Creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dl and Creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mg/dl.

          -  Uncontrolled, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias

          -  Severe claustrophobia

          -  Pregnant female

          -  KPS &lt;70
