  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prototype rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to simultaneously screen for gambiense human African
      trypanosomiasis (HAT) and diagnose P. falciparum malaria (the &quot;HAT/malaria combo&quot;) has
      recently been developed. The performance of this prototype has been evaluated in a
      retrospective study that showed that its diagnostic performance for HAT and malaria was
      equivalent to the performance of the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 and the SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f
      tests, respectively.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the performance of the test in
      settings where P. falciparum malaria is endemic, and which are either endemic or non-endemic
      for HAT. This will enable the assessment of the suitability of the HAT/malaria combo RDT as a
      diagnostic test for malaria, and a screening test for HAT in pre-elimination and
      post-elimination contexts, respectively.
