    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to assesses the benefit of adding pulsed shortwave therapy to
      the postoperative pain and recovery protocol following total knee replacement. Pulsed
      shortwave therapy is a safe adjunct pain therapy for acute and chronic pain.

      Despite the recent advances in the understanding of pain mechanisms and the introduction of
      new drugs and new techniques in the postoperative management, pain after total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) is still an unresolved issue. It affects the quality of life and
      rehabilitation of an important percentage of patients undergoing TKA. A recent study looked
      at the percentage of patients with chronic knee pain after knee replacement at a minimum of
      one year following surgery in 272 patients, 107 patients (nearly 40%) reported that they
      still had persistent pain at one-plus year following surgery. Central sensitization is now
      well established as an integral factor in many chronic pain states, including the commonly
      occurring knee and back pain. Many patients undergoing TKA are likely to have a significant
      degree of Central Sensitization, therefore the likely hood of high pain levels postoperative
      and persistent long standing pain after TKA is increased in this patient population.

    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in pain levels over 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) has been used extensively for rating pain intensity in previous studies. Postoperative pain at 2, 6, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 64, and 72 hours after surgery will be recorded using a 10-cm horizontal line with 1-cm vertical lines at each end labeled &quot;no pain&quot; (left side) and &quot;worst possible pain&quot; (right side). VAS scores will also be recorded also at day 4, 7, 14 and 28 and finally at three months. Different time point assessments are being conducted to look at the change in pain level from baseline through recovery.</description>

    <measure>The Oxford Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a 12-item patient-reported PRO specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery (arthroplasty). It is short, reproducible, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a knee-specific instrument, developed to assess the patients' opinion about their knee and associated problems. The KOOS evaluates both short-term and long-term consequences of knee injury. It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Pressure Threshold, is used routinely in clinical practice to assess pain sensitivity from musculoskeletal pain to indicate the level of pain sensitivity in individuals to central sensitization of the nervous system. Testing will occur locally above the effected knee as well as peripherally on the distal interphalangeal joint.</description>

    <measure>Active Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Active range of motion (A-ROM) is an important component of the assessment of total knee replacement (TKR) outcome. The goal of knee replacement recovery is to achieve flexion of 135 degrees. Range of motion will be measured by observational method by two separate individuals.</description>
