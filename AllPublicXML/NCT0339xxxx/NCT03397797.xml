  <brief_summary>

      Investigators assess and compare postoperative sore throat and hoarseness in the group using
      the muscle relaxant and not using it during the operation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The muscle relaxant is usually used during the operation to maintain moderate relaxation but,
      it can't be used in the surgery to need eletrophysiological monitoring during the operation.
      In this sturdy, the investigators assess the postoperative sore throat and hoarseness and
      compare the effect of muscle relaxant in the group using the muscle relaxant and not using it
      in terms of the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness.
