  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims:

        1. To elucidate the biological mechanism that leads to pulmonary and nutritional
           improvement in CF patients following treatment with ivacaftor using advanced techniques
           to assess changes of the pulmonary and nutritional status

        2. To examine the relation between the individual response to ivacaftor and the presence of
           modifier genes associated with CF disease severity,

        3. To assess altered CFTR function using new available in vivo tests,

        4. To validate newly developed in vivo sweat tests with well established functional tests,

        5. To establish correlation between the CFTR response to Vx-770 measured in a new ex vivo
           method (organoids) and the actual clinical and/or functional response in individual
           patients,

        6. To examine response in other CF-specific features such as aqua wrinkling.

        7. To examine if sleep/activity level changes.

        8. To establish a biorepository to enable further investigations.
