      Eligible subjects will be assigned to study treatment arms by their treating oncologist,
      rather than by the study. The drug, dose, and schedule of administration will be determined
      by the treating physician per NCCN guidelines for standard of care chemotherapy regimens for
      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Study treatment arms include: Taxane (nab-paclitaxel
      or paclitaxel), Eribulin, Vinorelbine, Ixabepilone, or the control arm (non-microtubule
      targeted chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, carboplatin, or gemcitabine).

      During the screening visit, the following will be taken: medical history; physical exam; ECOG
      performance status; a pregnancy test if indicated per physician (confirmation of the clinical
      testing result or assessment of the treating physician whether or not the subject is capable
      of pregnancy); AST, ALT, CBC (per oncologist); 15 mL blood sample for drug level assessment;
      15 mL blood sample for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); follow up assessments of cancer; RECIST
      1.1 response measurements; and an archived FFPE sample (8 slides) will be obtained.

      While enrolled on study, subjects will have the following procedures:

        -  15 mL blood sample for drug level assessment on C1D2

        -  15 mL blood sample for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) on C1D2 and at progression or end
           of study for a total of 30 mL

        -  Adverse events related to study procedures (research biopsy &amp; blood draws) will be
           assessed on C1D2 and at progression or end of study

        -  Toxicity evaluations will occur throughout the study per the treating MD

        -  Follow-up assessments of cancer will occur throughout the study per the treating MD

        -  RECIST 1.1 response measurements will be taken at standard of care imaging

        -  Fresh biopsy or tumor sampling (4 cores) for analysis of intratumoral drug levels and
           biomarkers including: markers of proliferation (mitotic index), aneuploidy, and
           sequencing analysis (ctDNA) on C1D2.

      The tests being performed on the samples as part of this study are not investigational.

      Subjects will be followed with imaging scans and tumor markers as deemed appropriate by the
      treating physician. Follow-up scans will be recommended every ~3 cycles as per standard of
      care. Subjects will be followed for the duration of treatment initiated while taking part in
      this study. Follow-up will discontinue either 2 months following completion of planned breast
      cancer treatment or upon the systemic imaging following therapy completion (whichever is
      later).

    <description>Advanced breast tumors safely sampled and analyzed from 35 subjects.
In order to successfully test the hypothesis that chromosomal instability in part governs the effect of antimitotic therapies, advanced breast tumors samples must be collected, preserved, and analyzed at 20+/- 2 hours after chemotherapy in order to characterize the effect of the drug on the tumor. A primary question becomes is this process safe and feasible within these time constraints in our clinical setting.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women with histologically or cytologically demonstrated breast cancer that is
             deemed metastatic or incurable by the treating physician.

          -  It is medically appropriate to treat the patient with an antimitotic agent or an
             intravenous control chemotherapeutic agent by IV infusion at standard doses as per the
             treating physician. Please see NCCN guidelines for standard of care, p58 for standard
             chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer7.

          -  The patient has measureable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1.

          -  Archived tissue is available from either primary, metastatic site or both.

          -  It is safe and feasible to obtain a research tumor biopsy on cycle 1 day 2 with a
             biopsy of an accessible lesion such as liver, lung, lymph node, skin, breast, or bone.

          -  All pre-chemotherapy test results (tests per treating oncologist discretion) have been
             reviewed and deemed appropriate for planned chemotherapy by the patient's treating
             oncologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HER2+ breast cancer by standard criteria.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because systemic chemotherapy may cause
             deleterious effects to the fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with systemic
             chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled in the
             trial.

          -  Planned treatment with hormonal therapy, or targeted oral therapy during trial
             enrollment.
