  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in investigating whether transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS0 over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can alter behaviour and
      neural activity in subclinical depression. tDCS is a neuromodulation technique that uses weak
      electrical current to increase (anodal stimulation) or decrease (cathodal stimulation) the
      probability of brain activity in the stimulated region. A growing body of evidence indicates
      that repeated administration of prefrontal tDCS can ameliorate symptoms of depression. A main
      characteristic of depression is that patients show a bias towards processing negative
      relative to positive information. Previously, we have demonstrated that a single session of
      prefrontal tDCS was associated with an increased learning rate for positive information in
      healthy adults. Here, the researchers will examine whether similar behavioural effects are
      found in individuals with subclinical depression when applying prefrontal tDCS. In addition,
      investigators will use neuroimaging measures to investigate how tDCS affects neural activity
      during a reward-learning task. The findings of the study will contribute to the understanding
      of the cognitive and neural effects of prefrontal tDCS in subclinical depression. It is
      predicted that tDCS will increase learning rates for positive information by altering
      activity in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. The ultimate aim, to be
      explored through further studies, is to understand and improve how tDCS might be used in the
      treatment of depressive disorders.

    <textblock>
      Depression is a psychiatric illness characterised by a persistent bias towards processing
      negative information. In a proof-of-concept study, the researchers demonstrated that
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) increased learning rates for positive outcomes
      in an information bias task in healthy adults. Here, the investigators aim to investigate
      whether these findings of enhanced reward learning with tDCS extend to individuals with
      subclinical depression. If changes in reward learning are found in this population, the
      researchers will then investigate effects of tDCS on underlying neural processes associated
      with the behavioural changes using MRI scanning. The study involves online screening, a
      face-to-face screening session, two tDCS sessions, and potential MRI scanning sessions.

      Screening: Participants will be asked to fill out a pre-screening online depression
      questionnaire (BDI) and will be asked questions regarding potential contraindications for
      tDCS/MRI. Participants with a BDI score of â‰¥10 are invited to a 1-hour screening session.
      Here, the participant will go through the procedures of the study with the researcher and
      will be asked to provide written informed consent. Subsequently, the SCID will be
      administered and tDCS/MRI screening forms to assess contraindications to brain stimulation
      and brain imaging will be completed by the researcher. If there are no contraindications to
      tDCS/MRI and no indications of current or history of psychological disorders, the researcher
      will schedule two tDCS testing sessions.

      Testing sessions: Participants will be asked to fill out mood and anxiety questionnaires
      before and after the tDCS procedure. The researcher will explain the computerised task, and
      the participant will get the opportunity to practice the task. The researcher will then set
      up the tDCS equipment with the anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and
      the cathode over the right DLPFC. The researcher will briefly test the tDCS to ensure that
      the participant is comfortable with the stimulation. The participant will perform one block
      of the task without tDCS, followed by 20 minutes of tDCS at 2 mA while performing the
      decision-making task. Finally, the participant will be asked to perform additional task
      blocks without tDCS to investigate after-effects of the stimulation. If findings from these
      sessions indicate that tDCS can modulate reward learning in individuals with subclinical
      depression, participants will then be invited to take part in two additional MRI scanning
      sessions. If the findings indicate that tDCS can modulate reward learning in this population,
      participants will be invited to take part in two additional MRI scanning sessions.

      Scanning sessions: Participant will be familiarised with the MRI environment and will be
      given the opportunity to practice the computerised task. Then, participants will be asked to
      fill out mood and anxiety questionnaires. The researcher will set up the tDCS equipment. The
      participant will enter the MRI scanner and will perform one block of the practiced task.
      Subsequently, tDCS will be applied for 20 minutes whilst participants perform additional
      blocks of the decision-making task in the scanner. In one of the sessions, participants will
      receive active tDCS, whereas in the other session they will receive sham tDCS. Following the
      stimulation, the participant may be asked to complete another block of the decision-making
      task in the scanner. In addition, the participant will undergo DTI and spectroscopy scans.
      After scanning, the participant will again be asked to complete the mood and anxiety
      questionnaires. Furthermore, they may be asked to perform an emotional processing task of
      face recognition.
