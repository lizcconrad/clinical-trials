  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is beneficial to both mother and baby. However, many breastfeeding women are
      affected by long-term health conditions and need to take medications. Sometimes, concerns
      about transfer of drugs to infants via breast milk lead the mothers to either avoid
      breastfeeding or stop their medication.

      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic condition that is marked by an abnormal
      response of the body's immune system, and high levels of certain proteins that cause
      inflammation (Cytokines like Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha or TNFα). A group of drugs called
      &quot;biologics&quot; target and stop these proteins from causing inflammation, and have been
      successfully used to treat this condition. Inflammatory proteins may be present in breast
      milk of healthy women in variable levels, and may play a role in development of infant's
      brain and immune system.

      This study is being conducted to investigate:

        -  Concentration of some of the inflammatory proteins in breast milk of mothers with IBD
           and healthy controls

        -  Interaction between these proteins and biologics in breast milk of women with IBD

        -  Potential role of these proteins (and their interaction with biologics) on development
           of infant learning and memory function It has been presumed that concentrations of TNFα
           and some other cytokines are higher in breast milk of women with IBD, and the biologics
           can normalize these high levels.

      The study consists of four study visits: a) two home visits in the first 6 months postpartum
      to complete a questionnaire and collect a small sample of breast milk at each visit and b)
      two visits at the Hospital for Sick children for evaluation of learning and memory function
      of the infant at the ages of 12 and 18 months.

      The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) shows the highest incidence among people of childbearing
      age. Indeed, it is not uncommon that pregnant or lactating women with IBD require drug
      therapy, including monoclonal antibodies against Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα). However,
      these patients face challenges, because information on pregnancy and breastfeeding safety of
      these new medications is lacking due to exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from
      drug development processes. Whereas the data necessary for fetal safety assessment is
      accumulating gradually, significant gaps in the research efforts and the understanding on
      excretion of TNFα inhibitors into milk remain. Experts generally consider it acceptable to
      use the TNFα inhibitors during breastfeeding, because the previous studies found relatively
      low levels of these drugs in milk. However, the existing data on milk levels of these drugs
      are highly inconsistent, probably because previous reports gave no consideration to potential
      interference from high levels of endogenous TNFα in milk. As a result, a comprehensive
      picture of TNFα inhibitors in breast milk remains obscure. Moreover, in a recent mouse study,
      transfer of TNFα-dependent chemokines through milk has been shown to play a role in shaping
      the postnatal programming of brain development, implying that altered disposition of
      endogenous TNFα and other chemokines in milk during anti-TNFα therapy has an impact on brain
      development of the offspring.

      This is an observational cohort study with comparison group, which describes the first step
      to address the issue by uncovering the TNFα-dependent 'lactocrine' pathway and disposition of
      TNFα inhibitors in milk. The study will also investigate the pharmacokinetics of TNFα
      inhibitors in breast milk (as a sub-study), using the population pharmacokinetic (popPK)
      approach.
