    <textblock>
      Patients with Multiple Myeloma who are considered for high-dose therapy and autologous
      transplantation at the bone marrow transplant clinic at the Wilmot Cancer Institute (WCI)
      will be be approached to participate in this trial. Eligible patients who choose to
      participate will be randomized so that half receive one hyperbaric oxygen therapy session
      prior to hematopoetic stem cell infusion and half will not. All subjects will have their
      blood counts monitored closely and time to count recovery will be compared between the two
      groups.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent.

          -  Multiple myeloma diagnosis applying the latest criteria by International Working
             Group. Patients should have received myeloma-directed induction therapy with
             appropriate response (partial response or better) in newly diagnosed myeloma patients.
             Multiple myeloma patients who relapse following induction therapy or following prior
             autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant are also eligible as far as remission
             following their first autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant lasted 12 months
             or more.

          -  Patients who are considered for high-dose therapy and autologous transplantation at
             the bone marrow transplant clinic at Wilmot Cancer Institute will be screened for
             eligibility to enroll in this study and if eligible will be approached to participate.
             Eligible patients will have the chance to tour the hyperbaric oxygen facility prior to
             signing the consent form.
