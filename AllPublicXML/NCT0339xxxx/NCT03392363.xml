  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the efficacy of the ResAppDx software
      application in the diagnosis of childhood acute respiratory disease, including pneumonia,
      bronchiolitis, asthma/reactive airways disease, croup, lower respiratory tract disease
      (LRTD), viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI), and upper respiratory tract disease
      (URTD).
