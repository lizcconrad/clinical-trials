          3. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤ 9.5%.

          4. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL.

          5. No clinically significant abnormality in the ECG at screening.

          6. Fasting plasma glucose levels less than 140 mg/dL at screening.

          7. The patient should be ready to give a written and signed informed consent before

             complications following diabetes).

               1. History of ≥2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia within 6 months before screening or
                  history of hypoglycemia unawareness as judged by the investigator.

               2. History of ≥1 episodes of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or emergency room
                  visits for uncontrolled diabetes leading to hospitalization in the 6 months prior

               3. Impaired hepatic function at screening [alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) value &gt;2 times the upper limit of the reference range
                  and/or serum bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of the reference range] which
                  investigator considers clinically significant.

               4. Evidence of clinically significant chronic renal disease (e.g. nephrotic
                  syndrome, diabetic nephropathy) as assessed by the investigator at screening

          4. History or use of the following:

               1. Patients on OADs other than metformin for previous three months prior to
                  screening.

               2. Patients who have received ≥14 consecutive days of oral, intravenous, or inhaled
                  glucocorticoid therapy within the past 1 year or have received steroids by any
                  route within 4 weeks immediately preceding screening visit (intra-nasal, intra
                  ocular, and topical steroid use is allowed).

          5. Receipt of another investigational drug in the 4 weeks prior to screening, or within 5
             half-lives of the another investigational drug at screening visit (whichever is
             longer), or scheduled for another investigational drug during the current study
             period.
