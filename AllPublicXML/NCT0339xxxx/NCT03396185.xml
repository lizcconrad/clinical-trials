  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the relapse free survival of patients who have
      EGFR-mutant stage IIIA-IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and receive Icotinib as consolidation
      therapy after synchronous or sequential chemoradiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open label and prospective clinical study. Patients who
      have EGFR-mutant stage IIIA-IIIB and unresectable lung adenocarcinoma will receive Icotinib
      as consolidation therapy after synchronous or sequential chemoradiotherapy. The primary
      objective of this study is relapse free survival. The secondary objectives are overall
      survival, the frequency of adverse events and patients' quality of life.
