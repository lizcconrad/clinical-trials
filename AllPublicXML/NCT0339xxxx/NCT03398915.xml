      In a multinational prospective registry, preoperative, intraoperative, perioperative and
      follow-up data on patients receiving thoracolumbar pedicle screw placement for degenerative
      disease or infections or tumors will be collected. The three arms consist of robot-guided
      (RG), navigated (NV), or freehand (FH) screw insertion.

      Introduction A decade ago, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) was considered a promising
      development in spine surgery, yet the value of the pioneering technologies was questionable.
      With the growing number of experienced MIS surgeons, the influx of evidence in favour of MIS
      is rapidly increasing. This makes a compelling argument towards MIS offering distinct
      clinical benefits over open approaches in terms of blood loss, length of stay,
      rehabilitation, cost-effectiveness and perioperative patient comfort1. Due to the limited or
      inexistent line-of-sight in MIS procedures, surgeons need to rely on imaging, navigation, and
      guidance technologies to operate in a safe and efficient manner. Therefore, a plethora of new
      and ever improving navigational systems have been developed. These systems allow a consistent
      level of safety and accuracy, on par with results achieved by very experienced free hand
      surgeons, with a reasonably short learning curve2-4. Computer-based navigation systems were
      first introduced to spine surgery in 1995 and while they have been long established as
      standards in certain cranial procedures, they have not been similarly adopted in spine
      surgery.

      Designed to overcome some of the limitations of navigation-based technologies, robot-guided
      surgery has become commercially available to surgeons worldwide, like SpineAssist® (Mazor
      Robotics Ltd. Caesarea, Israel) and the recently launched ROSA™ Spine (Zimmer-Biomet, Warsaw,
      Indiana, USA). These systems are rapidly challenging the gold standards. SpineAssist®, and
      its upgraded version, the Renaissance®, provides a stable drilling platform and restricts the
      surgeon's natural full range of motion to 2 degrees of freedom (up/down motion and yaw in the
      cannula). The system's guidance unit moves into the trajectory based on exact preoperative
      planning of pedicle screws, while accounting for changes in intervertebral relationships such
      as due to distraction, cage insertion or changes between the supine patient position in the
      preoperative CT and the prone patient on the operating table. Published evidence on
      robot-guided screw placement has demonstrated high levels of accuracy with most reports
      ranging around 98% of screws placed within the pedicle or with a cortical encroachment of
      less than 2 mm.4 Although the reliability and accuracy of robot-guided spine surgery have
      been established, the actual benefits for the patient in terms of clinical outcomes and
      revision surgeries remain unknown. We have recently conducted cohort studies that showed some
      evidence that robotic guidance lowers the rate of intraoperative screw revisions and implant
      related reoperations compared to free hand procedures, while achieving comparable clinical
      outcomes.5-7 We now want to assess these factors, among others, on a higher level of
      evidence. We aim to conduct a prospective, multicenter, multinational controlled trial
      comparing clinical and patient reported outcomes of robotic guided (RG) pedicle screw
      placement vs. navigated (NV) vs. free hand (FH) pedicle screw placement using pooled data
      from three centers.

      Methods Overview The index variable will be the method of pedicle screw insertion. Patients
      will receive either robot-guided pedicle screw fixation (Mazor Robotics SpineAssist and
      Renaissance), navigated pedicle screw fixation (either CT-, O-Arm or Iso3DFL-based), or
      conventional freehand pedicle screw fixation.

      Study Design This will be a prospective observational study with pooled data from 3 centers
      and 3 arms (RG, NV, FH). Data will be prospectively collected. In addition, a separate
      analysis will be performed with already prospectively collected data that is applicable to
      this protocol. An intermediate analysis will be performed after 75 patients have been
      enrolled in all 3 groups.

      Sample Size Analysis

      - Using the primary endpoint (overall rate of screw revisions (intraoperative screw revisions
      + revision surgery for screw malposition)) and previously published data from a review of the
      literature5, it was determined that, in order to detect an intergroup difference of 5%, 205
      patients are required per group to achieve a power of 1-beta = 0.8 with a ChiSquare test at p
      = 0.05.

      Patients Inclusion Criteria

        -  Informed consent

        -  Thoracolumbar pedicle screw placement

        -  Indication for surgery: Degenerative pathologies (stenosis, spondylolisthesis,
           degenerative disc disease, recurrent disc herniation), infections, tumors, fractures,
           trauma

        -  Age ≥ 18

      Exclusion Criteria - Deformity surgery (&gt;5 index levels)

      Patients will be thoroughly informed about the techniques, risks and backgrounds of the
      pertaining procedure.

      This is a prospective study. Analysis will occur on a per protocol basis. To provide optimal
      treatment quality, the procedures will be carried out surgeon-based: This means that surgeons
      who are most experienced in using robotic guidance will carry out all RG procedures and
      surgeons most experienced in using the free hand technique will carry out all FH procedures,
      etc.

      Data Management Each participating center will maintain a proprietary database, with
      identical structure. The databases should be kept anonymous, with each center maintaining its
      own, separate key that links study-specific patient numbers to birthdate and name.

      Twice yearly (1. December and 1. July), the anonymous databases will be sent to the principal
      investigator and stored safely.

      Follow-Up Baseline data will be collected at the patients first visit. Perioperative data
      will also be entered. Patients will be followed up after 6 weeks, 1 year and 2 years at a
      follow-up visit or by use of mailed questionnaires.

      Data Collection

      Primary Endpoint:

      - Overall rate of screw revisions (intraoperative screw revisions + revision surgery for
      screw malposition)

      The following data will be entered into the database perioperatively:

        -  Pedicle screw insertion method (RG vs NV vs FH)

        -  MIS or Open Surgery?

        -  Duration of Surgery (min.)

        -  Length of Stay (d.)

        -  Radiation Dose as DAP (cGy cm2)

        -  Estimated Blood Loss (ml)

        -  Need for blood transfusion

        -  Intraoperative Complications

        -  Postoperative Complications

        -  Intraoperative pedicle screw revisions

        -  Type of work (employed/self-employed/housework/student/retired/unemployed)

      The following variables will be assessed at baseline, and at 6 weeks, 12 months and 24 months
      follow up:

        -  Frequency of use of analgetics (daily/weekly/not regularly)

        -  Satisfaction with symptoms (satisfied/neutral/dissatisfied)

        -  Smoking status (active/ceased/never)

        -  Working status (able to work/unable to work)

        -  EQ-5D-3L8

        -  VAS back pain severity

        -  VAS leg pain severity

        -  Oswestry Disability Index9

      In addition, only at follow-up visits:

        -  Return to work (weeks/not)

        -  Any reoperations

      Statistics Categorical data are reported as numbers and percentages, and continuous data as
      mean ± standard deviation. Depending on the type of data, intergroup comparisons will be
      performed using ChiSquare tests, ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis H tests, and subsequent independent
      t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests with a Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple testing. The
      Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) will be defined as a ≥30 % improvement in the
      respective score.10 Longitudinal data will be assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
      All analyses will be performed blinded to group assignment using version 3.4.2 of R.11 A
      two-tailed p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
