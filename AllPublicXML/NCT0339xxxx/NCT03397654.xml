    <textblock>
      Open label, single arm, multi-centre study of pembrolizumab following trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE). Twenty-six to 32 evaluable participants with primary liver cancer
      (hepatocellular cancer; HCC) will be assessed. The primary objective is to determine the
      safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab following TACE. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab following TACE by improving progression-free survival
      rates as measured by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (mRECIST)
      criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          2. Be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Be willing to provide tissue from an excisional biopsy of a tumour lesion.

          4. Have at least one uni-dimensional lesion measurable by Computed Tomography (CT)-scan
             or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based on mRECIST criteria.

          5. Be ineligible for surgical resection or liver transplantation.

          6. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale

          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function

          8. Have an overall Child-Pugh score &lt;7

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
             pregnancy test will be required.

         10. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of
             contraception as outlined in Section 6.9.2 for the course of the study through 120
             days after the last dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). Note: Abstinence
             is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the
             subject.

         11. Sexually active males must agree to use an adequate method of contraception as
             outlined in Section 6.9.2 starting with the first dose of IMP through 120 days after
             the last dose of study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual
             lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has extrahepatic metastasis.

          2. Prior TACE or systemic anticancer treatment for HCC.

          3. Has any contraindication for TACE including portosystemic shunt, hepatofugal blood

          7. Has documented occlusion of the hepatic artery or the main portal vein (segmental
             portal vein thrombosis does not represent exclusion criterion provided this does not
             contraindicate TACE).

          8. Is currently participating and receiving therapy or has participated or is
             participating in a study of an IMP or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of
             the first dose of IMP.

          9. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy.

         10. Has a known history of active Bacillus Tuberculosis (TB)

         11. Hypersensitivity to Pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

         12. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

         13. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         14. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

         15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Exceptions relating to Hepatitis B
             and C virus infection are documented in Section 5.3.1, Table 5.

         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Principal Investigator
             (PI).

         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through to 120 days

         20. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV; HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         21. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of first dose of IMP administration. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-MistÂ®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
