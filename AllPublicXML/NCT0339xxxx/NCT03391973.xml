      This is a multi-centre, single arm phase 2 study of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda™ or MK-3475) in
      treatment naïve patients with poor prognosis carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP).
      Participants will receive Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each 3-week
      cycle for up to 24 months. Patients will be evaluated for response every 9 weeks. Patients
      with objective response to treatment and those with stable disease will continue to receive
      Pembrolizumab. Patients with tumor progression will be discontinued from the study. Patients
      with progressive disease (PD), but showing a clinical benefit, may continue on Pembrolizumab,
      as per the discretion of the responsible Qualified Investigator. Response will be evaluated
      as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1

          1. Have histologically (or cytologically) documented, metastatic carcinoma with no
             primary site identified. The following tests are required to exclude a primary site of
             disease: complete history and physical examination, blood chemistry (including serum
             tumor marker for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),
             β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)) and mammography in women, urinalysis, thoracic
             and abdominopelvic computed tomography scans, bone scan, and symptom or sign-oriented
             imaging or endoscopic studies).

          2. Have adenocarcinoma, a poorly differentiated carcinoma, or any squamous cell
             carcinomas.

          3. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for this trial.

          4. Be ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          6. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42
             calendar days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom
             newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety
             concern) may submit an archived Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Block(s).

          7. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          8. Must have a documented negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to
             receiving the first dose of study medication if female and of childbearing potential.
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test is required.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity from the time
             they sign the informed consent form prior to start of therapy through 120 calendar
             days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are
             defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from
             menses for &gt; 1 year.

         10. Male subjects must agree to use 2 adequate methods of contraception from the time they
             sign the informed consent form prior to start of therapy through 120 calendar days
             after the last dose of study therapy. Examples include: condoms, spermicidal jelly,
             and abstinence.

         11. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1 below. All screening labs
             must be performed within 7 calendar days of treatment initiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CUP suspected to be lymphomas (e.g. staining for leukocyte common antigen), malignant
             melanoma (e.g. staining for both S100 and HMB45), extragonadal germ cell neoplasms
             (e.g. staining for both AFP and β-hCG), sarcomas (e.g. staining for cytokeratins and
             vimentin), neuroendocrine tumors (e.g. staining for chromogranin and synaptophysin),
             and prostatic adenocarcinomas in men (e.g. staining for PSA).

          2. Patient subgroups that are suitable for well-defined treatments: (e.g. women with
             adenocarcinoma involving axillary lymph nodes as the only site of disease, women with
             papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, patients with squamous cell carcinoma
             that involved either cervical or inguinal lymph nodes only, patients with poorly
             differentiated carcinomas that suggested germinal tumors and with elevated levels of
             β-hCG and/or AFP, and patients with carcinoma that involved a single, potentially
             resectable site) also are excluded from enrollment.

          3. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          4. Has a confirmed diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving documented systemic
             steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 calendar days
             prior to the first dose of Pembrolizumab confirmed via study registration form.

             per the discretion of the Qualified Investigator.

          8. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or prior anti-cancer mAb.

          9. If subject has undergone major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             complications from the surgery prior to starting therapy as per the discretion of the
             Qualified Investigator.

         10. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

         11. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by CT brain or MRI brain for at least
             four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are
             not using steroids for at least 7 calendar days prior to trial treatment. This

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         13. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis or current pneumonitis.

         14. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         15. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Qualified Investigator.

         16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             compliance with the requirements of the trial.

         17. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 calendar days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         18. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         19. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

         20. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA is
             detected).

         21. Has received a live vaccine within 30 calendar days of planned start of study therapy.
