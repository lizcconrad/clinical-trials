    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy(SBRT) for spinal metastases has been proved a good
      results in pain relieve and local control, However,the longterm of efficacy and safety of
      this regimen is unclear.The purpose of the study is to evaluate the longterm outcome of this
      therapeutic regimen in selective patients who will be survival more than 2 years.

    <textblock>
      Recently,Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy(SBRT) become an alternative regimen for spinal
      metastases due to it's high dose cover the metastatic lesion and low dose in the adjacent
      spinal cord which result in more efficacy and less toxicity. However,the longterm of efficacy
      and safety of this regimen is unclear because of shortly median survival among unselective
      spinal metastases.To our knowledge,the median survival of some favorite metastatic diseases
      will be more than two years if they received appropriate system therapy.these include
      hormones dependent brest cancer/prostate cancer,and EGFR mutation non-small cell lung
      cancer(NSCLC) ect.The purpose of the study is to evaluate the longterm outcome of this
      therapeutic regimen in selective patients who will be survival more than 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. WHO scores 0-2;

          2. The primary lesion was confirmed by pathology or cytology;

          3. The metastatic lesions were diagnosed by imaging(CT,MRI,PET-CT,ECT),or the lesions

          5. The baseline pain score was ≥5(NRPS) and the use of analgesic drugs was recorded;

          6. The enhanced MRI scan of involved vertebral bodies was required in the 2 weeks before
             radiotherapy;
