  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TNF inhibitors have improved treatment options for patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) and three TNF inhibitors, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab are available for
      treatment of ulcerative colitis in Switzerland. However, these drugs have been tested under
      ideal conditions in randomized controlled trials. Real-world data are needed to complement
      this information. It is the aim of our study to test, whether patients with ulcerative
      colitis can be effectively treated with golimumab in a real world setting in Switzerland.

      The investigators will use data from the Swiss IBD cohort study (SIBDC) in Switzerland. They
      will identify all SIBDC patients with UC treated with Golimumab and perform a retrospective
      chart review. The investigators will acquire patient reported outcomes and objective measures
      for inflammation at baseline, at 6-10 weeks and at 6 and 12 months after golimumab treatment.
      Primary endpoint will be clinical response (i.e. meaningful improvement) at 6-10 weeks.
      Secondary endpoints will be clinical response at 6 and 12 months and clinical remission (i.e.
      free of symptoms of disease).

      Ulcerative colitis patients from the Swiss IBD cohort study treated with golimumab will be
      identified. The investigators will perform a retrospective chart review and assess patient
      reported outcomes and objective measures of inflammation to assess response and remission.

      As clinical response in UC the investigators will define a composite end point of: Marked
      improvement in partial Mayo score AND improvement in one or more of the following parameters
      (acquired during chart review):

        -  Endoscopy data

        -  ultrasonography

        -  Calprotectin (cut off 100microg/g)

        -  CRP

        -  Anemia resolution

      Marked improvement is defined as: Clinical response based on partial Mayo Score (including
      physician global assessment): decrease in partial Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from
      baseline and a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore ≥ 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding
      score ≤ 1. Improvement in lab work is defined as a reduction of the difference between
      baseline values and the next limit of normal by ≥ 30%. Improvement in endoscopy/
      ultrasonography is defined as a reduction of colitis in the same technique compared to
      baseline substantiated by images (endoscopy) or measurements of diameter of the bowel wall.

      As clinical remission in UC the investigators define normalization (i.e. absence of
      pathology) of patient reported outcomes (Frequency of stool, blood in stool) AND no evidence
      of residual disease activity in all of the following parameters:

        -  endoscopy data

        -  ultrasonography

        -  calprotectin (cut off 100microg/g)

        -  CRP and anemia
