  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sensory thalamus has been proposed for 40 years to treat
      medically refractory neuropathic pain, but its efficacy remains partial and unpredictable.
      Recently, bilateral DBS of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region
      involved in the integration of the affective and cognitive aspects of pain, has been
      successively proposed to treat few patients suffering from refractory chronic pain, by
      decreasing the emotional impact of their chronic pain. ACC-DBS could be an alternative or
      complementary approach to thalamic DBS in these patients, but the consequences of chronic
      dACC-DBS on cognition and affects have not been studied specifically.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bilateral ACC-DBS combined
      with unilateral thalamic DBS in patients suffering from chronic unilateral pain, refractory
      to medical treatment. Secondary objective will evaluate the efficacy of this combined DBS
      compared to thalamic DBS only.

      Chronic pain represents a major personal and societal burden, especially for medically
      resistant patients. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sensory thalamus has been proposed
      for 40 years to treat medically refractory neuropathic pain, but its efficacy remains partial
      and unpredictable. Recently, bilateral DBS of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a
      brain region involved in the integration of the affective, emotional and cognitive aspects of
      pain, has been successively proposed to treat few patients suffering from refractory chronic
      pain. In a pilot study, 16 patients treated by ACC-DBS experienced a significant improvement
      of their quality of life despite a slight decrease of their pain intensity, by improving the
      affective and emotional impacts of their chronic pain. ACC-DBS could be an alternative or
      complementary approach to thalamic DBS in these patients. However the consequences of chronic
      dACC-DBS on cognition and affects have not been studied specifically.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bilateral
      ACC-DBS combined with unilateral thalamic DBS in patients suffering from chronic unilateral
      pain, refractory to medical treatment. Secondary objective will evaluate the efficacy of this
      combined DBS compared to thalamic DBS only
