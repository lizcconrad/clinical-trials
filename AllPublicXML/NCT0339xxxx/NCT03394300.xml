      High myopia or pathological myopia is associated with elongation of axial length longer than
      26 mm or refractive error at least-6 diopter.

      High myopia is one of the most prevalent refractive condition globally with a higher risk of
      other eye conditions Moreover in high myopic eyes the incidence of cataract is significantly
      higher than in non myopic eyes and the progression is also faster.

      Calculation of IOL in high myopic eyes remains a challenge often leading to unexpected
      postoperative hyperopia the main potential sources of errors in IOL calculation for high
      myopic eyes include AL measurement &amp; IOL constants used &amp;IOL power calculation formula used.

      investigators suspect that the SRK I1 formula is inaccurate for myopic eyes, and that new
      formulas are needed, taking into account all those factors that make up the dioptric power of
      an eye.

      Formulas for IOL power calculation had past four generations, first generation formulas were
      theoretical and based on the same fundamental constant with no respect to anterior chamber
      depth. Since then, Binkhorst, Holladay, Hoffer and Shammas had refined the existing
      theoretical formulas where each of them developed his regression formula based on analysis of
      their previous IOL cases .

      This work was amalgamated in 1980 and yielded the Sanders Retzlaff Kraff I (SRKI) formula The
      second generation was designed by combining linear regression analysis and stepwise
      adjustment for long and short eyes according to anterior chamber depth .

      The third and fourth generation formulas, started by Holladay in 1988, all aimed at better
      calculation of the IOL power in eyes with extreme axial length where another term had
      appeared which is IOL specific anterior chamber depth .

      The accuracy of third and fourth generation formulas for IOL calculation in patients with
      high axial myopia had not been fully evaluated For that, the need for more studies conducted
      to evaluate such accuracy is crucial.

      This study will be conducted to evaluate the accuracy of different formulas used for IOL
      power calculation in patients with high axial myopia undergoing cataract surgery
