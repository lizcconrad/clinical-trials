    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of dexmedetomidine on swallowing function
      in healthy volunteers using combined pressure and impedance recordings. Furthermore, two
      different concentrations of dexmedetomidine will be studied to find out whether any posible
      impact of dexmedetomidine on swallowing function is dose-dependent.

      Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is commonly applied in modern perioperative care and means
      that minor surgical procedures are accomplished in awake patients using local anesthesia and
      light sedation. MAC has many advantages compared to general anesthesia; the recovery time
      after anesthesia is shorter and risk for postoperative nausea is lower to mention some.
      However, the patient is spontaneously breathing and the airway is not protected by an
      endotracheal tube which potentially increases risk of pulmonary aspiration. Pulmonary
      aspiration, that is inhalation of stomach and/or pharyngeal contents into the lungs, is a
      severe anesthesia-related complication and can in worst case lead to pneumonia and even
      death. Intact swallowing function is crucial in avoiding aspiration and how sedatives and
      analgesic agents used during MAC influence swallowing function is not fully understood.

      Pharyngeal function during bolus swallowing is measured by combined high resolution impedance
      manometry (HRIM). The HRIM catheter is inserted through the nose in such a way that sensors
      straddle the entire pharynx and esophagus with the distal catheter tip in the stomach.
      Dynamic pressure changes and flow can be detected during swallowing and data registered by
      HRIM are analysed using purpose-designed software, AIM analysis (automated impedance
      manometry analysis). AIM analysis derives pressure flow variables which describe different
      physiological events like bolus timing and bolus distension in the pharynx and the esophagus
      during swallowing. A Swallow Risk Index value, quantifying risk of deglutitive aspiration,
      can also be defined.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate impact of dexmedetomidine on swallowing function in
      healthy volunteers.Dexmedetomidine is a selective alfa-agonist frequently used during MAC.
      Furthermore, two different concentrations of dexmedetomidine will be studied to find out
      whether any posible impact of dexmedetomidine on swallowing function is dose-dependent.
      Moreover, subjective swallowing difficulties will be assessed.

      20 healthy volunteers will be studied on two different occasions approximately one week
      apart. In a randomized order volunteers will receive intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine
      in two subsequent concentrations and placebo (normal saline) infusion in corresponding doses
      on the other occasion. Blood samples are obtained for plasma concentration determination of
      the study drug and sedation levels are assessed during study drug exposure.
