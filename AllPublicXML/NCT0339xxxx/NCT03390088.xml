      This study is proposed to determined a national database of the etiologies, clinical and the
      demographic profile, using diagnostic tests and treatment of outpatients with chronic heart
      failure in Azerbaijan population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure remains the leading cause of hospitalization for those over the age of
      65 and expected to increase over the next 25 years with advancing life span. Being a
      progressive syndrome, CHF decreases the quality of life and place an economic burden on
      health care system.

      Advanced technologies in interventional cardiology, better organization of angiographic
      laboratories and primary prevention of coronary artery disease as the leading cause of HF,
      allowed warning its development in CAD patients. But the incidence and prevalence of CHF
      continue to increase with age as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction predominates
      in elderly patients. For the moment more than 23 million people over the world suffer from
      heart failure.

      The prevalence of these patients remains very high even in USA - over 5.8 million.However,
      there is no any database for heart failure patient in Azerbaijan.The purpose of this study is
      to compose a national database of the etiologies, clinical and demographic characteristics,
      using diagnostic tests and management of outpatients heart failure in Azerbaijan population.
