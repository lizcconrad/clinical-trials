  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of custom made toric intraocular lens
      implantation in patients with simultaneous post-DALK high corneal astigmatism and cataract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cataract surgery after DALK for keratoconus were enrolled. Total corneal
      astigmatism (TCA)was assessed by a rotating Scheimpflug camera combined with Placido disk
      corneal topography (Sirius; CSO, Firenze, Italy). A customized toric IOL (FIL 611 T, Soleko)
      was implanted in all eyes. One year postoperatively, refraction was measured, the IOL
      position was recorded, and vectorial and non-vectorial analysis were performed to evaluate
      the correction of astigmatism.
