    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized non comparative phase II clinical trial conducted on
      parallel groups, to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of Paromomycin (20
      mg/kg/d) IM for 14 days and Miltefosine (allometric dosing) oral for 42 days, and a
      combination of AmBisome® (20 mg/kg total dose) IV over 7 days and Miltefosine oral for 28
      days (allometric dosing) for the treatment of PKDL patients in Sudan.
