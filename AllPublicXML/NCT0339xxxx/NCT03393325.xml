    <textblock>
      A 4-8 week observational feasibility study of the use of the use of Tadalafil-Delivra in the
      treatment of Reynaud's Phenomena (RP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the feasibility of conducting a future RCT using the chosen outcome
      assessments in RP patients at 2 Rheumatology clinics.

      Study Design:

      Observation of patients prescribed Tadalafil-Delivra 2% (Tad-Del) for the treatment of RP
      with defined feasibility objectives and data collection through efficacy and safety
      assessments. Study objectives are:

        -  At least 70% recruitment of eligible participants.

        -  100% data collection from at least 70% of all enrolled subjects.

        -  Estimate the standard deviation(s) of all outcome assessments.

      Setting/Participants:

      Patients prescribed Tad-Del will be screened for study enrollment at 2 participating
      rheumatology clinics by the local research team. Participants that meet all the eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled in the study as subjects. Subjects will self-administer the
      medication as prescribed and return to the clinic for follow-up. Data will be collected on
      outcome assessments at: baseline, 1 week and at 4 to 8 weeks of treatment.

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of the severity of Digital Ulcers (DU) and Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP). The physician (MD) and patient will each independently make their own assessment on a linear 10 cm VAS scale by making a mark on the line with a pen anywhere from the left anchor &quot;0&quot; (indicating no disease at all) to the right anchor &quot;10&quot; (indicating the most severe imaginable). Both the MD and patient will complete an individual scale for RP and DU. The distance of the mark from the left anchor &quot;0&quot; will be recorded in mm, divided by 10 and reported as a value from 0 to 10. A total of 4 VAS scales will be completed.</description>

    <description>Visual Analogue Scales for Raynaud's Phenomenon and Digital Ulcer interference in daily activities as measured by the patient. Both assessments are part of the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ). The patient will make an assessment on the linear VAS scale for each by making a mark on the line with a pen anywhere from the left anchor &quot;Does not limit activities&quot; to the right anchor &quot;Very Severe limitation&quot;. The distance of the mark from the left to the right anchor will be measured in mm, divided by 10 and reported as a value from 0 to 10. There are two scales: 1 for Raynaud's Phenomena and the other for Digital Ulcer.</description>
