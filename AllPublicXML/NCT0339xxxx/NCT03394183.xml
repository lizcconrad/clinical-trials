  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is commonly recommended as a treatment for patients who present with peripheral
      artery disease (PAD). Although a great deal of research has supported the efficacy of
      exercise rehabilitation for PAD, it is infrequently implemented into clinical practices.To
      date, no comparison of cardiac rehabilitation efficacy and acute exercise responses has been
      made between patients with PAD and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Considering
      some of the parallels between the two conditions, as they are both atherosclerotic
      conditions, and the strong recommendations for exercise in both populations, it is worthwhile
      to compare the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation responses. It is also unclear if the
      magnitude of response for PAD patients is dependent on biological sex and clinical
      presentation as this may influence the development of exercise prescriptions. This study will
      be a prospective two-arm cohort study with both groups (CAD and PAD) undergoing the same
      intervention (standard 6 month out-patient cardiac rehabilitation program offered at the
      Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Rumsey Centre). The primary variable of interest will be
      peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) with a secondary variable of interest being functional
      capacity, as measured by the 6-minute walk test. Tertiary variables of interest will include
      walking impairment, as measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, and quality of life,
      as measured by the Short Form-36 health survey (SF-36).The second objective of this study is
      to determine if the magnitude of responses to cardiac rehabilitation for patients with PAD
      are dependent on biological sex or type of PAD (asymptomatic, post-surgical intervention, or
      intermittent claudication).Exploratory objectives include comparing acute exercise responses
      (prescribed exercise training load, actual training load, exercising heart rate and rating of
      perceived exertion) between PAD and CAD patients.

      This study is a prospective two-arm cohort study with both groups (CAD and PAD) undergoing
      the same intervention (standard 6 month out-patient cardiac rehabilitation program offered at
      the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Rumsey Centre). The standard 6-month out-patient cardiac
      rehabilitation program consists of weekly 1.5 hour visits to the TRI Rumsey Centre. After
      determining baseline VO2peak from the exercise stress test, an individualized walking
      exercise prescription will be developed by a cardiac rehabilitation supervisor which
      corresponds to approximately 60 to 80% of the participant's VO2peak. Participants will be
      invited to walk around the track and attend education sessions at the same time every week
      for six months. Patients will be encouraged to gradually increase their exercise time walking
      speed. Patients will be encouraged to exercise five times a week with four sessions occurring
      outside of the cardiac rehabilitation program. Both PAD and CAD participants will undergo the
      same standard cardiac rehabilitation program.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will be enrolled in the cardiac rehabilitation program which involves weekly 1.5 hour visits at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Rumsey Centre for 6 months. Each visit will consist of an exercise and a risk factor education lecture. Prior to the start of the program, participants will attend two assessment sessions with cardiac rehabilitation staff members to review medical history as well as complete a cardiopulmonary exercise test. During the cardiac rehabilitation program, participants will walk at 60-80% of their VO2peak heart rate based on the results of their exercise test, as per standard care procedures. Adjustments will be made to the patient's exercise prescription under the discretion of the cardiac rehabilitation supervisor, as per standard care procedures. Patients will also be asked to exercise an additional four times during the week on their own time for a total of five times per week, as per standard care procedures.</intervention_model_description>
