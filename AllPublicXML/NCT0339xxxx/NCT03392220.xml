  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma patients with clinically negative neck (cN0) will be
      randomized divided into two groups. Patients in case group will undergo unilateral neck
      dissection (II-IV) while bilateral neck dissection (II-IV) in control group. Regional control
      rate is the primary endpoint and comparison will be made to see if unilateral dissection can
      get similar regional control as control group.

  <detailed_description>

      Some retrospective analysises showed the low local recurrence rate of patients who accepted
      unilateral neck dissection with cN0 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study
      is to see if unilateral dissection can get similar regional control as bilateral dissection.

      308 patients with cN0 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma will be enrolled in five centers of
      northern China. Patients will be randomly assigned to 1: 1 ratio case group or control goup.
      Patients in case group will undergo unilateral (laryngeal primary tumor affected side) neck
      dissection (II-IV) while bilateral neck dissection (II-IV) in control group. And other
      necessary standard treatments will be performed in both case group and control group.Allowed
      by the patients, the investigators will obtain archived tumor specimens and 10ml peripheral
      blood samples from the patients before surgery.

      The patients will be followed-up every three months after surgery, until three years after
      surgery or develop regional recurrence. During the follow-up procedure, radiological
      evaluation will be performed. The primary end point is the patient's pathologically confirmed
      regional lymph node recurrence. Patients with primary end point will enter the overall
      survival follow-up stage. At the median follow-up time of two years, the investigators will
      undergo a major regional control rate analysis, then, all patients will be followed-up to
      five years postoperatively, and the overall survival analysis will be performed.

    <description>The local-regional control time is defined as the time from the primary surgery to any confirmed local-regional(neck) lymph node metastasis. The metastasis should be confirmed by both image examination( ultra-sound/CT/MRI etc.) and pathology examination. The primary outcome measure is to compare the unilateral neck dissection group's local-regional control time with the bilateral neck dissection group. The local control benefit of the two groups is evaluated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patients obtain informed consent prior to any trial.

          2. Diagnosis: Histopathology was confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma. Classified by
             laryngoscopy as supraglottic, no tongue and deep pharyngeal invasion, and subglottic
             invasion. Also, no distant signs of metastasis.

          3. Primary lesion is limited to one side, violation or more than midline, but
             preoperative laryngoscopy and CT can still clearly distinguish between the severity of
             bilateral lesions.

          4. Evaluation of cN0: Patients need to undergo neck palpation, ultrasound and enhanced
             CT, if the patient is allergic to CT enhancer, replace it with MRI.Not touch more than
             2cm hard lymph nodes in the neck, moreover, ultrasound and enhanced CT are not found
             lymph node that diameter â‰¥ 1cm.Or, the size does not meet the above criteria, but find
             rim enhancement, central irregular or hypodensity, and with the surrounding tissue
             boundary is obscure, and other suspicious transfer signs.

          5. After multidisciplinary discussion, the preferred treatment for patients is surgical
             treatment.

          6. Patients with no other previous head and neck cancer, and neck did not receive
             radiation therapy, no deep neck surgery, skin resection excepted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Laryngeal carcinoma but not squamous cell carcinoma, or primary pathology includes
             non-squamous cell components.

          2. Preoperative laryngoscopy assessment of primary lesions just in the middle or both
             sides of symmetry, can not distinguish which side is more serious.

          3. No surgical indications, or initial treatment evaluation recommends non-surgical
             treatment.

          4. The patient had other head and neck cancer.
