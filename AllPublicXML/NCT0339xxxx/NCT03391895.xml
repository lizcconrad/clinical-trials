  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is the abnormality of the spine with direct effects on the shape and mechanics of
      the thoracic cage. Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is the most common 3-dimensional
      deformity of the spine which can potentially affect respiratory function, exercise capacity
      as well as the performance of inspiratory and expiratory muscles. During growth morphological
      changes of thoracic cage affects the pulmonary tissues and functions. Respiratory functions
      shows negative changes due to Cobb angle, curve localization, number of vertebra and onset
      age in patient with scoliosis.

      Exercise approaches include respiratory training program and aim to improve respiratory
      functions.It is reported that respiratory muscle weakness is a potent contributor to
      pulmonary impairment in mild, moderate, and severe forms of scoliosis. Studies showed that
      exercise training and respiratory exercises may improve respiratory function and exercise
      capacity in patients with AIS. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle strength, respiratory function and
      functional capacity in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis.

    <description>Patients in this group will receive a home based exercise program. Home based exercise program includes deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises, resistive local expansion exercise on the collapsed areas in scoliosis concave sides, dynamic lumber stabilization, strengthening of inter scapular muscles, posture and stretching exercises once a day for 8 weeks. One of the exercise sessions was supervised by physiotherapist each week.</description>

    <description>In addition to home based exercise program, patients in this group will also receive inspiratory muscle training for 15 minutes, twice a day, 7 days a week for 8 weeks. One exercise session will be supervised in our clinic per week, other sessions will be performed at home.</description>
