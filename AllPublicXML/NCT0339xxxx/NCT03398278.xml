  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose, randomised, cross-over study to confirm the
      bioequivalence (BE) of OTR tablet 40 mg and OXYCONTIN tablet 40 mg in a fasted state in
      Chinese subjects with chronic pain
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this BE study, subjects with histories of chronic pain are chosen as the target
      population.

      Inclusion/exclusion criteria are strictly defined to reduce the potential variation of the PK
      data.

      Single dose design is chosen per Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/WHO guideline on
      bioavailability (BA)/BE studies for modified-release products.

      As a general rule, cross-over design is applied in the study to decrease the inter-individual
      variations between the two cohorts. A washout period lasting for at least 7 half-lives of the
      investigational medicine is needed to eliminate the drug residual from the previous period7.
      The elimination half-life of oxycodone from OTR is 4.5 hours, and a 6-day washout period is
      sufficient to achieve the aim.
