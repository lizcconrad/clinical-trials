      A Phase 2 Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of DKN-01 as a Monotherapy or in

      Endometrioid Ovarian Cancer

      This study employs a &quot;basket&quot; design to concurrently investigate DKN-01 as monotherapy and in
      combination with paclitaxel in patients with relapsed/refractory endometrioid endometrial
      cancer (EEC) or endometrioid ovarian cancer (EOC) (see Study Design for details). Thus, 4
      distinct patient groups are being independently investigated:

        1. DKN-01 monotherapy in relapsed/refractory EEC (Group 1)

        2. DKN-01+paclitaxel in relapsed/refractory EEC (Group 2)

        3. DKN-01 monotherapy in relapsed/refractory EOC (Group 3)

        4. DKN-01+paclitaxel in relapsed/refractory EOC (Group 4)
