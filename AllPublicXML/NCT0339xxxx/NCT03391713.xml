    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major health problem and a known cause of death and disability worldwide. In
      Malaysia, stroke is known to be top five causes of death and top ten causes of
      hospitalization Malaysia. Ischemic stroke accounts for more than 95% of all stroke cases (1).
      A recent study done in Malaysia showed that only 26% of patients with stroke symptoms
      presented to the hospital within 3 hours. One of the reasons was patients did not perceive
      the symptoms of stroke as being that of a serious illness (2). One of the modalities to raise
      awareness of stroke is through an educational poster. Posters in the waiting room can
      increase awareness of health promotion issues (3). Therefore, by placing poster regarding
      sign and symptoms of stroke in the waiting room in a government clinic, can increase
      awareness of early presentation of stroke.
