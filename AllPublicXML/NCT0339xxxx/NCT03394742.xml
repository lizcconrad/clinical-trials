    <textblock>
      Seriously sick people need social support to maintain their quality of life. Social support
      may be given by peers, who have experienced the same.

      In this study voluntary participants with recently diagnosed breast cancer were randomly
      allocated to intervention (N=130) or control (N=130) group. The intervention group received,
      in addition to usual care, peer support via telephone 1-5 times according to their own
      preference. The control group received usual care only. Peer support was given by volunteered
      breast cancer survivors who were educated for giving peer support.
