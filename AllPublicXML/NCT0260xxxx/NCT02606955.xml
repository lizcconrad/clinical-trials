  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical methods are fundamental in probing the DW. They must be supported by strict BIA
      protocols. REST appears to be a (the) brilliant solution in solving the old problem of DW in
      HD patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probing the dry weight (DW) was largely dependent on clinical subjective estimates until
      recently. New bedside non-invasive tools have been developed with the aim of providing more
      objective information on volume status and guiding physicians in the quest for DW. Among
      them, bioimpedance (BIA) appears to be very promising.

      Very recently, a BIA test aimed at assessing DW in hemodialysis (HD) patients has been
      developed, the &quot;REsistance Stabilization Test&quot; (REST). It is called BIA DW. Its rationale is
      based on the achievement of the flattening of the curve of the ratio R0/Rt (R0 is resistance
      at time 0 and Rt is resistance at a given time t during the HD session) of less than + 1%
      over 20 minutes in the presence of ongoing ultrafiltration.

      Study protocol: the Clinical DW is the gold standard by definition. It is determined under
      strict clinical surveillance by the same attending physician. She/he will be helped by a
      clinical score of volume state about symptoms and signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Then, this
      Clinical DW will be compared with BIA DW, as obtained after performing REST

    <description>All patients undergo a Clinical DW assessment. Then, they undergo a HD session in which BIA DW (injection of 800 microAmpere at 50 kilohertz alternating sinusoidal current with a standard tetrapolar technique) is determined. BIA DW is determined by performing the REsistance Stabilization Test (REST).</description>
