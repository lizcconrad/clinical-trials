  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates 20% n-acetylcystine (NAC) in the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma
      that is complicated by mucus in the airway, as determined by CT imaging. The study is a
      crossover design, which means that half the study participants will get 20% NAC in the first
      7-day treatment period and placebo in the next 7-day treatment period; and the other half
      will get placebo in the first 7-day treatment period and 20% NAC in the next 7-day treatment
      period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      n-acetylcystine (NAC) is a mucolytic medication, meaning that it breaks apart mucus.
      Investigators know that mucus is a factor in severe asthma attacks. However, mucus may be a
      factor in chronic severe asthma as well. This role has been hard to prove because of
      difficulty in showing that mucus occludes the lumen in chronic severe disease. Using a novel
      approach of scoring mucus occlusion, investigators have used CT imaging to uncover that a
      majority of people with severe asthma have at least one lung segment with a mucus plug and
      27% have more than four lung segments with mucus plugs.

      Historically, studies of mucolytics, like NAC, have not shown benefit in other obstructive
      lung diseases, like COPD. However, utilizing CT mucus scores as a biomarker, investigators
      believe that mucolytic treatment may prove useful for those with significant mucus impaction.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 4 study of 20% NAC in patients
      with asthma who also have evidence of mucus in their lungs as determined by CT imaging.
      Investigators hypothesize that by treating asthmatics, chosen based on the presence of mucus
      in the airways, with a mucolytic like NAC, will result in an improvement of lung function.
