  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biggest challenges for glycemic control during the day time involve meals and exercise
      variations, which are impacted by age, fitness level, duration, intensity and history of
      exercise. Meal variability has the benefit that meals are typically announced and quantified.
      Glucose control around exercise, on the other hand, is more complicated if the patient
      doesn't announce a change in activity level.

      The object of this study is to evaluate the Closed-Loop Control (CLC) in an environment where
      muscle glycogen is systematically depleted, glucose uptake systematically increased, and meal
      sizes are naturally larger than normal: a week of camp at high altitude, with the concomitant
      variable of oxygen consumption that this environment involves; during the winter, that will
      expose and challenge the different components of the system during cold temperatures, and
      with twice daily practice of physical activity designed to deplete glycogen reserves such as
      skiing.

      This proposal aims to demonstrate the superiority of the CLC, also known as Artificial
      Pancreas (AP), compared to the state-of-the art system available on the market:
      Sensor-augmented pump (SAP). This system has shown to diminish hypoglycemic events by setting
      the alarms on the continues glucose monitor (CGM) and taken action, such as performing
      self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) and treating if it is confirm to be low.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: To be eligible for the study, a subject must meet the following:

          1. Criteria for documented hyperglycemia (at least 1 must be met):

               -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (C-peptide levels and antibody
                  determinations are not required)

               -  The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment

          2. Criteria for requiring insulin at diagnosis (both criteria must be met):

               -  Daily insulin therapy for ≥ 12 months

               -  Insulin pump therapy for ≥ 3 months

          3. Age 10 - 25 years

          4. Avoidance of acetaminophen-containing medications (i.e. Tylenol) while wearing the
             continuous glucose monitor.

          5. Willingness to wear a continuous glucose sensor and physiological monitor for the
             duration of the study

          6. Female subjects who are sexually active must be on acceptable method of contraception
             (e.g. oral contraceptive pill, diaphragm, IUD)

        Exclusion Criteria: The presence of any of the following is an exclusion for the study:

          1. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months

          2. Hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness in the past 6 months

          3. History of seizure disorder (except for hypoglycemic seizure)

          4. History of any heart disease including coronary artery disease, heart failure, or
             arrhythmias

          5. History of altitude sickness

          6. Chronic pulmonary conditions that could impair oxygenation

          7. Cystic fibrosis

          8. Current use of oral glucocorticoids, beta-blockers or other medications, which in the
             judgment of the investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the
             study.

          9. History of ongoing renal disease (other than microalbuminuria).

         10. Subjects requiring intermediate or long-acting insulin (such as NPH, Detemir or
             Glargine).

             injectable).

         14. Presence of a febrile illness within 24 hours of start ski camp or acetaminophen use
             while wearing the CGM. The camp study subject will not participate in the trial if
             these conditions are met.

         15. Medical or psychiatric condition that in the judgment of the investigator might
             interfere with the completion of the protocol such as:
