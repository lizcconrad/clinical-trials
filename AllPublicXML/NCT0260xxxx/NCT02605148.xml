      To evaluate the effect of Gluten Free Diet (GFD) on beta-cell function and glucose metabolism
      in subjects with one or several islet autoantibodies without and with dysglycemia at
      baseline. Additionally, all subjects will be given treatment with Vitamin D, omega fatty
      acids and probiotics.

      Subjects will be randomized to GFD or normal diet during 18 months. Beta cell function will
      be evaluated at baseline, and during follow-up by glucose tolerance tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is a randomized controlled study to determine the safety and the effect of gluten
      free diet during 18 months on beta-cell function and glucose metabolism. Lead-in and nonstop
      supplement cocktail including vitamin D, omega fatty acids and probiotics will be used to
      equalize differences to reduce known confounders. All study subjects will meet with a
      dietician to obtain a 3-day diet record and to receive instructions on a healthy normal diet
      or GFD.

      Subjects (n=60) at 2-49.99 years of age positive for one or several islet autoantibodies will
      be recruited. Subjects with one islet autoantibody have done one or several oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) prior to the baseline visit. One islet autoantibody positive subjects
      are only eligible if they have dysglycemia. All subjects will be randomized based on baseline
      intravenous glucose tolerance test (IvGTT) and OGTT into subjects without and with
      dysglycemia at baseline.

      Beta-cell function and glucose metabolism (alternating IvGTT and OGTT) will be assessed at
      baseline and after 6, 12, 18 months of treatment and after 6 months of wash out on a normal
      healthy diet.

      Adverse events and safety Adverse event will be obtained at visits and during the study,
      which will be monitored.

      It is expected that subjects with one or several islet autoantibodies will show a loss
      compared to baseline of beta-cell function and glucose control. GFD is expected to reduce the
      loss in subjects on a healthy diet.
