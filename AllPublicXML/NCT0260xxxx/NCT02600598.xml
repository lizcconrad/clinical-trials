    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-centre, open label, within-subject comparison trial to explore the
      biological effects of LEO 43204 Gel, 0.037%, applied once daily for 3 consecutive days in
      patients with actinic keratosis on the upper extremity. The treatment area for each patient
      will be as defined as a contiguous area of 250 cm2 of skin on the upper extremity (including
      the dorsum manus) that contains a minimum of 5 AK lesions. Additionally there must be at
      least one AK lesion located in a non-treated area on the contralateral arm. All eligible
      subjects will receive LEO 43204 Gel, 0.037%, on the treatment area on Days 1, 2 and 3. Study
      medication application will be (sub)investigator applied. A total of 30 patients will be
      enrolled into this study (n=15 in each of the two groups). Patients will be divided into two
      groups with different biopsy schedules.

                       had a hysterectomy or have undergone tubal litigation or have been
                       post-menopausal for at least one year prior to first visit.

          -  9. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must be willing to use effective
