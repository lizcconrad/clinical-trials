    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a single-centre, randomized, controlled clinical trial to
      evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic efficacy of two local drug delivery
      systems containing 1.2% RSV gel and 1.2% ATV gel in treatment of intrabony defects in
      patients with chronic periodontitis as an adjunct to SRP.

      Background: Rosuvastatin (RSV) and Atorvastatin (ATV) are known to inhibit osteoclastic bone
      resorption and were proposed to have osteostimulative properties by causing osteoblast
      differentiation in vivo and in vitro as shown by an increase in matrix formation. The aim of
      the present study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of 1.2% RSV and 1.2% ATV gel as
      local drug delivery systems in adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) for the treatment
      of intrabony defects in patients with chronic periodontitis (CP).

      Methods: A total of 90 intrabony defects were treated with either 1.2% RSV, 1.2% ATV or
      placebo gel LDD after SRP. Clinical parameters (plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index,
      probing depth and clinical attachment level) were recorded at baseline and 6 months.
      Radiographic intrabony defect depth change was calculated on standardized radiographs by
      using image analysis software at 6 months.
