  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Keytruda (pembrolizumab) can help to
      control intermediate- or high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The safety of this drug
      will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of certain
      types of melanoma. Its use in patients with SMM is investigational.The study doctor can
      explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 13 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive pembrolizumab by
      vein over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for up to 8 cycles (about 6 months).

      At the end of 8 cycles, if your doctor thinks you have had a clinical benefit from
      pembrolizumab, you may choose to or continue receiving pembrolizumab for up to an additional
      16 cycles.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-24:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease. If you can become pregnant, part of this blood or urine will
           be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will also be collected to study how pembrolizumab
           works in your body.

        -  Urine will be collected over about 24 hours for routine tests.

      On Days 2 and 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will also be collected to
      study how pembrolizumab works in your body.

      End of Cycle 8 and 24:

        -  You will have 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations to check the status of the disease and
           for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

        -  You will have a skeletal survey to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  Urine will be collected over about 24 hours for routine tests.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an FDG PET/CT or MRI.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 24 cycles. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Once you are no longer taking the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  You will have 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations to check the status of the disease and
           for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

        -  Urine will be collected over about 24 hours for routine tests.

        -  You will have a skeletal survey to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an FDG PET/CT or MRI.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 6 to 12 months after the last dose of study drug:

        -  Urine will be collected over about 24 hours for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a skeletal survey, an FDG PET/CT, or
           MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations to
           check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
