  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) increases the risk of adverse pregnancy and birth
      outcomes and may have long-lasting effects in the offspring.Financial incentives may increase
      smoking abstinence rate in pregnancy and therefore reduce MSDP related negative health
      effects. This is a randomized open label study comparing financial incentives for smoking
      abstinence with no financial incentives for smoking abstinence.Research objectives

        1. To test the efficacy of financial incentives on smoking abstinence rate among pregnant
           smokers;

        2. To explore the heterogeneity of efficacy according to individual characteristics:
           socioeconomic status, social background, smoking characteristics, personality traits,
           time and risk preferences to determine profiles of women which could benefit best from
           this kind of intervention;

        3. To provide a cost-benefit analysis based on the cost of newborn and children disease due
           to maternal smoking during pregnancy.

      Multicenter, national study. Participants are pregnant smokers of at least 18 years old,
      smoking at least 5 manufactured or 3 rolled-on-their-own cigarettes per day. They will be
      randomly assigned according to a 1:1 ratio to receive either a financial incentive
      (20€/visit) to attend the 5 study visits (control group) or receive this show-up incentive
      plus an incentive for being abstinent at visit(s) on a progressive manner (treatment group).
      The incentives will be delivered as vouchers. Two hundred and forty pregnant smokers will be
      randomized into the control and treatment groups, respectively. The study will be run in
      several maternity wards across France all of whom routinely treat pregnant smokers.

      Expected results

        -  Financial incentives rewarding progressive abstinence from smoking will increase
           abstinence rate more than lack of financial incentives.

        -  Forward looking and time consistent women will be more likely to stop smoking.

        -  If the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness are demonstrated, financial incentives
           can be introduced as a standard intervention in helping pregnant smokers quit.
