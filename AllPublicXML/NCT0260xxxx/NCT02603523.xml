  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of exercise programs to prevent falls among older people is well documented in
      the literature. However, older people's adherence to these exercise programs has been
      reported to be suboptimal, varying between 21% and 74%. In addition, about 45% of people aged
      over 60 years do not meet the minimum recommended level of physical activity. In this
      context, dance is a promising alternative to traditional exercise programs, as it can
      positively influence important risk factors for falls, such as sedentary lifestyle, balance
      impairments and muscle weakness. Nevertheless, a recent systematic review conducted in this
      area show that the lack of randomized clinical trials as well as the low methodological
      quality of existing studies do not allow to reach definitive conclusions on the real effects
      of dance on risk factors for falls. A type of dance that is becoming popular among the older
      population in Brazil is the Senior Dance. Senior Dance classes consist of different
      choreographies, which include rhythmic and simple movements with rhythmic folk songs. The
      concentration required to learn the choreographies challenges balance, motor coordination and
      cognitive function. Thus the present study is a randomized clinical trial aiming to
      investigate the Senior Dance effect on balance, mobility and cognitive function, compared
      with a control group, among older people living in the community. A total of 82 subjects will
      be randomly allocated into two groups. The intervention group will participate in a 12-week,
      twice-weekly group-based program of Senior Dance, while the control will be encouraged to
      maintain their current routine activities. Outcomes measures (balance, mobility and cognitive
      function) will be evaluated before and after the intervention by an assessor blinded to group
      allocation. The results of this study will assist health practitioners when prescribing
      intervention for the older population.

    <description>The intervention group will attend a single educational class on fall risk factors and prevention, and will participate in a 12-week, twice-weekly group-based program of Senior Dance. Each dance class will last for an hour, and the number of participants per class will range from 10 to 15. Senior Dance-certified instructors will lead the classes. The Senior Dance classes consist of different choreographies, which include rhythmic and simple movements with rhythmic folk songs. During the classes, participants can practice the movements sitting or standing, quickly or slowly, in circles, individually, in pairs or in small groups.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will attend the same educational class on fall risk factors and prevention that intervention group participants will receive, and will be instructed not to take part in any regular exercise programs such as supervised group exercise, Tai Chi, Yoga, or any dance activity during the study period. At the end of the study, they will be offered Senior Dance classes, twice a week, during 12 weeks.</description>
