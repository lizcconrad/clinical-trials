      This study aimed at assessing the efficiency and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      (CCRT) using paclitaxel (PTX) plus oxaliplatin (OHP) in unresectable locally advanced
      esophageal cancer patients.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the date of CCRT initiation to the date of documented failure (local recurrence or metastasis occurrence) or the date of the last follow-up for those remaining. Overall survival (OS) was determined as the time (in months) between the first day of therapy and the last follow-up or the date of death.</description>

    <description>Radiotherapy was delivered with a daily fraction of 2.0 Gy to a total dose of 60 Gy over 6 weeks. Concurrent paclitaxel (135mg/m², d1) and oxaliplatin (125mg/ m², d1) were administered on Days 1 and Day 29 of radiotherapy.</description>

    <description>Radiotherapy was given concurrently on the first day of the first cycle of chemotherapy. The GTV received 60Gy (30 fractions at 2Gy per fraction) and CTV was 40 Gy (20 fractions at 2Gy per fraction). Radiotherapy was delivered in three-dimensional conformal technique (3D-CRT) and no intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cytologically or histologically confirmed esophageal carcinoma

          2. Age of 20 -80

          3. ECOG performance status: 0-1;

          4. No treatments prior to enrollment;

          5. At least one measurable lesion on CT, MRI or esophageal barium exam;

          6. Normal functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow

          7. Blood exams qualified for chemotherapy, which included hemoglobulin ≥9 g/dl,
             neutrophil ≥1.5×109/L and platelet (PLT) ≥100×109/L, creatinine ≤1.5 UNL

          8. Informed consent signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatments of chemotherapy or irradiation;

          2. Poor bone marrow, liver and kidney functions, which would make chemotherapy
             intolerable;

          3. Contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus, deep esophageal
             ulcer, fistula to mediastinum, or haematemesis;

          4. Participating in other clinical trials;

          5. Pregnancy, breast feeding, or not adopting birth control;

          6. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities

          7. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for
             cervical cancer in site, in situ carcinoma of the bladder or non-melanoma carcinoma of
             the skin;
