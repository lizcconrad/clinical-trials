  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder. The management of atrial
      fibrillation is of great importance. Despite the presence of exercise intolerance, weight
      gain, and an associated decline in overall health and well-being in patients living with
      atrial fibrillation, recommended standard care does not currently include the prescription of
      exercise to address these significant health issues. Exercise training is a recognized form
      of treatment of persons with heart disease. An exercise program such as high-intensity
      interval training when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training may
      provide a stronger training stimulus for exercise and clinical outcomes; may be more
      efficient and motivating; and, may help to improve adherence to exercise training in
      persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation patients. This has been shown in patients with
      coronary artery disease and heart failure.

      The primary objectives of this prospective study are to examine the impact of high-intensity
      interval training compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training in adults with
      persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation on exercise capacity and quality of life.

      Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder. Significant disease and death
      rates are associated with atrial fibrillation because of stroke risk, the complications of
      medications, poor quality of life and reduced exercise tolerance. Many patients report they
      have a lower quality of life because of this condition, so finding new ways of helping
      patients manage and cope with this health problem may help a great number of people. The
      management of atrial fibrillation is of great importance. Despite the presence of exercise
      intolerance, weight gain, and an associated decline in overall health and well-being in
      patients living with atrial fibrillation, recommended standard care does not currently
      include the prescription of exercise to address these significant health issues. Exercise
      training is a recognized form of treatment of persons with heart disease. An exercise program
      such as high-intensity interval training when compared to moderate-intensity continuous
      exercise training may provide a stronger training stimulus for exercise and clinical
      outcomes; may be more efficient and motivating; and, may help to improve adherence to
      exercise training in persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation patients. This has been
      shown in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure.
