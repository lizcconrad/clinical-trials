    <textblock>
      Objective of the study is to determine the influence of the cream with Silver fir wood (Abies
      alba) extract (Belinal) on the skin parameters and functions in comparison to the placebo
      cream. 10 healthy female subjects will use the test cream on one half and placebo cream on
      the other half of the face and of the gluteal part twice a day for 12 weeks. Various face
      skin parameters will be evaluated before the cream use (the baseline), after 6 and after 12
      weeks of the cream use. To evaluate the photoprotective potential of Belinal the minimal
      erythema dose (MED) will be determined before (the baseline) and after 12 weeks of the cream
      use at the gluteal area.

      Objective of the study is to determine the influence of the cream with Silver fir wood (Abies
      alba) extract (Belinal; 2% cream) on the skin parameters and functions in comparison to the
      placebo cream. 10 healthy female subjects will use the test cream on one half and placebo
      cream on the other half of the face and of the gluteal area (split-face and split-gluteal
      area ) twice a day for 12 weeks. Face skin parameters will be evaluated before the cream use
      (the baseline), after 6 and after 12 weeks of the cream use. The photoprotective potential of
      Belinal will be evaluated with a determination of the minimal erythema dose (MED) at the
      gluteal area before (the baseline) and after 12 weeks of the cream use. Comparison will be
      done as the mean of the individual ratios. The differences between the before-after condition
      will be analyzed with the statistical test of analysis of variance. In case of failure to
      find homogeneity in the variances the nonparametric ANOVA, the Willcoxon test, will be used.
      The results will be expressed as mean ± standard error for each group with a significance
      level of 0.05 for all the statistical tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of photoprotective function of the skin</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks of the supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal erythema dose (MED) of the skin will be determined. Skin on the gluteal part of the body will be exposed to 10 different doses of UVB light and 24 hours after exposure MED will be determined. Higher MED indicates better photoprotective function of the skin.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of the dermis structure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks of Belinal cream use</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound (US) images of the dermis will be taken and intensity of the dermis determined. Higher intensity of the dermis US images indicates improvement of the collagen and elastin network.</description>

    <measure>Reduction of trans-epidermal water loss</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks of Belinal cream use</time_frame>
    <description>Trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) will be measured on the face using open-chamber probe. Lower TEWL indicates better skin barrier function and improved skin condition.</description>
