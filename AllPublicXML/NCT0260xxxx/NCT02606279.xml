  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate specific factors in mitochondria that may precipitate
      premature aging and physical weakness in HIV patients. Angiotensin receptors 1 and 2 (AT1R
      and AT2R) are found in virtually every cell type. This study will evaluate how the
      relationships among these receptors in immune and skeletal muscle cells change with HIV, and
      how these changes might trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, declines in muscle strength, and
      cellular decline in people living with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV related premature cellular aging and declines in mitochondrial function are closely
      linked. Dysfunctional mitochondria generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      and provide less ATP supply cellular energy. Impaired turnover of damaged mitochondria leads
      to gradual but progressive decline in energy metabolism, increases in muscle fibrosis and
      clinically apparent weakness. The Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) is a central hormonal system
      that contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and impacts both lifespan and function across
      multiple organ systems. Deletion of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) results in a
      25-30% extension of lifespan in mouse models, partly through increasing mitochondrial
      numbers. Blocking of AT1R reduces a number of age-related morbidities in mice, and in human
      studies. A plethora of data implicates RAS modulation in marked effects on fitness, frailty
      and beneficial responses to exercise in older adults. Despite this, there are virtually no
      data examining RAS biology in HIV+ vs. age-matched HIVsubjects, no data of RAS in relation to
      key HIV-specific variables (duration of HIV, treatment history, immune markers), and no data
      examining the effects of blocking AT1R on physical function in HIV infected subjects. In this
      study, we will examine the RAS and its contribution to premature mitochondrial failure in HIV
      patients. We will begin to fill this void by enrolling 40 HIV+ subjects in a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo controlled pilot study of treatment with AT1R blocker to determine
      the feasibility of a larger trial, estimate effect size, assess the correlation of
      angiotensin receptor (AR) expression in peripheral blood cells and muscle cells, and the
      association of AR expression with physical function measures and immunity.
