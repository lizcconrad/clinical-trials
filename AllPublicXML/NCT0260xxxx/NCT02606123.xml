  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 parts: Part I (Dose Escalation) and Part II (Dose Expansion). In
      Part I, patients will participate in single, multiple, and long-term dosing periods using
      EPI-506 to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, the maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary
      indications of anti-tumor activity. Part I is an open-label, adaptive 3 + 3 design,
      dose-escalation study. Approximately six dose levels of EPI-506 will be studied, beginning at
      80 mg/day. Enrolled patients may be allowed to escalate to a subsequent dose cohort after
      their initial twelve weeks. Additional patients may be enrolled at any safe dose level prior
      to or concurrent with enrolling patients in Part II.

      In Part II, 3 patient populations; post-abiraterone metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) but enzalutamide-naïve, post-enzalutamide mCRPC but abiraterone-naïve, and
      post-abiraterone and enzalutamide mCRPC will be studied at the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) determined in Part I over 12 weeks of daily dosing. Approximately 120 patients (40 in
      each cohort) will be enrolled.

    <description>Patients will receive EPI-506 as an oral softgel capsule.
Part 1:
Approximately six dose levels of EPI-506 will be studied, beginning at 80 mg/day. During the Single-Dose Period, patients will first receive a dose of EPI-506 in the fasted state followed by 2 days of washout, and then patients will receive a second dose of EPI-506 in the fed state followed by 2 days of washout. Patients will then enter the Multiple Dosing and Long-term Dosing Period where they will receive once or twice daily dosing in a fed or fasted state until they meet discontinuation criteria.
Part 2:
The dose in Part 2 will be determined in Part 1 of the study. Patients will receive the Part 2 dose daily until they meet discontinuation criteria.</description>
