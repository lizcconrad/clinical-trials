      This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LXS196 as a single agent and in
      combination with HDM201 in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

             excluded if total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤ 1.5 x109/L.

          -  Platelets ≤ 100 x 109/L.

             to combination part only).

          -  Patients treated with growth factors targeting the myeloid lineage (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF
             and M-CSF) within 2 weeks of starting study treatment. (applicable to combination part
