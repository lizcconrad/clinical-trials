    <textblock>
      This study is designated to test the safety and initial efficacy of the LunGuard's PFT device
      for reduction of GER.

      Enterally-Fed, Sedated and Mechanically Ventilated Critically Ill Patients in the ICU will
      have the PFT positioned in them and used for feeding of a Nutritional Formula.Samples will be
      taken by suction on predetermined intervals and analysed for Pepsin A concentration.

      The PFT will be removed upon completion of the study's scheduled routine. Patients in the
      control group will have a standard polyurethane nasogastric device inserted according to
      standard procedure, which is considered the gold standard.
