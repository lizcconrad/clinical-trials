    <textblock>
      As cancer mortality rates improve in Asia, there is an increasing focus on patient-reported
      outcomes and survivorship issues. In view of the numerous medication and psychosocial issues
      that are commonly faced by early-stage breast cancer survivors, it deems important to develop
      and conduct specific interventional programs to mitigate these problems. In the literature,
      it is well recognized that psychosocial interventions are effective to manage emotional
      distress and quality of life, with the evidence clearly clustered in studies on female
      patients with breast cancer. One meta-analysis suggested that psycho-oncologic interventions
      including individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, psychoeducation, relaxing training
      can produce positive effects on emotional distress, anxiety and depression, and
      health-related QOL.

      The investigators hypothesize that a significant reduction in anxiety, improvement of
      cognition and improvement of health-related quality of life among those who receive
      psycho-education, in comparison to those in the usual care. Hence, this randomized trial is
      designed to assess the effectiveness of a psycho-educational group (PEG) intervention on
      supportive care and survivorship issues, which include anxiety, depression, cognitive
      function, toxicities management of cancer- or treatment- related physical symptoms, and
      health-related quality of life in early-stage breast cancer patients.

    <description>On the basis of previous studies that evaluated PEG interventions for women with breast cancer, a structured program based on the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles was developed. Patients in the PEG group will be involved in three sessions of psychoeducation. The PEG program is designed to cover the various aspects outlined by the IOM on quality cancer survivorship. This program is designed to take place on three individual days on a weekend. For each session, three major topics will be covered, with lectures and interactive workshop integrated. Sessions will be conducted by healthcare professionals who are experts/well-versed in their respective domains.</description>
