  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA)is a painful and disabling disease, predicted to be the fourth largest
      cause of disability worldwide by 2020. It commonly affects the hip or knee ultimately
      resulting in total joint replacement. In order to assess disease progression and plan
      surgery, x-rays are taken as part of routine practice. However x-rays provide limited
      information about formation of substructures and changes occurring during progression of
      disease. The proposed study aims to invite patients with OA of the hip or knee to participate
      in detailed examinations of their pain and their painful joint through interviews, blood and
      urine samples taken, MRI magnetic resonance imaging)and donating their waste tissue after
      joint surgery (all of old joint). Informed patient consent will be sought in all cases.

      The patient will be asked for permission for a clinician to access their notes for
      information relevant to the research, including full medical history, their sex and date of
      birth. Tissue obtained from joint replacement surgery at St. George's Hospital and
      transferred to St.George's, University of London where it will be prepared for various
      experiments including looking at the genes and proteins in people with osteoarthritis. The
      blood and urine samples will also be taken to St. George's, University of London, and
      prepared for studies on the genes and proteins in people with osteoarthritis. All samples
      provided will be anonymised with no patient details on the samples and stored in locked
      freezers, in locked labs. at St.George's, University of London.
