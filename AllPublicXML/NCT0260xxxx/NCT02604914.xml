      An Open-Label Study in Healthy Male and Female Subjects to Identify the Concentration that
      Provides Optimal Bioavailability of Levodopa Infused Subcutaneously via a Pump System; and to
      Compare the Bioavailability of Levodopa/Carbidopa Solution to that of Levodopa/Carbidopa
      Intestinal Gel (LCIG), Infused via a Naso-Jejunal Tube

      Part 1: This is a single centre, open-label design with 2 study arms (ND0612H and ND0612L),
      in 24 subjects that will receive the ND0612L or ND0612H regimens. Part of the subjects will
      also participate in Part 2 of the study. Within each study arm, subjects will receive 3 doses
      of the investigational LD/CD solution for subcutaneous (SC) infusion. Study drug will be
      administered for 24 -30 hours as a subcutaneous (SC) infusion to the lower abdomen. Then
      subjects will be readmitted for Part 2. Part 2: This is a single centre, open-label design
      with 3 treatment arms to which 15 subjects who completed the ND0612H arm of Part 1
      ND0612-005a will be allocated in a randomised manner. Within each treatment arm subjects will
      receive 2 out of 3 doses of LCIG infused for 16 hours directly to the jejunum. Subjects will
      be discharged from the clinic 24 hours after the end of the last infusion
