  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial tumors, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), have the ability to grow
      to only a finite size in the absence of vascularization. RCC is characterized as a
      highly-vascularized tumor and inhibiting angiogenesis has the potential to impair tumor
      growth, including growth of RCC. Therapeutic targeting of integral biological pathways in
      RCC, including those involving VEGF and mTOR, has produced robust clinical effects and
      revolutionized the treatment of metastatic RCC. These approaches offers significant clinical
      benefit and sequential use of these agents has become the empirical standard of care.
      However, complete or durable responses are uncommon and resistance develops after a median
      interval of 6-15 months. This raises the pressing clinical need for additional therapeutic
      approaches for patients with metastatic clear cell RCC. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the approach of targeted delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy with G-202 in
      patients with advanced, refractory RCC. This study is based on prodrug tumor targeting, in
      which an inactive form of a toxic agent is administered systemically and gets activated in
      specific locations in the body, resulting in higher concentrations of the cytotoxic form at
      the tumor location. G-202 is a prodrug that is activated by PSMA in the blood vessels of
      tumors, but not normal tissue; once activated, G-202 leads to disruption of intracellular
      calcium levels and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Thus, G-202 is expected to bring about
      cell death in RCC and destroy the blood supply of RCC tumors. This single-arm, open-label
      Phase II clinical trial will evaluate the safety and activity of G-202 in patients with RCC
      that expresses PSMA.
