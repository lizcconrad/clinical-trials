  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the changes in attention level due to isometric exercises and level three
      progression eccentric movements. The attention level will be measured using a mental speed
      test (how quickly a subject can process information and make decisions based upon that
      information). Another outcome measure will be the ability of the subject to maintain balance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On Day 1, subjects will complete the mental speed test and will undergo CDP testing using the
      modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in Balance (mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects
      will be required to stand on a hard or compliant surface (a 4&quot; tall foam cushion of known
      mechanical properties) in a comfortable posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or
      closed, head straight and arms to the side and free to move, gazing forward, and breathing
      normally. These will constitute the baseline information. Subjects will be divided into two
      groups: a isometric group (performing the isometric exercises) and an eccentric group
      (performing the eccentric exercises). At the end of Day 1, the isometric group will perform
      the isometric exercises while the eccentric group will act as control (no exercise). On Day
      2, subjects will complete the mental speed test and will undergo the CDP testing a second
      time. These will constitute the first follow-up information. At the end of Day 2, the
      eccentric group will perform the eccentric exercises while the isometric group will act as
      control (no exercise). Throughout Day 3, subjects will complete the mental speed test and
      undergo the CDP testing a third time. This will constitute the second and last follow-up
      information.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2 and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Stability Score is calculated as percentage ratio of the actual sway and the theoretical limit of stability.
Changes in Stability Score will be assessed between baseline (Day 1), and Day 2 and Day 3. It will be used to investigate if and which exercises affect it and how much.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Mental Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2 and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be presented a series of word/image pairs and/or simple mathematical equations or number sequences. If a pair matches, the subject has to click the &quot;Correct&quot; button, if the pair does not match, the &quot;Incorrect&quot; button . However, if the word &quot;Opposite&quot; appears at the top of the screen, the answer needs to be reversed. The subject has up to 5 minutes to complete the task. The Accuracy of the answers expressed as percentage will be used as measure of mental speed. Changes in Accuracy will be assessed between baseline (Day 1), and Day 2 and Day 3. It will be used to investigate if and which exercises affect it and how much.</description>
