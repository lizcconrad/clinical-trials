  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether using belladonna &amp; opiate suppositories (B&amp;Os)
      can improve patient discomfort during Onabotulinumtoxin A (BoNT) injection into the bladder
      for treatment of overactive bladder, neurogenic detrusor overactivity, or interstitial
      cystitis.

    <measure>Change in Bladder Injection Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be calculated difference in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score prior to procedure and midway through procedure. Scale is one question and has a range from a score of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Measure will be reported as the midway pain score minus the preoperative pain score.</description>

    <measure>Post-operative pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative (within 10 minutes of the end of the BoNT procedure)</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of participants declining to complete procedure due to pain intolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Patient declines to proceed secondary to pain or discomfort.</description>

    <measure>Participant satisfaction with pain control</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative (within 10 minutes of the end of the BoNT procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using one question Likert scale. This will be a 4-level scale ranging from 'not at all satisfied,' 'slightly satisfied,' 'mostly satisfied,' and 'very much satisfied.'</description>
