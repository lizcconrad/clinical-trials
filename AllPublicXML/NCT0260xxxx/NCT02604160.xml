  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is not intended to treat anemia of chronic kidney disease but to determine the
      safety of the study drug, LY3113593.

      The study will also evaluate how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream, how long
      it takes the body to remove the study drug, and what effect the study drug has on the body.

      The study consists of up to three parts. Participants may only enroll in one part.
      Participants will receive up to four injections of LY3113593 or placebo into a vein. The
      study will last up to about 26 weeks including screening and follow-up.
