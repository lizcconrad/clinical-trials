  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is configured major problem for public health in the country. Affected
      individuals may experience fatigue, dyspnea, respiratory muscle weakness, overstimulation of
      the sympathetic myocardial activity, among others. In relation to the treatment of patients
      with heart failure with symptoms mentioned above a great alternative is the implantation of
      cardiac rehabilitation programs, these programs can also be associated with other muscle
      training measures, among these there is inspiratory muscle training (IMT), as the weakness of
      these muscles is rather found in this population and this directly related to signs and
      symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training associated with
      a cardiac rehabilitation program in the modulation of sympathetic myocardial activity and
      maximal and submaximal functional capacity of patients with HF between 21-60 years.
      METHODOLOGY: This is a clinical trial, controlled, randomized, double-blind being developed
      in partnership with the Department of Physical Therapy, Federal University of Pernambuco
      (UFPE) and the Hospital das Clinicas (HC) of Pernambuco, whose patients will be accrued on
      the Recife's main referral centers in caring for patients with heart failure. Patients will
      undergo the evaluation of pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength (spirometry and
      digital Manovacuometry) as well as on the functional capacity (Ergospirometry), cardiac
      innervation (myocardial scintigraphy), mobility and diaphragm thickness (ultrasound) and
      quality of life. After the evaluation will be randomly allocated into two groups: The control
      group will perform cardiac rehabilitation associated with the Sham of IMT, and the
      experimental group cardiac rehabilitation associated with the IMT at 30% of maximal
      inspiratory pressure. The intervention will last three months for both groups and after this
      phase patients will be submitted again to the assessment tools. EXPECTED RESULTS: To clarify
      the association between physical exercise associated with specific respiratory training in
      modulating the autonomic nervous system of patients with HF and what the relationship with
      reflected cardiorespiratory fitness in maximal and submaximal functional capacity.
