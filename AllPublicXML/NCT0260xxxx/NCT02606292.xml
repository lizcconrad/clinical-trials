  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopy is an important technique in medicine to diagnose internal organs. Video endoscopy
      has been the most common technique providing clear, real time video images of organs'
      surfaces. However, this technique only images the surface and cannot effectively diagnose
      diseased tissues that develop in endothelial tissues. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been
      developed to overcome this limitation, and it is widely utilized in diagnosing GI diseases.
      This technique can image very deep areas of organs, up to several centimeters; however, it
      suffers from speckle artifacts and cannot adequately provide early diagnosis of tissue
      abnormalities that do not show mechanical properties that differ significantly from those of
      normal tissues.

      The investigators propose that photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE), an endoscopic embodiment of the
      rapidly growing photoacoustic tomography (PAT) technology, can fulfill the aforementioned
      need.

    <measure>Feasibility of PA endoscopic imaging as an alternative real-time noninvasive tool for evaluation of Barrett's esophagus as measured by the agreement between the PA imaging system and the standard esophageal biopsy for diagnosing Barrett's epithelium</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>-The investigators will image a series of human esophagi in patients with an established diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus with/without dysplasia to fine-tune the PA imaging system. The investigators will assess the agreement between the PA imaging system and the standard clinical practice of four-quadrant esophageal biopsy previously performed in this cohort of patients as part of his/her active surveillance program.</description>
