  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the investigational
      drug, palbociclib with bicalutamide for the treatment of triple negative, androgen receptor
      positive breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study therapy is to be self administered on an outpatient basis. Patients who meet
      eligibility criteria and sign informed consent to Step 2 may begin treatment on study.
      Treatment consists of bicalutamide orally once daily and palbociclib will be given orally
      daily for 3 weeks on followed by 1 week off. A treatment cycle is considered to be 4 weeks.
      Eligible patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 2 weeks during Cycle #1 and 2,
      followed by every 4 weeks in subsequent cycles. Toxicity assessment will include history,
      physical examination including vital signs, and laboratories including complete blood count
      and comprehensive metabolic panel. Patients will keep a drug diary to document adherence to
      oral therapy. Radiographic response evaluation per RECIST will occur every 8 weeks (2 cycles)
      for cycles 1-6 and then every 12 weeks thereafter with high-resolution CT scan. Patients with
      suspected bone-only lesions must have bone lesions assessed by CT with bone windows or by
      bone scan at screening.

      Phase I: We will use a standard 3+3 design for the dose finding lead in to establish the
      recommended phase II doses for the combination of palbociclib and bicalutamide. The doses for
      Phase I will be determined based on the dose level to which the patient is accrued.

      Phase II: Treatment consists of bicalutamide orally once daily and palbociclib will be given
      orally daily for 3 weeks on followed by 1 week off at the doses determined in phase I.

    <description>This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase I/II trial for patients with AR(+) MBC . There will be a dose finding phase I portion of the study to establish the recommended phase II dose (R2PD). This will be followed by a phase II where efficacy is evaluated. Patients with AR(+)ER(-) breast cancer treated on the phase I at the recommended phase II dose will be counted towards the primary endpoint analysis for the phase II study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be eligible for androgen receptor expression testing (STEP 1) if the
        following criteria are met:

          -  Female

          -  Pathologically confirmed invasive cancer of the breast

          -  ER/PR status (ER or PR defined as positive if ≥1%; ER/PR is defined as negative if

          -  Patient may receive bisphosphonates/denosumab for the palliation of bone metastases

          -  If patient has a history of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease, lesions must
             be stable for at least 3 months (as documented by either head CT or brain MRI)

          -  Prior treatment with bicalutamide will not be allowed

          -  At least 3 weeks from major surgery with full recovery

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Postmenopausal. Use of LHRH agonist permitted.

          -  Patients must not have another, non-breast, active malignancy that requires treatment.

          -  The effects of palbociclib on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence). Women must not
             breast feed while on study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Ability to swallow intact palbociclib capsules and bicalutamide tablets.

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below (ULN indicates institutional upper
             limit of normal):

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 10^9/

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN except for patients with known Gilbert syndrome

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 institutional ULN

               -  Plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN or Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 mL/min (calculated by
                  Cockcroft-Gault method)

               -  QTc interval ≤ 470 msec

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events of prior therapy to ≤ NCI
             CTCAEv4.0 Grade 1.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational anti-cancer agents.

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor

             active infection, including HIV, active hepatitis B or C, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia (specifically, uncontrolled
             atrial fibrillation or ventricular dysrhythmias except ventricular premature
             contractions), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women and women who are breast-feeding.

          -  Patients with a history of long-QT syndrome or documented family history of long-QT
             syndrome. Patients who must remain on drugs that prolong the QT interval.

          -  Palbociclib is a substrate of CYP3A. Caution should be exercised when dosing
             palbociclib concurrently with CYP3A inducers or inhibitors. Furthermore, patients who
             are taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of
             CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk.
