  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence related to intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) is a severe form
      of incontinence that may have a major impact on the quality of life. The main treatment is
      surgical and consists in the implantation of medical devices such as the artificial urinary
      sphincter, adjustable continence therapy, compressive sling, or injection of bulking agent.

      The investigator has developed a new therapeutic strategy for ISD that consist to implant
      myofibers with their attached satellite cells (the main source of muscle progenitor cells) at
      the vicinity of the striated urethral sphincter. The principle of this method relies on the
      in vivo activation of satellite cells leading to the formation of regenerated myofibers
      (myotubes) generating a distinct and tonic muscular activity . The proof of concept was
      investigated in a Phase I clinical trial: Investigator found that the periurethral
      implantation of myofiber strips around the urethra generated an electromyographic activity
      improving urethral closure pressure in women with severe urinary incontinence associated to
      ISD. In this previous study, the technique of myofiber implantation was invasive, as it
      required a surgical approach and dissection of the urethra to place the myofiber. For the
      clinical trial IPSMA, the investigator sought to optimize the myofiber transplantation
      process using a method injection of myofibers core obtained by hydro-dissection. The
      injection technique is performed percutaneously under fluoroscopic and endoscopic control and
      does not require a surgical approach of the urethra.

      This clinical trial is prospective, open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single-center
      for the first stage and multicenter for the second stage, of 13 months for each patient aims
      to assess the efficacy and safety of IPSMA in the treatment of urinary incontinence in women
      with ISD.

      The investigator chose an assessment method in 2 stages according to the Simon plane . A
      total of 38 patients are needed. Assuming a ratio of 10% of lost patients or for which the
      primary endpoint was not evaluable, 4 additional patients will be included totaling 42
      patients will be included.

      This trial is single-center for the first stage and multicenter for the second stage.

      11 patients will be included in the first stage and 31 patients in the second stage.
