    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of alpha-D Glucosamine
      Sulfate/Standardized Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaf versus a comparator product on
      osteoarthritis pain as assessed by the between group change in WOMAC™ Osteoarthritis Index
      Pain Subscale using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores in subjects with osteoarthritis of the
      knee.
