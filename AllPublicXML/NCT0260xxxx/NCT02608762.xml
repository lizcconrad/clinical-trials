      Background: Neurobehavioral functions and quality of life (QoL) are the important outcome
      measurements after radiotherapy in patients with brain tumors and even head/neck cancers.
      However, few studies have focused on neurobehavioral functions and QoL after anti-cancer
      treatment particularly brain radiotherapy for pediatric/adolescent patients with brain
      tumors. This study thus aims to prospectively evaluate those functions in pediatric or
      adolescent patients with brain or head/neck tumors in order to provide useful information
      about their clinical outcomes.

      Methods: A total of 72 pediatric/adolescent patients, who are diagnosed with brain tumors or
      head/neck cancers, were prospectively recruited. Neurobehavioral functions will be evaluated
      using a neuropsychological battery, which includes general cognitive functions, intelligence,
      memory, executive functions, information processing and emotional/behavioral expressions. The
      QoL will be evaluated by the health-related QoL questionnaire. All participants will be
      examined at six phases, which include pre-treatment, 1-month post-treatment, 4-month
      post-treatment, 1-year post-treatment, 2-year post-treatment and 3-year post-treatment.

      Expected results: Patients'neurobehavioral functions and QoL will show significant
      improvement after treatment, and the improvement will not be diminished across each
      post-treatment phase.

    <description>In this study, evaluations of neurocognitive functions include memory scores of verbal memory (NEPSY-II),memory scores of non-verbal memory (NEPSY-II) raw scores of executive functions (NEPSY-II), raw scores of processing speed (NEPSY-II), raw scores of attention (Continuous Performance Test, CPT).
Evaluations of psychosocial adjustments mainly include severity scores of behavioral problems (Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment),scores of behavioral problems(Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale), scores of parental stress (Parenting Stress Index, PSI) and scores on the scale for quality of life (Child Health Questionnaire, CHQ).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients diagnosed with brain tumors or head/neck cancers who are no older
             than 18 years old

          -  Patients should be considered indicated for receiving the subsequent course of local
             radiotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received radiotherapy once before

          -  Patients have visual and/or hearing impairments which obviously impede the
             administration of neurocognitive assessment

          -  Patients cannot underwent brain MRI examination because of clinical contraindications,
             such as renal insufficiency (GFR &lt;30)
