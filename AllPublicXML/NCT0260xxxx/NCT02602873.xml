    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is recommended to be the first line therapeutic medication within the several
      immunosuppressive agents when treating refractory pediatric nephrotic syndrome, because of
      its definite efficacy and low toxicity. But there are still some key problems which hinder
      the using of tacrolimus in clinic, such as its narrow therapeutic widow, great individual
      difference of pharmacokinetics. Routine therapeutic drug monitoring(TDM) is needed in
      practice. But the disadvantage of TDM is hysteresis, which could lead to treatment failure or
      toxicity. To find out the reasons of great pharmacokinetic difference between patients and
      find out the individual proper dosage before administration are important for the clinical
      using of tacrolimus.

      It is hot in research of tacrolimus in organ transplant field, such as the association
      between gene polymorphisms of cytochrome P-450 3A4, 3A5 and multiple drug resistant
      gene(MDR1) and concentration of tacrolimus. However, there is few study about
      pharmacogenomics and metabonomics of tacrolimus in patients of nephrotic syndrome.

      The aim is to study the relationships between pharmacogenomics, metabonomics of tacrolimus
      and its efficacy, toxicity and blood concentration in patients of nephrotic syndrome, to find
      out the exact dosage before administration, to provide reference to individual drug
      administration.

      Investigators will collect data about efficacy and adverse drug reaction(ADR) such as time of
      efficacy when evaluated, how to evaluate ADR, data of demography, etc.
