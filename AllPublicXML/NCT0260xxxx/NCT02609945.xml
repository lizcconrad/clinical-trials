      This study is the first study in humans with CVT-427 (zolmitriptan inhalation powder) and is
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of single ascending doses of CVT-427 in
      adult healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of single, inhaled doses of CVT-427
           (zolmitriptan inhalation powder) in healthy adults, with special emphasis on
           cardiopulmonary effects.

        -  To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single, inhaled doses of CVT-427, Zomig®
           Tablet, and Zomig® Nasal Spray in healthy adults.

Periods 3-6: Subjects will receive CVT-427 (dose levels (DL) 1, 2, 3 and 4), administered in ascending order provided that safety and tolerability data are observed to be adequate to allow dose escalation, approximately 24 hours after preceding DL.</description>

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 30 kg/m2;

          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) greater than 80% of predicted for race,
             age, sex, and height and FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio greater than or equal
             to 70%;

          -  No history of asthma;

          -  Non-smoking for at least 5 years;

          -  In good general health with no clinically significant abnormalities or recognized
             cardiovascular risk factors that preclude use of triptans and that would interfere
             with participation in this study as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory test results; and negative
             tests for drug and alcohol, serology, and for pregnancy for female subjects of
