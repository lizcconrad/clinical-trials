  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that insufficient iodine intakes impairs the production of thyroid hormones,
      essential for cognitive development and healthy growth.

      Although the World Health Organization (WHO) promotes public health measures for an adequate
      iodine consumption, it is estimated that one in three school age children remain iodine
      deficient worldwide. Whereas there is no mandatory iodisation programs in Portugal, young
      infants are among the most vulnerable to iodine deficiency due to their special requirements.

      Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate iodine status in school age Portuguese children
      (6-12y), compare iodine status in children, cognitive outcomes and thyroid health and monitor
      the use of iodised salt in school canteens exploring potential implications in children's
      iodine status.

      Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones, especially
      during periods of increased susceptibility, are crucial for neurodevelopment. Inadequate
      levels of iodine in the diet may lead to a strong and decisive cognitive impairment which
      poses a major public health challenge. The World Health Organization prioritized the intake
      of iodine and recommends the universal enrichment of salt with iodine, so it may reach the
      general population. In 2013 the Portuguese Department of Education (DGE) issued, as a result
      of the collaboration with the Portuguese Department of Health (DGS) under the National
      Program to Promote Healthy Eating a directive introducing the use of iodized salt in school
      canteens. To ensure the effectiveness and the impact of these policies in Portugal, this
      project aims to (1) evaluate urinary iodine status in school children (6-12 y), (2) monitor
      the use of iodized salt in schools, (3) explore potential associations between these
      parameters. The results of this project will be used to educate food service professionals
      regarding the use of iodized salt and inform the community about the impact of iodine in
      health, based on the Norwegian model.

      In this study a total of 4800 school aged children will be recruited from approximately 160
      schools in the north of Portugal. Parents will be asked to complete the CBCL 6-18, Child
      Behaviour Checklist and a comprehensive questionnaire which will collect data regarding the
      child lifestyle and diet. A urine sample will be collected from each participant in school
      and the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices will be applied to evaluate children cognitive
      performance. Anthropometry measurements will be also collected.
