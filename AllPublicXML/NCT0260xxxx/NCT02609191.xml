    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to validate the measurement characteristics of a new bone
      densitometer, the Stratos DR:

        -  Via cross calibration to the results of body composition (BC) measurement results to
           those of a reference device (the &quot;Discover A&quot; by Hologic) in terms of body fat
           percentage, lean mass percentage of total body mass and for different subregions (left
           and right arms, left and right sides, lumbar and thoracic spine, pelvis, left and right
           legs, head, android area, gynecoid area, visceral region).

        -  And by the evaluation of the reproducibility of the BC measurement results in terms of
           fat mass and lean mass.

      The secondary objective of this study is to cross calibrate the measures of bone mineral
      content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) from the Stratos DR against those of the
      Discovery A on the whole body and its subregions.
