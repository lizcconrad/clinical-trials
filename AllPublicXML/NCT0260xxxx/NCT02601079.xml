    <textblock>
      Endodrill is a new instrument for biopsy sampling in the GI-channel. The purposes of this
      study are as follows:

        -  Compare the Endodrill instrument with conventional biopsy forceps in terms of ability to
           establish the correct diagnosis based on collected biopsies of tumors in the upper GI
           tract.

        -  Based on the quality of the collected tissue samples we want to evaluate which
           instrument generates the most useful material for genetic studies of the tumor.

      Endodrill is a newly constructed biopsy tool for flexible endoscopic use. It uses a drilling
      motion within a casing to harvest solid biopsies from tissue through the biopsy channel of a
      conventional flexible endoscope. It was originally designed for sampling of tissue from
      submucosal lesions. The investigators´ first study of the instrument is now finished.
      Endodrill is safe to use and generates more submucosal tissue compared to biopsies with a
      conventional biopsy forceps.

      In this study the investigators want to compare the Endodrill instrument´s ability to obtain
      representative tissue samples from tumors in the distal esophagus and cardia with a
      conventional biopsy forceps. In addition the investigators want to compare the tissue samples
      in terms of weight, quality, artefacts and whether either instrument is more suited for
      collecting tissue for genetic analysis. Such analysis will be conducted with Next-Generation
      Sequensing (NGS) of the whole exome, Whole Exome Sequensing (WES). In the event of positive
      results from these analysis the investigators will also conduct RNA-sequencing of the tumor
      tissue in order to start pre-operative mapping of genetic abnormalities.

      20 patients will be enrolled for this study. For each patient the investigators will collect
      10 biopsies, 5 biopsies each with conventional biopsy and the Endodrill instrument
      respectively. The order will be randomized for each patient. For each specific biopsy the
      investigator will choose a particular site on the suspected tumor tissue without knowing
      which instrument that will be used for the biopsy. This procedure will be repeated for all 10
      biopsies.

    <description>4 out of 8 biopsies taken with a conventional biopsy forceps from the tumor tissue in the distal esophagus and cardia. The biopsies will be taken in random order &quot;blinded&quot; for the person performing the examination. 1 additional biopsy will be taken from the tumor tissue in order to be evaluated for appropriateness of further genetic analysis. Both type of biopsies will be taken from the same patient. In total 10 biopsies per patient.</description>
