    <textblock>
      Patients with HBeAG positive, chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection will receive either
      ARC-520 or placebo in combination with entecavir or tenofovir, and be evaluated for safety
      and efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study of
      ARC-520 in combination with entecavir or tenofovir administered to patients with HBeAg
      positive and immune active chronic HBV infection Eligible patients who have signed an Ethics
      Committee - approved informed consent, will be enrolled and will receive ARC-520 or placebo
      in combination with entecavir or tenofovir. The study will enroll up to a total of 90
      eligible chronic HBV infected patients. Patients will undergo the following evaluations at
      regular intervals during the study: medical history, physical examinations, vital sign
      measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature), weight, adverse
      events assessment (AEs), 12 lead ECGs, liver fibrosis testing, concomitant medication
      assessment, blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry, lactate,
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) measures (in a subset of patients), exploratory Pharmacodynamic (PD)
      measures, urinalysis, HBV serology, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) testing
      (post-menopausal females) and pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential.
      Clinically significant changes including AEs will be followed until resolution, until the
      condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the patient is lost to
      follow-up. For each patient the duration of the study is approximately 33 weeks from
      screening to the Day 169 follow-up visit. For patients enrolling into a planned extension
      study, the total duration of this study is approximately 25 weeks from screening to Day 113
      end of study visit.
