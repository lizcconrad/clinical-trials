  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's disease is a state of chronic endogenous glucocorticoid excess. Cushing's disease
      is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have pinpointed the
      frequency of somatic sequelas and persistent alteration in quality of life despite the cure
      of the disease. More specifically, a few studies have described persistent psychopathology,
      maladaptive personality and cognitive impairments in patients with a history of Cushing's
      disease. Among these, hippocampal memory deficits have been found in the majority of studies,
      a finding that is consistent with the alterations described in hippocampal neurons during
      chronic exposure to glucocorticoids. However, the tools currently available to assess
      hippocampal-dependent memory are multiple, sometimes difficult to perform by clinicians and
      to analyze or may lack of diagnostic sensitivity. The investigators have recently developed
      an original tool, the virtual radial task in 3D, which has shown to be reliable to detect
      subtle alterations in hippocampal-dependent memory in several human diseases. The primary aim
      of the study is the evaluation of persistent cognitive impairments (hippocampal memory) in
      patients cured of Cushing's disease for at least one year using the virtual radial task in 3D
      and to compare it with that obtained with classical cognitive tests.
