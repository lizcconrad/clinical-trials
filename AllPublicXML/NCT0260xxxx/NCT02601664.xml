    <textblock>
      Design: Single center, single-blind randomized controlled trial of patients with high risk
      native coronary artery lesions (defined as ≥2 contiguous yellow blocks on the block
      chemogram) requiring clinically indicated percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients will
      be randomized to either a combined intervention or conventional PCI. Cardiac biomarker
      measurements will be performed before PCI and 18-24 hours later.

      Treatment: Combined intervention consisting of pre-PCI intracoronary vasodilator and
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration, use of an EPD if technically feasible, and
      complete coverage of the lipid core plaque, if technically feasible.

      Control: Conventional PCI. Duration: 30 days follow-up. The primary trial objective is to
      compare the incidence and size of periprocedural MI, as assessed by the peak post-PCI
      troponin distribution in the two study groups.

      The secondary endpoints are: (1) Reduction in the incidence of &gt;3x and &gt;10x upper limit of
      normal increase in CK-MB. (2) Reduction in the incidence of slow flow/no-reflow post PCI. (3)
      Lower incidence of major adverse cardiac events, defined as the composite of death, acute
      coronary syndrome, or coronary revascularization) during 30-day follow-up.
