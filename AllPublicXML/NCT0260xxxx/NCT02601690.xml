      This is a research study intending to look at the response of a specific type of allergy
      cells in the blood (called T cells) to a a type of immunotherapy product known as SPIREs
      (Synthetic Peptide Immuno-Regulatory Epitopes), across a broad range of subjects. This is a
      non-interventional study in which no investigational product will be administered to any
      subject.

          2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          3. One year history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to one or more of cat, short ragweed,
             Rye grass, or HDM.

             to the visit.

          3. Vaccination/ inoculation within the 6 weeks prior to the first visit.

          4. A history of any significant disease or disorder (e.g. autoimmune, cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine,
             metabolic, neoplastic/malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment, severe atopic
             dermatitis).

          5. Subjects who have taken an investigational drug within 6 weeks prior to the visit or
             are currently participating in any other clinical study.

          6. Recent blood donation of an amount of &gt;100 mL.

          7. Immunotherapy within the last 5 years to any of the allergens for which a subject
             would otherwise be eligible on the basis of clinical history and skin prick test
             result.
