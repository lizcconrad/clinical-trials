      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, 1:1 parallel control and single dose
      administration study design. Healthy subjects will be matched to moderate hepatic function
      impaired (Child-Pugh B，7-9) subjects in age, gender and weight as parallel control, which
      matches healthy with normal hepatic function according to the of subjects with impaired
      hepatic function as, after enrollment of subjects with moderate impaired hepatic function
      (Child-Pugh B，7-9). Hepatic function impaired group and control group both receive orally
      single-dose of nemonoxacin malate capsule (0.5g). Collect the blood and urine samples before
      and after the administration to perform pharmacokinetic analysis and safety observation.
