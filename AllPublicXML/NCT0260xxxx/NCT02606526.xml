  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BCG vaccination may have non-specific effects (NSE) i.e., additional benefits on childhood
      morbidity and mortality that are separate the vaccine's effect on the incidence of
      disseminated tuberculosis. Though the available literature is mostly from observational study
      designs, and is fraught with controversy, BCG vaccination at birth, in a high risk population
      of HIV exposed children, may protect infants against serious infections other than TB. Yet,
      other studies indicate that giving BCG later in infancy, when the immune system is more
      mature, may offer even greater protection. The appropriate timing of BCG vaccination could
      therefore be up for revision. This study will therefore compare BCG vaccination at birth with
      BCG vaccination at 14 weeks of age in HIV exposed (HE) babies.

      Methods: This is an individually randomized clinical trial in 2,200 HIV exposed infants. The
      intervention is an intra-dermal administration of 0.05 ml of BCG vaccine within 24 hours of
      birth while the comparator will be an intra-dermal administration of 0.05ml of BCG vaccine at
      14 weeks of age.

      The main study outcomes include:

        1. Severe illness in the first 14 weeks of life,

        2. TNF, IL‑1b, IL-6 and IFN-γ in response to mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial antigens
           and

        3. Severe illness in the first 14-52 weeks and 0-52 weeks of life.

      The study will be carried in two health Center IIIs and a health center IV in Uganda.

      Implications: A well-timed BCG vaccination could have important additional benefits in HE
      infants. This trial could inform the development of programmatically appropriate timing of
      BCG vaccination for HE infants.

Among children ≥2 months of age, severe illness (other than TB) will be defined as illness that: is associated with at least one of the following danger signs observed by a clinician: inability to drink or breastfeed lethargy or unconsciousness, vomiting of all feeds, convulsions or a history of convulsions, and/or results in hospitalization and/or results in death. Hospitalization and death resulting from violent injury or burns will not contribute to the severe illness definition.</description>
