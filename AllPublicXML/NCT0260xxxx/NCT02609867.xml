      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and short-term effectiveness of
      implantation of 'Flowise Cerebral Flow Diverter' for the treatment of unruptured wide-necked
      cerebral aneurysm in the internal carotid artery.

    <textblock>
      Flowise is indicated for use in patients with unruptured wide-necked aneurysm in the internal
      carotid artery. Consecutive subject data should be collected at discharge, 1, 3, and 6 month
      post Flowise implantation.
