  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to discover how 18F-cholineFCH distributes in the body, and
      see if it can distinguish active histiocytes (tumor) from inflammatory (non- tumor) cells.
      This tracer has the potential to give the investigators' team more information when trying to
      identify the tumor cells that are most important to collect with biopsy. In addition, the
      study will measure levels of 18F-cholineFCH in the biopsy tissue.
