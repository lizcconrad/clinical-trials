  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epileptic encephalopathy is very common in children and adolescent with epilepsy, but there
      is no data in clinical studies.The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      long-term vagus nerve stimulation for children and adolescent with epilepsy
