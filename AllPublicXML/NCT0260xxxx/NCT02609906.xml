  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humeral fractures are with an incidence of 4-5% the third most common fractures in
      the elderly. Compared to fractures of the upper limb it is the second most common fracture
      after distal radial fractures. 65% of all patients with a proximal humeral fracture are older
      than 60 years. Being aware of the demographic change there will even be an increase of
      incidence of these fractures. Kannus et al. showed an incidence of 298 per 100,000 in the at
      least 80 years old patients in 2007. Palvanen et al. predict an increase of incidence of 50%
      until 2030.

      Approximately 80% of all humeral fractures are minimally or non-displaced and can be treated
      conservatively with a good functional result. In 20% of humeral fractures there is an
      indication for surgical treatment according to the modified Neer-Criteria. These criteria are
      fulfilled if there is an angulation of at least 45 degrees between fracture fragments, a
      displacement of the humeral shaft against the humeral head of at least 1 cm or a dislocation
      of the tuberculum of at least 5 mm.

      Up to now there is evidence for superiority of any surgical treatment in literature. At the
      moment the most frequently used surgical technique for treatment of proximal humeral
      fractures is the angle stable plate fixation. There are various publications concerning this
      topic published by the investigators research group. In their 10-years results a majority of
      patients showed excellent and good, but also 16% showed unsatisfactory results after locking
      plate fixation. Main risk for poor outcome was revision surgery caused by secondary
      displacement (14%) which is also confirmed by results of other studies. In a further study
      investigators could show that there is a higher risk for secondary displacement in
      2-part-fractures with a gross primary dislocation or a large metaphyseal fracture zone (AO
      11-A3), especially in osteoporotic patients. More over these are common fractures and because
      of that a problem in surgical treatment.

      A secondary varus dislocation of the head fragment and cutting-out are the most common
      complications of angle stable locking plates in AO 11-A3 fractures of the elderly. The
      primary reason for this mechanism of failure is certain instability of transmetaphyseal
      fractures in the region of the surgical neck caused by loss of impaction in a porous
      spongiosa. Because of that the forces on the head screws are high while the so called
      screw-bone-interface is rather weak after a surgical treatment.

      Currently there exist various approaches to avoid a failure of the primary screw
      implantation. One possibility to increase the stability of the screw-bone-interface is the
      cement augmentation of the screw tips. To date there exist no clinical study that reports the
      results of locking plate fixation and the augmentation of cannulated head screws although it
      is a widely used method in everyday surgery, especially in the elderly.

      A second possibility to prevent secondary displacement after surgical treatment of
      2-fragment-fractures is the use of an intramedullary nails. A further development of
      intramedullary nails is multiplanar nailing. Screws can be inserted in various different
      levels and directions which can lead to a clearly higher stability.

      A comparison of these two treatment options augmented locking plate versus multiplanar angle
      stable locking nail in 2-part proximal humeral fractures has not been carried out up to now.

      Because of the lack of clinical studies which compare cement augmented locking plates with
      multiplanar humeral nail systems after 2-part proximal humeral fractures, the decision of
      surgical method currently depends only on surgeons favour. Because only a randomized clinical
      trial (RCT) can sufficiently answer the question if one treatment option provides advantages
      compared to the other method we are planning to perform a RCT.

      Investigators hypothesis: The cement augmented angle stable plate fixation system PhilosTM
      with augmentation (Depuy-Synthes) achieves significant differences concerning intra- and
      postoperative complication and revision rate, functional outcome and patient satisfaction
      compared to the multiplanar proximal MultiLoc®-Nail (Depuy-Synthes) in terms of Disabilities
      of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand-Score (DASH) Constant Score (CS), American Shoulder and Elbow
      Score (ASES), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Range of motion (ROM) and Short Form 36 (SF-36).
