  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E is characteristic by sporadic and local epidemic around the world, and mainly
      infects adults aged 15 to 40 years old, resulting in the infection rate ranged from 1% to
      15%. The investigational hepatitis E vaccine is a recombinant aluminium-adjuvant hepatitis E
      vaccine.

      This is a single center, randomized, blinding, parallel-controlled phase Ib clinical trial.
      This study will determine the safety and immunogenicity of the investigational recombinant
      hepatitis E vaccine in healthy adults between 16 and 65 years.
