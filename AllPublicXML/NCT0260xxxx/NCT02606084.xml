  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      intranasally administered esketamine in participants with impaired renal function when
      compared to participants with normal renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-dose,
      single-center, parallel group study to characterize the pharmacokinetics and safety of a
      single 28 milligram (mg) dose of esketamine in both participants with varying stages of renal
      impairment and healthy participants. A total of approximately 32 medically stable men and
      women with varying degrees of renal function impairment or no renal impairment will be
      enrolled. The study consists of a Screening period of up to Days -21 to -2, open label phase
      of Days -1 to 4, and end-of-study (11 plus [+] or minus [-] 2 days after final dose). The
      participants will be assigned to 1 of 4 groups (8 participants per group) based on creatinine
      clearance (CLCR,m). Safety and tolerability will be assessed from the time of consent until
      the end of the study.
