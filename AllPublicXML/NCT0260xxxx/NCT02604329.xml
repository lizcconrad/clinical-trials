  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low Level Laser Therapy has been used for a few years in some pediatric hospital centers for
      chemo- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis care. It may promote ulceration's healing,
      limits mucositis severity and associated pain. As its use is recommended in the treatment of
      radio induced mucositis in adults, the level of evidence in pediatric studies does not allow
      a precise treatment protocol. The investigators present here the protocol of a feasibility
      study in the haemato-oncology department of the Children University Hospital of Toulouse,
      with the view to a future efficacy study.

      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using low level laser therapy (LLLT) in the
      haemato-oncology department of the Children University Hospital of Toulouse. The feasibility
      will be considered as acceptable if 60% of patients hospitalized for oral mucositis had
      successfully benefit from the procedure. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of
      efficacy of LLLT on pain and mucositis grade, the evaluation of tolerance of this treatment
      and the medical time needed for this supportive care. The athermic phototherapy laser diode
      will be used by scanning the entire oral mucosa area. It will be applied uniformly every two
      days as long as grade of mucositis is 2 or more, with a fluence of 4J/cm², under two
      wavelengths (635 nm and 815 nm).

    <description>The procedure is successful when low level laser has been used on all the oral mucosa minimum 3 times in the first 7 days of mucositis of grade 2.
The failure of the procedure is therefore declared if the laser was applied within 3 times within 7 days.</description>

    <description>The athermic phototherapy laser diode will be used by scanning the entire oral mucosa, including cheek and lip mucosa, gums, palate, tongue and floor of the mouth. It will be applied uniformly every two days as long as the grade of mucositis is 2 or more, with a fluence of 4J/cm², under two wavelengths (635 nm and 815 nm).
Cheeks will be scanned extra-orally with laser fiber during 50 seconds, at the fluence of 4J/cm², associating two wavelengths : infra-red (815 nm, 3850mW) and red (635 nm, 150mW).
Intra-orally, the fiber will be used to scan each area of mucositis during 30 seconds per area of 2 cm2, at 1cm from the mucosa; the power at 635 nm will be 150 milliwatts and 150 milliwatts at 815 nm.</description>
