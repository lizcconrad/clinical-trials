  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sinai Vein Stent Registry aims to establish and maintain a registry of patients who have
      undergone a vein stent placement procedure at The Mount Sinai Medical Center. The purpose of
      this study is to monitor and evaluate the long-term outcomes of venous stents placed to treat
      venous outflow obstruction. Outcome variables that will be assessed are: patency rate,
      reintervention rate, occurrence of any complications, clinical improvement, and quality of
      life. Venous outflow obstruction is defined as a stenosis and/or occlusion seen primarily in
      the ilio-femoral vein and inferior vena cava, and infrequently in the subclavian vein,
      brachiocephalic vein, or superior vena cava. While vein stent placement procedures are
      currently being performed in the United States, using stents which are commercially available
      and FDA-approved for use in arterial interventions, at this time there are no stents that are
      FDA-approved for use in veins. The placement of stents in veins holds tremendous promise as a
      treatment for venous outflow obstruction, but review of current literature has showed a
      paucity of published data on the long-term outcomes of this treatment.

      The study is composed of two arms, a retrospective arm and a prospective arm. Any patient
      over the age of 18 who has undergone or is scheduled to undergo a vein stent placement
      procedure is eligible for this study. A HIPAA waiver and waiver of informed consent are being
      requested for the retrospective arm for patients who have undergone a vein stent placement
      procedure from January 1st 2012 to date of study onset, as it is not possible to contact all
      patients in the retrospective arm (i.e., lost to follow-up, no longer follows-up with a study
      physician). This study is only interested in the collection and analysis of data; the
      clinical care and outcomes of research subjects will not be affected by their participation
      in this study.

      An IDE application has been submitted to the FDA for use of the Wallstent™ (manufactured by
      Boston Scientific, Inc.) in veins as treatment for venous outflow obstruction. The primary
      stents being used as treatment for venous outflow obstruction at Mount Sinai is the
      Wallstent™, mainly due to the fact that only Wallstents™ are available in the appropriate
      sizes to be used in veins. In rare occasions or exceptional circumstances, a smaller
      self-expanding nitinol stent may be used. Due to the extremely rare frequency of stents other
      than Wallstents™ being used and the impracticality (if not impossibility) of obtaining IDEs
      for all other stents, the investigators believe it is appropriate to exclude usage of these
      stents from the study data. To confirm, the purpose of this study is to monitor and evaluate
      long-term outcomes of the venous stents/the vein stent placement procedure, not specifically
      the Wallstent™ itself.
