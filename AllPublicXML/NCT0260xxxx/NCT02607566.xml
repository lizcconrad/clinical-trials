    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a twice weekly yoga program for
      adults with type 2 diabetes. Changes in perceived stress, salivary cortisol, and HbA1c will
      also be examined.

      The purpose of the current proposal is to test a yoga intervention for adults with T2DM and
      to gather data on the feasibility and acceptability of yoga compared to a contact control for
      glycemic control. The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled study with
      participants randomly assigned to 1) Yoga intervention, or 2) Group Walking program
      (control). Focus groups will be conducted with participants at the end of the intervention to
      identify facilitators and barriers to yoga practice and to examine their perceptions and
      beliefs about yoga and its relationship to stress and diabetes management. The investigators
      will explore the effect of yoga on stress (biomarker = salivary cortisol) that may act as a
      mechanism of action underlying the efficacy of yoga for improved glycemic control. The
      investigators will also measure HbA1c levels, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose at
      baseline, end of treatment (12-weeks), 6- and 9-month follow-ups. Study feasibility and
      acceptability will be assessed using participant recruitment, attendance and retention rates,
      and compliance with study protocols and general satisfaction with the program. Results from
      this study will provide scientific basis for a future larger clinical trial. Yoga, if found
      to offer advantages for glycemic control, can have potential for high impact on current
      practices of diabetes management.
