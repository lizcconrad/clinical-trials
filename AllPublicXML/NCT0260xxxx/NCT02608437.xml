    <textblock>
      Thi pahse I, dose-escalation trial will determine the MTD, safety and the additional benefit
      achieved from adding SGI-110 to ipilimumab therapy in metastatic melanoma patients.
      Preclinical evidence generated with SGI-110 in vivo demonstrated that besides having a direct
      activity on tumor growth as a single agent, SGI-110 was able to &quot;sensitize&quot; neoplastic cells
      to the anti-tumor activity of CTLA-4 blockade, providing a sound scientific rationale to
      develop new immunotherapeutic approaches combining SGI-110 with therapeutic mAb to immune
      check-points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epigenetic alterations play a pivotal role in cancer development and progression.
      Pharmacologic reversion of such alterations is feasible, and second generation &quot;epigenetic
      drugs&quot; are in development and have demonstrated to possess significant immunomodulatory
      properties. This knowledge, together with the availability of new and highly effective
      immuno-therapeutic agents including immune check-point(s) blocking monoclonal antibodies,
      allows us to plan for highly innovative proof-of-principle combination studies that will
      likely open the path to more effective anti-cancer therapies.

      Targeting immune check-point(s) with immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a novel
      and rapidly evolving strategy to treat cancer, that is rapidly spreading to different tumor
      histologies. The prototype approach of this therapeutic modality relies on the inhibition of
      negative signals delivered by CTLA-4 expressed on T lymphocytes. CTLA-4 blockade has
      profoundly changed the therapeutic landscape of metastatic melanoma (MM), significantly
      improving the survival of MM patients; however, objective clinical responses are limited, and
      only a minority of patients achieves long-term disease control.1 Therefore, several
      combination approaches are being explored to improve the efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade. Along
      this line, based on the preclinical evidence the investigators gained on the broad
      immunomodulatory activity of SGI-110, the exploratory phase 1 combination study NIBIT-M4 has
      been designed to provide proof-of-concept evidence to the immunologic and clinical efficacy
      of CTLA-4 blockade combined with DNA-HypomethylatingAgent (DHA). Progressing Stage III or
      Stage IV MM patients, amenable to serial tumor biopsies will be enrolled in the study.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the MTD of SGI-110 in combination with ipilimumab in 21 day cycles in melanoma patients. Endpoints related to this objective include an evaluation of Dose Limiting Toxicity(s). The MTD evaluation will be based on the DLT evaluable population.</description>

    <measure>Immune-related Time to Response (irTTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 24</time_frame>
    <description>Immune-related Time to Response (irTTR) is defined as the time from first dosing date until the measurement criteria are first met for overall response of irPR or irCR (whichever status comes first, and provided it is subsequently confirmed).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune-related Duration of Response (irDoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Immune-related Duration of Response (irDoR) for the subjects whose irBOR is irCR or irPR will be defined as the time between the date of response of confirmed irCR or confirmed irPR (whichever occurs first) and the date of irPD or death (whichever occurs first). The onset of a confirmed irCR or irPR is determined by the initial assessment of response, not by the confirmatory assessment. Note that if an assessment of irPR occurs before confirmation of irCR, the duration of immune-related response endpoint will not begin at the time that the irBOR of irCR is shown but rather at the earlier time-point showing irPR. For subjects who remain alive and have not progressed following response, irDoR will be censored on the date of last evaluable Tumor Assessment.</description>

    <measure>Immune-related progression free survival (irPFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Immune-related progression free survival (irPFS) per irRC will be defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of progression per irRC or death, whichever occurs first. A subject who dies without reported progression per irRC will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those subjects who remain alive and have not progressed, irPFS will be censored on the date of last evaluable Tumor Assesment. For those subjects who remain alive and have no recorded post baseline Tumor Assessment, irPFS will be censored on the day of last clinical evaluation.</description>
