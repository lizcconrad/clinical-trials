    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in the United States of America. The aim of this study is to estimate
      incidence rates of all malignant neoplasms, specific subgroups of malignant neoplasms, and
      acute pancreatitis among cohorts of antidiabetic drug users standardized to be representative
      of LEADER™ trial participants or liraglutide initiators within the Humedica Electronic Health
      Record (EHR) database.

        The study will include a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who
        initiated liraglutide and two cohorts of patients with T2DM standardized to have similar
        baseline covariates, including use of antidiabetic medicines, relative to the liraglutide
        initiators (the Liraglutide-like Cohort) and to participants in the LEADER™ Trial
        (LEADER™-like Cohort).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All Cohort Members: Members of each of the cohorts must have at least 12 months of
             baseline coverage within Humedica prior to the patients' index date (cohort- specific
             index dates are defined below). Within Humedica, baseline coverage will be defined as
             the date from the earliest observed encounter up to and including the index date.
             Patients must have at least 1 diagnosis of T2DM (250.X0 or 250.X2) prior to and
             including the date of the qualifying prescription, no prior diagnosis (inclusive of
             the index date) of T1DM (250.X1 or 250.X3) and no diagnosis of gestational diabetes
             within the previous 12 months (inclusive of the index date). Patients will not be
             eligible for inclusion if they have prior prescriptions for GLP-1 analogues (including
             liraglutide and exenatide) during the interval that would be considered the baseline
             period

          -  Liraglutide-like Cohort: To be eligible for inclusion in the Liraglutide-like Cohort,
             patients must have at least one qualifying prescription for an OAD. Qualifying OADs
             will be specified that share similar labelled or unlabelled indications as liraglutide

          -  LEADER™-like Cohort: To be eligible for inclusion in the LEADERTM-like Cohort,
             patients must meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Patients will be
             eligible for inclusion after meeting the overall inclusion and exclusion criteria in
             addition to the following: Ages 50 and over. HbA1c at least 7%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the LEADER™-like Cohort if any of the following are
             observed prior to meeting the inclusion criteria defined above: Calcitonin &gt;= 50ng/L.
             Baseline DPP-4 or pramlintide. Chronic heart failure diagnosis, NYHA Class IV. Acute
             coronary or cerebrovascular event within 14 days prior to initiation. Current
             continuous renal replacement therapy. End-stage liver disease. Solid organ transplant.
