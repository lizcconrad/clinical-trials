      The PROP UP research study is funded by The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute
      (PCORI). PROP UP is a multi-centered prospective observational study that will evaluate
      all-oral treatment regimens for HCV regarding several patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such
      as HCV-associated symptoms, treatment side effects, medication adherence, out of pocket
      costs, comorbid conditions, and long-term benefits of cure and harms of treatment to compare
      PROs of different treatment regimens, treatment durations, and patient subgroups.
      Participants will be recruited from 9 U.S. liver centers. Approximately 1920 patients with
      HCV infection who are prescribed a regimen containing Harvoni®, Viekera Pak®, Zepatier®,
      DAC/SOF or SOF/VEL for chronic HCV will be recruited and approximately 1600 patients who are
      approved and begin HCV treatment will be enrolled in the longitudinal study. PRO surveys will
      be evaluated before, during and after HCV treatment.

      PROP UP is a collaborative effort between behavioral and biomedical researchers, a patient
      engagement group and a patient advocacy organization.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newer, more effective all-oral regimens for hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection are available.
      However the available data from industry-sponsored trials do not provide all the information
      that patients need, nor do these data represent the broad spectrum of patients treated in
      real-world practice. Trials also exclude disadvantaged subgroups, focus on short-term
      efficacy and clinician-rated adverse events, rarely obtain the patient's perspective, and do
      not investigate longer-term harms of treatment or benefits of viral cure. Given these
      informational gaps, patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) on treatment harms and benefits
      that matter most to patients, is needed.

      PROP UP is funded by The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). PROP UP is a
      multi-centered prospective observational study that will evaluate 5 newly approved DAA
      treatment regimens for HCV regarding several patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as
      HCV-associated symptoms, treatment side effects, medication adherence, out of pocket costs,
      comorbid conditions, and long-term benefits of cure and harms of treatment to compare PROs of
      different treatment regimens, treatment durations, and patient subgroups.

      PROP UP is a collaborative effort between researchers, a patient engagement group, and a
      patient advocacy organization. Nine U.S. liver centers will collaborate on PROP UP.
      Approximately 1920 patients with HCV infection who are prescribed a regimen containing
      Harvoni®, Viekera Pak®, Zepatier®, DAC/SOF or SOF/VEL for chronic HCV will be consented and
      will complete baseline PRO surveys. Approximately 1600 patients who are approved and begin
      HCV treatment will be enrolled in the longitudinal study. Participants will complete several
      PRO surveys at 5 assessment periods during the study: baseline, treatment week 4, end of
      treatment, 3 months post-treatment, and 12 months post-treatment. PRO survey data will be
      collected via 3 options: patient home-based computers, tablet, smartphone; phone-administered
      surveys with a centralized call enter; or at regular clinic visits.

      Analysis of PROs collected longitudinally before, during and after treatment for HCV will
      allow the investigators to answer a variety of questions important to patients and
      clinicians. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate: (a) prevalence of pre-existing
      baseline symptoms associated with HCV; (b) the development of new onset treatment side
      effects and exacerbation of pre-existing symptoms during HCV treatment; (c) medication
      adherence and out of pocket costs associated with treatment; (d) changes in HCV-associated
      symptoms and functional status in patients who are cured; (e) long-term patient-reported
      harms associated with treatments and long-term benefits associated with viral cure.

    <time_frame>Baseline through end of HCV treatment, up to 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall toxicity of treatment will be measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). The MSAS is a reliable and validated 32-item instrument that will be used to measure change in pre-existing HCV symptoms and new onset treatment side effects during HCV treatment. The MSAS evaluates 32 prevalent symptoms or side effects that commonly occur in medical populations and during medical treatments. Participants will indicate the presence or absence of a symptom/side effect, and if present, will rate the construct on severity, frequency and interference. An overall treatment toxicity score using all the items will be analyzed, as well as descriptive statistics about change in each symptom/side effect over time.</description>
