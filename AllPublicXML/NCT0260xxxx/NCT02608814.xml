      Pleural infection is a potentially serious infection of the fluid normally found around the
      lung and current evidence suggests its incidence is increasing in both adult and paediatric
      populations.

      Identification of bacterial pathogens causing pleural infection is of paramount importance in
      the clinical care of patients are currently, only 40% of patients have a laboratory confirmed
      microbiological diagnosis for their pleural infection. An unclear diagnosis can be due to
      various reasons such as a small sample volume therefore the aim of the AUDIO study is to
      ascertain the capacity of pleural biopsies in improving the microbiological yield of pleural
      infection.

      Currently, there are no well validated methods for identifying patients presenting with
      pleural infection on the basis of initial ultrasound imaging. The AUDIO study will define the
      role of baseline thoracic ultrasound in predicting the radiographic, clinical and surgical
      outcomes of patients with pleural infection.

      The AUDIO study aims to recruit 50 patients from 2 centres with specific pleural expertise
      and these patients will be followed up over a 12 month period. Investigators hope that
      through the information gathered from ultrasound imaging and pleural biopsies, it will aid
      physicians' clinical and therapeutic decision making when treating patients with pleural
      infection.

          -  A pleural fluid collection that may or (rarely according to clinical judgement) may
             not require drainage that meets at least one or more of the following criteria:

          -  Purulent

          -  Gram stain positive for bacteria
