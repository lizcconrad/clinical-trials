  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease responsible for an abnormal hemoglobin.The anomaly
      has several consequences: a low hemoglobin rate (chronic anemia), plugs formed by red blood
      cells in blood vessels (extremely painful vaso-occlusive crises) and greater susceptibility
      to infections.

      Patients with this disease should be monitored medically continuously from birth. At
      adulthood, they will pass from a pediatric medical care system to an adult medical care
      system.This transition can be experienced with more or less ease, depending on the
      organization within the pediatric and adult hospitals.

      This questionnaire aims to assess the quality of the transition between pediatric and adult
      services.The investigators want to better estimate hospital work and improve the quality of
      care for this type of patients, throughout their entire medical history.

      Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease responsible for an abnormal hemoglobin. It
      particularly affects populations with an African ascent (300 000 African children are born
      every year with this genetic anomaly).

      The anomaly has several consequences: a low hemoglobin rate (chronic anemia), plugs formed by
      red blood cells in blood vessels (extremely painful vaso-occlusive crises) and greater
      susceptibility to infections.

      The severity of sickle cell disease is variable among children. Some develop frequent and
      serious complications, while others don't. A child with sickle cell disease is hospitalized
      about a week a year in average (for a painful crisis, infection or worsening of anemia).

      Patients with this disease should be monitored medically continuously from birth. At
      adulthood, they will pass from a pediatric medical care system to an adult medical care
      system.This transition can be experienced with more or less ease, depending on the
      organization within the pediatric and adult hospitals.

      This questionnaire aims to assess the quality of the transition between pediatric and adult
      services.The investigators want to better estimate hospital work and improve the quality of
      care for this type of patients throughout their entire medical history.

    <description>Adult sickle cell disease patients will fill in a survey about the quality of their hospital care, in the transition period between the pediatric to an adult hospital care system.
Since filling in this survey is not part of the standard of care, this study has been defined as interventional.</description>
