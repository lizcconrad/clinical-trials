  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will incorporate a wide range of clinical variables
      associated with aging to determine whether they are associated with mutation status
      independent of chronologic age. Clinically, aging can be operationalized using geriatric
      assessment, which entails a comprehensive multi-dimensional assessment of the health of an
      older adult, including measures of comorbidity, polypharmacy, functional status, cognition,
      depression, falls, social activities and social support. Given that aging is heterogeneous,
      geriatric assessment allows greater specificity for aging than chronological age alone.

    <measure>Background mutation rate in hematopoietic stem cells from older adults regardless of a prior cancer diagnosis as measured by the number and frequency of hematopoietic-specific mutations</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>-The investigators will sequence the coding region of some or all of the genes in an individual's blood cells and compare results to their matched mouth cells to define hematopoietic-specific mutations. The number of hematopoietic-specific mutations per individual and the frequency of individuals with mutations will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Presence or absence of geriatric syndromes as measured by hematopoietic stem cell mutations</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 10 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Determine the natural history of mutations in older adults with clonal hematopoiesis as measured by risk to develop blood cancer/geriatric syndrome/illness</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>-Individuals with mutations will be followed longitudinally to monitor the fraction of hematopoietic cells with mutations, the functional consequences of mutations in their blood cells, and the risk of developing a blood cancer, geriatric syndrome, or other illness.</description>

    <description>Participants identified as having clonal hematopoiesis after analysis of their baseline blood draw will be asked to return every 6 months for repeat geriatric assessment and sample collection listed below.
Complete the self-administered geriatric assessments of Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (subscale of the OARS), Karnofsky Self-reported Performance Rating Scale, Number of Falls, Physical Health Section (subscale of the OARS), MOS Social Activity Survey, and Body Mass Index &amp; Unintentional Weight Loss at baseline and every 6 months until death.
Cognitive assessment and Timed Up and Go will be performed by a member of the research team at baseline and every 6 months until death.
Peripheral blood draw will occur at baseline and no more than every 6 months until death.
Buccal swabs will occur at baseline and repeated as necessary, but not more than every 6 months until death</description>
