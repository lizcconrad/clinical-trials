    <time_frame>PK plasma samples were taken at: 1 hour (h) before drug administration and 1h, 4h, 8h,12h, 24h, 48h, 60h, 72h, 84h, 96h, 108h, 120h, 132h, 144h, 168h, 216h, 336h, 504h, 672h, 840h, 1008h after drug administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum measured concentration of BI 695501 in plasma (Cmax). The rate and extent of absorption of BI 695501 by assessment of maximum plasma concentration following administration via AI or via PFS of a single dose of 40 mg BI 695501. During analysis, it was realized that the PK sample on Day 43 had originally been mistakenly associated with a 1032 h time point, rather than with 1008 h. However, PK parameters are calculated using actual values so this did not impact the analysis results.</description>
