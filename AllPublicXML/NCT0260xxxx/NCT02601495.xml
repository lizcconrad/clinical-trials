      In this study the investigators will seek to improve their understanding of how positive and
      negative valence systems, cognition, and arousal/interoception are inter-related in disorders
      of trauma, mood, substance use, and eating behavior for women involved in a court diversion
      program in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Women in Recovery). The investigators will recruit 100
      individuals and use a wide range of assessment tools, neuroimaging measures, blood and
      microbiome collections and behavioral tasks to complete the baseline and follow-up study
      visits. Upon completion, the investigators aim to have robust and reliable dimensional
      measures that quantify these systems and a set of assessments that should be recommended as a
      clinical tool to enhance outcome prediction for the clinician and assist in determining who
      will likely benefit from the diversion program, and to inform future revision or augmentation
      of the program to increase treatment effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroscience has made tremendous progress in understanding the basic neural circuitry that
      underlies important processes such as attention, memory, and basic emotion processing. Yet,
      little progress has been made to utilize these insights to apply them to psychiatric
      populations in order to make clinically meaningful predictions. The connection between
      psychiatric disorders and their underlying neurobiology has been difficult to establish. The
      overarching theme of this study is to determine how biological and objective behavioral
      measures can contribute to improving assessment and treatment of women who attend a court
      diversion program (Women in Recovery [WIR]) that includes treatment for mental health
      symptoms. The investigators will use the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research
      Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a heuristic approach that integrates neuroscience and
      psychopathology to study the positive and negative valence systems, cognition and
      arousal/interoception domains. Within this framework the investigators will study a group of
      treatment seeking individuals with mental health conditions to determine how dysfunctions of
      affect, substance use, and eating behavior organize across different levels and whether these
      latent factors can be used to generate clinically useful prediction.

      Using self-report, behavior, physiology, neural circuit, cell, molecule, and gene unit of
      analysis measures, the investigators propose to enroll 1000 individuals from four different
      cohorts over 5 years: (1) anxiety and/or depression; (2) eating problems; (3) substance use
      problems; and (4) healthy controls. Each individual will undergo a multi-level assessment
      that consists of (a) a standardized diagnostic assessment, (b) self-report questionnaires,
      (c) behavioral tasks, (d) physiological measurements, (e) structural and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG, (f) biomarker and microbiome assessments, (g) blood to
      derive induced pluripotent stem cells, (h) and genetic and epigenetic assessments. These
      individuals will be followed up for one year and will be re-assessed using a multi-domain
      assessment of functioning, which will include: (a) symptom severity and duration, (b)
      subjective well-being, (c) psychosocial function, (c) occupational function, (d) physical
      health, (e) utilization of mental health resources (treatment), and (f) compliance with
      treatment.
