  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a brief parent-based adolescent sexual
      health intervention called Families Talking Together Plus (FTT+). FTT+ is based on an
      established intervention called Families Talking Together (FTT) and will enhance FTT by
      adding modules on human papillomavirus (HPV). The goal of the study is to evaluate whether
      FTT will help parents increase sexual health communication, delay adolescent sexual debut,
      and increase HPV vaccination. FTT will be delivered to parents of minority youth and will be
      delivered by student nurses.
