      Nucleus accumbens/anterior limb of internal capsule play important roles in the process of
      treatment-refractory obsessive compulsive disorder, deep brain stimulation of nucleus
      accumbens/anterior limb of internal capsule will inhibit its activity and thus to effectively
      prevent the disorder.

      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions (persistent thoughts) and
      compulsions (repetitive ritualistic behaviour). Core symptoms of OCD cause remarkable
      distress and often perceived as inappropriate. The prevalence of OCD in the general
      population is estimated between 1% and 3%. It is a psychiatric illness that can lead to
      chronic functional impairment. Treatment options for OCD include cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy. Even when the best treatment options are used,
      approximately 10% of these patients remain severely affected and are considered
      therapy-refractory resulting in marked suffering and impairment in self-care, work and social
      life. More recently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been investigated as a therapy for
      refractory OCD, and the procedure was granted a limited humanitarian device exemption by the
      FDA in 2009. For these patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS), a neurosurgical treatment that
      involves stereotactic implantation of electrodes in specific deep-seated brain regions, has
      emerged as a new treatment option.
