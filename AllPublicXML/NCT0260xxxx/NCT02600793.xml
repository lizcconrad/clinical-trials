  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ceftaroline fosamil is an intravenous (IV) drug that belongs to a group of antibiotics called
      cephalosporins . Antibiotics are drugs used to treat infections. Clinical studies in adults
      patient shave shown ceftaroline fosamil to be effective against many bacteria that are
      resistant to other currently approved antibiotics. Some of these bacteria may be responsible
      for infections in the central nervous system.The main aim of this study is to gather
      information to determine how much of a single IV dose of ceftaroline fosamil will enter into
      a child's CSF so that the benefit of giving ceftaroline fosamil to children with infections
      can be better determined.

      Children 6 months to 17 years of age admitted to the hospital because of infected VPS
      (ventriculitis) will be eligible for the study. A total of twelve eligible patients will be
      included in the study. Eligible study subjects would be patients who have undergone VPS
      removal and placement of EVD tubing and are being treated with standard IV antibiotics for
      ventriculitis. CSF cultures are obtained before antibiotics treatment is initiated. Standard
      initial antibiotics regimen is usually IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin. The antibiotics regimen
      is subsequently adjusted based on the pathogen recovered from the CSF culture. Total IV
      antibiotic treatment is usually 14 days. Following clearance of the infection the patient
      undergoes new VPS insertion by neurosurgery service.
