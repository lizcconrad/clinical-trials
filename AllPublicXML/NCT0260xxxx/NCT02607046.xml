  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) results in blockages of arteries (blood vessels) and
      decreased blood flow to the legs. This may cause difficulty or pain with walking or other
      activities that use leg muscles. Exercise may help improve blood flow in the legs and improve
      the ability to walk. This research project will be conducted patients with PAD that require
      revascularization. The goal is to examine the effects of 3 months of exercise rehabilitation
      and neuromuscular stimulation on leg blood flow, physical function, quality of life and
      general health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and its associated declines in physical function impair
      quality of life (QOL) in nearly 20% of older Veterans and result in substantial VA health
      care costs. Revascularization addresses the anatomical pathology, but does not restore
      mobility function and QOL. Optimal therapy may require post-revascularization rehabilitation
      to address lingering defects in skeletal muscle that limit function; however, the current
      standard of care after revascularization does not include rehabilitation. Exercise training
      and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may enhance function by increasing muscle
      perfusion. Together, these two therapies may work in a complementary manner to improve
      outcomes in older Veterans with PAD after revascularization.

      The investigators will enroll Veterans (50-80 years of age) with PAD who are planned for
      percutaneous revascularization. Participants will complete research testing consisting of: a)
      Assessment of mobility function and QOL; b) Treadmill tests to assess ambulatory capacity,
      and calf muscle perfusion; and c) A gastrocnemius needle biopsy to measure capillary density
      and angiogenic growth factor expression. Participants will undergo baseline testing prior to
      revascularization and will repeat research testing 2-3 weeks after revascularization to
      determine the effect of only revascularization on functional outcomes. After
      post-revascularization testing, 52 patients will be randomized to one of four groups
      (Exercise-only, NMES-only, Exercise+NMES, or Standard Care; n=13/group). After completion of
      the 3-month intervention, participants will repeat all tests to determine the effects of the
      interventions compared to standard care.
