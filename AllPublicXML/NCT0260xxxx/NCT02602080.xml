    <textblock>
      Nausea after surgery may negatively influence patient satisfaction, may delay discharge, and
      cause unexpected hospital admissions. The trend toward ambulatory surgery has increased the
      focus on postoperative nausea, but published evidence is not based on standardized criteria
      for assessment. Therefore, the results for postoperative nausea are very diverse, especially
      reports on nausea incidence after regional anesthesia, i.e. spinal anesthesia. When
      peripheral nerve blocks have been applied for postoperative pain control, they significantly
      reduce postoperative pain, opioid consumption and side effects; patients receiving general
      anesthesia (GA) and nerve blocks are thought likely to have less nausea than patients
      receiving GA alone. This study is a pilot study looking at the incidence and intensity of
      nausea after orthopedic surgery under nerve blocks in foot and ankle (FA) patients and under
      nerve blocks with either sedation or GA in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) patients. The
      results of this study will help power a future randomized controlled trial, comparing the
      incidence and intensity of nausea in FA patients receiving GA through laryngeal mask airway
      (LMA) versus spinal anesthesia.
