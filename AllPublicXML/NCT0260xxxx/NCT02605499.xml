  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of UV-C light disinfection as an adjunct to routine daily and
      discharge patient room cleaning on patient infection and colonization with hospital
      associated bacteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective cleaning of the patient environment (the patient room during hospital stay) is
      subject to human factors and unfortunately is often inconsistent or inadequate. Patient rooms
      that have residual bacteria after routine environmental cleaning can act as reservoirs for
      multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and contribute to the spread of MDROs from patient to
      patient. In the setting of an increased focus on Healthcare-associated Infections such as
      Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and multidrug-resistant Gram negative and Gram positive
      organisms such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), vancomycin-resistant
      Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus (MRSA), Ultra-Violet C
      (UV-C) light has been shown to be a safe, effective way to decrease the burden of MDROs in
      patient rooms. However, studies examining the effectiveness of UV-C light when used post
      daily and discharge patient room cleaning are lacking.

      This study is a cluster, randomized, two-period cross over trial to investigate the
      relationship between environmental decontamination with UV-C light and transmission of VRE
      and other healthcare-associated bacteria. It investigates the hypothesis that UV-C in
      addition to daily cleaning leads to decreased patient acquisition of healthcare-associated
      bacteria.

      This study is important to further advance hospital-based infection prevention knowledge of
      the impact of UV-C light for environmental cleaning.
