  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to continue our program on PDE5 inhibition by evaluating effects on insulin
      resistance, including glucose metabolism and subclinical inflammation, after a 6-week
      administration of tadalafil in T2D patients. The primary objective is to study the effect of
      tadalafil compared with placebo on insulin sensitivity during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
      clamp.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with one study site. Twenty-five
      T2D patients will be recruited and randomized to per oral intake of tadalafil 20 mg o.d. for
      six weeks and after a wash-out period of eight weeks intake of placebo for another six weeks,
      or vice versa. At the end of each 6 week treatment period a glucose clamp, subcutaneous
      needle biopsies as well as muscle and subcutaneous microdialysis will be performed.
      Endothelial function tests and arginin stimulation of insulin secretion tests will be
      performed after 3 weeks in each treatment arm.
