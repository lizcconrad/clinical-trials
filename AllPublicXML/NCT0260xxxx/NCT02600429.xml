  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK) is a degenerative corneal disease that occurs as a result of
      partial or total impairment of trigeminal innervation. The resulting loss of corneal
      sensitivity (anesthesia) leads to a reduction in lacrimation and a decline in status,
      metabolism, and mitosis of corneal epithelial cells. Previous studies (physician-sponsored
      studies) used to treat to nine patients with NK, six of whom had discrete geographic,
      non-healing lesions, and three of whom had punctate lesions and the study result reported.
