    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at University Hospital Alcorcón Foundation, belonging to the
      public network of hospitals of Madrid Health Service.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of clamping the urethral catheter prior to
      removal and determine which of the two options (clamping or free drainage) is the most
      recommended for removal of bladder catheterization in adults.

      The interest of this study is given by the importance of proper handling of catheterization
      in the health of patients admitted to a hospital and are subjected to this technique.
      Increase its interest the need for implementation of evidence-based care, and limited
      scientific literature on the subject.

      The study population will be patients undergoing short-term urethral catheterization at the
      Internal Medicine Service in the University Hospital Alcorcón Foundation.

      The methodology of the study is experimental, randomized clinical trial without drug type.
      Interventions (prior clamped and free drainage) will be assigned in a randomized manner.

      Interventions and data collection of patients who met the inclusion criteria to join the
      study will be conducted during 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. It is planned to present
      results at the end of 2017.
