  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an MRI technique called Blood Oxygen Level
      Dependent, or BOLD, can be used to evaluate blood flow in the leg before and after treatment
      with standard endovascular therapy in patients with chronic lower limb ischemia.

      This study is a prospective single arm, open label registry to evaluate the feasibility of
      blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of a
      potentially new functional surrogate of altered lower limb skeletal muscle oxygenation after
      a successful percutaneous endovascular intervention. Baseline MRI assessment using the BOLD
      technique will be performed on qualified subjects prior to undergoing a standard of care
      endovascular therapy. Post-procedure BOLD-MRI assessment will also be performed at 30 days
      and either 90 or 180 days post-procedure. Post-MR image acquisition processing and analysis
      will be performed, using pre-determined algorithms, by a core laboratory.

    <description>A fixed air cuff will be placed on the index limb at the level of the calf and will be inflated to a level which induces the loss of the pedal Doppler signal. Inflation will be maintained for 180 seconds, then will be rapidly deflated and BOLD MR imaging will be initiated.</description>
