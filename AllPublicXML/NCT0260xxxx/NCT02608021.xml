  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a study to validate Neurotrack's visual paired comparison task, aimed
      at early detection and monitoring of memory impairment. The investigators will determine
      whether the novel task developed by Neurotrack is associated with markers of brain pathology
      associated with very early Alzheimer's disease. The elderly subjects studied will be
      cognitively normal (CN) or have amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). For the current
      study, the primary brain pathology parameters will be derived from MRI scans. Data from this
      study will be correlated with data from a parallel study designed to validate a larger group
      of new cognitive tasks by correlating test performance with a broader array of biomarkers of
      Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neurotrack test has the potential to dramatically alter the current methods used for
      detecting cognitive deficits. Patients and research subjects could be screened for medial
      temporal lobe (MTL) impairment using inexpensive, widely available, safe, and non-invasive
      technology.

      Subjects will be elderly individuals who are participating in ongoing research at the NYU
      Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) and who have received the standard ADC clinical evaluation
      within the past year, including a medical-neurological evaluation, neuro-psychological
      assessment and structural neuroimaging (MRI). As part of the current study, all subjects will
      receive both the Neurotrack Visual Paired-Comparison (VPC) Task and MRI scans. The current
      protocol strictly for a research study and there will be no &quot;standard care&quot; provided.
      Participants will be asked to come in for two separate sessions. The first session will
      involve screening to confirm eligibility and administration of the cognitive testing
      procedures, while the second session will involve the MRI protocol.

        Individuals will be recruited from among participants at the NYU Alzheimer's Disease Center
        ADC, at the affiliated Center for Brain Health (CBH), and from other ongoing NYU research
        studies of the Center for Cognitive Neurology (CCN) that are affiliated with the ADC and
        for which participants receive the standard ADC research diagnostic assessment (the ADC
        Clinical Evaluation).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis based on recent (within 1 year) consensus meeting, cross-referenced
             with standard neuropsychological scores:

               -  Cognitively Normal (CN) Subjects: based on MMSE scores, CDR, and GDS.

               -  Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) Subjects: Diagnosis of aMCI, based on
                  MMSE scores, CDR, and GDS.

          2. Normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing (able to see images on computer
             screen and hear auditory events delivered through the computer speaker).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant history of mental illness, drug or alcohol abuse; severe trauma preventing
             normal use of dominant hand (needed to move the mouse cursor); clinical depression
             (unless medically controlled); other neurologic conditions (i.e. stroke), or learning
             disability; ophthalmologic/visual problems that prevent viewing a computer screen at a
             normal distance (such as legal blindness, detached retinas, occlusive cataracts).

          2. Having pacemakers, aneurysm clips, cochlear implants, pulse oximeters, EKG leads,
             tattoos or other metal/foreign objects in body or face and therefore unable to receive
             MRI.

          3. Lack the capacity to give informed consent and lack of an authorized surrogate to
             provide consent if the prospective subject is found to lack adequate consent capacity.

          4. Pregnancy, breastfeeding or planning to have a baby.
