      designed to investigate the effect of a prolonged course of atorvastatin versus placebo on
      CCM lesional iron deposition assessed by validated quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)

      This phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-site clinical trial is
      designed to investigate the effect of a prolonged course of atorvastatin versus placebo on
      CCM lesional iron deposition assessed by validated quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
      MRI studies in patients who suffered a symptomatic bleed within the preceding one year.
      Subjects will also be assessed by lesional and brain vascular permeability MRI using dynamic
      contrast enhanced quantitative perfusion (DCEQP) and a number of clinical evaluation tools.
      Subjects shall be followed for 2 years from randomization, the period of highest likelihood
      of rebleed after a recent CCM hemorrhage. Subjects will undergo clinical and MRI evaluations
      at baseline, and at 12 and 24 months during the study period. Enrolled subjects and the
      treating team will be blinded to treatment group allocation.

    <description>Each patient contributes two outcome measurements (at year 1 and year 2) based on intention-to-treat. Evaluation of the intervention on this outcome will be performed as a time-averaged difference between two arms using a repeated measures analysis implemented as an unadjusted linear mixed model. Patients with outcome measurements in both periods will be included in the initial intention-to-treat analysis. In cases with multiple lesions, only QSM measurements in the lesion with initial hemorrhage (index lesion) shall be considered for the primary outcome assessment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of CCM of any genotype supported by relevant imaging studies.

          2. Symptomatic CCM bleeding event within 1 year prior to enrollment.

          3. Must be willing/able to travel to the study site for all study visits (baseline, 12
             months, and 24 months) over the course of the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-menopausal women who are breastfeeding, pregnant or likely to get pregnant during
             the study period.

          2. Previous cranial irradiation or surgical/radiosurgical treatment of CCM lesion.

          3. Failure to pass MRI safety screening (claustrophobia, metal implant . . . etc)

          4. Known allergy or intolerance to gadolinium.

          5. Severely impaired renal function (eGFR &lt; 60ml/min), active renal disease or status
             post-kidney transplants.

          6. Statin therapy, for any indication, within 12 months preceding enrollment.

          7. Indication to use statin medication for current approved indication, unrelated to CCM

          8. Known allergy or intolerance to statins

          9. Liver dysfunction or active liver disease (including chronic viral hepatitis) defined
             as baseline serum transaminases levels twice the upper range of normal.

         10. Previous diagnosis of skeletal muscle disorders of any cause (myopathy), or baseline
             creatine kinase level five times the upper range of normal.

         11. Currently treated with or likely to need treatment with one or more of prohibited
             medications listed in the protocol.

         12. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

         13. Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) until subject
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the
             site investigator, for at least 30 days prior to study entry.

         14. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated, including conditions
             resulting in or precipitating myopathy (e.g. HIV, uncontrolled hypothyroidism).

         15. In the investigator's opinion, the patient is unstable, and would benefit from a
             specific intervention rather than treatment with atorvastatin.

         16. Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written
             informed consent.

         17. No documentation of valid healthcare insurance.

         18. No medical record confirmation of primary care physician.
