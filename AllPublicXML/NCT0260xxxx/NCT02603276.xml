  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large body of evidence confirm the cholesterol lowering effect of phytosterols and red
      yeast rice. Because their mechanisms of action mime the ones of chemical statins and
      cholesterol absorption inhibitors, it is plausible that their association will provide a more
      relevant (and safe) LDL cholesterolemia reduction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large body of literature suggest that the patients are strongly interested in
      self-medicating them with &quot;natural&quot; products aimed at reducing their plasma level of
      LDL-cholesterol. Plant sterols and red yeast rice are among the most widely marketed product
      with these properties in Western countries. However plant sterols per se have a limited
      effect on cholesterolemia, while full dosed red yeast rice can induce myalgias and myopathies
      as statins do. In this context, the aim of the investigators' study was to evaluate if the
      association of both products at low dosage could induce an additive or synergistic effect in
      term of LDL-reduction in humans.
