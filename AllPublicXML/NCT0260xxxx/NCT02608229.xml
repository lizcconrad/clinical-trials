  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In light of the central role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in pancreatic
      cancer, the investigators propose a phase I study to evaluate the ERK inhibitor BVD-523 at
      the recommended phase 2 dose in combination with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients
      with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint will be maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or RP2D and safety. The secondary endpoints include safety, response
      rate, biochemical response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The
      exploratory endpoints include the assessing the impact of BVD-523 on the MEK/ERK pathway and
      other major pathway pertain to pancreatic cancer.

BVD-523 is an oral drug which will given at the protocol-dictated dose on a twice daily basis (at approximately 12-hour intervals).
Dose de-escalation patients will take BVD-523 at 600 mg twice daily on its own for two weeks before initiating Cycle 1 treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.
Nab-paclitaxel will be given at a dose of 125 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle over the course of 30-40 minutes.
Gemcitabine will be given at a dose of 1000 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle over the course of 30 minutes.
