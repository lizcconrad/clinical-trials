  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare standard fillings and silver diamine fluoride (SDF)
      for treatment of cavities in baby teeth. The investigators will compare the effectiveness of
      stopping the cavity, cost of the treatments and the opinions of the families and the dental
      providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effectiveness of the application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in
      comparison to conventional restorative treatments in International Caries Detection and
      Assessment System criteria (ICDAS) 5 and 6, one and two surface carious lesions in primary
      molars which will be assessed based on major and minor failure criteria when followed for one
      year. Additionally, parents'/children's and providers' perceptions will be assessed as well
      as the cost of both regimens, to include both chair time spent and materials' costs.
