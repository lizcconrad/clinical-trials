      The purpose of this study is to To assess the correlation between the predictive factor of
      vascularity (CD74) in malignant pleural mesothelioma and treatment results (response rate,
      and overall survival) .

      This is a randomized controlled retrospective study through Examination of paraffin blocks of
      the patient selected to be included in the study for assessment of the selected vascularity
      marker of malignant pleural mesothelioma of both types . The CD74 (LN2) antibody is intended
      for qualified laboratories to qualitatively identify by light microscopy the presence of
      associated antigens in sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections using
      Immunohistochemistry test methods.
