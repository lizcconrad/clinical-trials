  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered an experimental
      malaria vaccine, R21. The R21 vaccine will be administered with the adjuvant AS01B.

      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. Each volunteer will receive three
      vaccinations in total.

      There are two different vaccine schedules:

      Group 1 will receive R21 10µg with AS01B on days 0, 28, and 56. Group 2 will receive R21 50µg
      with AS01B on days 0, 28, and 56.

      The study will assess the safety of the vaccine, and the immune responses to the vaccination.
      Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.

      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in Oxford and Southampton, England.

             their General Practitioner

          -  For females only, willingness to practice continuous effective contraception (see

          -  Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The volunteer may not enter the study if any of the following apply:

          -  Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational
             product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or planned use during the study period

          -  Prior receipt of an investigational malaria vaccine likely to impact on interpretation
             of the trial data.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, including HIV
             infection; asplenia; recurrent, severe infections and chronic (more than 14 days)
             immunosuppressant medication within the past 6 months (inhaled and topical steroids
             are allowed)

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine

             blood tests or urinalysis

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data

          -  Inability of the study team to contact the volunteer's GP to confirm medical history
