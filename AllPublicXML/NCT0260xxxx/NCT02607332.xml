    <textblock>
      With discovery of KIT mutations and the advent of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib
      (GlivecTM, Novartis), there has been substantial improvement in overall survival in patients
      with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal tumors (GIST). Recently, sunitinib
      (SuteneTM, Pfizer) showed activity as second-line therapy in GIST patients after failure with
      imatinib. However, virtually all patients will eventually progress or become intolerable
      after the first-line imatinib and the second-line sunitinib.
