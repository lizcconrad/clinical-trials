  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing total laryngectomy are at high risk for 30-day unplanned readmission.
      Many of these readmissions are related to stomal care, and it is thought that the
      readmissions could be prevented with better patient and caregiver education. The
      investigators are studying the effect of a comprehensive perioperative education program on
      30-day unplanned readmission for patients undergoing total laryngectomy.

      The comprehensive perioperative education program will include the following additional
      interventions:

      -Preoperative visit with the speech pathologist for explanation of laryngectomy physiology,
      stomal education, and alaryngeal voice rehabilitation. Participants will be expected to
      undergo this intervention and to attend it with their &quot;laryngectomy coach&quot; (a family member
      or friend to accompany the patient through the education process), but failure to meet with
      the speech pathologist will not exclude a patient from the study.

        -  Preoperative education class with a designated ENT laryngectomy nurse for patient and
           caregiver. The hands-on class introduces the patient and laryngectomy coach to the
           basics of stomal care. Participants and their &quot;laryngectomy coach&quot; will be expected to
           attend the preoperative education class

        -  Printed laryngectomy journey guide given to patients at time of study enrollment for
           patient/caregiver. This journey guide details the preoperative, in-hospital, and
           post-discharge course and is provided as a reference throughout their journey.

        -  Formalized, nursing administered practical evaluation of minimal competency of
           laryngectomy care for patient and caregiver/laryngectomy coach.

      This study will follow patients prospectively from the time of study commencement and then
      assess changes in patient knowledge before and after the education intervention. It will also
      compare rate of stomal complications and readmission rates to institutional historical
      averages to assess improvement in quality care.

Pre-Class Laryngectomy Survey (5-10 minutes to complete)
Attend a preoperative counseling session with a speech pathologist. It will take 30-60 minutes
Attend the Total Laryngectomy Preoperative Education Class. Participants will attend within 1-2 weeks of providing written consent and prior to their scheduled surgery. The preoperative education class will take one hour.

Perform the day of discharge practicum assessing the minimal competency skills for laryngectomy care prior to discharge from the hospital.
Complete the Laryngectomy Education Study Exit survey. Participants will perform an exit survey at the first clinic appointment after 30 days after hospital discharge (15-30 minutes to complete)</description>
