  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the causes of stroke in people with cancer.
      Active cancer increases the risk of stroke. The investigators do not know exactly why this
      occurs but one possible reason is that people with cancer may have thicker blood than people
      without cancer. Thick blood can sometimes cause blood clots to form in the heart, which can
      then travel to the brain and cause stroke. This study is being done to help figure out why
      this and other causes of stroke occur in people with cancer. The investigators expect that
      information from this study will help doctors to more effectively prevent and treat stroke in
      individuals with cancer.

      This will be a prospective cross-sectional study to examine the unique mechanisms of ischemic
      stroke in cancer patients. Enrollment will occur at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital
      (NYPH)/Weill Cornell Medical Center (WCMC) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
      (MSKCC). Measurements will occur at the NYPH/WCMC and MSKCC Neurovascular Ultrasound
      Laboratories, the MSKCC Central Laboratory, and the Sharp Laboratory at the University of
      California, Davis. Three groups of adult patients will be enrolled. Group 1 will consist of
      consecutive patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. Group 2 will
      be patients with acute ischemic stroke and no cancer. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 will be
      enrolled at 96 hours +/- 24 hours of stroke onset. Group 3 will include patients with active
      solid tumor cancer and no stroke. This group will allow us to confirm that differences
      between stroke patients with and without cancer are not simply incidental findings that can
      be expected in all cancer patients regardless of thrombotic status. Demographics,
      comorbidities, and stroke severity (for Groups 1 and 2 only) will be recorded on admission
      using a structured form. Study patients will undergo three facets of testing: 1) Transcranial
      Doppler (TCD) microemboli detection; 2) hematological biomarker testing; 3) peripheral blood
      leukocyte RNA gene expression analysis.

    <description>Hematological testing will consist of a single peripheral blood draw at 96 hours (+/-24 hours). Several factors will be evaluated, including markers of coagulation (thrombin-antithrombin complex, D-dimer), platelet function (P-selectin), and endothelial integrity (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, thrombomodulin).</description>

    <description>Blood specimens will be collected at the time of enrollment in PAXgene tubes which will be frozen and stored at the Weill Cornell CTSC Core laboratory and sent in batches to the UC Davis laboratory where processing of RNA gene expression will occur.</description>

    <description>With TCD studies, both middle cerebral arteries will be insonated for 30 minutes using a fixed headset. An experienced technologist will review the recording to ensure accurate characterization of all signals and a vascular neurologist with expertise in neurosonology will determine the rate and laterality of the microemboli. TCD microemboli in bilateral vascular distributions indicates a central embolic source.</description>

    <description>Study participants will undergo a single, peripheral blood draw. Blood specimens will be used to perform hematological biomarker testing and leukocyte RNA gene expression analysis.
Hematological biomarker testing will be performed to better elucidate the mechanisms of ischemic stroke in cancer patients and will include markers of coagulation, platelet function, and endothelial integrity. This analysis will occur at MSKCC.
Leukocyte RNA gene expression analysis will be performed to evaluate whether patients with cancer and stroke more often have cardioembolic mechanisms than patients with stroke and no cancer. This analysis will occur at the University of California, Davis where investigators have previously shown that differential RNA expression patterns can predict stroke subtypes.</description>
