  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial scans of newborns will be performed before and after implementation of respiratory
      support devices such as nasal CPAP. 3D scanned images will be processed by Fisher &amp; Paykel
      Healthcare Limited. Images will be analyzed for changes or distortion in nasal structure.

    <textblock>
      Any newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for
      Women and Newborns between 24-42 weeks CGA with parental informed consent are eligible. 3D
      scanned image will be obtained prior to implementation of nasal support devices and after
      nasal support devices. Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Limited will analyze the 3D images and
      observations will be made for changes in nasal structure or distortion.
