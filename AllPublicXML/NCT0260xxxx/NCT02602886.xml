      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether Exposure and Response Prevention
      Therapy (ERP) can help adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in China following a
      training of professionals and ongoing consultation.The treatment time for each participant is
      approximately 12 weeks. This includes the time between the referral and the beginning of
      treatment, the treatment sessions, and the 1-month follow-up time. Therapy sessions will take
      place twice per week for 15 sessions total and last about 90 minutes each. In addition to the
      therapy sessions, participants will have 3 separate assessments. These assessments will occur
      (1) right after they agree to participate in the study, (2) immediately after ERP ends, and
      (3) 1 month after ERP ends. The assessments will take about 1 Â½ hours each.

    <description>The treatment includes both therapist-supervised and self-controlled exposure and ritual prevention exercises. 2 sessions per week, up to 15 sessions in total. Session time is 90 minutes. The majority of in-session time is spent conducting in vivo exposures. When engaging in E/RP tasks, patients are instructed to refrain from ritual engagement. Between-session homework is given the patient practicing the within-session E/RP task up to 90 minutes each day. Clinicians supplement E/RP with other cognitive-behavioral interventions including motivational strategies for resistant patients, Socratic dialogue, and behavioral experiments to test the validity of erroneous cognitions.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Minimum score of &gt;16 on the Y-BOCS; this score indicates clinically significant OCD
             symptom severity;

          -  Medically healthy

          -  Outpatient men and women age 18 years and older;

          -  Meets DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of OCD as determined by the MINI. OCD is the
             primary psychiatric diagnosis (i.e., it is defined by the patient as the most
             important source of current distress);

          -  Able to communicate meaningfully with the investigators and competent to provide
             written informed consent. IQ estimate &gt; 85 standard score.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current clinically significant suicidality or individuals who have engaged in suicidal
             behaviors within the past 12 months will be excluded and referred for appropriate
             clinical intervention;

          -  Presence of any clinical features requiring a higher level of care (inpatient or
             partial hospital treatment);

          -  Current or past DSM-IV bipolar disorder (Current or past unipolar depression is not an
             exclusion criterion. We will allow comorbid depression, to ensure that we are treating
             a representative OCD sample. Depression is the most common complication in OCD, and
             about one third of the OCD clinical samples are depressed.)

          -  Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or any other current or lifetime DSM-IV
             psychotic disorder;

          -  Current or recent (within 3 months of study entry) DSM-V alcohol or drug dependence or
             abuse (other than nicotine), or a positive urine drug screen for any illicit
             substances of abuse;

          -  Estimated IQ &lt;85 on the WASI, mental retardation, dementia, brain damage, or other
             cognitive impairment that would interfere with the capacity to participate in the
             study and complete self-report measures;

          -  Any medical conditions that might contraindicate use of the study treatments, as
             determined by medical physical and laboratory tests by the study physicians;

          -  Presence of any significant and/or unstable medical illness which might lead to
             hospitalization during the study duration; subjects with a stable medical condition
             may participate with the agreement of the subject's physician and the study physician
             who performs the study physical exam;

          -  Concurrent psychotherapy of any type (e.g., CBT/ERP, supportive, psychodynamic) and
             duration;

          -  History of adequately-delivered exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (i.e., 10
             or more sessions of specific and regular exposure and/or response prevention
             assignments; as needed and with patients' written permission we will confer with prior
             treatment providers).
