        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females with age between 18 and 70 years old

          2. Performance status no more than 2

          3. Life expectancy longer than 3 months

          4. Histological proven unresectable recurrent or advanced breast cancer

          5. Triple-negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progestogen receptor (PR), and human
             epithelial receptor-2 (HER2) by immunohistochemistry (ER &lt;1%, PR &lt;1% and Her2
             negative). A negative Her2 gene amplification should be verified by FISH test for
             those patients with Her2 (2+).

          6. Patients must have progressed after 1or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic
             disease, cis/carbo-platin pretreated only 1 previous line prior to randomisation.
             Platinum sensitive in this study is defined as complete or partial or stable disease
             following completion (a minimum of 4 treatment cycles) of previous platinum-based
             chemotherapy and disease progression greater than 3 months after completion of their
             last dose of platinum chemotherapy (last dose).

          7. At least one measurable disease according to the response evaluation criteria in solid
             tumor (RECIST 1.1)

          8. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          9. All patients enrolled are required to have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal
             function

         10. Be able to understand the study procedures and sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients had prior treatment with vinorelbine

          2. Pregnant or lactating women, women of child-bearing potential, unwilling to use
             adequate contraceptive protection during the process of the study

          3. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system metastases are not permitted, except
             for those with stable and asymptomatic brain metastases who have completed cranial
             irradiation, and have at least one measurable lesion outside the brain. Radiotherapy
             should be completed within 4 weeks prior to the registration

          4. Treatment with an investigational product within 4 weeks before the first treatment

          5. Severe cardiopulmonary insufficiency, severe hepatic and renal dysfunction

          6. Uncontrolled serious infection

          7. Other active malignancies (including other hematologic malignancies) or other
             malignancies, except for cured nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia.
