    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of
      sapanisertib and to see how well it works compared to pazopanib hydrochloride in treating
      patients with sarcoma that is too large to be removed (locally advanced) or has spread to
      other areas of the body (metastatic). Sapanisertib and pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerable dose of sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228])
      within this patient population. (Phase I) II. To determine the differences in
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with sarcoma who receive MLN0128 (TAK-228) as
      compared to pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate adverse events. (Phase I/II) II. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR),
      clinical benefit rate (CBR), and duration of response (DOR). (Phase I/II) III. To evaluate
      time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). (Phase I/II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate PFS and secondary endpoints within patients crossing over to MLN0128
      (TAK-228), upon disease progression during treatment with pazopanib. (Phase II) II. To
      evaluate the 4 month CBR observed within patients treated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) and grouped
      by histologically defined cohorts. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study, followed by a randomized phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sapanisertib as in Phase I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      experiencing disease progression may crossover to Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 6
      months for 2 years.
