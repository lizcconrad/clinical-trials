  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center study comprising a lead-in phase and an
      expansion phase. The lead-in phase is a multiple-dose, randomized, parallel-arm,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of avelumab as a single agent in adult patients
      with cHL. Patients enrolled in the lead-in phase of this study are required to have relapsed
      following a prior autologous or allogeneic HSCT, or to be ineligible for HSCT. Based on the
      preliminary TO, safety, and efficacy results from the lead-in phase, the expansion phase will
      evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of single-agent avelumab utilizing an
      intra-patient dose escalation paradigm based on two of the dosing regimens studied in the
      lead-in phase in 40 cHL patients in whom an allogeneic HSCT has failed.

             refractory disease who, for the lead-in phase, either have had a prior autologous or
             allogeneic HSCT or are not eligible for HSCT, and , for the expansion phase, have had
             a prior allogeneic HSCT. In the expansion phase there must be a documented CD3+ donor
             chimerism of ≥20%.

          -  Patients must be off previous cHL therapy for at least 28 days prior to randomization
             in the lead-in phase/first dose of study treatment in the expansion phase.

             on PET-CT scan as defined by the Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (for the
             lead-in phase) and the Lugano Classification (for the expansion phase) that has not
             previously been irradiated.

          -  Expansion phase: Required &quot;de novo&quot; or &quot;archival&quot; tumor biopsy, as well as required on
             treatment biopsy

          -  Estern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1

        KEY EXCLUSION CRITERIA

             have had:

               1. Lead-in phase: allo HSCT performed &lt;12 months prior to randomization. Expansion
                  phase: allo-HSCT performed ≤4 months prior to the first dose of study treatment.
                  NOTE: Patients who have had allo-HSCT performed &gt;4 months prior to the first dose
                  of study treatment must have discontinued all immunosuppressive therapy, and must
                  have no clinical evidence of GVHD; or

               2. Immunosuppressive treatment for acute or chronic GVHD within 3 months prior to

                  for the expansion phase (with the exception of those patients who required 15
                  mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent). Patients who required 15 mg/day oral
                  prednisone or equivalent must have discontinued it within 7 days prior to first
                  dose of study treatment; or

                  persisted for &gt;6 months and required systemic immunosuppression (with the
                  exception of those patients who required 15 mg/day oral prednisone or
                  equivalent). Patients who required 15 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent must
                  have discontinued it within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment; or

               5. A donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 3 months prior to randomization for the
                  lead-in phase or first dose of study treatment for the expansion phase.

          -  Prior therapy with an anti PD 1 or anti PD L1 mAb.

               1. Lead-in Phase: May be enrolled if patient stopped prior anti PD1 or anti-PD-L1
                  therapy more than one year prior to randomization and had a documented prior
                  response.

               2. Expansion Phase: Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent following
                  allo-HSCT is prohibited unless the therapy was stopped more than one year prior
                  to the first dose of study treatment, and the patient had a documented prior
                  response. NOTE: Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent prior to
                  allo-HSCT is permitted with no time limits and irrespective of a documented
                  response.

               3. Patients with a history of ≥Grade 3 anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1-related immune
                  toxicity are not eligible.
