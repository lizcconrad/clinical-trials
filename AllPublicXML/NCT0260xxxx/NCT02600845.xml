  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction: Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQc) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for change from Baseline (DTSQc) to study end contains 6 items which can be rated from -3='much worse now' to 3='much better now'). The total score is the sum of the scores of the 6 items and ranges from -18 to 18. A higher score indicates more satisfaction. This questionnaire was administered at the end of the study (Week 24) only.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated their level of diabetes distress by answering 17 questions in in the following areas: Regimen-related Distress, Emotional Burden, Diabetes-related Interpersonal Distress and Physician-related Distress (PD) on a 6-point scale: 1=Not a problem to 6=A very serious problem. The Average Total score ranged from 1 (best) to 6 (worst). Results were calculated using a Linear Mixed Model with study group, visit, group-by-visit interaction, baseline DDS, gender, age, and race as fixed effects; and site and subject as random effects. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of HbA1c is an indicator of long-term control of diabetes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Percentage of Glucose Readings in Target Range</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose target range was specified as 70-180 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Mean Blood Glucose Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose is a type of sugar in blood and is measured to assess a participant's control of diabetes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Glycemic Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic variability refers to swings in blood glucose levels. Mean glycemic variability is expressed as a standard deviation of blood glucose data. A negative number indicates a decrease in glucose variability. A positive number indicates and increase in glucose variability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>A hypoglycemic reading was defined as a glucose value that fell below the 70 mg/dL level. The incidence of hypoglycemia was defined as the number of hypoglycemic readings in the interval divided by the total number of blood glucose checks in the interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Competency in Self-monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Competency was defined as appropriate response to high and low glucose values.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Follow-Up Visits With Sufficient SMBG Data</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Sufficient SMBG data is based on the ability of the healthcare provider to make informed decisions regarding therapy adjustments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Blood Glucose Checks at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>An increase in the number of blood glucose checks indicates more glycemic control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Daily Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) Frequency at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>An increase in SMBG frequency indicates more glycemic control. The average number of daily SMBG measurements per interval was calculated based on the total number of blood glucose readings recorded during the study visit interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Blood Glucose Tagged Data</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Tagged data specifies the timing of blood glucose recording and includes: fasting, before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner, and bedtime. The percentage of blood glucose tagged data per interval was calculated as the total number of tagged blood glucose readings during the interval divided by the total number of readings within the interval.</description>

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction: Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQc) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for change from Baseline (DTSQc) to study end contains 6 items which can be rated from -3=‘much worse now’ to 3=‘much better now’). The total score is the sum of the scores of the 6 items and ranges from -18 to 18. A higher score indicates more satisfaction. This questionnaire was administered at the end of the study (Week 24) only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) Score</title>
        <description>Participants rated their level of diabetes distress by answering 17 questions in in the following areas: Regimen-related Distress, Emotional Burden, Diabetes-related Interpersonal Distress and Physician-related Distress (PD) on a 6-point scale: 1=Not a problem to 6=A very serious problem. The Average Total score ranged from 1 (best) to 6 (worst). Results were calculated using a Linear Mixed Model with study group, visit, group-by-visit interaction, baseline DDS, gender, age, and race as fixed effects; and site and subject as random effects. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>
