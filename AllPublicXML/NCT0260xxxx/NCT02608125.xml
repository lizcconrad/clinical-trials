  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized Phase 1 study, to be conducted in two
      parts, Part A, and Part B. Part A is the dose escalation phase for evaluating the safety and
      tolerability profile of PRN1371, a FGFR 1-4 Kinase inhibitor. Part B is the Cohort Expansion
      phase to further evaluate safety and tolerability, preliminary activity, PK, and PD in
      patients with FGFR genetic alterations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a dose escalation study. The protocol specifies rules for dose-limiting toxicity
      and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). To gain further experience with the MTD, and/or at some
      lower optimal biologic dose level, an expansion cohort of 20 patients, enriched for solid
      tumors with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 or 4 genetic alterations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Histological or cytological documentation of an advanced solid tumor

          -  Subject must have metastatic or recurrent disease and have failed first-line systemic
             treatment, and if indicated, failed approved second-line therapy, and for whom no
             standard therapy options are anticipated to result in a durable remission

          -  Subject must have evaluable, progressive, and measurable disease per the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, Version 1.1

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

        For Part B subjects only:

          -  The patient's tumor has been evaluated and prospectively identified as having FGFR 1,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received adequate prior treatment with a highly selective FGFR
             inhibitor

          -  Patients with other major uncontrolled medical conditions, e.g., recent myocardial
             infarction, stroke, diabetes, active hepatitis

          -  Patients who have received prior systemic anticancer therapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to study
             start (6 weeks for nitrosourea, antibodies, or mitomycin-C)

          -  Patients diagnosed with another primary malignancy within 3 years prior to study
             start, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
             carcinoma, or other non-melanomatous skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine
             cervix

          -  Patients with glioblastoma multiforme

          -  Patient has a primary neoplasm of the brain or known uncontrolled metastases to the
             central nervous system (CNS). Patients with brain metastases are eligible, provided
             they have shown clinical and radiographically stable disease for at least 4 weeks
             after definitive therapy and have not used steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to
             first dose of PRN1371.
