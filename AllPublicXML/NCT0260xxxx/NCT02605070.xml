      Single center, prospective, open clinical study to determine the genomic imprint (epigenetic
      modification) in a series of male infertility patients with alterations in their spermiogram
      (oligozoospermia) compared to a group of fertile patients in order to evaluate the effect of
      FSH ( follicle stimulating hormone) administration on these modifications and on male

      Single center, prospective, open clinical study to determine the genomic imprint (epigenetic
      modification) in a series of male infertility patients with alterations in their spermiogram
      (oligozoospermia) compared to a group of fertile patients in order to evaluate the effect of
      FSH ( follicle stimulating hormone) administration on these modifications and on male
      infertility.

      Main objective: To determine the genomic imprint (epigenetic modification) in a series of
      male infertility patients with alterations in their spermiogram (oligozoospermia) compared to
      a group of fertile patients in order to evaluate the effect of FSH administration on these
      modifications and on male infertility.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the main characteristics of the spermiograms of infertility patients before
           and after FSH treatment.

        -  To assess modifications in the hormones involved in sperm formation in infertility
           patients before and after treatment.

        -  To analyze the results of assisted reproduction treatments in patients receiving FSH
           treatment.

    <description>Patients referred will be evaluated to participate in the study and then asked to take part.In this visit,the normal protocol for infertility patients will be followed and at least 2 spermiograms and a blood test analyzing the following parameters:FSH, LH,Estradiol,Total testosterone,SHBG, Albumin,Calculation of bioavailable testosterone,Prolactin.If these tests have not been performed,a second baseline visit will be scheduled.Should the patient meet all the inclusion criteria and after the patient has signed an informed consent form agreeing to participate in the study,the physician will prescribe the medication and schedule visits.Before initiating the treatment, they will provide a semen sample.This sample will be sent to the Center for Reproductive Biology,where the sample will be subjected to epigenetic analysis.The patient will be given samples of Bravelle.It is administered subcutaneously.The dose will be 150 IU 3times a week for 3months</description>

    <description>Patients who volunteer will be informed of the nature of the study and asked to sign the informed consent form. At least two spermiograms will be performed along with a blood test analyzing the following parameters:FSH,LH,Estradiol,Total testosterone,SHBG,Albumin,Estimation of bioavailable testosterone,Prolactin.
A second baseline visit will be scheduled to evaluate the test results and to check whether these subjects meet all the inclusion criteria for the control group. Those subjects will provide a semen sample which will be stored at -20º C.
Outpatient visit: week twelve: a physical exam will be carried out to identify any adverse reactions. A blood test and a semen sample will also be obtained.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bravelle</intervention_name>
    <description>Bravelle will be provided to all patients in the treatment group by the principal investigator (PI) or another member of the research team.
From week nine on, the patients will undergo a physical examination on three different occasions to assess the appearance of any adverse reactions during treatment. It will be up to the patient to communicate the appearance of signs or symptoms which could be associated with the use of the drug.
At week 12 the patient will be scheduled for another visit to perform a semen study and to measure new hormone levels. To this end, a blood test will be carried out (FSH, LH, estradiol, total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin to calculate the amount of bioavailable testosterone). A semen sample will also be obtained to carry out a spermiogram according to WHO guidelines; part of this sample will be used for epigenetic analysis.</description>
