  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab work in treating patients with
      hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body and express
      androgen receptor-variant-7 (AR-V7). Tumor cells expressing AR-V7 has been shown to be
      resistant to hormone therapy and some chemotherapy in patients with prostate cancer.
      Biomarker-driven therapy, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may work by blocking key
      biomarkers or proteins that help tumor cells to escape the immune system surveillance and
      this may help the immune system to kill tumor cells that express AR-V7.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. To evaluate the effect of administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the proportion of
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses (&gt; 50% PSA decline) in metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with detectable AR‐V7 transcript in
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES;

        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipilimumab + nivolumab in AR‐V7-positive
           patients.

        2. To determine the progression free survival (PFS).

        3. To determine the PSA‐PFS.

        4. To determine the proportion of &quot;durable&quot; responses.

        5. To determine the overall response rate (ORR).

        6. To determine the overall survival (OS).

        7. To evaluate changes in AR‐V7 detection (or expression levels) before and after treatment
           with ipilimumab + nivolumab and correlate with PSA responses.

        8. To explore potential biomarkers associated with clinical efficacy (ORR, PFS, and OS) of
           nivolumab and ipilimumab by analyzing absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood as
           well as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression in CTCs and/or in tumor
           biopsies, and immune profiling of sera and tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90
      minutes every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes every
      2 weeks for 36 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days and then every 3
      months.
