  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is the most common inherited
      peripheral neuropathy, for which no treatment has proved its effectiveness. It is autosomal
      dominant, associated with a duplication of the chromosome 17p11.2 region which leads to
      overexpression of the gene and the protein-peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22), a major
      component of peripheral myelin.

      In animals and humans, PMP22 mRNA level of glutathione S-transferase theta 2 and Cathepsin A
      (markers of oxidative stress), detected in a skin biopsy are markers that may play a role in
      the prognosis evolution of the disease. Furthermore, several studies have shown that the
      administration of progesterone increased the expression of PMP22 gene (measured in a skin
      biopsy) and worsening symptoms. In contrast, anti-progestins reduce the synthesis of PMP22
      and improve symptoms in rat CMT1A.

      The long-term safety of anti-progesterone was evaluated for mifepristone (RU486) ulipristal
      acetate and (EllaOne®). Few side effects have been reported including a few cases of
      endometrial hyperplasia reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. With the RU486, rare
      cases of adrenal androgen and failure have been observed. However, EllaOne® has low
      antagonistic action on the glucocorticoid receptor and no action on androgen receptors. The
      investigators therefore believe that it will be well tolerated in humans and will reduce the
      synthesis of PMP22 and the action of oxidative stress by improving disability of patients.
