      The purpose of this study is to examine the association between maternal alcohol use and

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of the proposed research study is to examine the association between maternal
      alcohol use and newborn phosphatidylethanol (PEth) levels in their newborn children, in a
      country (Uruguay) where significant alcohol use is common during pregnancy. Maternal alcohol
      biomarker assays will include ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair and nails and PEth in blood
      obtained at the time of delivery. Newborn umbilical cord and routine 48 hour heel stick blood
      will be collected to assess newborn PEth levels. Maternal biomarker levels will be compared
      to patient self-reported alcohol use. This proposed design is a cross-sectional study that
      will include 1,800 women 18 years and older and their newborns. Women who are admitted to one
      of two selected public health care hospitals in Montevideo, Uruguay (Hospital Pereira Rossell
      and Servicio Medico Integral) for obstetrical care will be recruited to participate in the
      study. Power estimates suggest that 1,800 maternal/infant pairs will give us sufficient power
      (&gt;90%) to estimate the predictive validity of this biomarker as a routine newborn screening
      test.

    <description>Conduct a formative assessment of the prevalence and patterns of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the relationship of these reported patterns to maternal biomarker levels (EtG in hair and nails and PEth in blood) in a large sample (n=1800) of pregnant women in Montevideo, Uruguay.</description>

    <description>Biomarkers will be collected to determine the correlations between maternal self-report of alcohol consumption, maternal alcohol biomarker levels and newborn PEth concentration levels at birth. It will also help identify the sensitivity and specificity of PEth and the predictive value of newborn PEth levels; and the half-life and window of detection of PEth in newborns by examining the kinetics of PEth elimination.</description>
