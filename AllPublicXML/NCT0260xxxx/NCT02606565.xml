  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Nearly all the yearly 3.3 million neonatal deaths occur in low and middle income
      countries. Infections, including those affecting the umbilical cord (omphalitis) are a
      significant factor in approximately a third of these deaths. In fact, the odds of all-cause
      mortality are 46% higher among infants with umbilical cord infection than those without
      infection. Five large randomized controlled trials in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have
      examined the effect of multiple applications (for at least 7 days) of 4% chlorhexidine (CHX)
      on the umbilical cord on omphalitis and neonatal death. These studies show a consitent
      positive effect of multiple applications on omphalitis but not on neonatal mortality. Whereas
      there is mounting evidence for the effect of 7 day chlorhexidine application, there is no
      data from Africa and only one study from Asia that examines the effect of a single
      application of CHX as soon as possible after birth. In this single Asian study, CHX led to a
      reduction in the risk of mild-moderate omphalitis and neonatal death. It is important, in an
      African setting to explore the effect of a single application, which is programmatically much
      simpler to implement than daily application for 7 days. Therefore, the investigators' study
      will compare umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% chlorhexidine at birth
      with dry cord care in both community and facility births on omphalitis and severe illness in
      the neonatal period.

      Methods: The chlorhexidine study is a community based, individually randomised controlled
      trial conducted on 4,760 mother-infant pairs in Uganda. The primary outcomes are severe
      illness and umbilical cord infection (omphalitis). Severe illness is defined as any illness
      associated with at least one of the following danger signs observed by study research
      assistants: inability to drink or breastfeed or (a history of) convulsions, lethargy or
      unconsciousness, vomiting of all feeds, and/or results in hospitalization and/or results in
      death.

      Discussion: This study will provide novel evidence, from a Sub-Saharan African setting of the
      effect of umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% chlorhexidine at birth in
      both community and facility births.

    <description>Severe illness will be defined as illness that is associated with any of the following danger signs observed or verified by a study clinician: inability to feed or vomiting of everything and unable to keep anything down, lethargy or unconsciousness, severe lower chest in-drawing, axillary temperature of ≥37.5 degrees Celsius or &lt;35.5 degrees Celsius, grunting, cyanosis, convulsions or a history of convulsions, and/or results in hospitalization and/or results in death. Hospitalization and death resulting from violent injury or burns will not contribute to the severe illness definition.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of infants with omphalitis</measure>
    <time_frame>First 28 days of life</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be recorded as present or absent based on specific signs. These include: pus, redness (inflammation) and swelling (oedema) of the cord stump and the surrounding skin at its base. Swelling and redness will be further broken down into: none, mild, moderate and severe. No swelling or redness will be the absence of visible swelling or redness; mild swelling or redness as that limited to the cord stump only; moderate swelling or redness as that extending less than 2cm onto the abdominal skin at the base of the stump and severe swelling or redness as extending ≥2cm into the abdominal skin at the base of the stump. Pus will be defined as either present or absent. Cord infection will then be defined based on combinations of these recorded signs and their severity into four categories as follows: 1) redness extending to skin or pus, 2) moderate or severe redness, 3) moderate or severe redness with pus, or severe redness alone and 4) Severe redness with pus.</description>
