      Hospitalization in pregnancy and childbirth greatly increases the thromboembolic risk of
      these patients. The application of a protocol for assessing the risk of VTE reduces mortality
      and morbidity of these phenomena.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thromboembolic events are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in
      pregnancy / postpartum period. They are the leading cause of maternal death in developed
      countries. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy and postpartum as
      family history or personal history of VTE, thrombophilia, age over 35, obesity and high
      parity has been the most studied. One of the main risk factors is hospitalization, which
      increases up to 20 times the risk of VTE.

      Objective: The objective of the study is to identify early risk factors for VTE in
      hospitalized pregnant women and institute appropriate prophylaxis to reduce the incidence and
      morbidity.

      Methods: A prospective study that will evaluate all pregnant women admitted for clinical
      treatment and / or surgery in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinics Hospital,
      University of São Paulo through the application of a thromboprophylaxis protocol with risk
      assessment score. The patient in whom prophylaxis would be indicated are those with scores
      greater than or equal to 3. The drug to be used is enoxaparin and the dose to be used depends
      on the weight of the patient.

      It will be further assessed: adverse effects of treatment with enoxaparin, protocol failure
      in the group treated and untreated (without anticoagulation) and bleeding incidence in the
      untreated group.

      Risk score description: score 3 - previous thrombosis/thromboembolism, homozygous mutations,
      combined thrombophilia risk factors, antiphospholipid syndrome, cancer(stomach, pancreas,
      lung), inflammatory conditions, lupus, sickle cell disease, nephrotic syndrome, heart
      disease; Score 2 - Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, heterozygous F5 Leiden,
      heterozygous F2 G20210A mutation, cancer(last 6 months), chemotherapy(last 6m), immobility,
      bed rest &gt;4d prior to C-section, current serious infections, BMI≥40 kg/m2 , age≥40y, lung
      disease(cyanosis), postpartum hemorrhage &gt;1L; Score 1 - age ≥ 35 and ≤39 y, parity ≥3,
      multiple pregnancy, hyperemesis, gross varicose veins, smoker ≥20, surgical procedure.

    <description>Identify early risk factors for VTE in hospitalized pregnant women and prescribe appropriate prophylaxis to reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of VTE. The patients that score ≥ 3 will receive enoxaparin. This group will be analyzed for the incidence of adverse outcomes: VTE, bleeding, death until 3 months post hospitalization. This same analysis will be done in those patients who have not received heparin. The patients that could not receive heparin due to bleeding risk will be analyzed also. The analysis of the score will also describe if the higher the score, the higher the index of adverse events, mainly when it is not possible to prescribe the prophylaxis.</description>
