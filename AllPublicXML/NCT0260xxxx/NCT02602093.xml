  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LSRS) is caused by a herniated lumbar nucleus
      pulposus (HNP) and the estimated annual incidence in The Netherlands ranges between 60,000 to
      75,000 people. Open microdiscectomy is the standard surgical technique.

      In recent years, several surgical techniques have been developed including, percutaneous
      transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). While PTED is gaining popularity in The
      Netherlands, evidence of its effects is lacking, leading to a heated debate. The current
      position of Zorginstituut Nederland (ZiN) is that there is insufficient evidence to support
      its use; therefore, PTED is not financially covered. The consequence is, patients are forced
      to pay the costs of treatment themselves. This study is expected to provide the necessary
      data to answer the question regarding effects and costs of PTED vs. open microdiscectomy, and
      help resolve the current debate.

      In recent years, several surgical techniques have been developed including, percutaneous

      data to answer the question regarding effects and costs of PTED vs. open microdiscectomy, and
      help resolve the current debate. Objective: To determine the effects and costs of PTED vs.
      open microdiscectomy. Study design: Pragmatic, multi-center non-inferiority randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) with subsequent observational study once sufficient subjects have been
      recruited for the RCT.

      Study population: In total, 682 subjects are to be included. The inclusion criteria are as
      follows: subjects 18-70 years of age with &gt; 10 weeks of radiating pain with- or without motor
      or sensory loss in the leg, or with &gt; 6 weeks of excessive radiating pain and no tendency for
      any clinical improvement and strong patient preference for surgery. There must also be an
      indication for an operation and a MRI demonstrating lumbar disc herniation with nerve
      compression with or without concomitant spinal or lateral recess stenosis or sequestration.

      Participants must also have sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: There is one primary outcome: self-report leg pain (0- 10
      numeric rating scale (NRS)); secondary outcomes include among others functional status
      (Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)) and are to be measured the day following treatment and at
      2, 4, and 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9,12 and 24 months. The data will be analyzed longitudinally,
      meaning there is no primary endpoint.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day after surgery, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 and 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity in the leg will be measured on a scale from 0 to 100 mm.(worst imaginable pain). Since the trial was published in the trial registry, the protocol has been modified. NRS for leg pain (back pain and quality of life) was added. NRS and VAS scores showed comparable rates when measuring pain following surgery.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day after surgery, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months , 12 and 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>There are 10 questions (items), each with 6 possible answers, each answer option receives a score of 0 to 5 points, yielding score range between 0 and 50, which is scaled to a 100% range. The questions are designed in a way to realize how the back or leg pain is affecting the patient's ability to manage in everyday life</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Cost questionnaires will be completed at the prescribed measurements. Hospitalisation for surgery will be registered using the case record forms. Other health care utilization (including physiotherapy, visits to GP and specialists, nursing care and medication), patient costs, and absenteeism from work will be measured using cost questionnaires filled out by the patients.</description>

    <measure>Changes on the Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 and 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To represent the patients' perspective, utility will also be estimated using a VAS for the valuation of the patient's health state (ranging from 0 = as bad as death to 100 mm = perfect health). An NRS was added as well.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes on the EuroQoL (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day after surgery, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months,, 12 and 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL (EQ-5D) will be used for the cost utility analysis. The tool measures five dimensions: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension consists of one item, while five levels are distinguished (no, slight, moderate, severe problems, unable to do).</description>

    <time_frame>Day after surgery, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 and 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the perceived recovery a seven-point Likert scale will be used. The score on this scale vary from 'completely recovered' to 'worse than ever'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 and 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To measure patient satisfaction a seven-point Likert scale will be used. The score on this scale vary from 'completely satisfied with current symptoms' to 'completely dissatisfied with current symptoms'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes on the SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 and 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 will be used as a generic quality-of-life questionnaire. The SF-36 questionnaire has been validated and found reliable for low back pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 and 2 year of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A systematic assessment of complications (including wound infection, deep venous thrombosis, urine tract infection, hematoma, and progressive neurological deficit) will be recorded out by the surgeon and research nurse, and these data are to be extracted from the patient chart. Moreover, surgeons will be asked for perioperative complications</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The wound will be inspected and a standard neurological examination will be performed. This standard neurologic examination includes the Body Image and Cosmesis Scale, the (crossed) leg raising test, patellar and tendon reflexes, sensibility in the lumbosacral dermatome region, leg muscle test, abdominal muscle strength and finger-floor distance.</description>

    <description>Local anaesthesia is to be administered. Verification of the site to be performed by an image intensifier and depending upon the patient's posture, a line is to be drawn from the center of the herniation. The needle is to be set and position checked. After the needle has reached the correct position, a guidewire is inserted. Following that, a series of conical rods are introduced, subsequently a drill is introduced through the cannula. After drilling, the instruments are removed, but the guidewire is to remain in place. The endoscope with the working channels are introduced via an 8mm cannula. Following removal of the hernia, the cannula and endoscope are removed. The patient is to be treated on an outpatient basis.</description>

    <description>General or spinal anaesthesia is to be administered. Verification is to be performed using a Carm and the patient is to be positioned prone or in the salaam position. A paramedian incision is to be performed and the level is to be indicated. Loupe or microscope magnification is to be used. Laminotomy as well as foraminotomy is to be performed, if necessary. The amount of degenerative disc material to be removed is at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Post-operative policy will be followed and it is expected that the duration of recovery in the hospital may vary from 2-7 days, but the patient will be discharged as soon as medically responsible.</description>
