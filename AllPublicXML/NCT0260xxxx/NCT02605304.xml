  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have a great chance of being cured of
      the infection when they are treated with sofosbuvir. However, in some instances, treatment
      with sofosbuvir-containing therapy does not work. It is not known if people respond to
      retreatment with sofosbuvir, after it did not work the first time. There is an important need
      to understand retreatment options in those instances. This clinical trial was done to study
      the response to two different regimens, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with
      ribavirin, and to see if they are safe and well-tolerated in HCV-infected persons whose
      previous treatment with sofosbuvir had failed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need to understand appropriate retreatment options for HCV-infected
      patients who fail direct acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens. To date, over 100,000
      prescriptions have been written for SOF. Recent data indicate that SOF-based treatment
      defined as SOF/RBV, SOF/pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)/RBV or SOF/simeprevir (SIM) +/- RBV
      have led to treatment response of 70-92% in HCV genotype (GT) 1 patients, depending on the
      regimen used and presence of liver cirrhosis. Thus, there is a growing number of individuals
      who have failed SOF-based regimens and are in need of a retreatment strategy, the majority of
      which are anticipated to be HCV GT1, given the US distribution of genotypes. There are no
      data to inform retreatment strategies for HIV-infected individuals with SOF failure, who have
      traditionally represented a harder to treat group and are impacted by DAA-antiretroviral
      (ARV) interactions.

      This was a phase II retreatment study of HCV GT1 and HIV coinfected participants who had
      previous HCV virologic failure on a SOF-based regimen. Participants were randomized to one of
      two treatment arms: 12 weeks of LDV/SOF with weight-based RBV (Arm A) or 24 weeks of LDV/SOF
      alone (Arm B). The targeted sample size was 40, 20 participants in each arm.

      Post-entry, the study visits were scheduled at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 after
      study entry (with week 16, 20, 24 visits limited to those on the 24-week regimen), and at 4,
      12 and 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation. The total study duration was 36 weeks in Arm
      A and 48 weeks in Arm B. At each visit, a physical examination and blood collection were
      conducted. HCV RNA was tested at each visit. For female participants of reproductive
      potential, pregnancy tests were done. At on-treatment visits, participants also completed an
      HCV treatment adherence questionnaire. Urinalysis was conducted at all on-treatment visits
      and at 4 weeks post treatment. At select visits, plasma, whole blood, urine and dried blood
      spots were collected.

      The study was randomized because there was clinical equipoise on the benefits and drawbacks
      in the two study arms. The study was not designed to be powered for comparisons between the
      randomized study arms, and no formal statistical comparisons were conducted. The primary
      analysis was conducted as a single-arm analysis for each regimen.

      The study experienced enrollment difficulties due to the small number of HCV treatment
      failures from select SOF-based regimens who would be eligible for this study, and closed to
      accrual prematurely. The participants enrolled remained on study until completion of
      follow-up.

    <time_frame>At 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation (i.e., at 24 weeks after study entry in Arm A and at 36 weeks after study entry in Arm B).</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA below the LLOQ of the assay (either target detected [TD] or target not detected [TND]) at 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. The sample within the visit window, closest to the targeted time was used. If there was no HCV RNA sample within visit window, then the participant was considered not to have achieved SVR12, unless there were preceding and subsequent HCV RNA measurements that were both &lt;LLOQ (either TD or TND). HCV RNA testing was conducted at a central laboratory using the COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Wilson (score) method was used for confidence intervals.</description>

    <time_frame>From study treatment initiation to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation. Duration of treatment was 12 weeks in Arm A and 24 weeks in Arm B.</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who experienced an AE (diagnosis, sign/symptom or laboratory abnormality) of ≥Grade 3, SAE according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) criteria, or AE reported as the reason for permanent study treatment discontinuation, during study treatment and up to 30 days after study treatment. Events that were ongoing at the same grade from prior to study treatment initiation were excluded. AEs were graded by the clinicians according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) AE Grading Table (V2.0) as follows: Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3=Severe, Grade 4=Potentially Life-Threatening. The percentage of participants who experienced any event (overall), and the percentage of participants who experienced each component of the outcome are provided in the data table below. The categories are not mutually exclusive. A participant may have experienced multiple events. Each participant is counted at most once within category, and in the overall summary line.</description>

    <description>SVR24 was defined as HCV RNA below the LLOQ of the assay (either TD or TND) at 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at 12 Weeks After Treatment Discontinuation (SVR12)</title>
        <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA below the LLOQ of the assay (either target detected [TD] or target not detected [TND]) at 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. The sample within the visit window, closest to the targeted time was used. If there was no HCV RNA sample within visit window, then the participant was considered not to have achieved SVR12, unless there were preceding and subsequent HCV RNA measurements that were both &lt;LLOQ (either TD or TND). HCV RNA testing was conducted at a central laboratory using the COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Wilson (score) method was used for confidence intervals.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at 4 Weeks After Treatment Discontinuation (SVR4)</title>
        <description>SVR4 was defined as HCV RNA below the LLOQ of the assay (either TD or TND) at 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation. The sample within the visit window, closest to the targeted time was used. If there was no HCV RNA sample within visit window, then the participant was considered not to have achieved SVR4, unless there were preceding and subsequent HCV RNA measurements that were both &lt;LLOQ (either TD or TND). HCV RNA testing was conducted at a central laboratory using the COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Wilson (score) method was used for confidence intervals.</description>
