  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a primary stabilizer of the knee, and thus when ACL
      injury occurs participation in physical activity is compromised. Reconstructive surgery is
      often necessary to repair the damage which is then followed by a regimen of physical therapy
      in order to regain full activity. Nutritional intervention after the surgery could help the
      patient maintain muscle mass during recovery, thus allowing for a quicker return to normal
      activity.

      Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a nutritional supplement shown to improve muscle
      mass with exercise, and also in muscle loss conditions caused by a decrease in physical
      activity. Participants will be recruited who will undergo reconstructive surgery for a
      complete ACL tear and will then enter a standard physical therapy program during a six week
      recovery period. Subjects will receive either HMB or a placebo supplement during the recovery
      period. Muscle mass will be measured two weeks prior to the surgery and again after the
      recovery period using an InBody 720 body composition analyzer. Additionally, the Knee Injury
      and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire will be administered as a measure of
      recovery and activity level during the study.
