      Agnostos Trial is a multicentric phase 2 randomized trial with a 'pick-the-winner design' in
      chemonaive patients with cancer of unknown primary. It will assess the efficacy of the two
      best active single agent - carboplatin or gemcitabine - added to an innovative taxane back
      bone (nab-Paclitaxel). Agnostos trial is a part of a larger clinical and translational
      initiative to improve the outlook of patients with cancer of unknown primary through
      evaluation of novel chemotherapeutic regimens.

      Treatment-naïve patients with CUP diagnosis confirmed according to CUP Diagnostic Guidelines,
      will be enrolled into AGNOSTOS trial. Patients will be randomized upfront to receive a
      nab-paclitaxel-based duplet adding either carboplatin or gemcitabine until progression or
      unacceptable toxicity (randomization 1:1, n= 120; 60 per arm).
