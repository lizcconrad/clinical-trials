    <textblock>
      The proposed study, for HIV positive alcohol dependent adults currently taking naltrexone, is
      a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the outcomes of a 12-week behavioral
      support program delivered via text-messaging.

      It is expected that the text messaging intervention will reduce alcohol use and HIV-risk
      behaviors. The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention will improve adherence to
      HIV treatment and naltrexone.

      To test the effects of the intervention on these target outcomes, 25 participants receiving
      the text messaging intervention will be compared to 25 participants receiving an
      informational pamphlet. The pamphlet will contain information about the importance of HIV
      treatment adherence, reducing HIV risk behaviors, and health consequences associated with
      alcohol use.

      By providing support to maximize HIV treatment regimen and naltrexone adherence, coupled with
      coping skills to promote abstinence from alcohol, the text messaging intervention may provide
      a promising, cost-effective, and easily deployable behavioral support program for alcohol
      users who are HIV-infected.

  <detailed_description>

      The aims of this study are to: 1) implement and evaluate a 12-week cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) intervention using text messaging via mobile phone technology (ALC-TXT-CBT) to
      reduce alcohol use, reduce HIV-risk behaviors and facilitate medication adherence in a
      population of alcohol dependent adults with HIV-infection and 2) examine potential mechanisms
      of action of ALC-TXT-CBT. The investigators hypothesize that ALC-TXT-CBT will produce greater
      reductions in alcohol use and HIV-risk behaviors, and will improve HIV treatment regimen and
      naltrexone (Vivitrol) adherence, relative to the control condition (informational pamphlet).

      Further, the investigators expect that ALC-TXT-CBT will facilitate greater changes in
      negative affect, self-efficacy, and social support, and these changes will be associated with
      substance use outcomes.

    <description>Urine Drug Screen (UDS). Urine drug screens will be collected monthly using temperature controlled test cups. An FDA-approved one-step test will be used. During the 12-week treatment period, one full-screen panel and two panels only testing for opioids (heroin and prescription opioids) will be conducted. The UDS will test for the presence of: amphetamines, benzodiazepines, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine, morphine (heroin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), oxycodone (OxyContin), and marijuana. The participants' change in substance use over time (as assessed by the ASI and UDS results) is being assessed from each timepoint to the next.</description>
