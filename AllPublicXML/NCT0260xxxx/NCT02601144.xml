  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study on the effect of the variable frequency stimulation (VFS) on Freezing
      of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with STN DBS. FOG has responded poorly to
      High frequency stimulation (HFS) but can be alleviated by relatively VFS. This study would
      have significant clinical implications in the management of Freezing of gait (FOG) in these
      PD patients with subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. The investigators hypothesize that VFS could
      have better effect on FOG than HFS and low frequency stimulation (LFS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HFS of STN provides consistent, long-term improvement of the cardinal motor signs of PD, such
      as bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. FOG has responded poorly to HFS and tends to continue
      to deteriorate over time, but this can be alleviated by relatively LFS. Evidence has
      indicated that LFS-STN can improve axial signs in some but not all PD patients, but most of
      them experienced loss of efficacy in the short term. Then comes to the little improvement or
      even worse of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia, which consists of the three main symptoms of
      Parkinson's disease. Thus even if axial problems could be solved by LFS in a long way, it
      could also be hard to tolerate by those patients. The effect of VFS on FOG will be studied.
      The investigators hypothesize that VFS could have better effect on Freezing of gait than HFS
      and LFS.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients were receiving bilateral STN stimulation for more than six months.

          2. They were optimized on conventional HFS for control of tremors, rigidity and
             bradykinesia yet complained of freezing of gait.

          3. Subjects had an ability to walk at least 10 meters independently during ON DBS
             condition.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. gait disorders perceived by patients as a direct consequence of STN stimulation and
             not the primary disease.

          2. any change in the HFS DBS settings, three months prior to participation in the study.

          3. complete inability to walk despite assistance while DBS ON.

          4. Subjects responding to reprogramming of chronic DBS settings (report improvement of
             freezing).

          5. Subjects could not tolerate prolonged OFF medication condition.
