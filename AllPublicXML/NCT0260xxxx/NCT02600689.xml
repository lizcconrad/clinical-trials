  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient (phase 2) pulmonary rehab is an important, but mostly underutilized intervention
      to improve physical function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Of those
      individuals who complete phase 2 pulmonary rehab, only a small cohort continues with any type
      of maintenance exercise therapy (phase 3). This is largely due to personal factors, such as
      access to transportation, weather, scheduling difficulties, and cost.

      Little is known about how to enhance physical activity among patients with IPF. In addition,
      no studies have investigated the long-term maintenance strategies of physical training in
      patients with IPF. Thus, the purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and
      effectiveness of a home-based, pulmonary rehab program for patients with IPF. A randomized,
      blinded, clinical trial (RCT) design with two arms -- Wii Fit Plus exergame program and
      cognitive video gaming, with no active whole body movement involved — will be used to
      investigate the benefits of a home-based exergame program on improving pulmonary-related
      function and symptoms in patients with IPF.
