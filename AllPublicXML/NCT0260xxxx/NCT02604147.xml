    <textblock>
      The respiratory system has been touted as a limiting factor of physical performance during
      high intense physical exercises. This limitation is related, among other things, with the
      fatigue of respiratory muscles. The fatigue of these muscles during physical exercise
      generates many physiological reflex activation culminating in reduced blood flow to the limb
      muscles, resulting in decrease in muscle performance. Researchers showed that the inspiratory
      muscle training (IMT) is able to generate improved of athlete's physical performance.
      However, when it comes to wheelchair athletes there are still divergent views on the effects
      of IMT on the physical performance. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of IMT on
      the physical performance and cardiorespiratory variables of wheelchair basketball players.
      For this purpose, the investigators will select 40 wheelchair basketball players of both
      genders. The participants will be allocated blindly and randomly into two groups that differ
      by the proposed interventions. In IMT Group, the participants will be submitted to a IMT
      program with inicial load of 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP); the SHAM Group will
      be submitted to a simulated IMT with load of 15% of MIP. All participants will pass through
      the same evaluation procedures before and after the interventions, so that the investagators
      can evaluate the benefits generated by the IMT on the physical performance and
      cardiorespiratory variables of wheelchair basketball players.

    <measure>Aerobic Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of aerobic capacity will be conducted by the 12-minutes aerobic performance test in a multisport court. In this field test the participants will have to covering the greatest distance as possible in the twelve minutes in a suitably demarcated circuit. Heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation and subjective perception of effort with the Borg scale will be measured in this test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary Function</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary function will be measured by a spirometer (Easy one, ndd Medizintechnik AG, Zurich, Switzerland) according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for technique, acceptability and reproducibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The respiratory muscle strength values will be obtained by measuring maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP) with an analog manometer (Ger-ar®, São Paulo, Brazil) scaled in cmH2O with an operational limit of ± 300 cmH2O.</description>

    <measure>Thoracic mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The thoracic mobility will be measured by the thoracic cirtometry.</description>

    <measure>Heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The heart rate variability will be measured with a Polar RS800CX® heart rate monitor (Polar Electro Co.Ltda. Kempele, Oulu, Finland).</description>
