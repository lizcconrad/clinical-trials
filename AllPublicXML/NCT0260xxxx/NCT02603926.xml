    <measure>California Verbal Learning Test II</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>California Verbal Learning Test II will be assessed pre- and post-treatment, measuring the total number of words remembered after 5 repeated trials(0-64) and then 20 minutes later (0-16).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CATSYS tremor measurement scale</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CATSYS system quantifies tremor by having a participant hold a tremor pen which is connected to a computer. Ataxia is quantified by measuring sway of patients standing with eyes open and closed on a force plate connected to a computer. Patients will be assessed pre- and post- treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increase in hippocampal volume, as measured by structural MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo a structural MRI pre-and post-treatment to measure hippocampal volume.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive and intravenous infusion of Allopregnanolone at escalating doses of 2mg, 4mg, and 6mg once weekly over a three week period. The highest dose tolerated without sedation will be held stable for the remaining weekly infusions, for a total of 12 infusions.</description>
