    <textblock>
      Rationale/hypothesis: Moderate-to-severe psoriasis can be treated with biologics.

      Objective To investigate whether the dose of biologics can be reduced in patients with
      psoriasis with stable disease.

      Study design: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority study with
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

      Study population: Patients with disease remission using normal dose of biologics.

      Intervention: 120 patients will be randomized into two groups: (1) dose reduction and (2)
      normal dose.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is clinical effectiveness. Secondary
      outcomes are: health-related quality of life (HRQoL), number and time to disease flares,
      costs, health status, anti-drug antibody formation and serious adverse events

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale/hypothesis: Moderate-to-severe psoriasis can be treated with biologics. These drugs
      have significantly improved the quality of life of psoriasis patients, but are very expensive
      drugs that should be used as efficiently as possible. In addition, the long-term safety
      profile can probably be improved if patients receive the lowest effective dose.

      Objective To investigate whether the dose of biologics can be reduced in patients with
      psoriasis with stable disease: Is dose reduction non-inferior to the current practice
      regarding clinical effectiveness? Secondary aims are: to investigate what influence dose
      tapering has on quality of life, whether there are predictors for successful dose reduction,
      and to determine the cost-effectiveness of dose reduction.

      Study design: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority study with
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

      Study population: Patients who used a biologic for at least 6 months (etanercept, adalimumab,
      ustekinumab) can be included if they have long-term stable low disease activity. Low disease
      activity is defined as a PASI score (Psoriasis Area and Activity Score) &lt;5 and a
      health-related quality of life score â‰¤5 (Dermatology Quality of life index: DLQI).

      Intervention: 120 patients will be randomized into two groups: (1) dose reduction guided by
      PASI and DLQI (n=60, intervention) and (2) maintenance of normal dosage (n=60, usual care).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is clinical effectiveness. Secondary
      outcomes are: health-related quality of life (HRQoL), number and time to disease flares,
      costs, health status, anti-drug antibody formation and serious adverse events

    <description>Patients receive daily practice care, but doses of etanercept, adalimumab or ustekinumab will be lowered: intervals of drug-administration will be prolonged stepwise with tight control of disease activity and DLQI. First, the dose will be decreased to 66-70% of the normal dose (by interval prolongation with a factor 1.5). If patients remain in a state of low disease activity, the dose will be further reduced to 50% (by doubling the original interval). Each step will be analyzed after three months, or when the patient visits earlier due to complaints.</description>
