  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is a randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy,
      and mechanisms of action of hyperthermic yoga versus a waitlist control for 80 medically
      healthy adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. The primary aim is to test the
      acceptability and feasibility of hyperthermic yoga as a treatment for depression. The
      secondary aim is to examine the effect size/efficacy of hyperthermic yoga for depressive
      symptoms. The tertiary aim is to explore physiological and psychological mechanisms of
      action.
