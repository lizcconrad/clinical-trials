  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called ibrutinib as a possible treatment for untreated
      Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved ibrutinib as a form of treatment
      for the patient specific disease.

      Ibrutinib has been under investigation in research studies in participants with recurrent
      B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and prolymphocytic leukemia, and
      WM. In a study of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory WM patients, response rates were high and
      the treatment was well tolerated.

      The prior studies suggest that ibrutinib may be a useful treatment strategy for untreated WM
      patients. This study will test the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib as an option for
      untreated WM patients. The study will also conduct genomic sequencing of malignant WM cells
      before the start of treatment, and 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months afterwards. Genomic sequencing
      is the analysis of the entire DNA structure from tumor and normal cells. The purpose of this
      sequencing is to study which genetic changes effect how ibrutinib works. The results of these
      studies could also help in better understanding the course of WM disease, and be applicable
      to the development of other effective drug treatments.
