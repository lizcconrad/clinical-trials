  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Encouraging individuals to eat fruit and vegetables is difficult. However, recent evidence
      suggests that using social-based information might help. For instance, it has been shown that
      if people think that others are eating lots of fruit and vegetables, that they will consume
      more food to match the 'norm'.The purpose of this study was to determine whether social norm
      messages could be used to enhance vegetable purchases in workplace restaurants, in an
      observational study.

      In this study the investigators hypothesised that placing posters containing social norm
      messages promoting vegetable consumption in three workplace restaurants, would increase the
      purchase of meals with vegetables, and that this effect would be sustained over time. The
      investigators recruited three restaurants to this study. For two weeks (Pre-intervention
      phase) the investigators used till receipts to monitor the number of meals sold with or
      without vegetables at baseline. For the following two weeks (Intervention phase) the
      investigators placed social norms posters around the three restaurants, while continuing to
      collect till receipts. After this, the posters were removed, and receipts were monitored for
      a final two weeks (Post-intervention).
