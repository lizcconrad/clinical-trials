  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High intensity Interval training (HIT) has repeatedly been documented to have superior
      positive effects on oxygen uptake and general physical health compared to continuous moderate
      exercise in healthy individuals and patients with heart disease. Recently, the same effect
      has been shown in heart transplanted recipients. Which mechanisms that explains this
      difference is uncertain; the effect can be due to changes in the heart or changes in the
      peripheral tissue and muscles. To explore these mechanisms the investigators will in this
      study compare two different exercise modalities, and explore how different biomarkers change
      in blood, related to exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 heart transplanted recipients (and 5 healthy controls) will be included in the study. Each
      patient will have three study-days.

      The study is designed to be a cross-over study. And randomisation will decide which training
      they will have som training session 1 and training session 2; Interval or continuous
      training.

      Before starting the two training sessions they will measure oxygen uptake and baseline blood
      samples.

      During each exercise session the patients will take blood samples during and after exercise.

      After first study admission the patients will have a wash out period for 1 week until first
      training session, and another week until the last session.
