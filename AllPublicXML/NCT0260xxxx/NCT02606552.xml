      Comparatively analyze the safety and validity of Amplazter Cardiac Plug (ACP) device-using
      percutaneous left atrial appendage closure, and the medical treatment with dabigatran plus
      aspirin or dabigatran plus clopidogrel after 3months triple therapy (Dabigatran plus DAPT
      (dual-antiplatelet therapy)) in patient with coronary artery disease treated with
      drug-eluting stent, accompanying atrial fibrillation.

      Total of 670 patients [left atrial appendage occlusion registry with 100 ACP/ 570
      anti-coagulation registry: (285 Dabigatran plus aspirin) and (285 Dabigatran plus
      clopidogrel) therapy)] will be comparatively analyzed the safety and efficacy. Primary
      endpoints were a composite of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic
      embolism, and GUSTO bleeding (moderate to severe).

    <description>Dabigatran (Pradaxa®) is indicated for the prevention of thrombotic events (for example stroke or heart attack) in people with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin is indicated for the prevention of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction in patients treated with drug-eluting stents.
