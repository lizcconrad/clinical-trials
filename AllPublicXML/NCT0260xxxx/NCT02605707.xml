    <textblock>
      Stroke is a frequently occurring and common diseases in nervous system,and most of the
      survivors will remain disorders of motor,sensory and cognition function.Stem cell
      transplantation provides a promising approach for rehabilitation. The main objective of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safy of the transplantation of autologous endothelial
      progenitor cells in patients with chronic stroke.

      Stroke is a frequently occurring and common diseases in nervous system,and most of the
      survivors will remain disorders of motor,sensory and cognition function.It will brought heavy
      burden to patients themselves,their family and society.Drugs,rehabilitation excise and
      hyperbaric oxygen will improve functions after acute stroke.However,in the chronic ischemic
      stroke,there was few methods to improve the functions.In recently research,stem cell will be
      a new methods to improve the neural function after through differentiate to nervous cells and
      secrete some neurotrophic factors to repair the damage. In this study, the investigators will
      assess the safety and feasibility of intracerebral transplantation of autologous endothelial
      progenitor cells in patients with chronic ischemic stroke. The neurological outcome will be
      determined after transplantation.
