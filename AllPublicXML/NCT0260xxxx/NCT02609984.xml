  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 2 randomized study that will examine the use of the study agents,
      CMB305 (sequentially administered LV305 [a dendritic cell-targeting viral vector expressing
      the NY-ESO-1 gene] and G305 [NY-ESO-1 recombinant protein plus GLA-SE]) in combination with
      atezolizumab or atezolizumab alone, in patients with locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic
      sarcoma (synovial or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma) expressing the NY-ESO-1 protein.

      CMB305 is a novel approach designed to stimulate the body's immune system to fight the spread
      and growth of cancer in patients whose tumors express the NY-ESO-1 protein. LV305 will be
      given in a prime-boost approach with G305 to induce a potentially synergistic
      immunotherapeutic response in combination with atezolizumab.

      This study is designed to investigate and examine the time to progression for CMB305 in
      combination with atezolizumab or atezolizumab alone in the treatment of patients with sarcoma
      expressing NY-ESO-1 protein.
