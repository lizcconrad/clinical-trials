  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cumulative adhesion percentage for the test
      products and the reference products for both small and large patches.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), single-center,
      parallel-group single-application, modified 3-way crossover study. Each participant will
      receive the marketed reference formulation (DURAGESIC) or the JNJ-35685-AAA-G016 or
      JNJ-35685-AAA-G021 fentanyl transdermal system (TDS). The study consists of a screening phase
      within 21 and 2 days before the first TDS application of the first period; a
      partially-blinded treatment phase consisting of 3 single-application treatment periods; and
      end-of-study or withdrawal assessments done upon completion of the 72-hour adhesion
      assessment on Day 5 of Period 3 or upon withdrawal. A 7- to 16-day washout period will
      separate the treatment periods, commencing at transdermal patch removal. The duration of
      participation in the study for an individual participant will be 31 days to a maximum of 68
      days (including screening and follow-up visits). Participants will be primarily evaluated for
      cumulative adhesion percentage. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The actual percentages of patch adhesion will be estimated according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 0-4 scoring system. An estimated percentage of adhesion, to a whole integer, will be obtained (FDA 0-4 [%] scoring) where 0=greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 90% adhered (essentially no lift off the skin); 1= &gt;= 75% to &lt; 90% adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin); 2 = â‰¥ 50% to &lt; 75% adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin); 3 = &gt; 0% to &lt; 50% adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off); 4 = 0% adhered - patch detached (patch completely off the skin).</description>
