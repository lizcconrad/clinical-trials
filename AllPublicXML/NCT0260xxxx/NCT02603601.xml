  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is designed to test the feasibility and efficacy of a novel
      10-week mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on weight maintenance as well as behavioral and
      psychosocial outcomes in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.

      Primary hypothesis:

      Bariatric patients who have stopped losing weight (&lt; 5 lbs weight loss in past month) 1-5
      years post-surgery will be willing to participate in this 10-week intervention. The
      investigators expect a high adherence rate (&gt;70%) and no issues with meeting recruitment
      goals.

      Secondary hypotheses:

      Patients assigned to the MBI will show greater improvement in a) weight control (defined by
      differences in body weight between baseline and follow-up); b) eating behaviors (binge
      eating, emotional eating); and c) psychosocial measures (quality of life, depression,
      perceived stress, eating self-efficacy, coping ability) than a standard lifestyle
      intervention (1 hr lifestyle counseling).

      Patients assigned to the MBI intervention will show greater improvement in biomarkers of
      stress and inflammation [salivary cortisol, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP),
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)] as compared with a
      standard lifestyle intervention.

      Food-related attentional bias as measured by the food-related Stroop task will be
      differentially affected among patients assigned to the MBI as compared with the intensive
      lifestyle intervention and standard lifestyle intervention.
