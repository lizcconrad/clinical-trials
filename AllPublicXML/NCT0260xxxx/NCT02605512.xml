  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast radiotherapy RT used until the 1990s was clearly responsible for increased mortality
      due to long term cardiac complications. Since the 2000s, improvements have appeared in dose
      distributions to organ at risks such as heart, but now, little is known on the risk of
      potential cardiac impairment in this population, in particular for chemotherapy naive
      patients. Based on the state that clinically detectable cardiotoxicity is generally preceded
      by subclinical cardiac dysfunctions, the aim of the BACCARAT study (BreAst Cancer and
      Cardiotoxicity induced by RAdioTherapy) is to evaluate whether adjuvant 3DCRT induces cardiac
      toxicity that could be detected in the first two years after treatment based on a global
      approach with repeated analysis of subclinical functional and anatomical cardiac lesions in
      myocardial and coronary levels and circulating biomarkers.

      BACCARAT study consists in a monocentric prospective cohort study that will finally include
      120 women treated with adjuvant RT for breast cancer in the Clinique Pasteur in Toulouse, and
      followed for 2 years after RT.

      Women aged 50 to 70 years, treated for breast cancer and for whom adjuvant 3DCRT is
      indicated, without chemotherapy are eligible for the study.

      Baseline and follow-up include measures of functional myocardial dysfunction based on
      2D-speckle tracking echocardiography, anatomical coronary lesions based on Coronary computed
      tomography angiography, and a wide panel of circulating biomarkers. Absorbed doses is
      evaluated for whole heart and for each different parts of heart, in particular coronary
      arteries.

      Analysis on occurrence and evolutions of subclinical cardiac lesions and biomarkers will be
      performed and completed with dose-response relations with absorbed doses of different heart
      segments.
