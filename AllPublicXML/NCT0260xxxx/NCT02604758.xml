    <measure>The Coping Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>after three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Coping Inventory was developed by Carver et al. in 1989, and Turkish validity and reliability were carried out in 2005 by Ağargün et al. Each sub-scale of COPE gives information on a different attitude to coping. The scores on the sub-scales allow an interpretation to be made of which attitude to coping an individual uses most.</description>
