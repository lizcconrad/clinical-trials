    <textblock>
      The main research question of this patient survey is to assess AF (Atrial Fibrillation)
      patients' preferences associated with different attributes which describe the different
      available anticoagulation treatment options (Vitamin K Antagonists [VKA] or New Oral
      Anticoagulants [NOACs] and, in case of NOACs, Apixaban, Dabigatran, Edoxaban or Rivaroxaban).

      VKAs (Marcoumar®, Sintrom ®) will be grouped together and compared to Rivaroxaban.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the following research questions in a
      cross-sectional survey of German-speaking Swiss AF patients being treated either with a VKA
      or with a NOAC:

        -  Which attributes of a medication to prevent stroke do AF patients view as important?

        -  Do AF patients have a preference regarding the attributes of the medication options VKA
           or NOAC and, in case of NOACs, with regards to rivaroxaban attributes?

        -  Are there subgroups of AF patients whose preference for one of the medication options
           appears above or below average?

        -  What is the quality of life of Swiss German-speaking AF patients? Are there subgroups
           with differences in their quality of life (for example: subgroups of patients with
           different CHA2DS2-VASc scores)?

        -  Which burden do German-speaking Swiss AF patients experience in association with their
           anticoagulation therapy? Are there differences in the burden of treatment (ACTS) between
           patients treated with VKA or with NOACs?
