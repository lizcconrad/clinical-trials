  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a simple and easy to use tool
      that can extract relevant attention-related markers - Brain Engagement Index (BEI) from
      ongoing EEG. During standard rehabilitative physical therapy sessions.

      This research aims at assessing and fine tuning the effectiveness of a unique tool for online
      guidance of neural rehabilitation. The tool monitors patient attention level and guides the
      therapist online regarding the effectiveness of the current exercise employed. It is well
      established that maintaining a high level of attention plays a major role in the clinical
      outcome in rehabilitation. The monitoring is achieved using a cheap and simple to use EEG
      system and a breakthrough signal processing algorithm. The feedback provides the caregiver
      and patient with online information regarding the effectiveness of attention recruited during
      a given exercise. Furthermore, the investigators are developing and fine-tuning a set of
      guidelines to attain optimal attention levels. These guide lines include : Choosing an
      appropriate goal/movement for each patient; Regulating the optimal degree of effort by
      changing the difficulty level of the exercise, changing the exercise or suggesting a short
      rest period; Integrating supportive exercises such as stretches, strengthening of stabilizers
      normalization of muscle tone, sensory stimulation etc. which may enhance the performance of
      the target goal/movement; Motivating patients to exert more effort; And taking advantage of
      the quality control aspect of the BEI index in-order to augment attention of both therapist
      and patient.
