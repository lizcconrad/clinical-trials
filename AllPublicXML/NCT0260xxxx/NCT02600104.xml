      Prospective clinical study, Up to 100 healthy adult volunteers seeking Treatment of Wrinkles
      Reduction in the facial area, males or females of 18 to 75 years of age, from up to 5
      investigational sites.

      This is an open-label, multi-center study. Subjects in this study will receive up to four (4)
      facial treatments in 3-8 weeks interval, with the PicoWayTM device-fractional hand piece
      1064nm and/or 532nm according to the study protocol. Subjects will be followed by phone 7
      days post first treatment by study staff, and will return for follow‐up (FU) visits at the
      clinic at: 6 weeks and 12 weeks following the last treatment.

      Methodology described in the protocol to evaluate efficacy and safety of treatments will be
      carried out at each visit at the clinic.
