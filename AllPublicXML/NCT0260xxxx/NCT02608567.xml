  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), the prognostic value of reduced left
      ventricular (LV) ejection fraction is well known. Consequently, there is class I indication
      for surgery in these patients when LV ejection fraction &lt;50%. However, there is growing
      evidences suggesting that subclinical LV dysfunction, and more particularly longitudinal
      myocardial dysfunction, may be a powerful early predictor of outcome, even when LV ejection
      is still preserved. In asymptomatic AS patients with LV ejection fraction &gt;50%, a reduced LV
      global longitudinal strain, as assessed using speckle tracking imaging with transthoracic
      echocardiography, may be an accurate marker to identify early subclinical LV dysfunction and
      thus, to improve the risk stratification, the management and the timing of surgery. Several
      mono-centric observational small studies recently reported results emphasizing the role of LV
      global longitudinal strain in AS patients. Therefore, a meta-analysis may be conducted and
      may provide meaningful data. The investigators hypothesized that LV global longitudinal
      strain is a determinant of outcome in asymptomatic patients with AS and preserved LV ejection
      fraction.

    <description>Patients will be compared according to the level of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) as derived from transthoracic echocardiography and speckle tracking analysis.
Two groups will be compared regarding outcome: preserved LV GLS vs. reduced LV GLS. The definition use for reduced LV GLS will be &gt;-16%. An optimal threshold would also be calculated and derived from the pooled data.</description>
