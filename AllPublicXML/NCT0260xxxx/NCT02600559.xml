    <textblock>
      This is an 8-week, multicenter, open-label study in which eligible subjects with a history of
      otitis media requiring TT placement will receive 6 mg OTO-201 to each ear. The study is
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTO-201 in subjects undergoing TT placement
      with common concurrent surgeries and any middle ear effusion status.
