    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, within-cohort randomized, 2-way crossover study
      to evaluate the PK of orally administered PF-06650833 modified release tablets under fasted
      and high fat meal fed conditions in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the third study of PF-06650833. The goals of the study are to assess the PK in
      healthy subjects of single doses of modified release (MR) tablets of PF-06650833 when orally
      administered under fasting and high fat meal fed conditions.
