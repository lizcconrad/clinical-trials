    <textblock>
      The identification of all cases (44 patients) was carried out from the database of
      microbiology, University Hospital Reina Sofía and the University Hospital of Jerez. For the
      identification of controls, in case of neutropenic patients, all colonized patients that were
      included during the study period did not receive any decolonitation treatment; in case of
      non-neutropenic patients it was studied a paired control by the presence of risk factors that
      indicated the beginning of decolonitation treatment.
