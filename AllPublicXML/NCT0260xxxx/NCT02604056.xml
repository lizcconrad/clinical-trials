      Two arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial, with nursing homes allocated to the full,
      active intervention (featuring educational outreach offered to each prescriber and team
      members in the home) or standard quality improvement supports (including online audit and
      feedback reports for each prescriber in the home). The 'standard' quality improvement
      supports represent 'usual care' as these are to be launched province-wide; a concurrent
      control arm with no exposure to a quality improvement intervention is not feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and Ontario Medical Association have initiated a
      project aiming to improve appropriateness of prescribing in long-term care facilities (aka
      nursing homes) through integrated educational supports for nursing home prescribers,
      inter-professional care teams, as well as residents and family members. The first focus of
      the project is appropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications. Working with Health
      Quality Ontario, the policy makers have determined that all prescribers will have the
      opportunity to review practice reports detailing their prescribing performance for this class
      of medication (aka audit and feedback).

      The primary question of this pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial is: What is the effect of
      adding educational outreach compared to the 'usual' quality improvement supports (i.e. audit
      and feedback) on prescribing of antipsychotic medications in long-term care?

      Secondary questions include the following:

      i. What is the effect of the intervention on acute care utilization (e.g., emergency room)
      rates? ii. What is the effect of the intervention on incidence of patient clinical outcomes
      and/or adverse effects associated with antipsychotic medications (e.g., falls, aggressive
      behaviours)? iii. What is the effect of the interventions on medications that might be used
      as alternatives to antipsychotic medications (e.g., benzodiazepines)? iv. What is the
      cost-benefit, focusing on prescribing outcomes?

      Process evaluation questions include the following:

        1. How and why do the interventions work as observed?

        2. Was the intervention implemented as desired in nursing homes?

        3. What were the contextual factors associated with implementation?

        4. Do the interventions affect precursors of behaviour (e.g., motivation, capability)?

    <description>The Educational Outreach program will be delivered by academic detailers, health professionals (often nurses or pharmacists) who have received specific intensive training to support prescribing providers in a particular environment, in this case long-term care homes, to make the best or appropriate clinical decisions as possible. It is defined as: &quot;an innovative method of service-oriented educational outreach for front-line clinicians. It combines the interactive, one-on-one communication approach of industry detailers with the evidence-based, non-commercial information of academia.&quot; The Educational Outreach will be delivered in addition to online Audit + Feedback practice reports, which detail prescribing performance for this class of medication for each prescriber in the nursing home.</description>
