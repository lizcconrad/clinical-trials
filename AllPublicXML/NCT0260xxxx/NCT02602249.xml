  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, safety and effects of MUC1-gene-DC-CTL and MUC1-peptide-DC-CTL on human
      gastric cancer are going to be investigated.

      PBMC of the patient will be separated from peripheral blood.DCs infected by MUC1 and pulsed
      by MUC-1 peptide are made respectively from PBMC, then they are respectively cultured with T
      cells into MUC1-gene-DC-CTL and MUC1-peptide-DC-CTL which will be infused to the patients as
      immunotherapy.
