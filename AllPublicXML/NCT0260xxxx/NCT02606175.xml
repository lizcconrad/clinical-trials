      Patients who receive a kidney transplant have to learn in 10-14 days which anti-rejection
      medication to take, how to take it ,... This learning process is attended by the nurses of
      the ward. This study wants to measure the degree of medication knowledge, health literacy and
      medication adherence of those patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive a kidney transplant arrive at the abdominal transplantation surgery ward
      after surgery. Within 10-14 days they learn which anti-rejection medication they have to
      take, how they have to take it and to what they have to pay attention. This learning process
      is attended by the nurses of the ward.

      It is already known that a bad medication adherence is related to a higher rejection rate and
      mortality of patients who receive a kidney transplant. Bad medication knowledge and low
      health literacy are correlated with a bad medication adherence. Data about the level of
      health literacy of the Belgian population (and certainly of patients who just received a
      kidney transplant) are scarce.

      The main purpose of this study is to have an idea of the extent of medication knowledge,
      heath literacy and adherence in patients who received a renal transplant.

      Therefore, a prospective cohort study will be performed. Adult patients admitted for a renal
      transplantation, will be included after obtainment of informed consent. The patients will be
      followed for 2 years. On predefined time points, the participants will have to fill in
      questionnaires and tests: on discharge 2 tests that measure health literacy, the &quot;Basel
      Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale&quot; (BAASIS), the medication
      knowledge test and a questionnaire about demographic factors. At 1 month post-transplantation
      the BAASIS test and medication knowledge test, 3 months post-transplantation the 2 tests
      assessing health literacy, the BAASIS test and medication knowledge test and finally after 1
      and 2 years all the tests (4 in total) and questionnaire assessing demographic factors

    <description>Measurement: NVS-D = quantitative score (max = 6 points) with 3 groups: low health literacy = 0-1; intermediate health literacy = 2-3; high health literacy = 4-6.
The FCCHL contains 3 subitems (functional, communicative and critical health literacy) Each subitem contains 4 questions. Each question is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 1 to 4 (4 indicating high health literacy). The scores for the items in a scale are summed and divided by the number of items in the scale to give a scale score (theoretical range 1-4).</description>
