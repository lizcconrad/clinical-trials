  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRCA1 carriers who are at high risk of developing either a relapse and/or a new cancer growth
      will be included. These patients will be followed up during 30 months (2,5 years) with
      mutated TP53 mutation detection or during 42 months (3,5 years) with mutated TP53 mutation
      detection and circulating tumor cells detection (CTC) performed at each hospital visit (for
      technical reason only patients included at Institut Curie will be proposed to participate to
      the CTC substudy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with no evidence of any invasive tumor mass at inclusion (clinical and, if
             any, radiological exams)

          2. Carriers of known germline BRCA1 deleterious mutation (a personal history of cancer is
             NOT mandatory).

          3. Age ≥ 30 years for patient with personal previous history of cancer

          4. Age ≥ 40 years for patient without personal previous history of cancer

          5. Patient who a follow-up visit is scheduled in the including center at least once a
             year

          6. Patient having health care insurance

          7. Signed informed consent by patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient presenting with invasive tumor masses (e.g. stage IV cancer or localized
             cancer not yet surgically removed)

          2. Carriers of germline BRCA1 variant of unknown significance

          3. Carriers of germline BRCA2 deleterious mutation or variant

          4. Individuals with a low risk of BRCA1-related tumor growth, i.e. women who underwent
             prophylactic bilateral mastectomy AND adnexectomy.

          5. Any medical or other condition that in the Investigator's opinion rendered the patient
             unsuitable for this study

          6. Patient deprived from ability to decide on her own.

          7. Patient unable to have a regular follow up for geographical, social or psychological
             reasons.
