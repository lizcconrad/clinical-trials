    <textblock>
      Resilience means a healthcare provider's ability to cope, recover, and learn from stressful
      events, as well as their access to resources that promote health and well-being. Neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) health professionals' need to have particularly good resilience,
      because their work is extremely stressful and their patients, fragile preterm infants,
      require their undivided attention. The investigators propose a feasible and engaging
      intervention to enhance resilience among NICU health professionals promoting their ability to
      provide safe care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimizing provider well-being is critical to the delivery of safe and high quality care to
      the most vulnerable of patients: very preterm babies.

      Major innovative objectives of this proposal include testing the Web-based Implementation for
      the Science of Enhancing Resilience (WISER) program's effectiveness in enhancing resilience
      among Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) health workers, evaluating its effect on unit
      safety culture, and examining its effect on clinical outcomes in preterm infants. The WISER
      program is an established but low-intensity yet engaging intervention, which integrates
      education and behavior modification to boost provider well-being and resilience in order to
      create an organizational environment which prevents patient harm.

      Care for the more than 50,000 very low birth weight (VLBW; &lt; 1500 gm) infants born annually
      in the United States is challenging and expensive. Quality of care and outcomes vary widely.
      Increasing technical demands and patient acuity have pushed burnout among health workers to
      the breaking point. The few tested interventions that improve caregiver resilience lack
      feasibility for widespread adoption. This study is designed to achieve the following aims:

        1. Test the effectiveness of WISER in improving NICU health professional resilience;

        2. Test the effectiveness of WISER in improving patient safety and organizational outcomes;

        3. Test the sustainability of WISER; and

        4. Describe the barriers and facilitators of the WISER program.

      The investigators will test the efficacy of the WISER Program in the NICU setting using a
      stepped-wedge mixed-methods randomized controlled trial (swRCT) at six tertiary care NICUs.
      The results of this trial will also provide insights into the causal relations between health
      worker resilience, the organizational environment, and clinical outcomes among infants born
      VLBW.

      Two blocks with 3 NICUs each will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention cohorts.
      The WISER NICUs program consists of six 10-minute videos delivered over the course of a
      six-month period. Following the end of the initial intervention, each NICU will receive
      individualized feedback/refresher webinar at 12 months, and a final follow-up at 24 months.
      The investigators will use measures of perception (surveys of health professional's
      perceptions) and quantifiable measures (clinical measures) to assess the efficacy of the
      intervention in different domains (resilience, organizational environment, and health).
      Qualitative methods will provide further insights into facilitators and barriers of the
      efficacy of WISER.

    <measure>NICU health professional resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Burnout (emotional exhaustion) is the primary resilience outcome. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) has been the gold standard tool in the field of burnout research. In our investigations, the Emotional Exhaustion subscale, in particular, is consistently associated with variables such as staff turnover, disruptive behavior, productivity, delays, and teamwork. When used as a &quot;percent agree&quot; metric, we have shown it to be a very effective indicator of emotional exhaustion at the group level for a clinical area or work setting. We will use a shortened 4-item version of this subscale from the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which we validated in the NICU setting. The response scale ranges from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). Resilience will be calculated as the percentage of NICU providers who disagree slightly or strongly with the 4 items assessing features of emotional exhaustion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work-Life Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Work-Life Balance (WLB). WLB items were adopted from the College Activities and Behavior Questionnaire. These items that can be interpreted at face-value. All items are prefaced with, &quot;during the past week, how often did this occur&quot; and include items such as &quot;argued with a co-professional&quot; and &quot;arrived home late from work&quot;; they are answered on a four-point scale (0 = rarely or none; 3 = all of the time). Each of these items individually is face-valid and interpretable, but together they make for robust debriefings and discussions linking QI to work-life balance. They are internally consistent, with a Cronbach's alpha of α = 0.82 in our large resilience database.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-10-item version (CES-D10), a psychometrically sound tool for screening respondents for clinical depression, consists of ten items. All items are prefaced with, &quot;during the past week, how often did this occur,&quot; include items such as &quot;I could not 'get going'&quot; and &quot;my sleep was restless,&quot; and are answered on a four-point scale (0 = rarely or none; 3 = all of the time). Each participant's responses are summed together to achieve a 0- to 30-point scale. A score of 10 or higher is considered a positive screen. We have used the CES-D10 in several WISER and three good things studies without any problems under the existing IRB. The CES-D10 is not a suicide screening tool, it is explicitly used to screen for depression without a suicide item.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Happiness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rather than to solely focus on negative outcomes, we will also measure happiness via the well-validated Subjective Happiness Scale. This 4-item measure of global subjective happiness was developed and validated 15 years ago using 14 studies with a total of 2732 participants, and has high internal consistency, test-retest, self-peer correlations, as well as excellent convergent and discriminant validity. The strong psychometrics and brevity of this scale have made it very popular in positive psychology interventions that require more precision in the assessment of subjective happiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and teamwork climate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>These two scales of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) to assess health professionals' perceptions of these dimensions. Response scales range from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). These scales have been linked most closely with burnout, clinical, and operational outcomes. Scale scores will be calculated according to published methods.</description>

    <measure>Any health care associated infection</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use standardized Vermont Oxford Network (VON) data definitions for all clinical data during the birth hospitalization. We chose this outcome because we have found it to be modifiable, and sensitive to health professional participation and unit safety culture. The VON addresses measurement bias through data collection procedures designed to minimize error and maximize accuracy. Data are abstracted from the medical record locally, using standardized protocols. Throughout this study, we will be able to collect routine clinical data collected for the VON database directly from participating NICUs.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Voluntary Nursing Turnover</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be collected through a 3-item intention to leave index (I would like to find a better job; I often think about leaving this job; and I have plans to leave this job within the next year (α=.915)). We have found these items responsive to intervention in our work with the Comprehensive Unit Based Safety Program.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Conflicts with co-professionals</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Conflicts will be measured using a disruptive behavior index that assesses the prevalence of 15 distinct types of disruptive behaviors, as well as the extent to which they are managed well in a given work setting.</description>

    <description>The intervention will begin for all NICUs, with baseline surveys as necessary pre-work. For those unable to attend, a link to the baseline survey will be emailed with site champion instructions to complete in groups at staff meetings and during shift change. Two weeks later, three randomly (random number generator) assigned NICUs (block 1) included in the first block webinar will then receive Module 1 of the intervention with Modules 2-6 being rolled out monthly. The second block of three NICUs starts approximately six-month later.</description>

    <description>This module introduces a structured opportunity to cultivate positive experiences by reflecting on them for a couple of minutes within two hours of sleep onset (daily email/SMS sent to each participant for 2 weeks). By savoring good moments from earlier that day just before sleep onset, we see improvements in resilience, sleep quality, relationships, work-life balance, and depression. Participants also benefit from electronically sharing the nightly Three Good Things with their colleagues.</description>

    <description>This module provides a structured opportunity to learn about and experience the benefits of awe and wonder through a series of visually and conceptually stunning images, followed by an exercise to recount in detail one of their own experiences of awe and a daily &quot;moment of awe&quot; log. When we experience awe, our sense of time expands, we are kinder to others, and we prefer experiences over material things. By cultivating awe we see improvements in life satisfaction, kindness, and sense that we have more time to do the important things in life.</description>

    <description>This module uses a strengths-finder tool to examine what you do well, and sends daily email prompts to elicit how participants will be deliberate about using their strengths in new and more frequent ways to address their challenges. When you use your strengths personally and professionally, you feel engaged and invigorated, and you feel like what you are doing has more meaning to you personally. By deliberately choosing to do what we already do well, we see improvements in engagement, happiness, resilience and depression.</description>
