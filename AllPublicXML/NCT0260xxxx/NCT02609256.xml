    <textblock>
      Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction(MMCI) has a high rate of disability and
      mortality. At present, there is no effective treatment except for craniotomy decompression,
      but the controversy of the craniotomy decompression still exists. The project is a
      prospective, randomized, single center, open label, clinical controlled trail. The eligible
      patients for enrollment are as follows: (1) malignant cerebral artery infarction within 48h
      onset; (2) craniotomy decompression can not be performed due to the contraindications, or
      refused by the patient or relatives. The patients are randomly assigned into 2 groups:
      (1)Medical therapy group: receiving osmotic therapy with mannitol and glycerol
      fructose，anti-platelet treatment, statins, and other symptomatic treatments such as
      controlling blood pressure, blood sugar, and infection, tracheal intubation or incision, etc;
      (2) Stereotactic infarct tissue aspiration (SITA) group: on the basis of medical treatment,
      receiving minimally invasive aspiration of infarct tissue 24-48 hours after stroke attacked.
      This study is aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety of of SITA in patients with MMCI.

    <textblock>
      Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MMCI) has a fatality rate of up to 80%, due to
      massive brain edema, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebral herniation. The
      herniation-induced death usually occured during the first week, despite aggressive
      osmotherapy with mannitol or hypertonic saline, sedation, and eventually hyperventilation,
      buffers, or hypothermia. A growing evidence show that decompression craniectomy (DC) can
      produce a significant reduction in mortality rate and an improvement in neurological outcome,
      but the controversy of the DC still exists. There is an urgent need to find a more effective
      treatment method. Given that brain tissue necrosis-induced edema and cerebral herniation is
      the key reason of fatality and disability of MMCI patients, the investigators argue that the
      reduction of cerebral tissue volume by stereotactic infarct tissue aspiration (SITA) is
      likely to reach the decompression effect similar to the DC. Recently, the investigators
      performed SITA in 2 MMCI patients who were qualified for decompressive craniectomy, but
      refused by patient relatives, and their neurological function significantly improved.

      The project is a prospective, randomized, single center, open label, clinical controlled
      trail. The eligible patients for enrollment are as follows: (1)ages from 40 to 90 years old;
      (2) malignant cerebral artery infarction within 48h onset; (3) craniotomy decompression can
      not be performed due to the contraindications, or refused by the patient or relatives. The
      patients are randomly assigned into 2 groups: (1) Medical therapy group: receiving osmotic
      therapy with mannitol and glycerol fructose，anti-platelet treatment, statins, and other
      symptomatic treatments such as controlling blood pressure, blood sugar, and infection, and
      tracheal intubation or incision, etc; (2) SITA group: receiving minimally invasive aspiration
      of infarct tissue 24-48 hours after stroke attacked on the basis of medical treatment. This
      study is aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety of of SITA in patients with MMCI.

    <description>The patient posed supine position to expose local skin and puncture point was located at 6.5 cm behind the hairline of the lesion side, and 5.0 cm lateral of midline. After routine skin preparation and disinfection, 5% lidocaine 2-5 ml was injected for local anesthesia. The skin was cut to expose periosteum by a scalpel. After skull was vertically drilled through with a 6mm diameter hole, a sterile tube with a needle in tube was put about 8 cm into centrum semiovale. The needle was put out and about 50ml necrosis brain tissue was aspirated by a 20 ml syringe. The tube was fixed into the skin about 2 cm after subcutaneous tunnel, and connected to the drainage bag. Surgical area was sterilized and wrapped by sterile gauze bandage.</description>
