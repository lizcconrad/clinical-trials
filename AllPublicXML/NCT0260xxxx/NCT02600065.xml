  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radio(chemo)therapy is the standard therapy for both, brain tumors and brain metastases.
      Neurological decline is observed in these patients and tumor progression or radiotherapy side
      effects have been made responsible for this. However CMV encephalitis may also be a reason.
      Therefore the investigators aim to analyze the CMV status in patients during and after
      radio(chemo)therapy. It will be checked by CMV-DNA (PCR analysis) and CMV antibodies (IgG and
      IgM ELISA) in the blood of the patients. These findings will be correlated with changes in
      the brain, visualized by MRI. In addition a detailed immunophenotyping in the peripheral
      blood will be performed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of CMV status during radio(chemo)therapy (RCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to day 45 after start of Radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>CMV infection will be monitored by virus analysis by an approved laboratory. The analyses were conducted at time points during and after RCT - before RT (day 0), during RT (dose halftime), end of RT (last day of RT), month 3 and 6 after completed RT. This scheme is repeated if patient receives additional RT for relapse treatment. The time points during RT were determined depending on the applied irradiation dose. For glioblastoma the halftime of RT is usually day 23 (received dose 30 Gy) and the end of therapy is usually day 45 (received dose 60 Gy). For cerebral metastases the halftime of the RT is usually day 8 (received dose 9 Gy) and day 16 at the end of therapy (received dose 18 Gy). However, the time points are strongly connected to the received dose.</description>

    <description>Immunophenotyping of the patients. Detection of about 30 distinct immune sell (sub)types together with their activation markers.The analyses were conducted at time points during and after RCT - before RT (day 0), during RT (dose halftime), end of RT (last day of RT), month 3 and 6 after completed RT.
