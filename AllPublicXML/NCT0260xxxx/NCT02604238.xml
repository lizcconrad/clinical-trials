    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether mid dose (safe dose) of Alteplase in
      addition to standard treatment with heparin (LMWH) in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE)
      at intermediate risk, it is effective to reduce:

        -  right ventricular dysfunction

        -  pulmonary hypertension 24 hours and 7 days after the treatment

        -  PE recurrence to 7days and 30 days after the treatment without increasing the incidence
           of bleeding intra-extracranial

      The guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC2014) confirm the indication for
      pharmacological revascularization with thrombolysis only to cases of pulmonary embolism at
      high risk and thus hemodynamically unstable (class of recommendation I, level of evidence B),
      reserving the surgical or interventional procedures to cases where thrombolysis has failed or
      is contraindicated, while it remains controversial the role of thrombolysis in patients with
      pulmonary embolism at intermediate risk; the current state, in EP intermediate risk, the
      standard treatment involves the administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or
      fondaparinux (for 5-10 days followed by anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists)
      or alternatively the new anticoagulants oral (NAO). Although the results of the study PEITHO,
      recently published, confirm the indication for thrombolytic therapy for primary reperfusion
      in patients with embolism pulmonary high risk and provide element of reflection about the
      incidence of intracranial hemorrhage major, recent studies suggest that the thrombolysis with
      tPA to reduced dose (about half the dose that used in standard thrombolysis) in addition to
      anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin) may reduce pulmonary hypertension (systolic
      artery pulmonary pressure&gt; 40 mmHg) and the incidence of recurrent PE. In this protocol,
      based on the study MOPETT and pharmacokinetic data available, it is used a &quot;safe dose&quot; (safe
      dose reduced) of alteplase which provides a intravenous (iv) bolus loading dose of 10 mg in 1
      min, followed by intravenous infusion 40 mg within two hours (for patients weighing &lt;50 kg
      loading dose iv bolus of 0.5 mg in 1 min, followed by iv infusion of 40 mg within two hours).

      After treatment with alteplase, the heparin therapy will be resumed when aPTT values are less
      than twice the upper limit of normal; the infusion will be adjusted to maintain aPTT between
      50-70 seconds (1.5 to 2.5 times the reference value), and for safety reasons are excluded
      patients&gt; 65 -70 years (increased risk of bleeding complications related age and
      comorbidities).
