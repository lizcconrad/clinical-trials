  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 2 parts: a double-blinded phase and an open-label extension phase. The
      blinded phase only will be described in this record. Participants will be randomized in a 4:1
      ratio to receive GWP42003-P or matching placebo. The hypothesis is that levels of stiripentol
      (STP) or valproate (VPA) may be altered (increased or decreased) as a result of using
      GWP42003-P.
