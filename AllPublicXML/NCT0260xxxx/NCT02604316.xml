      The proposed study will address the effect of developed novel food products through
      processing innovation on motivation to eat, biomarkers of satiety, nutrient bioavailability
      and gut health using in vivo studies and validating new in vivo approaches.

      Specifically in this protocol the investigators will address, in a short human intervention
      study the effect of a potentially satiating product on appetite, appetite biomarkers,
      particularly the influence on gut microbiota, tolerance and safety of the products in healthy
      obese and overweight participants in free living conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has suggested that food structure and food composition has a role to play
      in controlling consumption. Low-energy, high-fibre diets provide physical bulk in the
      gastro-intestinal tract to sustain fullness in a way that low-volume, energy-dense foods
      cannot. However, studies shown low long term acceptability be probably associated to its poor
      palatability. Taste and hedonic experience remain the main drivers of consumer choice, and
      the immediate sensory aspect of food products such as palatability to have greater salience
      to consumers than their health promoting properties.

      Changing the properties of foods merely by changing oro-sensory properties and through the
      delay of gastric emptying deals with mechanisms critical to within-meal satiation and early
      post meal satiety and may produce only transient suppression of hunger unless regularly
      consumed and represent benefits in delivering nutritional stimuli to key parts of the
      gastro-intestinal tract. The potential to manufacture change can make food structure variety
      now seem near limitless due the numerous advances in food technology.

      Several recent reports have associated satiety effects with fermentable fibre sources in
      human dietary studies. Apparently, the large intestine microbiota recovers 'extra' calories
      from the diet and might contributes to obesity. However, the different mechanisms involved in
      lean and obese subjects are not completely resolved. Recent evidence in experimental animal
      designs indicates that changes in gut microbiota composition may be associated with increased
      food intake and obesity suggesting that satiety and intake are influenced by the species
      composition of the gut microbiota.

      This short-term human nutrition study comprises in a randomised, cross-over design testing
      either two potentially satiety product, Arabinoxylan (A) or Beta-glucan (B) against an
      equivalent amount of heterogeneous natural fibre (Control) in 40 healthy-obese volunteers,
      aged 18-65 years old, BMI between 27 and 42Kg/m2 from both genders after an initial
      maintenance diet in free- living conditions.

      Dietary intake, body weight, blood pressure would be monitored through the study. Faecal,
      urine and blood samples will be collected to monitor, glucose, insulin, gut peptides and
      assess metabolites of dietary and microbial origin. Orocecal Transit Time (OCTT),
      carbohydrate fermentability and methanogen status will be estimated using a breath test and
      transit time will be determined using SmartPill™.

    <description>During this part of the study the effect of novel fibre of 3 dietary interventions subsequent each other: Maintenance (3 days), Arabinoxylan or Beta glucan per 10 days and Control diet per 10 days. Weight loss will be assessed after dietary intervention. Changes on body weight, BMI and total and regional body composition information using a two compartment model (fat mass and fat free mass by air displacement densitometry -Bod-Pod) will be assessed at the end of each dietary intervention. Resting Metabolic Rate will be assessed the beginning and at the end of the weight loss diet (Deltatrac).</description>

    <time_frame>23 days</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of a novel fibre on gut health: Gut microbiota, short chain fatty acids production.
To assess metabolites of dietary and microbial origin including short chain fatty acid. Bacterial community structure will be assessed by targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), high throughput 454 sequencing (Walker et al., ISME J 2010) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining to estimate total bacteria. Gut transit will be assessed once at the end of each diet using a wireless motility device (SmartPill™). Only 4 volunteers will receive this assessment during the last 5 days of each maintenance period.
Questionnaires will be provided to monitor qualitatively gastrointestinal wellbeing during each dietary intervention.</description>
