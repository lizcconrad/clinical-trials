  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disorder of oral language development is defined by the delay in language acquisition in
      children who possess efficient auditory acuity and normal non verbal intellect.

      The diversity of language developement disorders depends either in the expressive level or in
      the receptive level leading to divers syndromes and symptoms. These syndromes and symptoms
      are regrouped under the name of STOL (Specific Troubles of Oral Language).

      In the current project the visual exploitation and learning capability of children presenting
      a STOL condition will be compared to patients with a normal development. The investigator's
      hypothesis is as follows: STOL patients for whom the STOL disorder is reduced between 4 and 7
      years of age will present a better performance at verbal memorisation, compared to patients
      with a persistent STOL condition after the age of 6.

    <measure>Changes from baseline in the score associated to speech-language outcome measured by a scale grouping results of different questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>0,12, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine if capacities of verbal memory of the children presenting STOL diagnosed at an early stage of their development (before 6 years) are predictive of the evolution of the disorder according to their cognitive profile and more specifically, their language profile as well as their tests performances. To measure the speech language outcome is necessary to take in consideration the score of more than one test performance.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test</measure>
    <time_frame>0,12, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) is a test often used in educational settings that is comprised of 60 multiple choice questions. This is a nonverbal test in that the questions are comprised of visual patterns. RPM measures the ability to think clearly about complex ideas and the ability to store and recall information.</description>

    <description>It is done in order to determine if their is a relation between the evolution of processes involved in verbal memorisation (cognitive mechanisms in charge of data processing).
Eye tracker will allow the recording of information regarding eye fixation (number, duration, location) and saccadic eye movements (speed, range, number, duration) in order to determine the interplay between linguistic and visual information processing during test performances.</description>

    <description>STOL children will be recruited in the neuropediatric unit at the GHICL in Lille. Children will be followed and we will determine if capacities of verbal memory of the children presenting STOL diagnosed at an early stage of their development (before 6 years) are predictive of the evolution of the disorder according to their cognitive profile and more specifically, their language profile as well as their tests performances. The participants' eye movements ( visual world paradigm or eye tracking) will be recorded in order to determine the interplay between linguistic and visual information processing.
Patients with a persistent STOL will be identified at the end of the follow up.</description>
