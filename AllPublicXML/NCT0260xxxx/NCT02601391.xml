  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective the STEPPS-HI group is at improving
      emotional regulation skills in those with identified difficulties in this area within
      forensic inpatient services. In addition, to explore whether there is increased acceptability
      of the adapted STEPPS group (STEPPS-HI) for this client group.

    <textblock>
      Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) is a manualised
      group programme for people primarily with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder
      (BPD). Although, STEPPS groups have been run within prisons in USA, it has been less formally
      evaluated within forensic psychiatric settings except for Pipon-Young &amp; Cole (2012). Taking
      the learning from these studies into account, significant adaptations to the current STEPPS
      manual are needed to increase the acceptability and applicability of the group within
      forensic settings.

      Following the adaption of the STEPPS manual for a forensic inpatient population (STEPPS HI),
      this research aims to investigate how effective the group is at improving emotional
      regulation skills in those with identified difficulties in the area as well as whether there
      is increased acceptability of the adapted group for the participants. The outcome of the
      research is intended to provide feedback on the adaption of the STEPPS manual and also an
      evaluation of the revised programme.
