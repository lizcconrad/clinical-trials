  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the effects of an office-based, clinical trial education video on
      clinical trial knowledge and enrollment in clinical trials, in a clinical sample with no
      previous history of clinical trial participation. This study will also determine the
      feasibility of implementing an office-based video educational program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials are essential to scientific discovery and are critical to translating
      research in to practice. Despite their significance, clinical trial participation rates
      remain low, especially among underrepresented minority groups. Several barriers exist to
      minority group participation in clinical trial, one of which lack of awareness about clinical
      trials. Video educational programs show promise as an effective strategy to increase
      knowledge and clinical trial participation. The specific aims are as follows:

        1. Measure the effects of an office-based, clinical trial education video on clinical trial
           knowledge and enrollment in clinical trials, in a clinical sample with no previous
           history of clinical trial participation.

        2. Determine the feasibility of implementing an office-based video educational program.

    <description>The stages of implementation completion (SIC) measure will be used as an internal tool utilized by the study team to track time to achievement of key implementation milestones. An 8-stage implementation plan to measure feasibility of the office-based educational program will be executed across 3 phases. Three scores will be derived from the SIC measure. The first score is the number of stages completed. The second score is the time spent at each stage. The third score is the proportion of activities completed at each stage. Implementation of the SIC model poses no additional burden on study participants.</description>

Next, participants in the standard of care group will be provided standard educational resources (booklet and DVD), with no additional instructions. Participants in this groups will be informed that a team member will call him/her in approximately 1 week to ask him/her the (same) questions about clinical research.</description>
