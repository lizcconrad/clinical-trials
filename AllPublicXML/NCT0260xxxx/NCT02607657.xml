  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized, parallel trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
      Eplerenone tablet at different dosages (25 mg once daily, 50 mg once daily, 100 mg (2 tablets
      of 50 mg) once daily and 50 mg twice daily). Sample size is 96 participants (24 per treatment
      group), male or female, aged between 18 and 50 years-old.

      Primary objective is to evaluate pharmacokinetics of Eplerenone tablet at different dosages,
      and secondary objective is to evaluate safety and tolerability of the investigational
      product.

      Study overall duration is approximately 12 weeks, including enrollment and follow-up visits.
      Participants will be admitted for a period of 36 hours, when investigational product will be
      administered, and blood samples, at pre-determined time periods, will be collected for
      pharmacokinetics.

      Primary endpoint is to obtain pharmacokinetics parameters. Additionally, safety will be
      assessed by adverse events occurrence and laboratory exams evaluation.
