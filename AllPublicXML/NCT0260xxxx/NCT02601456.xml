  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The changes in step length asymmetry after prolonged effort in running on a treadmill.</measure>
    <time_frame>Several measurements during 20-30 minutes run.</time_frame>
    <description>Step length will be recorded by the v-gait analysis system during the running test for 20 seconds at certain points of the run: minute 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. If the subject will ask to stop the run, 20 seconds will be recorded prior to the termination of the run.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The changes in contact time asymmetry after prolonged effort in running on a treadmill.</measure>
    <time_frame>Several measurements during 30 minutes run.</time_frame>
    <description>Contact time will be recorded by the v-gait analysis system during the running test for 20 seconds at certain points of the run: minute 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. If the subject will ask to stop the run, 20 seconds will be recorded prior to the termination of the run.</description>
