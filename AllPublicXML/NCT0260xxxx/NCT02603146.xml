    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is safe and effective
      for the prevention of future onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in individuals who have
      elevations of an autoantibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP).

      The following recruitment strategies will be employed towards identifying healthy subjects
      with elevated anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 3 (anti-CCP3) levels:

      -Pre-screening:

        -  first degree relatives of patients with RA;

        -  subjects at health-fairs; and

        -  identification of subjects with elevated anti-CCP3 levels in the absence of inflammatory
           arthritis in rheumatology clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects an estimated 1% of the population. RA is a disease where
      the immune system attacks the joints, leading to joint inflammation and damage that is felt
      by someone with RA as joint pain, stiffness and swelling.

      Recent studies have shown that there are markers in the blood called 'autoantibodies' that
      precede the onset of joint symptoms of RA. Antibodies are commonly made in the blood to fight
      infections. Sometimes, these antibodies attack one's own body. These are called
      autoantibodies.

      Certain autoantibodies are specific for certain diseases. The autoantibody known as anti-CCP
      is specific for RA and can predict the development of RA in the future, especially if the
      level of anti-CCP is high. The investigators of this study believe that individuals with
      elevations of anti-CCP greater than 2 times the normal value have approximately a 50% chance
      of developing RA within 3 years.

      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is already used successfully and safely in the treatment of malaria,
      lupus and RA. The objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with HCQ in
      individuals with elevations of anti-CCP without joint inflammation may help prevent the
      future onset of RA. This will involve a 12-month course of HCQ in the prevention of the
      development of clinically apparent RA at 36 months in individuals at high-risk for future RA
      due to high titer elevations of anti-CCP3. This study will recruit for individuals without a
      history or clinical findings of inflammatory arthritis. Eligible subjects will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to HCQ versus HCQ placebo.
