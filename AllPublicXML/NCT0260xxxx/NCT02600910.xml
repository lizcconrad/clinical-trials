  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 300,000 people in the United States have spinal cord injuries and many use manual
      wheelchairs for mobility. Most manual wheelchair users will develop shoulder injuries and
      pain that greatly affect quality of life and level of independence. Understanding when
      shoulder disease starts in manual wheelchair users and which daily activities contribute to
      the disease will provide necessary evidence for effective primary prevention methods to
      inhibit the development of further disability. Our central hypothesis is that the development
      of shoulder disease in manual wheelchair users will be strongly associated with the
      cumulative exposure to elevated shoulder postures combined with high upper body loading.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the 1.7 million wheelchair users in the United States (US), 90 percent, or 1.5 million
      persons use manual wheelchairs (MWCs). People with traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord
      injuries (SCI) make up approximately 20% of the MWC users, and 12,000 new traumatic SCIs
      occur every year. While MWCs are immediately available and enable independence, 63% of MWC
      users will have one or multiple rotator cuff tears after decades of MWC use as compared to
      15% of age-matched able-bodied adults. A crucial gap in knowledge exists in understanding how
      the shoulder of MWC users functions from an almost permanent seated position as an agent for
      mobility, weight bearing, and hand grasping; and how this altered function translates to
      longitudinal shoulder health decline.

      The objective of this application is to define the longitudinal components of the early phase
      (before chronic symptom onset) of shoulder health decline specific to new MWC users by
      characterizing the exposure to altered shoulder function and the associated MRI signs of
      early onset of shoulder pathology. The investigators propose to: (Aim 1) quantify shoulder
      joint motion and loading in the real world over 3 years in 50 new MWC users and a matched
      able-bodied cohort; (Aim 2) define early, preclinical changes on shoulder MRI specific to the
      MWC users, over 3 years, in comparison to the matched cohort; and (Aim 3) identify specific
      exposure measures as risk factors for early changes on MRI in the MWC users. Three central
      and novel aspects of this proposal will pave the way for targeting primary prevention: (1)
      characterizing the altered shoulder function in new MWC users in the real world with hardware
      and instrumentation suitable for multiple, day long collections, (2) defining the early,
      preclinical pattern of disease in users compared to a matched able-bodied cohort, and
      (3)investigating the combined effect of shoulder motion and loading and its relationship to
      the incidence of shoulder pathology.

      Successful completion of this project will define how the shoulder responds to MWC use (Aim
      1), identify the MWC-specific pattern of shoulder disease on MRI (Aim 2), and determine how
      altered shoulder function has contributed to shoulder health decline (Aim 3). This work
      provides the foundation for understanding the relative impact of shoulder elevation and
      loading in shoulder health decline. Additionally, this work provides the first building block
      in defining the complete natural history of shoulder disease in MWC users. The investigators
      expect the overall impact to be a powerful influence on environmental and assistive
      technology redesign, post-SCI rehabilitation practices, insurance reimbursement for shoulder
      health-preserving equipment, and understanding shoulder pathology in the general population.

    <time_frame>3-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the standardized MRI Assessment of the shoulder guide to assess shoulder pathology and compare baseline shoulder condition on MRI to yearly follow-up. For the purposes of grading, pathology aside from rotator cuff tears will be assessed on an ordinal scale from 0-3 with 0 indicating no abnormality, 1 mild, 2 moderate, and 3 severe. Field measurements will be used to determine changes in upper extremity motion and loading from baseline across 3-5 years of follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>3-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will model the preclinical phase of shoulder health decline based on the Natural History of Disease. The exposure variables are defined by the upper extremity motion and loading, and the biological onset of the disease and pattern of disease development will be defined with the MRI findings of pathology type, location, and severity. Using regression techniques, an exposure-response relationship will be defined.</description>

        50 new manual wheelchair users with traumatic or non-traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI)
        will be recruited &amp; consented during the first 2 years of this project. Subjects will be
        recruited at sites that treat &amp; rehabilitate people with acute SCI. SE MN &amp; neighboring
        states will be the 1st regions of recruitment. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were
        chosen to include a sample of the population of people with new SCIs who will use MWCs as
        their primary mode of mobility inside and outside the home. For 25 SCI participants, an
        age, sex, and activity level able-bodied matched participant will be recruited from the SE
        MN area.
