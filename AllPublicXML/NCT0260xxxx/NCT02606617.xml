  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the improvement of living level, the incidence rates of diabetes, obesity, and
      hypertension in China increased quickly, which are 11.6%, 7.1% and 18.8% respectively,
      according to the newly investigated data. The clustering of diabetes, obesity, hypertension
      and dyslipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events for patients. GLP-1 (glucagon
      like peptide-1) is a kind of incretin discovered in recent years. It was reported that beside
      its hypoglycemic and losing weight effects, activator of GLP-1 receptor could decrease blood
      pressure and improve lipid metabolism. Sleeve gastrectomy can improve the level of blood
      glucose and serum lipid of type 2 diabetic rats by ameliorate insulin level and insulin
      resistance, which may be related with the change of gastrointestinal hormones such as ghrelin
      and GLP-1. So, intervention of gastrointestinal tract and gastrointestinal hormone secretion
      may be a new therapy for glycolipids disorder and vascular complications. But, it is lack of
      evidence-based medicine proof on the relationship between prokinetic drug and glycolipids
      metabolism. So, the investigators designed a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo
      control study, and try to evaluate the effects of prokinetic drug (Mosapride) on the blood
      glucose and serum lipid in type 2 diabetic patients.
