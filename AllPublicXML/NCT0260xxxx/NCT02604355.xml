          -  Able to comply with study restrictions

          -  Non-smoker (nor tobacco-containing products) for at least 90 days prior to dosing on
             Day 1 and agreeing not to smoke during the study

        Chronic Hepatitis B-Infected Participants' Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic hepatitis B infection

          -  A BMI between 18 to 32 kg/m^2, inclusive

          -  Positive test for HBsAg for more than 6 months prior to randomization

          -  On entecavir or tenofovir treatment for at least 6 months prior to randomization and
             remaining on stable treatment during the study

          -  Liver biopsy, fibroscanÂ® or equivalent test obtained within the past 6 months
             demonstrating liver disease consistent with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection
             without evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis

          -  Males must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures, and agree to refrain from donating sperm during the study

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use non-hormonal contraceptive methods that result in a
             failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least until the
             end of the follow-up period

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Healthy Participants' Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are lactating

             examination and in the laboratory test results (including hepatic and renal panels,
             complete blood count, chemistry panel and urinalysis) at screening and on Day -1

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 90 days prior to
             screening or 5 times the half-life of the investigational drug (whichever is longer)

          -  Donation of blood over 500 mL within three months prior to screening

          -  Concomitant disease or condition (including allergic reactions against any drug, or
             multiple allergies) that could interfere with, or treatment of which might interfere
             with, the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             pose an unacceptable risk to the healthy participant in this study
