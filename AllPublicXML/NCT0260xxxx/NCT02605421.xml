  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single center study to administer two courses of myeloablative
      consolidation chemotherapy each followed by an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      rescue in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have completed induction chemotherapy
      (independent of this study). Ideally, patients should begin consolidation chemotherapy no
      later than 8 weeks after the start of Induction Cycle #5; however it is strongly recommended
      to begin consolidation within 4-6 weeks after the start of Induction Cycle #5.

          -  Minimum frozen PBSCs of 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg for each transplant are mandatory and a
             PBSC of 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg for back-up are strongly recommended (thus, PBSC of no
             less than 6 x 106 CD34 cells/kg is encouraged). These must all be collected prior to
             the initiation of consolidation.

             Creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 If a
             creatinine clearance is performed at end induction and the result is &lt; 100
             ml/min/1.73m^2, a GFR must then be performed; Cardiac: shortening fraction ≥ 27% or
             ejection fraction ≥ 50%, no clinical congestive heart failure
