  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytological examination of punctured lymph nodes is the gold standard for confirming
      metastatic lymph node spread of differentiated thyroid cancers. In order to increase the
      diagnostic sensitivity of fine-needle cyto-punctured lymph nodes, an assessment of Tg levels
      of the aspirate could be included. Although this technique has been well proven, many
      uncertainties remain, especially with regards to a pathological cut-off value and its
      clinical utility when the thyroid is still intact. This uncertainty is mainly due to
      discordancy between low Tg levels found in cytopunctured lymph nodes with normal cytology,
      and their final histopathological analyses.

      To eliminate this uncertainty, cyto-punction will be performed intra-operatively after
      localizing and isolating the target lymph nodes for assessment of cytology and Tg values. The
      thyroid gland might be present or absent (already operated) depending on the case. Finally,
      the cyto-punctured lymph nodes will be excised for complete histopathological analysis. In
      order to determine whether the Tg values are appropriate in cases where the thyroid is
      intact, a control group has been included (First operation for thyroid cancer or benign
      pathology). To eliminate the possible iatrogenic risks of lymph node dissection and resection
      in patients for whom it is not indicated, only lymph nodes found along the incision path for
      neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (performed systematically) will be analysed
      and excised.
