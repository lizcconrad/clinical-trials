  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will estimate how fast two antiepileptic drugs (Levetiracetam and Brivaracetam)
      enter the human brain. Brain imaging will be used to measure how quickly the radioactive
      probe [11C]UCB-J exits the brain when Levetiracetam or Brivaracetam are given. This will be
      used to estimate how fast the antiepileptic drugs enter the brain.

    <description>Cohort 1: Half of the subjects will receive LEV as a 5 minute iv infusion during the second Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, 60 minutes after the start of [11C]UCB-J administration.
Cohort 2: Half of the subjects will receive LEV as a 5 minute iv infusion during the first PET scan, 60 minutes after the start of [11C]UCB-J administration. The dose of LEV (500 mg to 2500 mg) or BRV (50 mg to 200 mg) will be decided based on the data obtained in Cohort 1. Subjects will return for a second PET imaging session (Visit 4), 7 to 28 days after completion of their first session (Visit 3) to enter the BRV arm.</description>

Cohort 2:Half of the subjects will receive BRV as a 5 minute iv infusion during the first PET scan, 60 minutes after the start of [11C]UCB-J administration. The dose of BRV (50-200 mg) will be decided based on the data obtained in Cohort 1. Subjects will return for a second PET imaging session,7 to 28 days after completion of their first session to enter the LEV arm.
Cohort 3:void Cohort 4:Subjects will take oral BRV (25-100 mg bid) for 4 days and a single dose of BRV on Day 5. Pre-/post-block scans will be obtained at the first dose, one post-block scan after the last dose. Additional post-block scans may be obtained 8-10 and 28h or later after last dose; if last scan not needed, subject will return 7 to 28 days later for a post-block scan. Dose range for LEV in Cohort 4 will be 250 to &lt;1500mg.</description>
