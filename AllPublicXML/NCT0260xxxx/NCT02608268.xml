  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study of MBG453 is to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of MBG453
      administered i.v. as a single agent or in combination with PDR001 in adult patients with
      advanced solid tumors

          -  Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, including
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease or any condition that requires systemic
             steroids.

          -  Systemic steroid therapy or any immunosuppressive therapy (≥10mg/day prednisone or
             equivalent).

          -  Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g. varicella, pneumococcus) within
             4 weeks of initiation of study treatment.

          -  Pre-treatment with anti-CTLA4 antibodies in combination with any other antibody or
             drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathway.

          -  Participation in an interventional, investigational non-immunotherapy study within 2
             weeks of the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Prior participation in an interventional, investigational cancer vaccine or
             immunotherapy study except for an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 study.
