      Primary Objective:

      -To assess the change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes
      patients on OAD agent in Jordan after 6 months of treatment with basal insulin (Insulin
      glargine).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the percentage of patients achieving target of HbA1c ˂7%.

        -  To evaluate the change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG).

        -  To assess the following safety criteria: hypoglycemic events, body weight changes, and
           overall safety.

        -  Describe the titration process: changes in glargine insulin dose at 3 months and 6
           months, changes in the titration doses used (if any), and time to reach control.
