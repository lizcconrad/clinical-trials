    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the patient positioning in
      the beach chair position with consequential arterial pressure changes and their influence on
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation under two anesthesia techniques, general anesthesia in
      one group of patients and interscalene block in the second group of patients.

      The participants of the study are patients scheduled for elective shoulder athroscopy. The
      patients randomise themselves by choosing the type of anesthesia technique (general
      anesthesia or interscalene block) after detailed description of both techniques. They receive
      the standard, routine medical care (monitoring and anesthesia techniques) during which the
      obtained data of arterial pressure, heart rate, peripheral and cerebral oxygen saturation
      will be statistically analysed and compared.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criterion for the study was the approval for surgery under general or regional
        anesthesia with ASA I and ASA II patients classification. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients who have refused to take part in the study, patients assessed as ASA III
             or higher, who have cerebrovascular or coronary disease, coagulopathy,
             hypersensitivity to local anesthetics or other contraindications to one or the other
