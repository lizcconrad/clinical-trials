  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized trial to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics
      of Zolpidem orodispersible tablet at two different dosages (1.75 mg and 3.50 mg). Sample size
      is 48 participants, male or female, aged above 18 years-old.

      Primary objective is to evaluate pharmacokinetics of Zolpidem orodispersible tablet at two
      different dosages (1.75 mg and 3.50 mg), and secondary objective is to evaluate safety and
      tolerability of the investigational product.

      Participants will be admitted for a period of 36 hours, when investigational product will be
      administered, and blood samples, at pre-determined time periods, will be collected for
      pharmacokinetics.

      Primary endpoint is to obtain pharmacokinetics parameters. Additionally, safety will be
      assessed by adverse events occurrence and laboratory exams evaluation.
