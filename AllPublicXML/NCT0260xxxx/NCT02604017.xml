    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 12 Weeks Post-treatment (SVR12) in Mono-infected Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 (HCV GT1), Direct-acting Antiviral Agent (DAA) Naïve Participants in the 12-Week Treatment Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than the lower limit of quantification [&lt;LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint was noninferiority of the percentage of participants who achieved SVR12 in the 12-week treatment group compared with the historical control rate for HCV GT1 subjects who are treatment-naïve or treated with pegylated-interferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b and ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV).</description>

        OR

          -  On a stable, qualifying HIV-1 ART regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to screening,
             with CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm3 (or CD4+ % ≥14%) at Screening and plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; LLOQ at
             Screening and at least once during the 12 months prior to Screening.
