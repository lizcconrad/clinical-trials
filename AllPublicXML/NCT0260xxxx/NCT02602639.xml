  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, those with spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrate increased prevalence of obesity
      (75%) cardiovascular disease (30 - 50%), type II diabetes (21%) and osteoporosis in the legs
      (100%) when compared to the general population. It is important to identify the modes and
      intensities of exercise most likely to generate a reduction in these inactivity-related
      diseases in this population.

      Therefore, the main purpose of this pilot research project is to implement and test a form of
      a spinal cord injury-specific exercise, known as FES rowing (FES: functional electrical
      stimulation).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak VO2 (volume oxygen) output during exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Peak VO2 testing will be performed before beginning rower training and again at the end of the 24 weeks of training. Testing will be performed with an arm ergometer, rowing without electrical stimulation, and rowing with electrical stimulation. This will assess energy use, time to fatigue, and perceived exertion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have their body composition (specifically leg percent fat and muscle, and bone mineral density) measured before beginning training and at the end of the 24 weeks of training.</description>

    <intervention_name>Functional electrical stimulation rowing (Odstock 4 channel neuromuscular stimulator with Concept 2 Rower)</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will strengthen their quadriceps and hamstrings using electrical stimulation for up to 12 weeks (using an Odstock 4 channel neuromuscular stimulator). Then participants will use a seated rower (Concept 2 Rower, fitted with a backrest that allows those with spinal cord injury to engage in rowing) in conjunction with the electrical stimulation for 12-24 weeks.</description>
