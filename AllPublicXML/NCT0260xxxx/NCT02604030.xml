      Our objective is to identify the possible changes of three-dimensional scapula movement
      during arm elevation in women after breast cancer surgery and subjected to a physical therapy
      intervention. Also to evaluate pain, upper limb function and quality of life. Methods: Will
      be evaluated 25 women with a clinical diagnosis of breast cancer and 25 healthy controls
      women with no history of musculoskeletal disorders of upper limbs and matched with age and
      body mass index. Two pre-surgical evaluations in the month prior to surgical treatment of
      breast cancer and two post-surgical assessments are going to be assess: the first, after 4
      weeks after surgery, when patients have received 8 sessions of physical therapy in upper
      limb; the second, after 8 weeks after surgery, when patients completed 16 sessions of
      physical therapy for shoulder complex . In each evaluation, bilateral scapular kinematics
      will be analyzed by an electromagnetic tracking device during arm elevation in scapula plane,
      in breast cancer group. Range of motion will by assessed by a digital inclinometer and muscle
      strength by a hand held dynamometer. Also, pain will be assessed by visual analog scale and
      upper limb function by DASH questionnaire. Quality of life is going to be evaluated by 36
      questionnaire -item Short Form Health Survey (SF36).

      The main disorders of upper limb related to postoperative breast cancer, as functional
      limitations and muscle weakness, have already been studied. Three-dimensional scapula
      movement can be altered after surgical treatment of this condition, but the studies are
      inconclusive on this topic. Objective: To identify the possible changes of three-dimensional
      scapula kinematics during arm elevation in women after breast cancer surgery and subjected to
      a physical therapy intervention. Also to evaluate pain, upper limb function and quality of
      life. Methods: Will be evaluated 25 women with a clinical diagnosis of breast cancer and 25
      healthy controls women with no history of musculoskeletal disorders of upper limbs and
      matched with age and body mass index. There will be two pre-surgical evaluations in the month
      prior to surgical treatment of breast cancer (with an interval of one week between then) and
      two post-surgical assessments: the first, after 4 weeks after surgery, when patients have
      received 8 sessions (twice a week) of physical therapy in upper limb (passive mobilization in
      glenohumeral joint and scapular, scar massage, lymphatic drainage, stretching exercises); the
      second, after 8 weeks after surgery, when patients completed 16 sessions (twice a week) of
      physical therapy for shoulder complex (strengthening and stretching exercises). In each
      evaluation, bilateral scapular kinematics will be analyzed by an electromagnetic tracking
      device during arm lifting movement in scapula plane, in breast cancer group. For control
      group, the assessed side will be correspondent to dominant or non-dominant operated side.
      Flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation of each arm will be assessed by a digital
      inclinometer. Muscle strength of abductors and external rotators will be evaluated by a hand
      held dynamometer. Pain will be assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) and upper limb function
      will be assessed by Disabilities of the Arm and Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire.
      Quality of life, through the Medical Outcomes Study 36 questionnaire -item Short Form Health
      Survey (SF36). Statistical analysis will include analysis of qualitative and quantitative
      variables. Statistical tests will be applied according to the normality of the data and it
      will adopt a 5% of significance level for variables comparisons along evaluations. Expected
      results and clinical implications of the study: To provide information of shoulder and
      scapular biomechanics in women after surgery for breast cancer.

             shoulder injury prior to surgery, with signs and symptoms compatible with subacromial
             pain syndrome;

          -  Previous history of surgery and fractures in upper limb;

          -  Allergy to tape transpore, necessary to display the sensors during scapular kinematics
             assessment;

          -  Body mass index (BMI ) greater que 28 kg/m², as can compromising data quality due to
             increased of subcutaneous tissue amount. This has been linked to an increase in the
             artifact in electromagnetic kinematic analysis signal.
