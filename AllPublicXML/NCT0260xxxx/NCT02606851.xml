      China Survey of Proton Pump Inhibitor Empirical Treatment in Management of Outpatients with
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the overall responder rate after 4 weeks of Proton Pump Inhibitor empirical
      treatment This will be a multicenter prospective observational study carried out in China.
      Investigator will collect data in a pre-specified Case Report Form from the outpatient.
      Informed consents will be needed. Investigator will provide patient diary card to each
      patient for them to note down the symptom frequency every day. Main data from each outpatient
      will include demographics, Gerd Q, symptom frequency and Proton Pump Inhibitor empirical
      treatment. Data from each outpatient will be collected on the screening day, 2 weeks and 4
      weeks.
