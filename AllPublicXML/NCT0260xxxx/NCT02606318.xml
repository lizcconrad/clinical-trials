      The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects on health-related QOL of occupational
      therapy involving the adjustment of challenge-skill balance in the activity of elderly
      clients.

    <textblock>
      This study was single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Clients were randomly assigned by
      blocked randomization (block size 4) to either the experimental group (occupational therapy
      that included assessment and adjustment of the challenge-skill balance of the activities) or
      to the control group (occupational therapy as normally conducted at the day care center).
      Randomization was stratified by sex and EuroQol visual analogue scale, resulting in four
      layers. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life after 10 sessions of
      occupational therapy. Clients were assessed before the intervention (pre-test) and after the
      10th session (post-test). Significant differences were observed in the EuroQol-5 Dimension
      (EQ-5D) score and in the Medical Outcome Study 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scores
      for general health, physical functioning , and vitality.

    <description>The EQ-5D defines health in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety or depression). The EQ-5D also has a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) that enables self-assessment on a scale from 0 (worst possible health) to 100 (best possible health).</description>

    <description>The SF-8 encompasses eight domains: general health, physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health, which can be combined to yield a physical component summary score and a mental component summary score.</description>

    <description>In the first session of occupational therapy, the therapist assessed the client's problems in daily living using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Based on the problems identified, an activity that could be supported in day care was selected. In the second session, the client performed the selected activity, and then the challenge and skill levels of the activity were evaluated. Based on these levels, adjustment of the challenge-skill balance in the activity was attempted. Occupational therapy consisted of 10 sessions of 20 minutes held over about 10 weeks</description>

    <description>The first and second sessions were conducted in the same way as for the experimental group, except that the therapists were not informed of the client's subjective perception of the challenge and skill levels for the activity. From the third session, the therapists simply assessed the client's performance and conducted the therapy in the normal manner for the day care center, following the general guidelines for occupational therapy practice</description>
