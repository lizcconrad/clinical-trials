  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority, Phase III, open-label, randomized, parallel trial to evaluate the
      new intervention Dapaconazole cream 2% versus Ketoconazole cream 2% in patients with Tinea
      pedis. Sample size is 140 participants (70 per treatment group), male or female, aged between
      16 and 60 years-old.

      Primary objective is to evaluate non-inferiority of Dapaconazole cream 2% compared to
      Ketoconazole cream 2% in Tinea pedis treatment. Secondary objective is to evaluate safety and
      tolerability of Dapaconazole cream 2% after multiple administrations.

      Participants will receive either new intervention or active control during 14 consecutive
      days, which will be followed by 2 follow-up visits.

      Primary efficacy endpoint is clinical and mycological lesion cure, and secondary efficacy
      endpoint is time (days) until clinical diagnosis of lesion cure. Additionally, safety will be
      assessed by adverse events occurrence and laboratory exams evaluation.

          -  Absence of previous antifungic treatment for the lesion under study;

          -  Absence of other significant diseases which, at the physician's discretion, could have
             an impact on subject's participation in the trial, according to protocol requirements,
