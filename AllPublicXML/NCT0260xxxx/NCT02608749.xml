      BACKGROUND: The deterioration of musculoskeletal system imposes significant impact on
      physical activity in older adults.

      METHODS: This was a randomized, parallel-group, prospective study. All participants received
      education program including home-based exercise. The IC group consisted of different
      modalities of exercise while the LEE group performed machine-based exercise. Body
      composition, muscle strength, and physical performance were measured at their baseline and 3
      months follow-up.

    <description>Integraded care (IC) Weekly professional led exercise program for 90 mins with reinforcemen on osteoporosis related educations and caremangements from study educational booklet and CD rom for 3-month. The exercise program included 15 minutes warm up with 10 minute brisk walks followed by gentle stretching. Resistance training (20-30 minutes) was provided with rubber band and bottled water (0.6-1L) as weight for major muscles of upper and lower limbs. Balance training were also provided for 10 minutes with tandem gaits and one leg standing, step up and down stairs, toe walking and heel walking.</description>

    <description>Lower extremity exercise (LEE) group subjects were invited to BB site to receive 2 sessions of 45-mintute training using isotonic strength training machines on major muslce groups each week. The intensity is set at 60-80% of 1 repetition maximum (RM). Evaluation of the exercise protocol are repeated every 2 weeks for individualized adjustments by trained physical therapist.</description>

    <description>Home care (HC) group subjects were invited to LK site. For examining whether the exercise video could help elderly people to maintain their exercise and improve their muscle strength or not, the investigators provided exercise video to subjects, and encouraged them to play this exercise at least 2 hours for one week.</description>
