  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a pilot study to gain insight into attitudes, barriers and
      facilitators for health behavior change in cancer patients and their partners. Results of
      this pilot will be used to design suitable questionnaires to investigate health behavior
      change in a larger cohort of patients and their partners. It will also direct future
      interventions to adequately target patients and, potentially, their partners to improve their
      lifestyle following a cancer diagnosis.
