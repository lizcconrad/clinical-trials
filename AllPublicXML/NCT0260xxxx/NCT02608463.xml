    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a common pain disorder that is caused by problems in the nervous system.
      It affects more women than men and commonly occurs in pregnancy. Physicians have little
      information to guide their treatment of neuropathic pain in pregnancy. The overall goal of
      this study is to define the course, management, and pregnancy outcomes of neuropathic pain in
      pregnancy and the acute postpartum period. It is difficult to manage neuropathic pain in
      pregnancy as treatment options must minimize their risk to the unborn child as they have a
      direct effect on infant outcomes through their exposure in utero. Thus, other treatments are
      needed. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be an acceptable alternative
      to medications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses a magnetic force to change the way
      nerves work in the brain. This non-invasive and localized mechanism of action makes it
      attractive for use in special populations, such as pregnancy. This will be the first study to
      investigate the use of rTMS in the treatment of neuropathic pain in pregnancy. This study
      will enroll 60 pregnant subjects between the ages of 18 and 45. Participation in the study
      will last about 15 months with study visits about once a month. All participants will receive
      treatment as usual. Subjects diagnosed with neuropathic pain will be offered rTMS as a
      treatment option.

    <description>Subjects will undergo daily repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), defined as Monday through Friday, for a total of 10 consecutive sessions. rTMS will be applied using the NeuroStar TMS Therapy System through a figure-8 coil connected to a magnetic stimulator, which provides a biphasic pulse. The coil is applied to the primary motor cortex, M1, contralateral to the painful side. The optimal stimulus site, motor hot spot, will be determined according to visual detection of muscle twitches, and a resting motor threshold is defined as the minimal intensity necessary to induce at least one visible muscle twitch. An rTMS session consists of 10 trains at 90% intensity of resting motor threshold (one train, 100 pulses at 10 Hz; intertrain interval, 50s).</description>
