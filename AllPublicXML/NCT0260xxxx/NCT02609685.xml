      The purpose of this study is to better understand the outcomes of active surveillance
      (observation) instead of immediate surgery, which is the current standard of care for
      papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). Patients with a 1.5 cm or smaller thyroid nodule(s)
      with papillary thyroid carcinoma will be eligible for the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of thyroid cancer has more than doubled in the last 30 years in the United
      States, Europe, Canada, and South America. Since nearly 50% of this increase is attributable
      to papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMC), it appears that greater detection and diagnosis
      of previously subclinical disease is a major factor driving this dramatic rise.

      The primary objective is to estimate the rate of disease progression (growth of primary tumor
      or development of loco-regional/distant metastases) over a 3, 5, and 10-year period in a
      series of PTMC patients followed with active surveillance in the United States.

      Patients who opt for immediate surgery can participate in a sub-study looking at quality of
      life and anxiety measures as compared to those patients who enroll in the active surveillance
      main study. Patients who enroll in active surveillance can choose to have surgery at any time
      that they and their treating physician feel that it is in their best interest.

    <description>Patients who choose to get surgery immediately after diagnosis may choose to enroll in a questionnaire sub-study that will compare quality of life and anxiety scores to patients who enroll in the active surveillance study. This is considered &quot;no intervention&quot; because the protocol is not directing treatment. Surgery is the standard treatment for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.</description>
