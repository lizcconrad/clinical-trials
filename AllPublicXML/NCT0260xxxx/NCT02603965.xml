      This pilot phase I trial studies copper Cu 64 TP3805 (Cu-64-TP3805) positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in detecting cancer in patients with prostate
      cancer undergoing surgery to remove the entire prostate and some of the tissue around it
      (radical prostatectomy). Many patients with benign lesions must undergo biopsy to test the
      lesion. Cu-64-TP3805 is a radioactive substance that attaches to cancer cells but not normal
      cells. PET/CT uses a scanner to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body
      where the radioactive substance is lighting up. Using Cu-64-TP3805 PET/CT scans and comparing
      them with cancer tissue obtained from surgery may help doctors learn whether Cu-64-TP3805
      PET/CT can accurately detect prostate lesions and determine whether they are cancerous or
      benign, which may minimize the need for prostate biopsies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 to detect prostate cancer (PC) within the prostate
      gland, as compared with whole mount step-sectioned surgical pathology of the prostate after
      radical prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copper Cu 64 TP3805 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/computed tomography
      (CT) at 30 minutes and 2 hours post-injection. Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy
      within 1 to 3 weeks after scans.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours.

    <description>The proportion of lesions detected with Cu-64 PET will be determined and compared with tumor maps derived from the whole mount step sectioned surgical pathology analysis of the radical prostatectomy specimen after surgery. 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. As a secondary analysis, a generalized estimating equations will be utilized to account for multiple lesions in an individual patient.</description>
