    <textblock>
      Exercise is effective at reducing pain while improving physical function. However we do not
      know if exercise can boost resilience in the workplace, to allow people with osteoarthritis
      to work as long as they desire. Previous research shows that exercise holds the most promise
      for helping people enjoy their work because it reduces sick time, reduces pain, and improves
      productivity. However, little work has examined the effect of exercise for people with
      arthritis in the workplace. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether exercise
      improves resilience in the workplace, mobility, fitness, strength, and pain in comparison to
      no exercise in those with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.

    <textblock>
      The Canadian workforce is aging. The most prevalent age group is 50-54 years and most of
      these Canadians will aim to continue working over the next 10 years. However, the impact of
      arthritis on aging Canadians compromises their ability to continue working. By 2031, over 2
      million Canadians aged 45 to 64 years will have arthritis. We aim to boost the ability of
      older adults with the most common arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), to engage in the workforce
      for as long as they desire. Identifying strategies to promote productivity among older
      workers with knee and hip OA will be of great public health significance in the coming
      decades. However, we face two challenges. First, obesity among sedentary workers is a risk
      for worsening knee and hip OA. Second, large occupational loads on the knee and hip worsen
      OA. Exercise has the most promise in addressing these challenges because it reduces pain and
      sick time, and improves mental health. Thus, there is a call for studies examining exercise
      for the aging worker with knee and hip OA. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact
      of an OA-specific leg strengthening exercise program, delivered within the workplace, on
      mobility, pain, physical capacity, and resilience among older workers with knee or hip OA.

    <measure>Change in Lower Extremity Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) consists of 20 items, on an adjectival scale, that assess difficulty during mobility tasks ranging from transfers to running. Each item is scored from 0 (extreme difficulty or unable to perform activity), to 4 (no difficulty to perform activity). The minimum possible score is 0, and the maximum possible score is 80. Scores closer to 80 represent better self-reported physical function. It is reliable and valid in knee OA and has superior sensitivity to change compared to similar measures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported Knee and Hip Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Change in self-reported knee and hip pain will be assessed with 3 valid and reliable questionnaires: the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) score. The KOOS and HOOS pain scores represent a normalized score from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms). KOOS and HOOS scores closer to 100 indicate fewer symptoms. The ICOAP consists of two sub-scales: constant pain (5 items) and intermittent pain (6 items). The score from each subscale represents a normalized score from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain). ICOAP scores closer to 0 indicate less pain. The items from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized ICOAP total score, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain).</description>

    <measure>Change in Arthritis-related Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) measures arthritis-specific beliefs regarding perception of performance on certain tasks to cope with the disease. The ASES is measured using 20 questions on a 10-100 scale with respect to three main areas: pain management (5 questions), physical function (9 questions), and other symptoms (6 questions). Each question is scored from 10 (very uncertain), to 100 (very certain), in 10-point increments. The minimum score for each subscale is 10, and the maximum score for each subscale is 100. The scores from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized total score. Scores closer to 100 indicate greater certainty that a participant can cope with a particular task as a consequence of their disease.</description>

        <title>Change in Lower Extremity Function</title>
        <description>The Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) consists of 20 items, on an adjectival scale, that assess difficulty during mobility tasks ranging from transfers to running. Each item is scored from 0 (extreme difficulty or unable to perform activity), to 4 (no difficulty to perform activity). The minimum possible score is 0, and the maximum possible score is 80. Scores closer to 80 represent better self-reported physical function. It is reliable and valid in knee OA and has superior sensitivity to change compared to similar measures.</description>

            <description>The participants in this arm were asked to attend 3 group classes per week for 12 weeks taught by a certified exercise instructor. Four class times were offered per week. These classes included a warm-up, static poses shown to decrease knee joint loading, and a cool down including flexibility exercises. Measurements were obtained at baseline (before intervention) and at follow-up (following intervention). Outcomes included clinical mobility; pain; isometric leg strength; cardiovascular fitness; and resilience.

        <title>Change in Self-reported Knee and Hip Pain</title>
        <description>Change in self-reported knee and hip pain will be assessed with 3 valid and reliable questionnaires: the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) score. The KOOS and HOOS pain scores represent a normalized score from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms). KOOS and HOOS scores closer to 100 indicate fewer symptoms. The ICOAP consists of two sub-scales: constant pain (5 items) and intermittent pain (6 items). The score from each subscale represents a normalized score from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain). ICOAP scores closer to 0 indicate less pain. The items from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized ICOAP total score, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain).</description>

        <title>Change in Arthritis-related Self-efficacy</title>
        <description>The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) measures arthritis-specific beliefs regarding perception of performance on certain tasks to cope with the disease. The ASES is measured using 20 questions on a 10-100 scale with respect to three main areas: pain management (5 questions), physical function (9 questions), and other symptoms (6 questions). Each question is scored from 10 (very uncertain), to 100 (very certain), in 10-point increments. The minimum score for each subscale is 10, and the maximum score for each subscale is 100. The scores from each subscale are averaged to produce a normalized total score. Scores closer to 100 indicate greater certainty that a participant can cope with a particular task as a consequence of their disease.</description>

        <description>Depression will be assessed with the Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, a 20-item scale developed for the general population with emphasis on affect. Elements of affect include mood, guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, appetite, and sleep. Each item is scored from 0 (rarely or none of the time), to 3 (most of the time). The items are summed to produce a total score between 0 and 60 with a score of 16 or higher indicating depression.</description>

            <title>Exercise</title>
            <description>The participants in this arm were asked to attend 3 group classes per week for 12 weeks taught by a certified exercise instructor. Four class times were offered per week. These classes included a warm-up, static poses shown to decrease knee joint loading, and a cool down including flexibility exercises. Measurements were obtained at baseline (before intervention) and at follow-up (following intervention). Outcomes included clinical mobility; pain; isometric leg strength; cardiovascular fitness; and resilience.
Exercise: A biomechanical exercise program shown to decrease joint loading was administered 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Outcomes included mobility performance; pain; strength; cardiovascular fitness; and resilience.</description>

            <title>No Exercise</title>
            <description>The participants in this arm were asked to refrain from changing their physical activity over the 12 weeks and maintain any strategies typically used to manage knee and/or hip pain. Since it is known that exercise is beneficial for pain management and strengthening in knee OA, participants randomized to the no exercise group were offered a free exercise pass following completion of the study. Measurements were obtained at baseline (before intervention) and at follow-up (following intervention). Outcomes included clinical mobility; pain; isometric leg strength; cardiovascular fitness; and resilience.
No Exercise: A no exercise (control) group maintained their existing activity level for 12 weeks. Outcomes included mobility performance; pain; strength; cardiovascular fitness; and resilience.</description>
