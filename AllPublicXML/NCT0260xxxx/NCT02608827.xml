  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is serious health problem in Brazil and affects almost 30%of adult population.
      It is known that there are pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies for treating
      hypertension. Aerobic exercise and slow breathing are nonpharmacologic methods that reduce
      blood pressure in an isolated form, but its combinations has never been studied. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the association of both strategies and also the mechanisms involved
      in blood pressure reduction using slow breathing, in stages 1 and 2 hypertensives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of drugs and no medication for hypertension treatment has been widely
      recommended, with emphasis on aerobic exercises (EXE), relaxation exercises, and the use of
      equipment designed to decrease the respiratory rate called Resperate®. This intervention has
      demonstrated a hypotensive effect in pressure measurements in clinical blood pressure and
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). It is
      unknown; however, if slow breathing (GRL) associated with other intervention, such as EXE,
      for example, may potentiate the blood pressure (BP) reduction. The aim of this study will be
      evaluate the acute responses of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and BP, in
      association of the slow breathing versus control (listening to calm music) and the 24 hour
      blood pressure response after the association of EXE and GRL. Twenty hypertensives will be
      evaluated between 18 to 60 years old, mens and woman, sedentary, non-obese, without target
      organs damage and associated comorbidities, after 4 weeks of placebo use (washout period).
      Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups (GRL and GC) and both perform EXE on a
      cycle ergometer. Volunteers will make a ABPM before and after the experimental session. In
      this session will be recorded for 10 minutes, prior to the physical exercise, the systolic
      blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate
      (HR), after that, It will be held microneurography to register also the MSNA for 10 minutes,
      then they will perform either GRL or listened to music for 15 minutes. Variables will be
      measures for more 10 minutes. After finishing the session, volunteers will put the ABPM and
      will go away.
