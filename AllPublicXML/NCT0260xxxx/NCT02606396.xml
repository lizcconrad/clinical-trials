  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of the few cancers with a rising incidence in the
      United States, with an estimated 17,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012. Most patients with
      esophageal cancer present with tumors which are not amenable to surgery and are treated with
      chemotherapy and radiation. The most common and bothersome symptoms from esophageal cancer is
      dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Chemotherapy and radiation are effective in shrinking
      tumors and allowing patients with EAC to swallow more easily; however it usually takes 1-2
      months for swallowing to improve with this treatment.

      Another method of shrinking esophageal tumors and allowing for better swallowing is
      endoscopic spray cryotherapy (freezing the tumor from inside the esophagus with the aid of an
      endoscope); cryotherapy is a well established method for treating cancerous and pre-cancerous
      esophageal disease. This is a particularly attractive treatment option, as patients with
      esophageal cancer usually undergo endoscopy on several occasions before starting treatment in
      order to biopsy and evaluate the tumor.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cryotherapy in treating EAC
      related dysphagia in patients who are getting ready to start chemotherapy and radiation.

      In order to do this the investigators are planning to invite patients who are already
      undergoing endoscopy for pre-chemotherapy evaluation of known EAC. Patients would undergo
      cryotherapy after the diagnostic portion of the endoscopy has been completed. After the
      cryotherapy patients will be contacted by phone in order to evaluate change in symptoms, 2
      and 4 weeks after cryotherapy.

      Endoscopic spray cryotherapy (EC) is a novel modality for destruction of tissue in the
      gastrointestinal tract. EC involves the endoscopic application of cryogen [liquid nitrogen
      (LN)], which destroys tissue by rapid freezing and slow thawing. Immediate effects from
      tissue freezing include failure of cellular metabolism, membrane damage and local ischemia.
      Delayed effects may include apoptosis of cancer cells and immune mediated tumor destruction.
      EC has been used for the treatment of mucosal EAC and palliation of malignant dysphagia since
      2007 in multiple tertiary centers, including Washington University in St Louis, with positive
      results. EC is an attractive modality for the palliation of malignant dysphagia in EAC due to
      the fact that newly diagnosed patients undergo upper endoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS) as part of initial staging; thus EC could be delivered at the time of the
      staging endoscopy, without burdening the patient with an additional procedure. However,
      prospective studies on the efficacy of EC in the short term palliation of malignant dysphagia
      in EAC have not been performed.

      Thus, the goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of EC in the short term
      palliation of malignant dysphagia in patients with unresectable EAC.
