      The purpose of this study was to determine if untrained subjects with diabetes could perform
      basic tasks with the Styx lancing device to obtain adequate blood volume from fingerstick and
      palm lancings for Blood Glucose Meter testing.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Numeric Meter Results When Users Obtain Fingerstick Capillary Blood Using the Styx Lancing Device ( 28 Gauge Lancets)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Untrained subjects with Diabetes operated the Styx Lancing Device with 28 Gauge lancets to obtain fingerstick capillary blood. Study Staff tested the capillary blood using Contour NEXT Blood Glucose Meters (BGMs) and recorded the results. Meter results could be numeric, non-numeric (ie, error messages), or not obtained at all. The number of subjects with numeric BGMS results was determined.</description>

    <description>Staff obtained responses from persons with Diabetes using short questionnaires to provide feedback on instructions for use and the basic operation of the Styx Lancing Device. Subjects could respond 'Strongly Agree' or 'Agree' or are 'Neutral' or 'Disagree' or 'Strongly Disagree'. The percent of subjects who provided responses that were 'Strongly Agree' or 'Agree' or 'Neutral' about each statement was calculated.</description>
