      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disease that affects millions of people
      worldwide and about 100,000 Americans. Sickle cell disease is a group of blood disorders that
      affect hemoglobin (Hb), the molecule that delivers oxygen throughout the body via red blood
      cells. The abnormal sickle cell Hb polymerizes under low oxygen tension and causes RBCs to
      become distorted into a rigid sickle, or crescent shape. Sickle cells have a shorter lifespan
      than normal RBCs. As a result, patients with SCD frequently develop anemia, leading to
      fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, and coldness in the hands and
      feet. In children with SCD, anemia can also cause delayed growth and development.

      Sickle red blood cells are also prone to adhesive interactions with each other, white blood
      cells, platelets, and blood vessel walls. These adhesive interactions lead to occlusion of
      the small blood vessels, blocking the flow of blood, and cause inflammation and multiple
      organ damage. Acute blockage of the blood vessels results in episodic events that are known
      as sickle cell crises, and they are accompanied by 3 serious symptoms: pain, organ damage and
      inflammation.

      Pharmacotherapy of SCD is limited to hydroxyurea, the only FDA approved drug for the
      treatment of sickle cell disease. However, considerable percentage of patients with sickle
      disease are not responsive or showing varying degree of response to hydroxyurea treatment.

      For a very long time, the investigators understanding of the underlining pathological
      processes which lead to the occlusion of the blood vessel was dominated by the simplistic
      mechanical approach. However, the emerging evidence indicates that primary events in
      vaso-occlusion are triggered by polymerization-independent events, with sickling occurring as
      secondary incident. The current consensus is that, the primary events crucial to
      vaso-occlusion are due to inflammation and increased adhesion of RBC, platelet and leukocyte
      to blood vessels lining tissue (endothelium). This new paradigm of pathophysiology of the
      disease has shifted the management strategies from prevention of Hb polymerization to
      amelioration of the inflammation and reduction of blood cell adhesion. In order to elucidate
      the changes behind the increased propensity of blood cells to adhere to each other and the
      endothelium extensive studies were conducted on red blood cell membrane. The major membrane
      abnormalities observed in red blood cell of SCD patients compromise membrane transport
      defects, dysfunctional lipid bilayer and perturbation of fatty acid composition of membrane
      phospholipids. The abnormality is characterized by high omega-6, low omega-3 and an imbalance
      between the two fatty acid families. The fatty acid imbalance in SCD is known contributory
      factor in enhanced blood cell adhesion, aggregation, blood coagulation and inflammation (Daak
      et al 2013; Daak et al 2015).

      SC411 is a drug based on omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that may help prevent sickle cell
      crises, decrease inflammation and continuous breakdown of red blood cells. The active
      ingredient DHA, is formulated using advanced Lipid Technologies™ (ALT™), and encapsulated in
      a soft gelatin capsule. In this study investigator will compare the rate of sickle cell
      crises between individuals with sickle cell anemia disease receiving SC411 capsules vs.
      placebo capsules. The results of this research will provide the evidence about the potential
      therapeutic effect of SC411 in SCD.
