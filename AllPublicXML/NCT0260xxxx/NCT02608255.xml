      A Single-center prospective pilot study enrolling chest pain patients. CD 26 measurement will
      be performed and compared to troponin Âµs for early triage of these patients. This novel
      biomarker of myocardial ischemia (CD26) will be measured at the time of first medical contact
      (T0) and after 30 min simultaneously o troponin Ic.

      All patients aged over 18 years with chest pain which may be related to acute coronary
      syndrome requiring pre hospital medical contact through the Emergency Medical Service.
