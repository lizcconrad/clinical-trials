  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that LEO 80185 gel takes effect in the upper layer of the skin, it is important to
      compare and examine the amount of the drug in the upper layer of the skin with that of
      Dovobet® Ointment. Therefore, a dermatopharmacokinetic study will be conducted in healty
      adult male volunteers to evaluate pharmacokinetics of LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet® Ointment in
      the stratum corneum. In this trial, a single application of LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet®
      ointment will be applied to multiple test sites on the back of healthy Japanese male adults
      and the trial is designed to compare the amount of each of the active ingredients at steady
      state or close-to-steady state between LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet® Ointment. The amount of
      calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate in the stratum corneum will be assessed by use of
      tape stripping.

      The study consists of two phases:

      The pilot: The first part, known as the pilot study, will include 8 subjects and will
      evaluate pharmacokinetic profile of LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet® Ointment by measuring the
      amount of each of the active ingredients in the stratum corneum.

      Pivotal: The second part, known as the pivotal study, is designed to compare the amount of
      each of the active ingredients at steady state or close-to-steady state between LEO 80185 gel
      and Dovobet® Ointment. The number of subjects in the pivotal study and the number of
      application sites for study medications will be based on the results of the pilot study.

      The number of subjects included in the trial and design of trial is in line with previous
      type of DPK trials in Japan and the Japanese guideline
