      Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (PET-FDG) is emerging as a
      promising approach for detecting brain lesions in dementia, among which Alzheimer's disease
      has been the most widely studied.

    <textblock>
      Alteration of neuro-cognitive function induced by chemotherapy has been extensively
      documented in breast carcinoma patients. These modifications consist in the decrease of
      memory, intellectual capacity, speed analysis, and represent a real limitation for patients,
      sometimes durable. Aggressive lymphomas (diffuse large B cell lymphomas/DLBCL) represent a
      common disease, the standard being
      Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide-Doxorubicine-Vincristine-Prednisone (RCHOP) regiment which
      contains, as for breast cancer patients, anthracyclines. However, very little is known about
      the incidence and severity of cognitive function alteration in these patients. The occurrence
      of such complications should also be facilitated because of frail cognitive states due to age
      and co-morbidity. Cognitive function alteration is usually measured by neuropsychological
      tests (NPT) which are easy to handle and sensitive, but could lack specificity, in the
      context of general degradation which is often observed in hematological patients.

      Positron emission tomography with 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (PET-FDG) is emerging as a
      promising approach for detecting brain lesions in dementia, among which Alzheimer's disease
      has been the most widely studied. In our center, the investigators have already described
      glucidic hypometabolism in several brain territories associated with Alzheimer's disease and
      other dementia. Moreover, uptake quantification and topography are useful markers for
      determining the type of the disease and progression. PET-FDG received very little attention
      for the detection of chemotherapy-induced brain damages.

    <description>PET-FDG brain imaging and NPT should be performed at T0 (within the 15 days before chemotherapy), at Tf (within 1 month after chemotherapy termination), T+12 (Tf+12 months: within the first month after one year of achievement of chemotherapy). Several PET parameters should be calculated: minimal Standard Uptake Value (SUV), maximum SUV, and mean SUV for each of 20 cortical and sub-cortical territories.
NPT scores (3 values) should be correlated with the five better values on PET-FDG.
Each patient will be monitored along a time period of 18 months.
Duration of the study: one year to include the 15 patients with all the exams; 18 months follow-up for each; total of 30 months.</description>
