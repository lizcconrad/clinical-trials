  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain in adolescents and young adults (AYA, aged 15-25) is a common problem. Pain that
      is not treated properly can reduce quality of life. Programs to help AYA learn to live with
      and manage pain are very important. Our team is developing a smartphone application (app) and
      website for AYA with chronic pain. The app will help AYA to track pain, sleep, mood,
      activities, and exercise and help AYA set and achieve goals. The website will give
      information about pain and how to manage it independently. We will build the program and make
      sure it is easy to use and understand. We will also test if the program can be put into
      practice as planned and if AYA using the program feel less pain, have less limitations, and a
      better quality of life.
