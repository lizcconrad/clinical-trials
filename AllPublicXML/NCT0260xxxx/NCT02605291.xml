  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of dietary macronutrient manipulation on glycogen
      (stored carbohydrate) levels in the muscle and substrate oxidation during exercise. The
      investigators will investigate the hypothesis that manipulating the macronutrient content of
      the diet will alter the levels of glycogen in the muscle and, in turn, substrate oxidation
      during exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One way to help reduce body fat is to expend more energy from the oxidation of fat as a fuel.
      Exercise is one way to increase fat oxidation. The extent to which exercise facilitates the
      use of fat as a fuel may be influenced by an individual's dietary intake.

      This study aims to establish the effect of dietary macronutrient manipulation on muscle
      glycogen levels and substrate oxidation during exercise. Participants will undertake three
      separate trial periods. During each trial period participants will consume a diet containing
      different macronutrient compositions. For each of the trials the investigators will assess
      how the macronutrient composition of the diet affects muscle glycogen level and substrate
      oxidation during exercise.
