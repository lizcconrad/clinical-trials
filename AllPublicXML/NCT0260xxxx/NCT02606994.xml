    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Oral Defense Toothpaste causes accelerated
      healing of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study showed that patients with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis experienced
      accelerated healing of their oral mucositis by brushing with Oral Defense Toothpaste.

      In this study, participants experiencing up to grade 2 chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis
      will be split into two arms. The first arm (test arm) will receive Oral Defense Toothpaste
      and be required to brush three times per day, for 8 days. The second arm (control arm) will
      receive Crest Toothpaste and be required to brush three times per day, for 8 days. Patients
      in the control arm will be provided Magic Mouth Rinse, if needed. Healing of oral mucositis
      lesions will be evaluated at days 1 and 8. Quality of life assessment (determination of
      pain/loss of oral function) will be determined using a daily questionnaire.

    <description>The primary measure is the healing of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis lesions which are evaluated at days 1 and 8 of the study. The clinical investigators will identify patients who qualify for the study and this will mark day 1 of the study. At days 1 and 8 of the study, the clinical investigators will evaluate the oral cavity of each study participant and document changes in the oral mucositis of the participants.</description>

    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will fill out a quality of life questionnaire every day of the study. An evaluated outcome is when their chemotherapy induced oral mucositis lesions have resolved and their quality of life has returned to pre-chemotherapy levels.</description>
