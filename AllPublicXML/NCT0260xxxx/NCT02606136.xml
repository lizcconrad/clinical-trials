  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm trial of pamrevlumab (FG-3019) to estimate
      pamrevlumab's safety and efficacy in non-ambulatory subjects with DMD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will receive pamrevlumab (35 mg/kg) every two weeks by intravenous infusion for
      up to 156 weeks. After at least 10 to 12 subjects complete one year of treatment interim
      analysis may increase total subjects enrolled to approximately 32. All subjects will be
      closely monitored for safety. Efficacy assessments will be performed routinely over the
      course of the study.
