  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy, safety and effect on hemoglobin levels, of once weekly
      subcutaneous injections of epoetin beta (30,000 IU) in anemic participants with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma. The anticipated study duration is
      4 months, and the target sample size is 30 individuals.
