    <description>Cohort A: For patients that have indication for systemic therapy with standard chemotherapy. This cohort has a phase II design; the Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be evaluated according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1) after 2 and 3 cycles of PIPAC with Cisplatin (7.5 mg/m²) + Doxorubicin (1.5 mg/m2 ) or Oxaliplatin (92 mg/m2) according to the primary cancer, in association with standard systemic chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>Cohort B: For patients that have not indication for systemic therapy with standard chemotherapy. This cohort has a phase I design; with a dose-escalation design the maximum tolerated doses and recommended doses of Cisplatin + Doxorubicin and Oxaliplatin (according to the pathology) administered through PIPAC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>An open access with a midline 5-6 cm incision is performed and a single-port platform is positioned. A 12 mm Hg CO2 pneumoperitoneum is inflated. PC extent is evaluated according to Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) and peritoneal biopsies are taken. A nebulizer is connected to an intravenous high-pressure injector and inserted into the peritoneal cavity; the tightness of the abdomen has to be documented with a CO2 zero-flow. The laparoscopic camera and the nebulizer are maintained in position by a self-retaining retractor (Thompson). A pressurized aerosol containing drugs is delivered. Standard dosage of drugs for each PIPAC: Cisplatin (7.5 mg/m²) + Doxorubicin (1.5 mg/m²) or Oxaliplatin (92 mg/m²) The capnoperitoneum is then maintained for 30 minutes at 37°C. At the end, the aerosol is exsufflated through two sequential micro-particle filters into the air-waste system of the hospital.</description>
