      Does the novel drug decrease liver fat in subjects with NASH or NAFLD as compared to placebo

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to combine voxel matched magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic
      resonance elastography (MRE) liver (pre vs. post) to evaluate hepatic fat and hepatic
      fibrosis. We will also establish glucose tolerance status by our established labeled oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (6,6 ²H2 glucose). Following baseline evaluation subjects with
      biopsy/MRE proven NASH will be randomized to one of two groups and treated either with active
      drug (AZ compound) or placebo for 12 weeks (plus or minus 1 week). Subjects with history
      suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or NASH will be invited to
      participate. If they meet criteria following initial screening they will be included in the
      study. OGTT, liver MRS, MRE will be repeated. Liver enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase
      (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] as well as other safety
      tests [creatine phosphokinase (CPK), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), international
      normalized ratio (INR),total bilirubin] will be measured before, monthly during therapy and
      at one month following therapy.
