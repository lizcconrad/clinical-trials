      Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with lung cancer, and circulating tumor
      cells(CTCs) play a key role in the process of distant metastasis. The investigators' study
      will elaborate the clinical significance of CTCs intervented by Traditional Chinese
      Medicine(TCM) in lung cancer from the diagnosis and clinical staging,metastasis and
      recurrence, individual treatment and prognosis and so on, in order to provide a new direction
      for the treatment of lung cancer.

      Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with lung cancer, and circulating tumor
      cells play a key role in the process of distant metastasis.In recent years, research results
      have shown that CTCs may become a emerging marker and new target in the treatment of lung
      cancer. The investigators' study will elaborate the clinical significance of CTCs intervented
      by TCM in lung cancer from the diagnosis and clinical staging,metastasis and recurrence,
      individual treatment and prognosis and so on, in order to provide a new direction for the
      treatment of lung cancer.
