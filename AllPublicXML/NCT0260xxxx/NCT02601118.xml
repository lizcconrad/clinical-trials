      This study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of the Micro Expression Training
      Tool (METT) and the Subtle Expression Training Tool (SETT) to help improve the non-verbal
      communication skills of medical students.

    <textblock>
      Teaching and assessing communication skills is an important component of medical school
      curricula, and it is not easy for medical students to develop non-verbal communication skills
      without adequate training. This study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of the
      Micro Expression Training Tool (METT) and the Subtle Expression Training Tool (SETT) to help
      improve the non-verbal communication skills of medical students.
