  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study has the evaluation of a test to measure the localization performance goal .
      It is about the perception of danger audio signals in everyday listening environments nearby
      which are reproduced in controlled laboratory conditions. In addition, a dereverberation
      algorithm regarding speech intelligibility and localization ability is evaluated . The
      research hypothesis is that the dereverberation of the audio signals can improve speech
      intelligibility for both normal hearing and hearing-impaired persons. In addition, the
      binaural dereverberation algorithm should not affect the localization ability in everyday
      situations.
