  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cholangitis with obstructive jaundice is a condition which needs biliary drainage and
      appropriate antibiotics. Bile culture is an optional laboratory test according to 2013 Tokyo
      guideline, but the clinical significance is yet unproven. And its results might indicate less
      information of the true pathogen regarding normal flora. Previous study conducted at our
      institute found drug-resistant pathogens identified in bile culture had no impact on the
      outcome. So the investigators are conducting a multicenter randomized controlled trial
      comparing groups which considers both blood and bile culture as control and which considers
      only blood culture as trial group in order to prove bile culture provides no additional
      helpful clinical information.

      This study includes patients who are diagnosed acute cholangitis and had percutaneous
      transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) as the modality of biliary drainage. All patients will
      start empirical antibiotics as soon as they are diagnosed acute cholangitis. Randomization
      will be done after the blood sample and bile sample for culture are obtained. The patients
      will be allocated to one of the control or trial group. Patients in control group considers
      both blood and bile culture for the choice of antibiotics, and patients in trial group
      considers only blood culture for the choice of antibiotics. Organ failure and mortality rate
      are the primary outcomes. Data will be analyzed as intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol
      (PP). The rate of organ failure and mortality will be analyzed by Pearson chi-square &amp; Fisher
      exact test.
