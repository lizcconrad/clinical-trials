  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG)-acupuncture has been shown to exhibit distinct effects in
      treatment of nasal inflammatory disease, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown.
      Investigators aimed to assess the effects of SPG acupuncture for nasal ventilation function
      and autonomic nervous system in health volunteers. The randomized, double-blind, controlled
      clinical trial enrolled healthy volunteers.Healthy subjects were randomly assigned to either
      active SPG-acupuncture group or sham-acupuncture group. All subjects were assessed for
      self-reported nasal ventilation, nasal patency (nasal airway resistance (NAR) and nasal
      cavity volume (NVC)), exhaled nasal nitric oxide (nNO) before and after acupuncture.
      Meanwhile, in order to explore underlying mechanisms of SPG acupuncture, the changes in
      neuropeptides (substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y
      (NPY)) in nasal secretions were investigated at baseline, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours
      after acupuncture.

    <measure>The change of subjective perception nasal ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after acupuncture</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective perception of nasal ventilation was self-assessed by participants according to three categories: unchanged, better, and worse. Number of participants reported unchanged or better was analysed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of exhaled nasal nitric oxide assessed by nitric oxide analyser</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after acupuncture</time_frame>
    <description>A nitric oxide analyser was used to measure exhaled nasal nitric oxide (nNO). Briefly, NO-free air was aspirated through the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 50 ml/s. The subject exhaled against the air-resistance, resulting in an intraoral pressure to close the velum and prevent mixture of oral and nasal gas. Nasal gas from this circuit was continuously routed in part directly into the analyser for determination of nNO, and the level of nNO(ppb) was calculated from a plateau lasting for at least 3s.</description>

    <measure>The change of nasal patency assessed by acoustic rhinometry</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after acupuncture</time_frame>
    <description>Acoustic rhinometry was performed to measure the total nasal cavity volume (cm³).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of substance P in nasal secretions were analysed by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after acupuncture</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal secretions were obtained by inserting a postoperative sinus pack in the nasal cavity (acupuncture side) for five minutes. The quantity of secretions was determined by comparing the weight of the sponges before and after insertion and 2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution was added to each sponge. The sponges were stored at 4°C for two hours and the nasal secretions were recovered from the sponges by centrifugation at 1500 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were separated and stored in aliquots at -20°C until further analysis. The levels of substance P(pg/ml) were analysed.</description>

    <description>Rhinomanometer was used to measure unilateral nasal airway resistance (Pa·cm⁻³·s⁻1) and the total nasal airway resistance.</description>
