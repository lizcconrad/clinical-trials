  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gilles da la Tourette syndrome (TS)* is a common chronic neuropsychiatric disorder
      characterized by motor and vocal tics. In most adult patients, quality of life is
      significantly impaired. TS, therefore, is a cost-intensive disease (in Germany: mean total
      costs=€3404/year). Despite significant adverse effects, dopamine receptor antagonists were
      recommended as first choice treatment for many years. Although efficacy could be demonstrated
      only recently, today, behavioral therapy with face-to-face Comprehensive Behavioral
      Intervention for Tics (CBIT) (including psychoeducation, habit reversal training,
      function-based assessment and intervention, and relaxation training) is recommended as first
      line treatment for tics. In Germany, however, dissemination of CBIT is restricted due to a
      considerable lack of well-trained therapists. The aim of this study is to overcome this
      deficiency by creating a new and sophisticated internet-delivered CBIT (iCBIT) program. In
      addition, internet-delivered CBIT will shorten waiting time, will reach additional groups of
      patients and will be - once developed and established - highly cost-effective (about € 100
      vs. € 1450 for face-to-face CBIT). Investigators want to perform a multicenter, randomized,
      controlled, observer-blind trial including 160 adult patients in order to demonstrate that 8
      sessions (10 weeks) of iCBIT are superior to internet-delivered psychoeducation/relaxation in
      adult patients with TS. Both immediate (1 week after end of treatment) and long-term effects
      (after 3 and 6 months) will be evaluated.
