  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, investigators test the hypothesis that a controlled mechanical pressure
      applied on specific sites of both fore-feet (ES) can reduce the inflammatory state and
      arterial blood pressure in patients with Parkinson's Disease by increasing the overall
      parasympathetic activity and reducing vascular sympathetic modulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroinflammation may contribute to the cascade of events leading to neuronal loss in
      Parkinson's disease (PD) thus facilitating motor and autonomic impairment. A link between
      autonomic function and chronic and acute inflammation has been previously described.
      Specifically, active inflammatory state was associated with an overall increased sympathetic
      tone, whereas the parasympathetic cholinergic activation seemed to promote a decrease of
      inflammatory compounds in inflamed tissues. In addition, a functional link between peripheral
      sensory afferents and autonomic control has been reported. In a recent study it was observed
      that in PD patients a somatosensory activation by mechanical stimulation of specific sites of
      the fore-foot (effective stimulus, ES), improved gait, increased cardiac vagal modulation and
      decreased vascular sympathetic activity at rest. This latter effect was associated with a
      decline in arterial blood pressure values.

      The present study is aimed at:

        -  Addressing the magnitude of the inflammatory state in PD patients.

        -  Testing the hypothesis that a change in the autonomic profile of PD patients induced by
           ES, consistent with cardiovascular increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic
           activities, may promote an overall reduction of the PD inflammatory state.

    <description>Intervention: Foot Mechanical Stimulation (FMS) will be performed on enrolled patients every 72 hours (total 5 stimulation sessions) by a pressure-controlled mechanical stimulator (Gondola®, European Community (CE) marking n° 0476) .
The sites of the stimulation will be the tip of the hallux and the lower big toe first metatarsal joint plantar surface. The FMS procedure consists in the application of the patient's calibrated pressure for 6 seconds, over the selected sites. Each of the 2 cutaneous sites of both feet will be mechanically stimulated. The procedure will be automatically repeated for 4 times in every subject so that the overall time of stimulation will be approximately 2 minutes.</description>
