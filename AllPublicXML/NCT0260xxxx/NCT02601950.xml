  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, single arm, 2-stage study of tazemetostat 800 mg
      BID administered orally in continuous 28 day cycles. Screening of subjects to determine
      eligibility for the study will be performed within 21 days of the first planned dose of
      tazemetostat. Eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of fivecohorts based on tumor type:

        -  Cohort 1 (Closed for enrollment): MRT, RTK, ATRT, or selected tumors with rhabdoid
           features, including small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type [SCCOHT], also
           known as malignant rhaboid tumor of the ovary [MRTO]

        -  Cohort 2 (Closed for enrollment): Relapsed or refractory synovial sarcoma with SS18-SSX
           rearrangement

        -  Cohort 3 (Closed for enrollment): Other INI1 negative tumors or any solid tumor with an
           EZH2 gain of function (GOF) mutation, including: epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve
           sheath tumor (EMPNST), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC), myoepithelial
           carcinoma, other INI1-negative malignant tumors with Sponsor approval (e.g.,
           dedifferentiated chordoma) any solid tumor with an EZH2 GOF mutation including but not
           limited to Ewing's sarcoma and melanoma

        -  Cohort 4 (Closed for enrollment): Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC)

        -  Cohort 5 (Closed for enrollment): Epithelioid sarcoma (ES)

        -  Cohort 6 (Opened for enrollment): Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) undergoing mandatory tumor
           biopsy

        -  Cohort 7 (Opened for enrollment): Poorly differentiated chordoma (or other chordoma with
           Sponsor approval)

      Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study. Response assessment will be evaluated
      after 8 weeks of treatment and then every 8 weeks thereafter while on study.
