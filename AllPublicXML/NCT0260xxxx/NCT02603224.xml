  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      investigational drug, MRG-201, in healthy volunteers. MRG-201 is designed to mimic the
      activity of a molecule called miR-29 that decreases the expression of collagen and other
      proteins that are involved in scar formation. MRG-201 is being studied to determine if it can
      limit the formation of fibrous scar tissue in certain diseases.

      MRG-201 will be tested in healthy volunteers by injection into intact skin or adjacent to a
      short skin incision. Volunteers may receive one or several doses of MRG-201, and will be
      monitored for local reactions in the skin, signs or symptoms of adverse effects on the body,
      and for the levels of MRG-201 in the blood over time. Skin biopsies will also be collected to
      study how cells in the skin respond when exposed to MRG-201.

      Study Design:

      Cohorts of 3-6 healthy male volunteers, ages 18-45, will receive single or multiple ascending
      doses of MRG-201 by intradermal injection at one site and placebo at a second site over a
      period of up to 15 days, with follow-up for up to 28 days after the last dose to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose in intact or incised normal skin and the tendency for active drug
      to diffuse through the skin.
