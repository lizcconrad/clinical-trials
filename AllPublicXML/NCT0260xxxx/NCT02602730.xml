    <textblock>
      This project developed and evaluated an Internet-based interactive program with digital
      coaching designed to assist two groups of smokers in quitting smoking: (1) pregnant smokers
      and (2) general-population smokers (i.e., men and non-pregnant women). Program content was
      based on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Clinical Practice Guidelines,
      &quot;Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update&quot; (Fiore et al., 2008) and input from
      project consultants.

      The &quot;Break the Chain&quot; program is an online smoking cessation intervention that incorporated
      strategic message construction based on behavior change constructs, interactive exercises,
      and digitial coaching support to engage the user in their smoking behavior change. The
      Expanded Theory of Reasoned Action (ETRA) (Fishbein, 1999, 2000) provides the theoretical
      foundation for the content. Intervention components include: (1) interactive check-ins, (2)
      content modules and interactive smoking cessation tools, (3) digital coaching, and (4) online
      social media (i.e., article feed).

      Content modules included: Benefits of quitting, Making a plan for quitting, Boosting your
      support system, Planning for cravings and tempting situations, Managing stress and mood,
      Managing your weight, and Becoming an ex-smoker. Tailored information within each module was
      presented to the user based on responses to initial assessment questions and interactive
      check-ins (e.g., readiness to quit, pregnancy status, previous quit attempts, self-efficacy
      for quitting, worry about weight gain). Interactive tools presented within the logical flow
      of the modules included a Reasons for Quitting questionnaire, Pros and Cons of Quitting tool
      (decisional balance), Nicotine Dependence quiz, a Pharmacological Aid Decision tool, and a
      Quit Meter. Content was entirely text-based.

      Within-program coach-generated and program-generated messages provided cessation tips and
      information. Digital coaching contacts were timed and tailored to the user's smoking status,
      health history, pregnancy status (if appropriate), and timing of quit day. The coaching
      messages prompted the user to engage more fully with the website by presenting hyperlinks to
      pertinent smoking cessation information or strategies in the program. A computer algorithm
      controlled the timing of the messages to each user. Users were invited to contact their coach
      via in-program message at any time with questions or concerns about smoking cessation
      strategies. A coaching interface allowed a health coach to view user information as the user
      progressed through the program and developed his/her quit plan. The coaching interface was
      also the platform through which the coach managed communication with each user.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in number of cigarettes smoked in the last 7 days</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking cessation as measured by number of cigarettes smoked in the last 7 days. We will use an intent-to-treat statistical analysis, a conservative approach that classifies all non-responders as smokers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in knowledge of impact of smoking cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnant smokers only: Eight knowledge items assess post-natal impact (e.g., Smoking during pregnancy increases chances of having a child who develops asthma); seven items assess infant impact (e.g., Exposing an infant to smoke in the home increases the chances the baby will wake up at night more than usual); eight items assessed infant health risk (e.g., Babies exposed to secondhand smoke have increased chances of having learning disabilities). Response options were a &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; format scored to reflect the proportion of items answered correct in each domain. The seriousness of infant health issues related to smoking was assessed with five items (e.g., A baby born with lower than normal weight - low birth weight baby) with a five-point response option (1=not at all serious, 5=extremely serious). A mean score was computed and it showed good reliability (alpha = .82).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in self-efficacy to quit smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Six self-efficacy items (e.g., How confident are you that you could quit and stay quit) were assessed of all smokers. Each item had a five-point response option (1=not at all confident, 5=extremely confident) and showed good reliability (alpha=.86).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in attitudes about smoking cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Five attitude items (e.g., Knowing the right way to ask for help from family and friends when I'm quitting is important) were assessed of all smokers. Each item had a five-point response option (1=not at all important, 5=extremely important) and showed adequate reliability (alpha=.77).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in behavioral intentions about smoking cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Five intention items (e.g., How likely is it that you will avoid every situation where you will be tempted to smoke) were assessed of all smokers. Each item had a five-point response option (1=not at all likely, 5=extremely likely) and showed adequate reliability (alpha = .79).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week posttest</time_frame>
    <description>Seven program satisfaction items were assessed of as rated by the treatment participants at the T2 assessment. Treatment participants were also asked how likely they would be to recommend the program to a friend and/or family member.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User rating of system usability</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week posttest</time_frame>
    <description>All treatment participants were asked how much they agreed or disagreed with program usability statements (see Table 3) with response options on a 5- point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree or agree, 4 = agree 5 = strongly agree). The SUS is a tool designed for assessing the usability of a product and has been normed across numerous platforms (e.g., Web sites, cell phones, TV applications). Scores range from 0 to 100.
