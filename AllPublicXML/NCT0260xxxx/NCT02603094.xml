  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fasting (according to ASA, ESA or institutional guidelines) is an important strategy to
      minimize the risk of regurgitation, vomiting and pulmonary aspiration during general
      anaesthesia; the effect of fasting time for clear fluid on gastric pH in children is goal of
      this study and can be investigated in children undergoing elective procedures in general
      anaesthesia and intubation without inconvenience or additional invasive procedure and hence
      without additional risk

      Hypotheses: Gastric pH is higher in children that drink clear fluids until premedication
      before anaesthesia induction than in those that drink until 2 hours before anaesthesia
      induction
