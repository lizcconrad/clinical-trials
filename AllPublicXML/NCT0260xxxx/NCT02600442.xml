  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A correlation between early changes in the tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax)
      on FDG-PET after one or two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and the pathological
      response after 6 to 8 cycles has been demonstrated in several independent small series of
      patients.

      Breast tumor proliferation status has previously been demonstrated to be a good predictive
      factor of response to chemotherapy. The best method for assessing proliferation status is
      unclear. Proportion of cells staining for nuclear Ki67 antigen is the most widely used assay
      for comparing the proliferation status between tumors. However major variations in analytical
      procedure and interpretation limited its clinical value. Taking into account the prognosis
      and predictive value of proliferation gene as a common &quot;signature&quot; in breast cancer
      transcriptome analysis, quantitative assessment of mRNA expression of genes involved in
      proliferation has been developed by the investigators team and others. The evaluation of
      these parameters is quantitative and reliable and can be standardized for a clinical use.

      The main objective of the investigators study is to early predict pathological response to
      anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using a combination of parameters based on
      FDG-PET imaging performed at baseline and after 2 cycles, and molecular markers of
      proliferation measured on pre-treatment biopsy (Ki67 protein level by immunohistochemistry
      and Ki67 mRNA level and the mRNA (messenger RNA) expression of the most pertinent genes of
      the Genomic Grade Index (GGI) component by RT (reverse transcriptase) - qPCR).
