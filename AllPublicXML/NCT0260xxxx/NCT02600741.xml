  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall effect of caregivers receiving a
      study-provided caregiver psycho-education and skills training program on the number of
      treatment failures (psychiatric hospitalization, psychiatric emergency room (ER) visit,
      crisis center visit, mobile crisis unit intervention, arrest/incarceration, and suicide or
      suicide attempt) in patients under their care during a 12 month period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group study of patients with schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and their caregivers. Study will
      consist of a paired patient and caregiver. Patients will receive routine treatment, which may
      include oral antipsychotics or paliperidone palmitate, as directed by their treating
      physician. Caregivers for patients whose routine treatment is paliperidone palmitate will be
      randomized to receive either a study-provided caregiver psycho-education and skills training
      or usual caregiver support. Caregivers for patients whose routine treatment is oral
      antipsychotics will be randomized to the same Study Groups: Study Group 1: Study-provided
      caregiver psycho-education and skills training. Study Group 2: Usual caregiver support
      (caregiver support that is customarily provided by the study site, if any).
      Patients-caregiver pairs will be followed for up to 12 months following baseline assessment.
      Cumulative number of treatment failures over 12 months will be assessed primarily.

    <measure>Number of Treatment Failures Over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure is defined as any of the following:
Psychiatric hospitalization
Psychiatric emergency room (ER) visit
Crisis center visit
Mobile crisis unit intervention
Arrest/Incarceration
Suicide or suicide attempt.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden Based on Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) Total Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IEQ is designed to measure levels of caregiver consequences among family members and friends of patients with schizophrenia. The 31 items included in this scale are answered on a 5 point Likert response scale and address consequences among 4 dimensions (tension, supervision, worrying, and urging).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is used to rate the severity of a patient's overall clinical condition on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).</description>

    <description>The 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) is a self-administered, generic, 12-item questionnaire designed to cover the same 8 domains of functional health status and well-being included in the longer 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF 36): physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health.</description>
