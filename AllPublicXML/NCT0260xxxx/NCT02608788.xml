    <textblock>
      The purpose of intubation for patients under general anesthesia is to maintain their
      respiratory function. However, this procedure does cause a postoperative sore throat. Comfort
      of patients could be promoted if effective treatment could be found.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. Comparing the Efficacies Between the Spray of S.L. Spray Solution and Difflam to Release
           Postoperative Sore Throat.

        2. Acular spray for the prevention of postoperative sore throat.

        3. Comparing the Efficacies Between the Spray of S.L. Spray Solution and Difflam and Acular
           to Release Postoperative Sore Throat.

      This is a quasi-experimental study with purposive sampling. Patients were distributed into
      the four groups (1.5mg / ml Benzydamine hydrochloride, 3.0mg / ml Benzydamine hydrochloride,
      5％Ketorolac Tromethamine) by the operative room. Research tools including pain scale (Numeric
      Rating Scale: 0-10), drugs and case data record sheet. Collected information was managed by
      SPSS for Windows (version 21.0) statistical software package. Both the descriptive and
      Inferential statistics were performed. Sample homogeneity among the four groups were verified
      by F-test and chi-square test. generalized estimating equation was selected to compare the
      throat pain in the four points of assessment.
