      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of treatment with pregabalin in
      patients with idiopathic small fiber neuropathy proven by skin biopsy.This is an enriched
      enrollment randomized withdrawal study that comprises 4 phases: a screening and selection
      phase, a washout period from previous pain medication for enriched enrollment, an 8 week
      single blind pregabalin treatment phase; and a 4 week randomized withdrawal phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who show any increase in their pain intensity score during the washout phase will be
      eligible for the single blind pregabalin treatment phase. Patients who respond to pregabalin,
      with at least 1 point improvement in neuropathic pain from baseline at the end of the single
      blind pregabalin treatment phase and meeting all other study requirements are considered
      eligible for participation in the withdrawal phase. These eligible patients are randomly
      assigned (1:1) to continue pregabalin or to be switched to placebo for a comparison of
      pregabalin efficacy and safety. Patients who have a worsening of average pain relative to the
      last week of the single blind pregabalin treatment period by more than one point and average
      pain level &gt; =4 will be considered to have a loss of therapeutic response (LTR).
