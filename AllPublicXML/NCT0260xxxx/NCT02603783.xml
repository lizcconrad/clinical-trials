  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reflux is common, especially after large meals. In general, this can do no harm. However, if
      reflux occurs often and causes troublesome symptoms and or complications, it is called
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Long exposure to gastric acid causes the mucosa of
      the esophagus to loose its integrity, which is thought to lead to the symptom of heartburn.
      Several food products can also impair the esophageal mucosa integrity and thereby influence
      reflux symptoms. One of these products is capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of red peppers.
      Use of capsaicin often leads to worsening of complaints in patients with GERD and can cause
      symptoms in healthy volunteers, possibly due to its effect on the mucosal integrity.

      In this study the investigators want to investigate the effect of capsaicin infusion on
      mucosal integrity. The investigators will evaluate mucosal impedance and the histology of the
      esophageal mucosa. In addition, the investigators also aim to assess the involvement of the
      TRPV1 receptor by evaluating the possible release of neuropeptides in the esophageal mucosa.
