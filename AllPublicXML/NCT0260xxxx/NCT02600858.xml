  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study determines whether standard medical care (dopamine) affects learning and retention
      of an upper limb feeding task in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and whether training on
      the feeding task generalises to performance on an untrained upper limb buttoning task. Half
      the participants will train on the feeding task after they have taken their first dose of
      dopamine for the day (i.e. &quot;on&quot; medication state), while the other half will train on the
      same feeding task before taking their first daily dose of dopamine (i.e. &quot;off&quot; medication
      state).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) is an age related neurodegenerative disorder with symptomatic declines
      in motor function due to a loss of dopaminergic neurons within the basal ganglia.

      Ironically, treatment with exogenous dopamine-replacement medication (e.g. levodopa) may have
      positive effects on existing motor skills such as handwriting or walking, but may have
      detrimental effects on the learning of motor skills necessary for effective rehabilitation.

      Although dopamine medications are routinely prescribed to replace lost dopamine in the
      sensorimotor areas of the striatum, they may actually be &quot;overdosing&quot; the associative
      striatum, a candidate neuroanatomical correlate for motor learning. To date, however, this
      'overdose' hypothesis has not been widely tested, given that few studies of motor learning in
      PD have reported or controlled for whether individuals were tested &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; their
      dopamine replacement medication.

    <description>Participants will spoon two raw kidney beans at a time from a center proximal &quot;start&quot; cup to three distal &quot;target&quot; cups positioned 16 cm away at 45°, 90° and 135° around the start cup as fast as possible using their non-dominant hand. Spooning two beans between the start cup and a target cup is considered one repetition; each trial will consist of 15 repetitions. Participants will perform 50 trials per day for 3 consecutive days.</description>
