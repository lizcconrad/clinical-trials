      Rapid onset Obesity, Hypoventilation, Hypothalamic dysfunction and Autonomic Dysregulation
      (ROHHAD) is a syndrome named in 2007. The hallmark of the syndrome is the rapid onset obesity
      and dysregulation of central ventilation. There is little information about the metabolic
      changes that lead to the rapid onset obesity in these children. The investigators would like
      to study the metabolic phenotype of these children to understand the disturbances in energy
      balance that lead to the rapid onset obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late-onset hypoventilation syndrome with hypothalamic dysfunction was first described in 1965
      and renamed to ROHHAD syndrome in 2007 by Ize-Ludlow et al.

      The hallmark of ROHHAD syndrome is rapid-onset obesity starting at approximately 1.5 years of
      age with weight gain of 12-20 kg/year, central hypoventilation distinct from the obstructive
      hypoventilation caused by obesity, hyperphagia, a spectrum of pituitary hormonal dysfunction,
      and autonomic disturbances including temperature, blood pressure, and nociception
      abnormalities. Some children have been noted with developmental and behavioral abnormalities.
      Tumors of neural crest origin have been identified in 25-33% of the patients. The etiology of
      ROHHAD syndrome and the cause of rapid onset obesity is unknown.

      The aims of this study are to understand the biological mechanisms behind rapid weight gain
      in early childhood in children with ROHHAD syndrome compared with age, sex and BMI matched
      controls.

      Aim 1. Determine if changes in the energy expenditure contribute to the severe obesity in
      children with ROHHAD syndrome: The investigators will perform detailed metabolic phenotyping
      including total energy expenditure by using doubly labeled water, resting energy expenditure
      using indirect calorimetry, body composition by Dual X-ray absorptiometry. The investigators
      anticipate that children with ROHHAD syndrome will have low total and resting energy
      expenditure compared to age-, sex- and BMI- matched controls.

      Aim 2: Determine if feeding and/or feeding signals in the postprandial period are
      dysregulated in children with ROHHAD syndrome: The investigators will measure spontaneous
      food intake, and following responses through the postprandial state: leptin, ghrelin and
      metabolic fuel concentrations (glucose, lipids and ketones). The investigators expect
      abnormalities in caloric intake adjusted for energy expenditure, peripheral hormonal signals
      of hunger and satiety, and metabolic fuel concentrations.
