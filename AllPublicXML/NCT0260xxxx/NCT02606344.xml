  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high rates of HIV infection in women have brought into sharp focus the problem of
      violence against women. There is a growing recognition that women and girls' risk of and
      vulnerability to HIV infection is shaped by deep-rooted and pervasive gender inequalities
      violence against them in particular. The links between intimate partner violence and HIV/AIDS
      are explained by biological as well as sociocultural and economic factors.
