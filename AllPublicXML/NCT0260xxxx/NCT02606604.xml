      This study will seek to determine the benefits that FES-LE cycling has over cycling alone on
      walking performance and quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is a rehabilitation tool that stimulates nerves via
      electrical current, causing muscles to contract. When FES is appled to leg muscles during
      stationary cycling the legs move in a fixed rhythmical pattern. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that FES during cycling is a safe and effective exercise for individuals
      recovering from spinal cord injury or stroke, but few have applied this tool to a progressive
      disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study is to assess the immediate
      and short-term effect of an 8-week training program comparing FES lower extremity cycling to
      cycling without FES. Twenty volunteers with MS will participate. They will be randomly
      assigned to a training group. This study examine the effects of training on quality of life,
      endurance, walking speed, and step quality. Participants will sign an informed consent and
      complete a questionnaire that includes medical history and demographic data. Before training,
      immediately after training finishes and one month after training, self-report questionnaires,
      timed walking tests will be completed. During the walking tests, step quality and speed will
      be measured with a sensor that is worn on a belt
