    <textblock>
      This randomized active-controlled multicenter Phase III open-label study will evaluate and
      compare between treatment groups the efficacy of alectinib versus chemotherapy in
      participants with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who were previously treated with chemotherapy
      and crizotinib, as measured by investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and to
      evaluate and compare between treatment groups the central nervous system (CNS) objective
      response rate (C-ORR) in participants with measurable CNS metastases at baseline, as assessed
      by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).

        <description>Time to CNS progression was defined as the time from randomization until radiographic evidence of CNS progression.
