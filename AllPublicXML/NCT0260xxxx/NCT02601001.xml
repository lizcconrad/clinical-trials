        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No history or evidence of clinically relevant medical disorders as determined by the
             Investigator, and in good health as determined by a pre-study physical examination and
             medical history with no clinically significant abnormalities, normal vital signs and
             no history or presence of a clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram finding

          -  Subjects' pre-study clinical laboratory findings (including creatine phosphokinase)
             should be within normal range or if outside of the normal range, are deemed not
             clinically significant by the Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinically significant disorder/disease, including gastro intestinal abnormalities
             that might interfere with absorption

          -  An unstable medical condition, defined as having been hospitalized within 28 days
             before day 1, major surgery within 6 months before day 1, or otherwise unstable in the
             judgment of the Investigator

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition, or
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor would pose a risk
             to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion

          -  History of malignancy of any type other than surgically excised non-melanomatous skin
             cancers or in situ cervical cancer within 5 years before the day of dosing

          -  Use of any prescription or over-the-counter medications within 14 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever time period is greater), prior to receiving the first dose of omecamtiv
             mecarbil (Acetaminophen up to 2 grams per day for analgesia and hormone replacement
             therapy (e.g., estrogen) will be allowed

          -  Use of any known inhibitors of CYP3A4/p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or CYP2D6 within 14 days
             or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer; or use of grapefruit juice or grapefruit
             containing products within 7 days prior to receiving the first dose of omecamtiv
             mecarbil

          -  Use of any known CYP3A4 inducers within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,
             before receiving omecamtiv mecarbil
