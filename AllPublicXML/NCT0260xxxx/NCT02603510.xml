      Primary Objective:

        -  Assess the safety of SAR342434 and Humalog when used in external pumps.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Intervals for infusion set changes.

        -  Incidence of insulin pump alarms for infusion set occlusion.

        -  Patient observation of infusion set occlusion.

        -  Adverse events including bruising at the infusion site and injection site reactions.

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Male and female subjects above the age of 18.

          -  Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 1 year prior to the screening
             visit.

          -  At least 1 year of insulin treatment with at least 6 months of continuous subcutaneous
             insulin infusion (CSII) treatment with an external insulin pump.

          -  Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  HbA1c ≥8.5% at screening.

          -  Diabetes other than type 1 diabetes mellitus.

          -  History of abscess at the infusion site within 3 months prior to the screening visit
             (Visit 1).

          -  Use of oral glucose-lowering agents or any injectable glucose-lowering agents other
             than insulin during the 3 months before screening.

          -  Hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the last 6 months before screening
             visit.

             tests, or vital signs at the time of screening that in the judgment of the
             investigator or any sub investigator would preclude safe completion of the study.

          -  Known history of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to the time of screening.

          -  Use of investigational drug(s) within 3 months or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,

             throughout the study and/or unwilling to be tested for pregnancy.

          -  Any contraindication to the use of Humalog as defined in the national product labels;
