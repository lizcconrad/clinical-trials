  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3039294 has been developed in order to offer an orally available alternative to parenteral
      CPHPC (GSK2315698 [metabolite of GSK3039294]) for plasma serum amyloid P component (SAP)
      depletion prior to use of anti SAP monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the treatment of systemic
      amyloidosis. This phase 1 study is intended to study safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of GSK3039294 in humans. This study consists of three parts. Part A will
      evaluate safety and tolerability of single doses of GSK3039294 in healthy subjects, Part B
      will evaluate safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3039294 in healthy subjects, and
      Part C will evaluate safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3039294 in subjects with
      systemic amyloidosis. Part A is a single dose, open label, dose escalation study. Two cohorts
      of subjects will be enrolled to provide data from 6 subjects per cohort and up to 4 different
      doses (2 dose levels per cohort) of GSK3039294 will be tested. For Cohorts 1 and 2, each
      subject may take part in two dosing periods. Part B is repeat dose, open label, dose
      escalation study. Sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 3a to ensure 6
      completers (Cohort 3b will be conducted if required) and GSK3039294 will be administered
      repeatedly for a total of 21 days. Each subject will take part in a single study period. In
      Part C a single dose level of GSK3039294 will be tested for 21 days repeat dose, in 12
      subjects with systemic amyloidosis. Each subject will take part in a single study period. The
      total duration for Part A is approximately 8 weeks, Part B is approximately 8-9 weeks, and
      Part C is approximately 13 weeks.
