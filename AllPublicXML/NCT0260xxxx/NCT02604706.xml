    <textblock>
      Background. A common alternative treatment for substance abuse is ear acupuncture. The aim of
      the study was to evaluate the short and long-term effect of auricular acupuncture on anxiety,
      sleep, drug use and addiction treatment utilization in adults with substance abuse. Method.
      Adults with substance abuse and psychiatric comorbidity were randomly assigned to either of
      two variants of auricular acupuncture - The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association
      protocol (NADA) or a local protocol (LP) - or relaxation training (controls). Primary
      outcomes were measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Insomnia Severity Index
      (ISI) with assessment before treatment and follow-ups after five weeks and three months.
      Secondary outcomes were drug use and addiction service utilization.

    <description>NADA-acupuncture was delivered in three phases: (1) one treatment each day during the first of a total of five weeks; (2) three treatments each week during the following two weeks; (3) two treatments each week during the two remaining weeks. each session consisted of approximately 40 minutes with acupuncture at five ear points called Sympathetic, Shen Men, Kidney, Liver and Lung, which are believed to be the best points for substance abuse patients. Acupuncture was administered to both ears using stainless steel needles. NADA-acupuncture were given as a supplement to treatment as usual consisting of Motivational Interview, pharmacological treatment, and control of drug use with urine tests.</description>
