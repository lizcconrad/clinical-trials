  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Norway an estimated 10 % of the population is injured annually. Of these 36.000 sustain
      permanent functional impairment, 1.200 receive disability pension, and approximately 2.500
      die because of their injuries. Mortality is the most common variable measuring trauma
      outcome. However, measuring only trauma mortality may be looking merely at the tip of the
      iceberg. For every trauma death, there are ten-folds suffering long term functional
      impairment. Mortality is therefore a too crude variable to describe the impact of injuries -
      both for the individual trauma patient and for society as a whole. There is a need for
      variables describing long-term outcomes on a functional level. The aim of this study is to
      use the rate of return to work and education as an alternative outcome measure. The ability
      of returning to work after injury is a central indicator of individual functional outcome,
      combining both physical and mental skills in performing complex and compound tasks. Previous
      studies on return to work after injury are limited by a combination of short follow-up times,
      the use of patient reported outcomes and having mainly been focusing on only severely injured
      patients (ISS &gt; 15). This a population-based study including all patients in working age (16
      - 65 years) received by a trauma team in any of the eight hospitals within the region of
      Central Norway in the time period from June 1st,2007 to May 30th, 2010. Already collected
      trauma registry data will be linked with national register data on sickness and disability
      benefits, employment and education.
