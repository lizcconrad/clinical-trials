  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, prospective, observational, single arm, multicenter trial to identify the
      population at high risk of overstimulation associated with signs and symptoms of PCOS and
      examines the utility of 12.5 international units (IU) increment of Gonal-f® new pen for
      individualized controlled ovarian stimulation (iCOS).

          -  Known history of poor ovarian response in a previous COS cycle for IVF/ICSI, defined
             as less than 4 oocytes retrieved or history of previous cycle cancellation prior to
