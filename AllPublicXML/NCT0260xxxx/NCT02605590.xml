  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of escalating inhaled
      AIR-DNase doses administered as a single dose followed by multiple doses for 5 consecutive
      days in healthy subjects.

      A thorough review of safety data will be conducted after completion of each dose level per
      subject and prior to both, moving to the next dose level in Part 1 and commencement of the
      multiple dose Part 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of inhaled
      AIR DNase in healthy volunteers. Up to 18 healthy males subjects (age 18 -55 inclusive) will
      be randomized to one of three dose cohorts (up to 6 subjects per cohort), receiving AIR DNase
      doses equivalent to 1.25 mg, 2.5mg or 5 mg or placebo in accordance. Subjects randomized to
      one of the cohorts will receive either active of placebo as single dose, in continuation,
      following safety assessments, will receive multiple doses, once daily for 5 consecutive days.
      Subjects will remain at the clinical center for 8 hours after the single administration of
      AIR DNase/placebo including PK sampling. During the multiple dosing subjects will arrive at
      the clinical center daily for AIR DNase/placebo administrations and study procedures and
      remain at the site for 4 hours post dosing.

      Follow up visits will be performed 7±2 days following single administration and 7±2 days
      following the last administration of the multiple phase.
