  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 2 parts: a double-blinded phase and an open-label extension phase. The
      open-label extension phase only will be described in this record. All participants will
      receive the same dose of GWP42003-P. However, investigators may subsequently decrease or
      increase the participant's dose until the optimal dose is found.

    <description>Administered orally, twice daily (morning and evening), commencing with titration of 100 mg/mL GWP42003-P to 20 mg/kg/day over 10 days in a blinded manner (i.e., only participants taking placebo in the blinded phase will up-titrate; doses will remain unchanged for those taking GWP42003-P in the blinded phase).
Participants remain on the maintenance dose for the remainder of the 12-month treatment period. However, investigators may subsequently decrease or increase the participant's dose (to a maximum of 30 mg/kg/day) until the optimum dose is found.
Dosing is tapered (10% each day) for participants who do not immediately continue to use GWP42003-P once market authorization is granted, or for those who withdraw early.</description>
