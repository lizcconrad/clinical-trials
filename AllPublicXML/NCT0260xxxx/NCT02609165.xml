      This study aims at investigating the therapeutic potential of recombinant human Nerve Growth
      Factor ( rhNGF ) eye drops treatment in patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) associated
      with cystoid macular edema (CME) in a phase II, randomized, double-masked, controlled
      clinical trial.

          7. Participant must be medically able to undergo the testing and study procedures
             required in the flowsheet of exam procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of diabetes-related macular edema, or macular edema associated with other
             causes such as choroideal neovascularization or after the eye surgery.

          4. Evidence of an active eye infection.

          5. previous uveitis or evidence of intraocular inflammation.

          6. History or evidence of glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or
             equal to 21 mm Hg at baseline.

             significantly limit of visual acuity or visual field, hindering the effectiveness of
             treatment in the study or its evaluation, or could interfere with the interpretation
             of The study results, or may be judged by the investigator incompatible with the visit
             program or with the procedures in the study.

         11. Known hypersensitivity to study drug or drugs procedural.

         12. Participation in another clinical study during the same period of this study or within
             90 days of the screening visit / baseline.

         13. History of drug use, illegal drugs or alcohol abuse or addiction.
