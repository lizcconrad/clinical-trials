    <textblock>
      Primary sclerotic cholangitis (PSC) is an inflammatory process of sclerotic cholangitis that
      involves intra and extra hepatic biliary system. There is no curative treatment for this
      disorder. Supportive and conservative treatments are the most common therapies that used for
      this disease. Although treatments such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) are recommended in some
      situations but whereas a hypothesis is stimulatory effect of intestinal anaerobic bacteria
      such as cholestridium difficile as pathogenesÄ±s of PSC, so use of antibiotics is recommended
      for treatment of these patients. Therefore according to the great role of anaerobic bacteria
      such as cholestridium difficile in pathogenesis, antibiotics such as metronidazole and
      vancomycin can be counted as recommended therapies in PSC. In addition some studies
      correlated this effect of vancomycin to its immunomudulatory effect the cause reduction of
      inflammation in biliary system. But with all this detail there is no finality about
      effectiveness of antibiotic therapy and accordingly in this study the investigators compare
      oral vancomycin effect versus placebo in primary sclerosing cholangitis patients.

      In this double blind clinical trial 30 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients that divided
      in two 15 persosns group with Block Randomization method. in this study one group receive 250
      mg oral vancomycin every 6 hours and other group receive placebo.

      The study duration is 12 weeks . The baseline laboratory tests and 1 month and 3 months after
      treatment concept of; Alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, GGT and serum total bilirubin and
      clinical manifestations such as tiredness, itching and probable adverse effects such as
      hypotension accompanied by flushing,erythematous rash on face and upper body (red neck or red
      man syndrome), chills and drug fever, eosinophilia and reversible neutropenia.
