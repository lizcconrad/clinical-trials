    <textblock>
      Phase I to determine safety of combining stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will determine safe doses of
      radiation by organ site when used together with pembrolizumab. The study will also provide
      the opportunity to evaluate changes in the tumor caused by SBRT.

      The study will include 2 expansion cohorts:

        -  Partially Irradiated Large Volume Tumors Cohort: Patients with at least one lesion
           greater than 65cc amenable to SBRT followed by pembrolizumab.

        -  Oligometastatic Cohort: Patients with limited metastatic disease (4 or fewer lesions)

    <measure>Recommended stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) dose in combination with pembrolizumab.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the recommended SBRT dose to various metastatic locations in patients with advanced solid tumors, and specifically in the lung in patients with NSCLC, in conjunction with pembrolizumab treatment.
Each metastasis targeted with SBRT will be assigned to one of the seven &quot;Metastasis Locations&quot;. Patients will receive 3 or 5 fractions of radiation as determined by the location of the metastases to be irradiated.
Exact logistic regression 13 analyses will be conducted to model the probability of DLT as a function of site dose, number of metastatic sites, and cumulative body radiation. These analyses will be conducted separately for each site using all patients with lesions at that site. If these analyses suggest a high (&gt;=33%) probability of toxicity for a particular combination of predictors, dose recommendations may be modified</description>

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

               -  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu
                  vaccines and are allowed, however intranasal influenza vaccines are live
                  attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

               -  In addition to the criteria above, patients must have disease limited to 4 total
                  lesions or less, all of which are amenable to SBRT. Patients with oligometastatic
                  disease at presentation or oligorecurrent disease are eligible. Patients who had
                  more than 4 sites of disease previously, but had a complete response at other
                  sites and limited progressive disease to 4 sites are eligible for participation.
                  Partial tumor irradiation for lesions &gt;65cc is permitted in this expansion
