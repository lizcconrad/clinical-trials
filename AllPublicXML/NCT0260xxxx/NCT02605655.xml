  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Chinese formula AMP-1915 has effect on
      Metabolic Syndrome (MS) in MS patients. Half of patients received AMP-1915, while the other
      half received placebo.

      In China, the herbal formulas have been used in the treatment of diabetes for centuries.
      Huangqisan, investigators named it AMP-1915, is one of traditional Chinese herbal formula
      used to relieve diabetes which was recorded in Shengji Zonglu (General Medical Collection of
      Royal Benevolence) published in 1117 A.D. AMP-1915 consists of three herbs: Radix Astragali
      (roots of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao, A), Mori
      Cortex radices (root barks of Morus alba L., M) and Puerariae Lobatae Radix (roots of
      Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi., P). Recent studies have shown that these three herbs and
      their constituents have therapeutic effects on the metabolic disorders.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a community hospital
      of Shanghai, China. 60 adult participants were metabolic disorder patients according with at
      least two impaired metabolic profiles (obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia or others).
      During 3-month treatment, participants were randomly divided in to two groups assigned to
      take AMP-1915 or placebo. AMP-1915 or placebo was mixed into instant noodles as daily meals
      with same color, shape, size and packaging. BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride
      (TG), total cholesterol (TCH), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), insulin, HbA1c were measured before and after treatment.
