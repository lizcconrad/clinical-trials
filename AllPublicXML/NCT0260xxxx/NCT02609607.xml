      The investigators seek to test whether incorporating the scheduled dosing of a bisacodyl 10
      mg rectal suppository every other day improves bowel-related symptoms in patients with
      multiple sclerosis. Patients will be randomized to receive either a placebo suppository or
      bisacodyl suppository dosed every other day for 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from some form of anorectal
      dysfunction, and these difficulties with bowel function are often ranked as negatively
      impactful on quality of life as impaired mobility. Despite the significant clinical burden of
      these symptoms, there remains a paucity of published literature supporting specific
      therapeutic options to manage anorectal dysfunction in this clinical population. Most bowel
      regimens rely on either oral laxatives (i.e. PEG-3350) or anti-diarrheal agents (i.e.
      loperamide). In their study, the investigators propose to establish the efficacy of a bowel
      regimen that combines both oral agents (as needed; standard care) with scheduled, every other
      day dosing of a placebo or stimulant laxative rectal suppository -- bisacodyl 10 mg.

      Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative medication that is available over-the-counter. It works by
      activating nerves in the rectum to elicit rectal contractions which ultimately leading to
      defecation.
