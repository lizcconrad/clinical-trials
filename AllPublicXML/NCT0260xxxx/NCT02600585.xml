  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to retrospectively characterize the safety of Flublok
      in adults 18 years of age and older, in comparison with egg-based trivalent or quadrivalent
      inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), using a methodological approach designed to query the
      database of electronic health records (EHR) maintained by Kaiser-Permanente, Northern
      California (KPNC), a large medical care organization (MCO).

      The primary analysis is a nonrandomized, observational retrospective cohort study. Data on
      adults 18 years of age and older who were enrolled in the KPNC database during the risk
      intervals after vaccination analyzed for this study who were vaccinated with Flublok or an
      IIV (either IIV3 or IIV4) will be identified for analysis. The rates of occurrence of
      specific MAEs of interest in pre-specified risk intervals following Flublok and IIV will be
      compared.

        The study population will include adults 18 years of age and older who are vaccinated with
        either Flublok or IIV within the same time period, e.g. month of the year.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Data from the EHR of all adult KPNC members 18 years of age and older, who received Flublok
        for active immunization against influenza as part of routine medical care within the KPNC
        system. The comparator cohort will include data from all adults in the same age group who
        received any IIV (trivalent or quadrivalent) during the period of Flublok administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Healthcare providers are expected not to administer Flublok or IIV to individuals with
        known contraindication to either vaccine (see product package inserts). However, there will
        be no exclusions other than age and KPNC membership criteria at the time of vaccination.
