  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two phases: Dose Escalation (Phase 1b) and Dose Expansion (Phase 2)

      The Dose Escalation phase will evaluate the safety and tolerability of GS-5829 as a single
      agent and in combination with enzalutamide, as well as determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of GS-5829 as a single agent and in combination with enzalutamide in participants with
      metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      The Dose Expansion phase will evaluate the following:

        -  In group 1, the efficacy of GS-5829 as a single agent in participants with mCRPC who
           have progressed while receiving enzalutamide (may have also received abiraterone)

        -  In group 2, the efficacy of GS-5829 combined with enzalutamide in participants with
           mCRPC who have progressed while receiving treatment with abiraterone (may not have
           previously received enzalutamide)

        -  In group 3, the efficacy of GS-5829 combined with enzalutamide in participants with
           mCRPC who have had Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) progression, but not radiographic
           progression, while receiving treatment with enzalutamide (participants may have also
           previously received abiraterone)
