      SANGUINATE™ Sickle Cell Disease associated Leg Ulcers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an escalating, repeated-dose, open-label Phase 2 study to test SANGUINATE (pegylated
      carboxyhemoglobin bovine) in patients suffering from leg ulceration associated with Sickle
      Cell Disease (SCD leg ulcer).

      Patients will undergo consent and screening procedures at the time of presentation for leg
      ulcer treatment. Eligible patients will begin a 3-week Run-In Period. A total of
      approximately fifteen (15) patients are expected to be screened in order to achieve an
      enrollment target of ten (10) evaluable patients for participation in the study. Evaluable is
      defined as a patient receiving a minimum of three doses of investigational product. Five (5)
      patients (Cohort 1) will receive four (4) once-weekly 2-hour IV infusions of SANGUINATE at a
      dose of 320 mg/kg (8 mL). An additional five (5) patients (Cohort 2) will receive six (6)
      once-weekly 2-hour IV infusions of SANGUINATE also at a dose of 320 mg/kg. Each patient will
      be contacted by telephone approximately 24 hours after dosing to verify the safety status of
      the patient. One week following the Treatment Phase, patients will return to the study center
      for a Final Visit where safety assessments will be performed. During the Final Visit,
      patients will receive standard of care treatment of ulcer. All patients will receive
      once-weekly Standard of Care (SOC) therapy for SCD leg ulcer for the duration of the study.
      SOC includes dressing the wound with multi-layer, short stretch, compression bandaging.
      Non-adherent, medical-grade foam will be used as the wound contact layer and primary
      dressing.

    <description>This is an Open-label, repeated-dose study. About five patients will be observed for 3 weeks continuing on standard of care therapy (for wound cleaning and bandaging). This will be followed by a 4-week treatment period to include once weekly doses of SANGUINATE provided via two-hour IV infusion. The final week of the study will include another observation period wherein all patients will receive standard of care therapy.</description>
