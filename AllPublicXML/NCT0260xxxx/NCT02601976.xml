  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a global problem, prevalent in developed as well as in the developing
      countries. New treatment regimens using PegInterferon in combination with ribavirin has led
      to improved sustained viral response rates for some genotypes. A single arm, open labeled,
      multicentre trial was conducted to evaluate the response rate and safety of PegInterferon
      alfa-2a (Unipeg®) plus ribavirin (Ribazole®) for the treatment of patients with chronic
      hepatitis C infection. RVR at 4 weeks, ETR at 24 weeks for genotype 3 and at 48 weeks for
      genotype 1 patients and SVR was determined at 24 weeks after completion of treatment. Quality
      of life at baseline and at follow-up visits were determined using SF-36.

      A multicenter, phase IV, open labeled, single arm study was conducted. Total 110 patients
      were screened for recruitment. Out of which 67 subjects met the inclusion criteria, 3 failed
      to give the informed consent and were excluded. The final sample size of the study was 64
      patients. The duration of study was August 2010 to September 2013. Peginterferon alfa-2a
      180µg 20kDa (Unipeg®) solution for injection was administered as single dose sub-cutaneous
      once weekly for 24 weeks to patients with genotype 3 and 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1
      at the site of recruitment. Ribavirin (Ribazole) orally were given in divided daily dose
      according to body weight-based dosing recommendations (&lt; 75kg = 1000 mg and ≥ 75 kg = 1200
      mg). Quality of life related Physical Component Score (PCS) &amp; Mental Component Score (MCS)
      were measured through Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Questionnaire (SF-36). The SF-36
      questionnaire was completed for all patients during their evaluations before treatment, at 4
      weeks, at the end of treatment and at 24 weeks after completion of treatment.
