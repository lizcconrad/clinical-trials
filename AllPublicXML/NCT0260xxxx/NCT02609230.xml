      This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D) of single agent ONC201 in patients with advanced solid tumors or multiple
      myeloma.

    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase
      II dose (RP2D) of ONC201, when given as a single agent, to patients with advanced solid
      tumors or multiple myeloma, in two dose schedules including every 3 weeks and weekly. For the
      first arm (A), dose escalation will use the following single patient dose-escalation cohorts
      based on 'Design 4' proposed by Simon and colleagues: 125, 250, 500, and 625 mg. Following
      completion of Arm A dose escalation, subsequent cohorts will be tested in a minimum of 3
      patients. The Arm B dose cohort will consist of dose levels administered once every one week
      (planned dosing of 250, 375, 500 and 625 mg). Dependent on PK and PD data, or emerging
      efficacy data, additional dose levels in Arm A or Arm B may be explored.

      For Arm A, single patient cohorts will be used until the first instance of DLT or the second
      instance of grade 2 toxicity. Either occurrence will lead to immediate use of a modified 3+3
      design and ~40% dose increments. Arm B will use a 3 + 3 design for all cohorts. It is
      anticipated that 16 - 48 evaluable patients in the dose escalation and an additional 17
      patients in the expansion phase will be enrolled into this study over the course of 2 years.
      Patients will receive ONC201 in 3-week cycles until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or the patient discontinues for any other reason. The maximum duration of treatment
      will be 12 months unless it is determined that a patient would derive benefit from continued
      therapy beyond 12 months.
