  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent pre-clinical data provide strong evidence that short-term starvation before the
      administration of cytostatic drugs for the chemotherapy of solid tumors leads to
      significantly higher efficacy and lower toxicity levels. However, these findings have so far
      not been validated in patients. The aim of this trial is to provide first clinical evidence
      regarding the impact of pre-chemotherapeutic short-term starvation on response to therapy
      (primary endpoint). Additionally, progression-free survival, adverse events, and overall
      survival will be monitored (secondary endpoints). In perspective, short-term starvation
      before chemotherapy could represent a simple and secure way to improve both efficacy and
      tolerance of chemotherapies at low cost.

    <description>Primary endpoint of this study is to assess the improvement in response to therapy for patients undergoing short-term starvation before chemotherapy of solid tumors in comparison to patients without dietary restrictions. Response to therapy on MRI or CT scancs will be measured using the RECIST criteria version 1.1.</description>
