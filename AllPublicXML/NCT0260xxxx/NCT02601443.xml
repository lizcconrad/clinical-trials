  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of multiple gestations has increased over the past years, mostly because of
      increased use of assisted reproductive technologies. Triplet pregnancies are at increased
      risk of preterm birth (PTB), which is the primary reason for their increased morbidity and
      mortality compared to singletons. Multiple gestations, including triplets, account for about
      3% of all pregnancies in the US but constitute at least 10% of cases of PTB, over 30% of very
      low birth weight infants, and nearly 20% of infant mortality.

      A short cervical length (CL) on transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) has been shown to be a good
      predictor of PTB, including in multiple gestations. In singletons with a prior PTB and a
      short CL &lt;25mm before 24weeks, cerclage is associated with significant decreases in PTB and
      perinatal morbidity and mortality in the meta-analysis of randomized trials (RCTs). On the
      contrary, the effect of cerclage in multiple gesttations has been insufficiently studied,
      with meta-analysis data showing a possible harm from cerclage compared to controls.

      The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the efficacy of cervical pessary in prevention of PTB in
      unselected triplet gestations.

      We planned to assess outcomes in subgroup analysis of women with short cervical length (TVU
      CL &lt;30 mm)

    <description>Cervical pessary is a medical device used to treat an incompetent (or insufficient) cervix (cervix starts to shorten and open too early). Early in the pregnancy a round silicone pessary is placed at the opening to the cervix to close it, and then remove late in the pregnancy when the risk of a preterm birth has passed.
Cervical pessary has been tried as a simple, non-invasive alternative that might replace the above invasive cervical stitch operation to prevent preterm birth.</description>
