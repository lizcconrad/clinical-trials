  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether three-dimensional tranesophageal
      echocardiography (3D TEE) assessment of ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD II) may be
      as efficient as two-dimensional (2D) TEE assessment complemented by the balloon-sizing during
      transcatheter closure of the defect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 50 consecutive patients eligible to percutaneous ASD II closure will be enrolled
      in the study. 3D-TEE will be performed in the diagnostic process; the images will be recorded
      for further investigation, however, measurments of the defect will not be taken until after
      the procedure. Traditional 2D-TEE together with balloon-sizing assessment of the defect will
      be performed in enrolled patients in order to chose a device. Control transthoracic
      echocardiography (TTE) will be provided twice to evaluate the outcome of transcatheter
      treatment: 1 day after the procedure and 6-12 months later. The previously obtained 3D images
      will be retrospectively assessed by 2 independent investigators excluded from the
      interventionalists' team. Maximum and minimum diameter, perimeter and area of the defect will
      be measured to propose the assumed optimal occluder size. Correlation between proposed
      occluder size and the device used during the procedure will be statistically analyzed.
