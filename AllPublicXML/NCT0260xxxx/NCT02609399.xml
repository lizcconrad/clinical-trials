  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing Emergency
      Departments (EDs) as a primary site for subject enrollment in clinical trials evaluating
      influenza therapeutics, and to provide pilot data for future clinical trial design and
      planning.

      Primary Objective: To prospectively enroll high-risk subjects with laboratory-confirmed
      influenza into a randomized, open label study of oral versus IV influenza therapeutic to
      include symptom evaluation and outcome assessments.

      Secondary Objective 1: To identify influenza positive patients utilizing a previously
      established triage-based assessment and rapid testing algorithm for suspected influenza
      infection.

      Secondary Objective 2: To retrospectively evaluate all potentially eligible patients for
      potential enrollment biases.

      Secondary Objective 3: To create a repository of residual nasopharyngeal samples collected
      from ED patients with suspected influenza illness.

      Title: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial for Feasibility of Enrolling Subjects for
      Influenza Therapeutic Trials and Administering Influenza Antivirals in the Emergency
      Department to High Risk Subjects

      Population: Adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory confirmed
      influenza who meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for antiviral
      treatment

      Informed consent: Written informed consent

      Number of Sites: 2 - large, urban, academically-affiliated, US EDs

      Study Duration: September 2015 - September 2018

      Subject Participation Duration: 4 weeks

      Description of Agent or Intervention: Subjects will be randomized to either oral
      (oseltamivir) or intravenous (IV) (peramivir) antiviral treatment.

      Description of Study Design: This is an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial in
      which subjects with influenza are randomized to either oral (oseltamivir) or IV (peramivir)
      antiviral treatment.

      Estimated Time to Complete Enrollment: Subject enrollment will occur over two influenza
      seasons (November 2015 - April 2017) or longer, at the Principal Investigator's discretion,
      based on influenza prevalence.
