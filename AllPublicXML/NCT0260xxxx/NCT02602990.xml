      A non-interventional multicentric study for patients with a cerebral AVM for which
      endovascular treatment is indicated.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will collect data about the treatment of ruptured, unruptured,
      untreated or endovascular previously treated AVM's.

      Primary endpoint is safety. Safety will be assessed with the number of procedure-related
      complications occurring during the endovascular treatment until 30 days after the final
      embolization.

      Secondary endpoint is efficacy. Efficacy will be assessed by angiography and clinical outcome
      assessments (mRS).

      For each patient enrolled, data will be collected at inclusion, at each embolization session
      and at 6 ± 1 months after the end of the endovascular treatment phase.

    <description>The safety is assessed with the number of procedure-related complications occurring during endovascular treatment until 30 days after the final embolization session. Procedure-related complications include complications/adverse events related to the procedure or to the device such as but not limited to hemorrhagic and ischemic complications.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must sign the informed consent form prior to the index-procedure. If patient
             is unable to provide it him- or herself because of the patient's medical condition,
             the informed consent of the patient's legally authorized representative shall be
             requested.

          2. The patient has an untreated or endovascular previously treated cerebral AVM for which
             endovascular treatment is indicated.

          3. The patient is at least 18 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is pregnant.
