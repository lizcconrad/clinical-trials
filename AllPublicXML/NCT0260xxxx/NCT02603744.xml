    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine safety and tolerability and of intra-ovarian injection
      of adipose derived stromal cell in women with premature ovarian failure and to study the
      preliminary efficacy ADSCs intra ovarian injection on ovarian function improvement.

    <textblock>
      In this study 9 patients with the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure will participate.

      The patients will be divided randomly in 3 groups, each group contains 3 patients. First
      group will receive 5 millions of ADSCs, second group receive 10 millions cells and the third
      group receive 15millions of ADSCs.

      Stem cell Transplantation method is intraovarian injection of ADSCs which will be performed
      under guidance of transvaginal sonography.

      All the patients will be followed for 12 months after cell injection to evaluate any adverse
      events .
