    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment
      with obinutuzumab, polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide in participants with relapsed or
      refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) and rituximab in combination with polatuzumab
      vedotin and lenalidomide in participants with R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
      followed by post-induction treatment with obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide in
      participants with FL who achieve a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable
      disease (SD) at end of induction (EOI) and post-induction treatment with rituximab plus
      lenalidomide in participants with DLBCL who achieve a CR or PR at EOI.
