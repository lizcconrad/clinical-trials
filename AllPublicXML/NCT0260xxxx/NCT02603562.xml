    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and biological activity of ATYR1940 in
      patients with early onset facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).

      A Phase 1b/2 open-label, intrapatient dose escalation study aiming to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, immunogenicity, biological and pharmacodynamic activity of intravenous
      ATYR1940, administered once weekly for 12 weeks, in early onset FSHD patients with signs or
      symptoms prior to 10 years of age. In Stage 1, up to 8 patients between the ages of 16 and 25
      years will be enrolled. Stage 2 of enrollment will include patients with early onset FSHD
      between the ages of 12 and 15 years.

          -  Established, genetically confirmed diagnosis of FSHD.

          -  Onset of FSHD signs or symptoms prior to 10 years of age, as documented in the
             patient's medical record or based on patient or family report.

          -  Provide written informed consent or assent

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, patient is willing and able to complete all study
             procedures and comply with the weekly study visit schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently receiving treatment with an immunomodulatory agent including targeted
             biological therapies within the 3 months before baseline; corticosteroids within 3
             months before baseline; or high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents within 2
             weeks before baseline.

          -  Currently receiving curcumin or albuterol; use of a product that putatively enhances
             muscle growth or activity on a chronic basis within 4 weeks before baseline; statin
             treatment initiation or significant adjustment to statin regimen within 3 months
             before baseline (stable, chronic statin use is permissible).

          -  Use of an investigational product or device within 30 days before baseline.

          -  Evidence of an alternative diagnosis other than FSHD or a coexisting myopathy or
             dystrophy, based on prior muscle biopsy or other available investigations.

          -  History of severe restrictive or obstructive lung disease, or evidence for
             interstitial lung disease on screening chest radiograph.

          -  History of anti-synthetase syndrome, prior Jo-1 Ab-positivity, or a positive or
             equivocally positive Jo-1 Ab test result during screening.

          -  Chronic infection, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             or a history of tuberculosis.

          -  Vaccination within 8 weeks before baseline or vaccination is planned during study
             participation.

          -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or severe cardiac arrhythmia, that may, in the
             Investigator's opinion, limit the patient's ability to complete the study protocol.

          -  Muscle biopsy within 30 days before baseline.
