  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-resistant tuberculosis is becoming a major problem for the whole humanity, and
      development of new Anti-TB drugs is of great importance. Since Kazakhstan is a country with
      the high burden of tuberculosis, The Government of The Republic of Kazakhstan has founded
      initiative on the development of new Anti-TB drug to treat drug-resistant forms of this
      infectious disease. JSC &quot;Scientific Center for Anti-infectious Drugs&quot; has developed original
      drug FS-1 for the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

    <textblock>
      Phase 3 clinical study of FS-1 drug is a randomized, interventional, multicenter,
      placebo-controlled (add-on), double-blind and two arms trial.

      The study consists of two following phases: treatment phase - 6 months and follow-up phase 12
      months. It is planned to recruit 480 patients with verified MDR-TB diagnosis.

      All data will be compiled in an Electronic Data Capture System with further statistical
      analysis according to approved Statistical Analytical Plan.
