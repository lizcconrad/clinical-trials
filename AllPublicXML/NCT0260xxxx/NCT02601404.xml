  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current drug-eluting stents (DES) has demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes in patients
      with coronary artery disease. However, a continued risk of clinical events even several years
      after the procedure is reported. Stent platform or polymer-associated inflammation may play a
      role.

      Bioresorbable scaffold (BRS) is known to disappear 2 to 3 years after the implantation, which
      may result in the more favorable very long-term clinical outcomes compared with metallic
      stents. The initial clinical experiences of BRS in relatively simple lesion subsets were
      comparable to DESs.

      BRS, however, is limited by the disadvantageous mechanical characteristics such as thick
      strut and the risk of fracture by overdilation. There is concern that BRS is less optimal for
      complex lesion subsets such as bifurcation lesions, calcified tortuous lesions, or diffuse
      long lesions. Real world registry is needed to test the feasibility and safety of BRS in
      these complex lesion subsets.

        A total of 1,000 patients derived from a population of Korean patients receiving PCI for
        coronary artery disease will be enrolled in the present registry. It is recommended that
        each enrolling investigator review the most recent instructions for use (IFU) of Absorb™
        and assess the contraindications, warnings, and precaution sections for treating potential
        patients.
