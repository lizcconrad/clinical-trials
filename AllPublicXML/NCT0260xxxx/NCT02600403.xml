      The aim of this study was to evaluate structural and functional improvement after lowering
      intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence
      Tomography (SD-OCT), Visual Field (VF) testing, and Visual Evoked Potential (VEP).

      Glaucoma exhibits characteristic changes to the optic nerve in the back of the eye. The optic
      nerve is formed when fibers that overlay the retina come together. This layer is called the
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a machine that scans eyes and has the capability of
      measuring thickness of various layers in the retina and RNFL. This provides important
      anatomical information.

      VEP (visual evoked potential) is an imaging system that measures electrical signals from the
      eye to the brain by using electrodes placed on the forehead and back of head. This is similar
      in principal to an electrocardiogram of the heart.

      Visual field testing is done to evaluate the extent of side vision loss caused by various
      diseases of the eye, including glaucoma. This testing is performed as you stare at a small
      light directly in front of your eye while lights flash one at a time in every direction on a
      screen surrounding the central light. You push a button each time you see a flash out of the
      corner of your eye.

      Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye has been shown to result in reversal of
      glaucoma changes of the optic nerve in some patients. It has also been suggested that
      improvement in function (visual field) has been associated with improved optic nerve
      appearance.

      This study seeks to provide evidence for reversal of disc appearance and visual function
      following IOP lowering interventions.

    <measure>Visual Field Mean Deviation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Visual field mean deviation as measured in decibels (dB) is the amount of visual field loss compared to age matched controls (people with no eye diseases or visual field loss). Brightness of the flashes of light used to test peripheral vision during a visual field test is measured in decibels. Brighter light has lower number in decibels. The dimmer the light, the higher the number in decibels with a range of 0 to 40 dB.</description>

    <measure>Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) Thickness Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in different quadrants of optic nerve and macula are measured pre and postoperatively to evaluate structural changes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Cup to Disc Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cup to disc ratio is used to evaluate structural changes comparing the size of the cup to the size of the disc during dilated ophthalmic examination. High eye pressure can cause the cup to enlarge, closer to the size of the disc. This measurement is used to follow progression in glaucoma. A normal range for cup to disc ratio would be 0.0 to 0.4. Advanced glaucoma would be 0.8 to 0.9 cup to disc ratio.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Evoked Potential Amplitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>VEP amplitudes at high contrast as measured in microvolts (Î¼V). Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures electrical activity in the brain. VEP measures electrical activity in areas of the brain responsible for vision by using EEG electrodes. The amplitude measurement is the peak of the energy generated (strongest strength of the signal) from the eye's response to the visual stimulus during the VEP.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Evoked Potential Latency</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>VEP latency at high contrast as measured in milliseconds (ms). Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures electrical activity in the brain. VEP measures electrical activity in areas of the brain responsible for vision by using EEG electrodes. VEP latencies measure the duration in time of the energy generated (duration of the signal) from the eye's response to a visual stimulus during the VEP.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Field</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Visual field pattern standard deviation in decibels (dB). Visual field results compare visual field loss to age matched controls (people with no eye diseases or visual field loss). Brightness of the flashes of light used to test peripheral vision during a visual field test is measured in decibels. With a localized defect in the visual field, pattern standard deviation (PSD) quantifies amount of loss and progression of glaucoma when in the beginning stages of the disease.</description>

        <title>Visual Field Mean Deviation</title>
        <description>Visual field mean deviation as measured in decibels (dB) is the amount of visual field loss compared to age matched controls (people with no eye diseases or visual field loss). Brightness of the flashes of light used to test peripheral vision during a visual field test is measured in decibels. Brighter light has lower number in decibels. The dimmer the light, the higher the number in decibels with a range of 0 to 40 dB.</description>

        <description>VEP amplitudes at high contrast as measured in microvolts (Î¼V). Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures electrical activity in the brain. VEP measures electrical activity in areas of the brain responsible for vision by using EEG electrodes. The amplitude measurement is the peak of the energy generated (strongest strength of the signal) from the eye's response to the visual stimulus during the VEP.</description>

          <title>Glaucoma Subjects With IOP 22-32 mmHg</title>
          <description>Forty four (44) patients will have testing done using optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual evoked potential (VEP) and visual field (VF).
Testing will be repeated at 1-2 months, 4-6 months and 9-12 months after the initial eye pressure intervention (follow-up testing will be one (1) visual field test, two (2) OCTâs and one (1) VEP).
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a machine that scans the eyes and has the capability of measuring the thickness of the various layers of the retina and NFL.
Visual Evoked Potential (VEP): Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) is an imaging system that measures the electrical signal from the eye to the brain by using electrodes placed on the forehead and back of the head.
Visual Field: Visual field testing is done to evaluate the extent of side vision loss a patient has with various diseases of the eye, including glaucoma.</description>
