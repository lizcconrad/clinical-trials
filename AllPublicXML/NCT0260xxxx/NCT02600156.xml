  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of MRI-guided
      focal laser ablation (Laser-Induced Interstitial Thermal Therapy, LITT) to treat low-risk
      native prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI)-guided focal laser therapy with the Visualase Thermal Therapy System to treat
      low-risk prostate cancer tumors. Unlike surgery or radiotherapy which affects a large portion
      of the prostate or the entire organ, localized or focal therapy is intended to treat a small
      portion of tissue in which the cancer has been found by biopsy.
