      Evaluation of FDG PET/CT to image immunotherapy response in adult thoracic cancer.

      Compare pre- and post-treatment primary tumor uptake for FDG-PET/CT and correlate with
      clinical markers of response. PET/CT tumor metabolic response will also be correlated will to
      progression-free survival and overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients, at least 18 years of age

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer or malignancy pleural mesothelioma
             with at least one site of disease &gt; 1 cm by at least one type of standard imaging
             (e.g.

        CT, chest x-ray, MRI)

          -  Recommended to start anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy.

          -  Obtaining pre-PD1/PDL1 therapy clinical re-staging [18F]FDG-PET/CT scan at the
             Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

          -  Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging
             procedures in the opinion of the investigator or treating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding at the time of screening will not be
             eligible for this study. Female participants of child-bearing potential will have a
             urine pregnancy test at the time of the screening visit.

          -  Patients with only a single site of primary non-small cell lung cancer or malignancy
             pleural mesothelioma who have undergone or are recommended to undergo radiation
             therapy to that site will not be eligible, the inclusion of patients who may be
             undergoing radiation therapy to ancillary disease sites may be allowed to enter the
             study at the discretion of the PI if it is not felt to affect the ability to capture
             [18F]FDG information for at least one primary site of disease.

          -  Patients who have undergone cancer surgery removing a significant portion of active
             disease, in the opinion of an investigator, within 2 months prior to study enrollment
             will be excluded.

          -  Patients who have received prior immunotherapy.

          -  Patients with an active auto-immune disease (ie. Multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis).

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of the investigator or
             treating physician

          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
             study.
