  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, open-label study will assess the safety and efficacy of oral
      treprostinil in subjects diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary
      fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how oral treprostinil can affect pulmonary vascular resistance, as
      assessed by right heart catheterization, and exercise capacity, as assessed by the Six-Minute
      Walk Test. This is a 16-week study that will involve at least 10 clinical trial centers. The
      expected enrollment period is around 24 months and 52 subjects will be entered into the
      study.
