    <textblock>
      This pilot trial compares conventional restorations with a new strategy based on the medical
      management of caries using silver nitrate and fluoride varnish with no restorations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, parallel group, patient-randomized controlled pilot trial. Children with
      at least one primary tooth where caries extends into dentine. Children will be randomized and
      treated according to one of two treatment approaches;(1) conventional caries management with
      best practice prevention, or (2) medical management of caries using silver nitrate with best
      practice prevention.

      Baseline measures and outcome data (at treatment/review during two year follow-up) are
      assessed through direct reporting, clinical examination including blinded radiographic
      assessment, and child/parent questionnaires.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presense of one or more cavitated carious lesions in the primary dentition, extending
             into dentin but not encroaching on the pulp.

          -  Absense of any spontaneous or elicited pain due to caries, or signs of pulpal
             infection in response to any of the carious lesions in the primary dentition to be
             included in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hereditary developmental defects of the teeth such as Amelogenesis Imperfecta and
             Dentinogenesis Imperfecta

          -  Medical conditions that prevent treatment of the child in the outpatient clinic. These
             conditions include severe bleeding disorders, cardiac problems and mental disabilities
             that prevent child from communication with the research team.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity to any of the dental materials.
