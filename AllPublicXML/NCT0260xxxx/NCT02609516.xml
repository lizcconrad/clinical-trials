  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy at age 65 in the most deprived fifth of the English population was about 4
      years shorter than of the most affluent fifth in 2010. The inverse gradient between mortality
      and social position is well established. But how disease patterns and multimorbidity (having
      two or more long term conditions at the same time) impact on differential mortality rates is
      inconclusive: is it because disadvantaged groups acquire more or more lethal combinations of,
      diseases over their life course; or, simply, become ill at ages younger than more affluent
      groups?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The association between social inequality and cause-specific mortality and single disease
      morbidity has been studied extensively. However, it remains unclear whether having two or
      more chronic diseases concurrently (or 'multimorbidity') plays a role in contributing to the
      inequalities gap in survival. This is particularly relevant given an ageing population and
      the trend of a widening in the life expectancy gap across several European countries.

      Multimorbidity incidence increases rapidly with age. Estimates of the prevalence of
      multimorbidity in older people range from 55% to 98%, mainly due to the selection of diseases
      included, population coverage (hospital, community) and data source (self-reported surveys or
      clinical records). However, across all studies there is a clear and consistent pattern of
      higher prevalence rates at older ages, with multimorbidity.

      Many aspects of the patient health trajectory remain under-explored. Patient case-mixes are
      likely to vary across socioeconomic groups, alongside a host of prognostic factors, including
      the clustering of multiple risk factors, age of onset, and disease presentation, progression
      and management in the presence of multiple health conditions.
