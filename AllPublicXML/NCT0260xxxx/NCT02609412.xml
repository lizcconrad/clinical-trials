    <textblock>
      Latent myofascial trigger points (LMTRP) which impair neuromuscular performance occur in
      both, patients and asymptomatic subjects. As evidence suggests that LMTRP can transform into
      active trigger points, therapy seems warranted. Besides other modalities, self-massage using
      foam rollers (self-myofascial release) has been applied as a treatment. However, there is no
      data on the efficacy of this method concerning LMTRP. Thus, the present study aims to
      evaluate the effects of different forms of self-myofascial release on LMTRP pain.

      Healthy patients with LMTRP in the calf are randomly allocated to one of three groups: 1) 90s
      static compression of the most sensitive LMTRP by means of the foam roll, 2) dynamic
      self-myofascial release rolling back and forth on the calf muscles for 90s using a foam
      roller, 3) placebo laser acupuncture of the most sensitive LMTRP. All subjects participate in
      a familiarization session with the foam roller one week prior to treatments. As an outcome,
      pressure pain threshold is assessed with an algometer. The investigators hypothesize, that
      static compression can reduce pressure pain of LMTRP more effective than dynamic
      self-myofascial release. The investigators further expect that placebo treatment will be the
      least effective method.
