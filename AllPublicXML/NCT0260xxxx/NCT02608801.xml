  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate patient related factors that contribute to
      increased risk of recurrent fractures and to investigate patient adherence to prescribed
      anti-osteoporotic drugs.

    <textblock>
      A standardized treatment program of osteoporosis will be introduced successively at 7
      hospitals in Norway from April 2015 to January 2016. This Project is named NoFRACT (Norwegian
      Capture the Fracture Initiative https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02536898). Patients above
      50 years of age, who recently have suffered a fragility fracture, will be offered examination
      of osteoporosis and treatment if indicated. Some of these patients will be asked to
      participate in this consent-based sub-study (NoFRACTsub). At baseline, the patients will be
      asked to answer a questionnaire, collect blood-sample for to outline possible causes for
      osteoporosis, in addition to Dual X-Ray Apsopiometry (DXA) scan including bone mineral
      density(BMD), trabecular bone score(TBS) and vertebral fracture assessment (VFA). At 1-year
      follow-up there will be a brief questionnaire and measuring of BTM. At 2-year follow-up there
      will be a brief questionnaire in addition to repeated measurement of DXA including BMD, TBS
      and VFA. All data will be stored securly at the designated server at the University of Oslo,
      Service of sensitive data, TSD.
