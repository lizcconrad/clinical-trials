    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to test the feasibility and work flows associated with using MRI as the
      initial imaging modality in the investigation of patients presenting with suspected scaphoid
      fracture.

      This pilot will be used to inform the design of a study that will aim to evaluate whether the
      proposed intervention is likely to generate cost-savings whilst improving or maintaining
      overall patient quality of life and satisfaction.

      The present pilot study is designed to assess the feasibility of using MRI as the initial
      imaging modality in the investigation of patients presenting with suspected scaphoid fracture
      at the Emergency department or Urgent Care Centre. This study will inform the design of a
      study that will aim to evaluate whether the proposed intervention is likely to generate
      cost-savings whilst improving or maintaining overall patient quality of life and
      satisfaction.

      Patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture will be randomised to receive standard of care
      using 4-view plain x-ray (control group) as the first imaging modality or MRI examination as
      the first imaging modality.

    <description>This arm assess the use of MRI as the first line examination of suspected scaphoid fracture (replacing conventional plain x-ray).
Patients with negative findings will receive a splint and contact card to a specialist wrist clinic if the pain persists for ten to fourteen days after initial presentation.
Patients with positive findings will receive a plaster cast and undergo a CT scan (to evaluate displacement) and will be referred to the fracture clinic. Furthermore, if the CT scan confirms a displaced fracture, that might require surgery, the patient should be seen by a Hand Specialist at fracture clinic.
All patients enrolled in the pilot should undergo a 4-view plain x-ray 3 months after the initial ED/UCC presentation.</description>

    <description>This arm is the current standard of care pathway for the diagnosis of patients with suspected scaphoid fracture. This includes an initial clinical assessment on arrival to the Emergency Department of Urgent Care Centre followed by a plain x-ray (using a 4-view scaphoid protocol).
Patients with negative/positive findings for scaphoid fracture in the initial X-ray will be immobilised with a splint/plaster cast.
All patients will be referred to an initial fracture clinic and a proportion of patients are likely to require additional imaging scans (usually CT but also MRI) and follow-up appointments in the fracture clinic. All patients enrolled in the pilot should undergo a 4-view plain x-ray 3 months after the initial ED/UCC presentation.</description>
