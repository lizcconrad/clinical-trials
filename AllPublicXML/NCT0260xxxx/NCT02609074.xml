  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The investigators initiated a pilot clinical study to test safety and preliminary
      efficacy in humans (bone tissue repairing capacity) and to evaluate standard clinical and
      rehabilitation protocols.

      Summary Background Data: Bone tissue engineering scaffolds loading growth factors have been
      considered as the most perspective among all bone substitutes, yet little progress of its
      clinical translation has been made. The concept of &quot;micro-scaffolds&quot; was proposed in this
      study to provide a trajectory to its clinical translation.

      Methods: Pre-cured CPC/rhBMP-2 micro-scaffolds have been successfully developed and further
      applied as an easy-to-operate filler for bone regeneration in a pilot clinical study.
      Patients of tibial plateau fractures, proximal humeral fractures, or calcaneal fractures at a
      similar level of severity were randomly divided into two groups and treated by CPC/rhBMP-2
      microffolds or traditional CPC paste (control group).

    <description>The assessment was based on clinical examination. After the CPC implantation, all patients were observed according to the following indexes: allergic or toxic reactions, rash or high fever.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function scoring - IOWA knee score</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 months post-operation.</time_frame>
    <description>The functional recovery was recorded at each follow-up time point using IOWA knee score in cases of tibial plateau fractures. The IOWA knee score is a questionnaire and clinical-examination-based evaluation of the function of the knee. The knee score is a five- category measurement, which includes activities of daily living, freedom from pain, gait, aid dependence, deformity and range of movement. The scores are grouped into excellent (90 to 100), good (80 to 89), fair (70 to 79) and poor (under 70) categories.</description>

    <measure>Function scoring - IOWA ankle score</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 months post-operation.</time_frame>
    <description>The functional recovery was recorded at each follow-up time point using IOWA ankle score in cases of calcaneal fractures. The IOWA ankle score is a questionnaire and clinical-examination-based evaluation of the function of the ankle. The ankle score is a four-category measurement of function, freedom from pain, gait and range of movement. The scores are grouped into excellent (90 to 100), good (80 to 89), fair (70 to 79) and poor (under 70) categories.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function scoring - NEER shoulder score</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 months post-operation.</time_frame>
    <description>The functional recovery was recorded at each follow-up time point using Neer shoulder score in cases of proximal humeral fractures. Neer shoulder score has three parts: scoring of pain during the previous week by patients (verbal rating scale); clinical testing of function (muscle strength, reaching ability, and stability) and active range of motion; and an anatomical or radiological evaluation. The scores are grouped into excellent (90 to 100), good (80 to 89), fair (70 to 79) and poor (under 70) categories.</description>

    <description>All operations were done by doctors titled with associate chief physician or above. Procedures were performed under general anesthesia in a tertiary care medical center.
A minimally invasive internal fixation method had been applied in the surgeries. In brief, the patients with fracture were treated by reduction of fracture first of all, the correction of displacement, and the angle of the deformity, and the use of metal implants were fixed, and the collapse of the cancellous bone was filled with CPC/rhBMP-2 microffolds (product of Shanghai Rebone Biomaterials Co., Ltd, following the manufacturer's instruction), which was compacted and prevented from filling material into the joint cavity.</description>
