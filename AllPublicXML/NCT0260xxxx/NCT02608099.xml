  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the prospective, randomized cohort in this study is to assess the safety and
      efficacy of 2 apixaban treatment strategies (uninterrupted versus interrupted) in subjects
      planned to undergo catheter ablation for the treatment of non-valvular atrial fibrillation
      (NVAF).

      Simultaneously, a retrospective cohort of 300 warfarin-treated individuals, identified by
      chart review, who are matched to the prospective randomized subjects, will be identified. The
      purpose of the retrospective warfarin cohort is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      warfarin(the current clinical practice) to that of apixaban (uninterrupted, interrupted,
      combined uninterrupted and interrupted).

      Prospective, Randomized Cohort

      Subjects undergoing ablation for NVAF who meet all eligibility criteria and sign informed
      consent will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be treated with apixaban for ≥21 days
      prior to the ablation procedure (for subjects already on apixaban for ≥21 days, it is not
      necessary to wait 21 days before the ablation procedure. Apixaban dose will be 5 mg b.i.d.
      per product label, or 2.5 mg b.i.d. in subjects with 2 or more of the following: age ≥80
      years, body weight ≤60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL.

      Eligible subjects will then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 peri-procedural treatment
      strategies:

        -  Uninterrupted treatment: administer the evening apixaban dose on the day prior to the
           procedure; administer the morning apixaban dose on the day of the procedure; administer
           heparin bolus before transseptal puncture to maintain a target activated clotting time
           [ACT] &gt; 300 seconds; administer the evening apixaban dose after the procedure if there
           were no peri-procedural complications that necessitate withholding anticoagulation for
           longer duration.

        -  Interrupted treatment: administer the evening apixaban dose on the day prior to the
           procedure; do not administer the morning apixaban dose on the day of the procedure;
           administer heparin bolus before transseptal puncture to maintain a target ACT &gt; 300
           seconds; administer the evening apixaban dose after the procedure if there were no
           peri-procedural complications that necessitate withholding anticoagulation for longer
           duration.

      Randomization will take place prior to the procedure (on the day of the procedure or up to 3
      days prior to the procedure) and will be stratified by site.

      It is anticipated that up to 360 subjects may be enrolled in order to evaluate a total of 300
      randomized subjects (150 subjects per treatment arm):

      Randomized subjects will continue treatment with apixaban for 1 month post procedure.

      Retrospective, Warfarin Cohort In addition, a chart review of 300 warfarin-treated patients
      who underwent catheter ablation for NVAF on or after September 1, 2013 in the enrolling
      centers and who have documented follow-up in the medical record for ≥ 30 days post-ablation
      procedure will be performed. Patient records for warfarin-treated individuals who meet the
      applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria and who are matched 1:1 to a subject in the
      prospective, randomized cohort for age (+/- 5 years), gender and atrial fibrillation (AF)
      type (paroxysmal vs. persistent), will be identified. Sites will document key demographic and
      outcome variables. This review will be performed in a blinded manner such that site personnel
      are blinded to the outcome of each retrospective subject during the subject selection
      process. Only pre-existing data will be collected for the analysis of this cohort.
