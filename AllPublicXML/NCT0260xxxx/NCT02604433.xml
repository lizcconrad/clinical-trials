    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) plus Best supportive care (BSC)
      versus placebo plus BSC in adults who require regular red blood cell transfusion due to
      (β)-thalassemia.

      The study is divided into the Screening/Run-in Period, double-blind Treatment Period,
      double-blind Long-term Treatment Period, and Post-treatment Follow-up Period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Male or female, ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document
             (ICF).

          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an Inform Consent Form prior to any
             study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Documented diagnosis of β-thalassemia or Hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia. (β-thalassemia
             with mutation and/or multiplication of alpha globin is allowed).

          5. Regularly transfused, defined as: 6-20 Red Blood Cell (RBC) units* in the 24 weeks
             prior to randomization and no transfusion-free period for ≥ 35 days during that
             period.

             * Sites who prescribe transfusions and have the transfusion records only in volumes
             should use for conversion of volume to units the below criteria, in order to obtain
             number of units within the last 24 weeks to assess the eligibility: 1 unit in this
             protocol refers to a quantity of packed RBCs approximately 200-350 mL. (i) sites who
             use transfusion bags within this range, or ≥ 350 mL, the conversion in units should be
             done by dividing the volume transfused to the patient by 350 mL, (ii) sites who use
             transfusion bags &lt; 200 mL, the conversion in units should be done by dividing the
             volume transfused to the patient by 200 mL.

          6. Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1.

          7. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) for this study is defined as a female who:
             1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea
             following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24
             consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive
             months). FCBP participating in the study must:

               1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to
                  starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the
                  course of the study, and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the
                  subject practices true abstinence ** from heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence** from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) If a FCBP engages in sexual
                  activity that may result in a pregnancy, she must agree to use, and be able to
                  comply with, effective*** contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to
                  starting investigational product, during the study therapy (including dose
                  interruptions), and for 12 weeks (approximately five times the mean terminal
                  half-life of luspatercept based on multiple-dose Pharmacokinetic PK) data) after
                  discontinuation of study therapy.

                    -  True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and
                       usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar,
                       ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
                       acceptable methods of contraception.] *** Agreement to use highly effective
                       methods of contraception that alone or in combination result in a failure
                       rate of a Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used consistently and
                       correctly throughout the course of the study.

             Such methods include: Combined (estrogen and progesterone/progestin containing)
             hormonal contraception: Oral; Intravaginal; Transdermal; Progestogen/progestin only
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: Oral; Injectable
             hormonal contraception; Implantable hormonal contraception; Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD); Placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system
             (IUS); Bilateral tubal occlusion; Vasectomized partner; Sexual Abstinence.

          8. Male subjects must:

               -  Practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a
                  pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the
                  study, during dose interruptions and for at least 12 weeks (approximately five
                  times the mean terminal half-life of luspatercept based on multiple-dose PK data)
                  following investigational product discontinuation, even if he has undergone a
                  successful vasectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from participating in the study.
