  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Evidence of high quality has suggested that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)/aspirin
      effectively reduces colorectal adenoma incidence and recurrence rate, and several randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) strongly indicate its potential to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC)
      initiation and progression and to decrease cancer-related mortality. However the role of
      aspirin supplied as an adjuvant agent in postsurgical CRC patients remains obscure, and a RCT
      is warranted for clarification.

      Aim: The APREMEC trial aims to investigate the potential preventative role of enteric-coated
      aspirin (100 mg and 200 mg daily) against postsurgical recurrence and metastasis among Asian
      CRC patients.

      Design: The investigators hypothesize that this large-scale multicenter randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial will support that aspirin can reduce recurrence and
      metastasis and improve survival in postsurgical non-metastasized CRC patients. The primary
      endpoint of this trial is disease-free survival, and the secondary endpoints are 3-year and
      5-year overall survival, the interactive effects of lifestyle including smoking and alcohol
      ingestion, and adverse event rate. Eligible postoperative patients with non-metastasized CRC
      will be randomized in this trial to 100 mg aspirin, 200 mg aspirin or placebo until
      recurrence/metastasis, severe adverse event, death, or end of study, after standard adjuvant
      therapy. Individuals with peptic ulcer, bleeding tendency, or previous or ongoing treatment
      with aspirin or other anticoagulants will be excluded from this trial. Stratification factors
      are gender, study center, cancer site, and tumor stage. After randomization, patients will be
      followed up with evaluations at a 3-month interval while taking study drug.

      Discussion: This study aims at investigation of aspirin's role as an adjuvant agent in
      prevention of postsurgical CRC recurrence and metastasis. If results turn out to be positive,
      Asian and global CRC patients will be greatly benefited, due to the fact that aspirin is
      inexpensive, easily-accessible, and simply-administered, with well know and managed adverse
      events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial investigating aspirin
             application in tumor-nodal-metastasis (TNM) stages I-III CRC without metastasis
             requiring surgical resection. Patients ≥ 18 years who have their primary tumors (and
             metastatic lymph nodes) completely removed with R0 resection margin, and who have
             completed standard adjuvant therapy within 3 months without bleeding potential (e.g.,
             platelet count ≥ 100 000/mm3) or other contradictions to aspirin will be eligible for
             this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients allergic to aspirin, receiving previous (within 3 months before surgery) or
             ongoing treatment with aspirin, other anti-platelet or anticoagulation agent, other
             Cox inhibitors, glucocorticoid, or drugs severely interfering with aspirin, with
             peptic ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
             disease), asthma, ischemic heart disease (IHD), class III/IV heart failure (as defined
             by the New York Heart Association), stroke, thrombotic event, peripheral vascular
             disease, uncontrolled hypertension, gout or severe liver or renal dysfunction, having
             undergone coronary artery bypass grafting within 3 months will be excluded from this
             trial. Other exclusion criteria are: colorectal non-malignant diseases (e.g., familial
             adenomatous polyposis, and adenoma); recurrent CRC; previous colorectal resection;
             malignancies other than CRC (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) within 5 years before
             intake initiation; pregnancy or nursing; immunosuppressive therapy within 6 months;
             and enrollment in other CRC clinical trials.
