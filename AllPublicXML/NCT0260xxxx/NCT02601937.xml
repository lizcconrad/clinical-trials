    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study with a BID oral dose
      of tazemetostat. Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 14 days of the planned
      first dose of tazemetostat. A treatment cycle will be 28 days. Response assessment will be
      evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment and subsequently every 8 weeks while on study.
