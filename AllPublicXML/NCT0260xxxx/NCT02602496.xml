  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of increased intake of fruits and vegetables and whole grains
      on markers of inflammation and gut microbial composition. The treatment groups are 3 servings
      of whole grain per day; 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day; a combined 3 servings of
      whole grain per day and 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day; and a control (3
      servings of refined grains per day provided).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature data suggests that fruits and vegetables and whole grains containing dietary fiber
      and other nutrients are important for maintaining beneficial microbes in the gut. The
      presence of beneficial microbes in the gut may mediate the subclinical inflammation
      experienced in metabolic disease. In this project, overweight or obese participants with low
      intakes of fruits and vegetables or whole grains will increase their intake of these foods to
      recommended levels. Changes in markers of inflammation and gut microbiota composition will be
      determined to assess and compare the potential impact of these foods on metabolic disease.
