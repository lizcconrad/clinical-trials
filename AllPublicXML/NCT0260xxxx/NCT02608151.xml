  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature birth deprives infants of sensory stimulation. Tactile stimulation such as massage
      pressure with kinesthetic movement significantly increases the weight, bone density and
      shorten the duration of stay of premature babies who benefits.

      Studies using vegetable oils show an increase in the effect on weight gain by cutaneous
      absorption. The mechanism is probably vagal (stimulation of baroreceptors and skin
      mechanoreceptors) since it is found in children stimulated an increase in the vagal activity,
      acceleration of gastric emptying and an increase in the secretion of insulin and IGF1.

      Few studies have evaluated the effects of massage on the medium-term neurological development
      in preterm infants and the effect of the essential oils in the effectiveness of touching the
      short and medium term massage.

      The aim of the investigators study is to evaluate the neurological development in the short
      and medium term in premature newborns and biological effects of massage with essential use of
      vegetable oil.

      Methodology and possible collaborations This is a monocentric, randomized, controlled, in a
      neonatal intensive care unit. It concerns 60 children born between 26 and 30 weeks of
      amenorrhea. Each child receives massage randomized with or without oil ISIO 4. The treatment
      is administered 10 minutes twice a day for 10 consecutive days watching for signs of
      intolerance. The quality of the spontaneous motility between 12 and 20 weeks of age corrected
      is used as the first neurological assessment criterion.

      The questionnaire (ASQ) Bricker and Squires (translated into French by Martha Bonin et al.)
      is used to 6, 12, 24 months corrected age and completed by the parents as a second
      neurological endpoint.

      A lipid chromatography is performed at the beginning and at the end of the massage time and
      at the deliverance from NICU for comparing the profile of children's fatty acids.

      Expected results Show that there is an improvement in the neurological development in
      children who received massage with vegetable oil ISIO 4. Show that there is a skin absorption
      of essential fatty acids that can substitute for a known major deficiency in premature even
      in infants fed breast milk.

    <description>The primary outcome is represented by the assessment of neuro-development of children from 3 months of age corrected more precisely between 12 and 20 weeks post-term. The evaluation of neuro-development will be realized from measurement of the quality of spontaneous general movement. The motor repertoire was evaluated using the video-recording made between 11 to 16 weeks post-term, following Prechtl's method for the assessment of the motor repertoire between 3 and 5 months. Scores were assigned to the following five aspects: Quality of FMs, Age-adequacy of concurrent movements, Presence and normality of concurrent movements, Presence and normality of postural patterns and Quality of concurrent movements. Scores for each aspect can range from 1 to 4. The scores for the five aspects of the motor repertoire are summed to provide a Motor Optimality Score, range 5 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher movement quality.</description>

    <description>The evaluation of neuro-development between 12 and 20 weeks post term from motor score will be complemented by an assessment using the questionnaire &quot;Ages and Stages Questionnaire&quot; (ASQ) at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The ASQ [Bricker and Squires 2000] questionnaire is a child developmental delay screening tool, thus identifying children in need of a thorough assessment of their development.</description>
