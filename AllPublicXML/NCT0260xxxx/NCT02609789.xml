    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-55920839 following
      single ascending intravenous (IV) dose administration in healthy participants and a single
      subcutaneous dose in healthy participants and multiple IV dose administrations in
      participants with mild to moderate Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of JNJ-55920839. The
      study consists of Screening Period of 28 days. The healthy participants will have a
      6-day/5-night inpatient period. All Participants will receive study agent on Day 1 and SLE
      Participants will receive additional doses on Days 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71. The total duration
      of participation for each participant will be approximately 13 weeks for healthy
      participants, 22 weeks for participants with SLE. All eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive active agent or placebo. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part
      1, single ascending doses of JNJ55920839 or placebo will be administered to sequential
      cohorts of healthy participants as an IV infusion or as a subcutaneous injection. In Part 2,
      multiple doses of JNJ-55920839 or placebo will be administered as IV infusions to
      participants with SLE. Blood samples will be collected for assessment of pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamics parameters in both part 1 and 2, along with assessment of safety and
      clinical outcomes. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
