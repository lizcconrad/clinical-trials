    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the COMFORT (C-Communication, O-Orientation and
      opportunity, M-Mindful presence, F-Family, O-Openings, R-Relating, and T-Team) caregiver
      intervention in improving communication and reducing distress in caregivers of patients with
      lung cancer. Caregivers of patients with cancer may experience stress and anxiety due to
      difficulty communicating with family, friends, and healthcare providers, or feeling unable to
      communicate openly. A communication intervention that improves the caregiver's ability to
      communicate with patients and healthcare providers may help reduce caregivers' psychological
      distress and improve the health outcomes of patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of the COMFORT Caregiver Intervention (CCI) for family
      caregivers.

      II. To explore common family caregiver communication concerns in oncology and their impact.

      III. Estimate the effects of the CCI on family caregivers' psychological distress (primary
      outcome) and caregiver confidence with communication (secondary outcome).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive the printed communication tool &quot;A Communication Guide for Caregivers,&quot; a
      guide developed from the COMFORT communication curriculum, a national training program for
      palliative care communication. After a 1 week period to review the material, participants
      undergo communication coaching with a research nurse by phone over approximately 1 hour.

      After completion of the study, caregivers are followed up at 1 month to complete
      questionnaires and rate their satisfaction with the intervention.

    <description>Qualitative review of recruitment procedures and evaluation of research nurse feedback about intervention calls will be conducted. Content analysis will be conducted on the transcribed qualitative data. A qualitative summary of themes derived from study documents will be used. The intervention will be refined based on study results, and improvements made for it to be suited to a larger randomized, controlled trial.</description>
