  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paralympians competing in wheelchair sports may experience a very high glycolytic demand (and
      therefore acidotic environment) in their upper-body muscles, particularly in high-intensity
      disciplines. Previous studies from our group have shown that upper-body exercise is very
      sensitive to the ergogenic effects of β-alanine supplementation and to other nutritional
      supplements capable of increasing buffering capacity. In line with this, have shown that
      upper-body muscle groups benefit more from artificially induced alkalosis than lower-body
      muscle groups. Although β-alanine appears to be an interesting and potential ergogenic
      supplement for paralympians, no study to date has assessed its potential in wheelchair
      athletes.In this study, we will evaluate the effects of β-alanine supplementation on
      upper-body performance in wheelchair athletes.
