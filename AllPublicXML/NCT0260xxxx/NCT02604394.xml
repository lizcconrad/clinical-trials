      Coronary obstruction by an occlusive thrombus complicating a ruptured or eroded
      atherosclerotic plaque is the most frequent pathologic substrate of acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) , , . Timely restoration of perfusion and thereby myocardial salvage is the
      single most important objective in the management of patients with ST segment-elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI).

      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now the preferred treatment for STEMI
      patients and is effective in opening the infarct-related artery (IRA) and restoring
      Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) III flow in more than 95% of patients , , .
      However the presence of a large thrombus burden increase the incidence of adverse outcomes
      including persistent or transient no-reflow and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events
      (MACEs), possibly due to distal atherothrombotic embolization, with ensuing disruption of the
      microvascular network and failure of myocardial reperfusion . The microvascular obstruction
      occurs in 10% of STEMI patients with a patent epicardial vessel after primary PCI , , . It is
      associated with an increased infarct size, reduced recovery of ventricular function, and
      increased mortality , , , , , , .

      Removal of thrombi from the IRA during primary PCI may prevent distal embolization and
      improve myocardial perfusion and thus long term clinical outcomes. However studies conducted
      to date provide mixed results , , , , , .The two largest randomized trials to date comparing
      manual thrombus aspiration (MTA) followed by PCI to PCI only are the Thrombus Aspiration
      during PCI in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TASTE) study , and Thrombus Aspiration during
      Percutaneous coronary intervention in Acute myocardial infarction (TAPAS) study , . They
      further illustrate the existing uncertainties.

      TAPAS study showed improvement of the myocardial blush grade (primary endpoint) and reduction
      of cardiac mortality at one year follow up in patients of the MTA group compared to those in
      the conventional-PCI group. However, it is important to note that TAPAS was not powered to
      detect differences in clinical outcome. TASTE study showed no mortality benefit of MTA at one
      year follow up. These results concluded that routine use of thrombus aspiration is not
      supported by current evidence however, selective use may improve tissue perfusion in some
      patients .Accordingly MTA is currently a class IIb recommendation in the European Society of
      Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for myocardial revascularization in STEMI patients , and a class
      IIa recommendation in the 2013 ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines . The latter was released before the
      results of TASTE were published.

      MTA is ineffective in â‰ˆ30% of patients. Furthermore, residual thrombi after MTA are present
      in virtually all patients when studied by optical coherence tomography (OCT).27, . The
      currently existing alternative technique for removal of intracoronary thrombi is the
      Rheolytic Thrombectomy (RT) by Angiojet device. RT is a catheter-based system that utilizes
      multiple high-velocity, high-pressure saline jets introduced through orifices in the distal
      tip of the catheter to create a localized low-pressure zone (Venturi-Bernoulli effect),
      resulting in a vacuum effect with the entrainment and dissociation of bulky thrombi. The jets
      break down thrombi into small particles and propel them proximally through the exhaust lumen,
      leading to the aspiration and removal of thrombotic debris without embolization.

      The two largest randomized trials to date studying the benefits of RT in patients presenting
      with acute STEMI are (JETSTENT) Study and (AIMI) study.

      In the JETSTENT study8, ST-segment resolution was more frequently achieved in the RT arm.
      There were fewer MACEs (death, MI, target vessel revascularization, and stroke) in the RT arm
      at 12 months (p=0.036). Infarct size at one month did not differ between both arms. However,
      results of JETSTENT need to be interpreted with caution; in the strict statistical sense, it
      was a negative trial. Studies with a co-primary endpoint require a p value of 0.05 for both
      endpoints or 0.025 for a single endpoint. This was not achieved in JETSTENT. However,
      multivariable analysis showed that the use of rheolytic thrombectomy was independently
      associated with improved clinical outcomes at one year - acknowledging that that latter was
      not one of the primary endpoints.

      On the other hand, in the AIMI 24 , the final infarct size was higher in the adjunct RT group
      compared to PCI only group. Final TIMI III flow was lower in the adjunct RT group. Thirty-day
      MACEs were higher in the adjunct RT group, a difference primarily driven by very low
      mortality rates in patients treated with PCI only. There were no significant differences in
      TIMI blush grade or ST-segment resolution between both groups. However, there are several
      limitations to AIMI; a) the study did not require angiographic evidence of thrombus, and in
      fact, excluded patients with very large thrombus burden, b) a retrograde technique - which
      involves crossing the lesion before activation of the device - was used in the majority of
      patients in the RT group, c) the time delay between admission and use of RT (door-to-device)
      was very long, d) compared to the RT group, more patients in the PCI-only group had baseline
      TIMI III flow (44% vs. 63%, p= 0.05). Collectively, these factors might have overshadowed any
      potential benefit of RT in AIMI.

      In another study, Parodi et al 31, compared MTA to RT in patients with acute STEMI using
      residual thrombus burden (assessed by OCT) as the primary endpoint. The study did not meet
      the primary end point; the number of OCT quadrants containing residual thrombus .However,
      angiographic thrombus grade decreased significantly after RT, and all markers of reperfusion
      (secondary endpoints) were better in the RT arm. There was a trend toward higher rate of
      early ST-segment elevation resolution in the RT arm as compared with the MTA arm. These
      findings suggest that RT may be more effective than MTA but to a lesser degree than
      hypothesized by the investigators. Furthermore, calculation of thrombus volume by OCT is
      extremely challenging given the inability to accurately define the border between disrupted
      atherosclerotic plaques and superimposed thrombi, which is further blurred by the optical
      shadowing of red thrombus.

      To address these uncertainties, our study aims to evaluate the role of RT in patients who are
      most likely to benefit from it (thrombus grade 4 and 5) using a sensitive, quantitative, and
      reproducible parameter; CMR-derived myocardial salvage. CMR Cardiac MRI can provide a wide
      range of information such as myocardial edema (myocardium at risk), microvascular obstruction
      (MVO), location and &quot;transmurality&quot; of necrosis, as well as quantification of infarct size .
      Moreover, CMR provides accurate and reproducible measurements of ventricular volumes and
      function. For these reasons, cardiac MRI is currently perceived as the ideal tool for
      evaluation of global post-infarction remodeling.

      Myocardial edema in the acute phase of myocardial infarction can be visualized as a bright
      signal on T2-weighted images, defining 'myocardium at risk .The major advantages of this
      technique are distinguishing chronic from acute infarction, and quantifying the proportion of
      myocardial salvage assessed retrospectively by comparing T2-weighted edematous (at risk) size
      and late gadolimium enhancement (LGE) images (scar). LGE images are T1-weighted inversion
      recovery sequences acquired about 10 min after intravenous administration of gadolinium and
      the inversion time is chosen to null myocardial signal using 'inversion time scout' or 'look
      locker' sequences .

      Delayed post-contrast sequences are currently used also to evaluate persistent microvascular
      dysfunction/damage: in the context of white LGE regions (infarcted myocardium) dark
      hypoenhanced areas may coexist, traditionally referred to as microvascular obstruction.
      Microvascular obstruction has been initially defined as hypo enhancement at 1-2 min after
      gadolinium injection; the final infarct size depends mainly on the extent of the so-called
      'risk area', defined as the myocardial area related to an occluded coronary artery with
      complete absence of blood flow, either antegrade or collateral .

      These novel CMR-derived parameters have emerged as potential indices of adverse remodeling,
      with the most attractive being myocardial salvage. Myocardial salvage is a prognostically
      validated therapeutic target in primary PCI , , , , with myocardial salvage index being a
      strong predictor of major cardiac events and mortality at 6-month . Myocardial salvage is
      defined as the difference between the initial jeopardized area at risk (determined by
      T2-weighted MRI) at baseline and final infarct size (determined by contrast-enhanced MRI).
      The myocardial salvage index is defined as final infarct size indexed to the initial area at
      risk , , .

      Objectives of the study:

        1. To determine whether Rheolytic Thrombectomy (RT) before conventional PCI to the culprit
           vessel as compared to conventional PCI (with or without MTA) results in improved
           myocardial salvage.

        2. To identify clinical and angiographic determinants of any difference observed between
           both treatment groups.
