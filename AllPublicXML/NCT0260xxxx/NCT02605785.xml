    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be over 40 years of age.

          -  Must have an informant or study partner that can provide independent information of
             functioning.

          -  Must meet criteria for possible or probable Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. To fulfill
             criteria for possible PSP, subjects must have a gradually progressive disorder with
             either vertical (upward or downward) supranuclear palsy or both slowing of vertical
             saccades and prominent postural instability with falls in the first year of disease
             onset. To fulfill criteria for probable PSP, subjects must have vertical (upward or
             downward gaze) supranuclear palsy and prominent postural instability with falls in the
             first year of disease onset.

          -  Must have symptoms for &lt;4 years.

          -  Must be able to ambulate independently.

          -  Must have a PSP rating scale score of less than 40 and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment
             score of greater than 20.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they meet criteria for another neurodegenerative disease
             (including corticobasal syndrome, frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive
             aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease) or do
             not have the symptoms necessary to fulfill inclusion criteria for possible PSP.

          -  Subjects with concurrent illnesses that could account for their symptoms, such as
             traumatic brain injury, encephalitis, strokes or developmental syndromes will be
             excluded.

          -  Women that are pregnant or post-partum and breast-feeding will be excluded.

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are unable to undergo the tau-PET
             scan due to a prolonged QT interval on ECG, or if they have any of the following
             genetic conditions which can increase the chance of cancer: Cowden disease, Lynch
             syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and Down's syndrome.

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if MRI is contraindicated (metal in head, cardiac pace
             maker, e.t.c.), if there is severe claustrophobia, if there are conditions that may
             confound brain imaging studies (e.g. structural abnormalities, including subdural
             hematoma, intracranial neoplasm or large cortical infarcts), or if they are medically
             unstable or are on medications that might affect brain structure or metabolism (e.g.
             chemotherapy).

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they do not have an informant, or do not consent to
             research.
