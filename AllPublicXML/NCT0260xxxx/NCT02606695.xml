  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comprehensive approach to the evaluation of alignment in spinal surgery patients - through
      preoperative planning, intraoperative assessment, and postoperative confirmation - has not
      been well-studied. This study aims to assess the value of such planning through clinical and
      radiographic outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative planning using tools such as NuvaMapTM (NuVasive®, Inc., San Diego, CA) enable a
      surgeon to preoperatively evaluate these alignment parameters and simulate a patient-specific
      plan using a combination of procedures, techniques, and implants. Once in the operating room,
      realignment objectives can be verified from a lateral fluoroscopic image in real-time using
      NuvaMap O.R. (NuVasive, Inc.), a software application integrated with the NVM5®
      neuromonitoring platform (NuVasive, Inc.). This real-time verification allows for
      confirmation and subsequent changing of the plan as necessary. The objective of this study is
      to validate the utility and effectiveness of comprehensive surgical planning in restoring and
      preserving sagittal alignment through the collection of clinical and radiographic outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients who are at least 18 years of age;

          2. Patients with planned thoracolumbar (any number of levels between T1 and the pelvis)
             spine fusion surgery and available preoperative standing lateral radiographs,
             inclusive of the femoral head axis;

          3. Able to undergo surgery based on physical exam, medical history and surgeon judgment;

          4. Patients who understand the conditions of enrollment and are willing to sign an

             study requirements;

          2. Patient is a prisoner;

          3. Patient is participating in another clinical study that would confound study data.
