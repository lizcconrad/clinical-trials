  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study focuses on needle guidance in rheumatologic operations - glucocorticoid injections
      inside joint capsules specifically. The main purpose of the study is to assess and validate
      the clinical feasibility and performance of Bioimpedance Probe (BIP) Needles and assess the
      benefits, drawbacks and risks related to use of the BIP Needles.

    <measure>True Positive Detection of Synovial Fluid Marked in Case Report Form</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-articular injection</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement device indicates with a sound and visual feedback when needle is in contact with synovial fluid. Physician verifies the location with ultrasound imaging, aspiration of synovial fluid and/or lack of resistance in glucocorticoid injection. Even if the device does not detect the synovial fluid, physician performs the injection when needed. Physician marks to the case report form whether the device provided detections during the puncture and were the detections true or false detections.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients having an inflammatory rheumatic disease requiring an intra-articular
             glucocorticoid injection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria are the same as generally for intra-articular glucocorticoid
             injections (e.g. bacterial infection or recent surgical operation relating the joint).

          -  In addition for not giving (or not capable to give) the consent personally for any
             reason is an absolute exclusion criterion.

          -  In addition pregnant women are excluded
