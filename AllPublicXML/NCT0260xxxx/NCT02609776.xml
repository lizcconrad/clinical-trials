      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics, establish a
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimens, and to assess the preliminary efficacy of
      JNJ-61186372 in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This open label (all participants know the identity of the study drug), multicenter (more
      than one study site), first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation
      and Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort. In Part 1, participants with evaluable non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) will be enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of JNJ-61186372,
      which will be administered in 28 day treatment cycles. The dose will be escalated until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD, or maximum administered dose [MAD], if no MTD is found) is
      reached. Part 1 will follow a traditional 3+3 design. At each dose level, 3 participants will
      complete Cycle 1. If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in these 3 participants, then
      escalation will continue in a new cohort of 3 participants. Data from Part 1 will be used to
      determine one or more recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen(s). In Part 2, participants
      with documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and measurable disease,
      whose disease has progressed after previous treatment will be enrolled and receive
      JNJ-61186372 at the RP2D determined in Part 1. For both parts, the study consists of 3
      periods: a Screening period (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug); a
      Treatment period (first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug);
      and a Follow Up period (approximately 6 months). All participants will be followed for
      survival in the post-treatment follow-up period until the end of study and safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung
             cancer (NSCLC) that is metastatic or unresectable. Participants must have either
             progressed after receiving prior therapy for metastatic disease, or be ineligible for,
             or have refused all other currently available therapeutic options

          -  For Part 2 only: Participants must also have disease with a previously diagnosed
             activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (includes both inhibitor
             sensitive primary mutations such as Exon 19 deletion and L858R, as well as marketed
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI] -resistant mutations such as Exon 20 insertion).
             Documentation of EGFR mutation eligibility by CLIA-certified laboratory (or
             equivalent) testing is required

          -  For Part 1: Participant must have evaluable disease. For Part 2: Participant must have
             measurable disease according to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

          -  For Part 2: Cohort A and B: Participants disease must have most recently progressed
             following treatment with a marketed EGFR inhibitor. Exception: In participants
             diagnosed with mutations associated with de novo EGFR inhibitor resistance (for
             example, exon 20 insertions), only previous treatment with combination platinum-based
             chemotherapy is required. Cohort C: Participants must have been previously treated
             with a third generation EGFR TKI (eg, osimertinib). Cohort D: Participants must have
             been previously diagnosed with an EGFR Exon 20 insertion

          -  Participant must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0
             or 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has uncontrolled inter-current illness, including but not limited to
             poorly controlled hypertension, other cardiovascular disease, or diabetes, ongoing or
             active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance
             with study requirements or confound study results

          -  Participant has had prior chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapy, immunotherapy, or
             treatment with an investigational anticancer agent within 2 weeks or 4 half-lives
             whichever is longer, before the first administration of JNJ-61186372. For agents with
             long half-lives, the maximum required time since last dose is 4 weeks. Toxicities from
             previous anticancer therapies should have resolved to baseline levels or to Grade 1 or
             less, (except for alopecia [any grade] and Grade less than or equal to [=&lt;] 2
             peripheral neuropathy). For Part 2 only: Cohorts A and B: Prior treatment with
             chemotherapy for metastatic disease is not allowed unless the tumor mutation carries
             de-novo resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (eg, exon 20 insertions).
             Cohort C: Prior treatment with more than 2 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for
             metastatic disease (maintenance therapy is not included). Cohort D: Previous treatment
             with an investigational third generation EGFR TKI with activity against EGFR Exon 20
             insertions (such as poziotinib)

          -  Participants with untreated brain metastases. Participants with treated metastases
             that are clinically stable and asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks and who are off or
             receiving low-dose corticosteroid treatment (=&lt;10 mg prednisone or equivalent) for at
             least 2 weeks prior to study treatment are eligible

          -  Participant has a history of malignancy other than the disease under study within 3
             years before Screening (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin
             and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the
             investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured
             with or minimal risk of recurrence within a year from screening)

          -  Participant has not fully recovered from major surgery or significant traumatic injury
             prior the first dose of study drug or expects to have major surgery during the study
             period or within 6 months after the last dose of study drug
