      Study CV-0002 is the first clinical trial administering CV-MG01 in humans. This clinical
      trial is a safety and proof-of-concept study (proof of mechanism of action) intended to
      assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenic response following 3 subcutaneous injections
      of CV-MG01 as a potential therapeutic vaccine / active immunotherapy in myasthenia gravis
      (MG) patients.

      Part A of the trial has been designed as a human safety pharmacology and therapeutic
      exploratory, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled, single centre, Investigator and
      subject-blind study using adaptive dose and sample size approaches.

      At the end of part A of the present study, all patients, including those receiving placebo,
      will be monitored in an open label, long-term safety follow-up part B of the study to assess
      the treatment effects over time.
