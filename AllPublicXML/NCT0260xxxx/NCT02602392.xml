  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of
      cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for
      children, and better asthma management skills for their parents. This could result in eased
      suffering and improved quality of life for millions of children and their families, and also
      reduce the economic burden borne by society in the forms of medical expenditures and lost
      productivity.

      This proposal will create an interactive multimedia (IMM) program designed to support the
      self-management efforts of asthmatic children aged 5-10 years and their families. This
      behavior change program will be designed to promote self-management by (a) increasing child
      and caregiver knowledge about asthma, (b) encouraging compliance with medication protocols
      and environmental controls, and (c) increasing self-efficacy to create and implement an
      Asthma Action Plan.

    <time_frame>45 days</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-item knowledge scale was developed with program-specific questions regarding asthma physiology, response to worsening symptoms, and asthma medications. These items used a 3-response choice scheme: &quot;true,&quot; &quot;not true,&quot; and &quot;I don't know.&quot; The total number of items correct was summed to form the knowledge scale.</description>

    <description>The Parent Knowledge Questionnaire (alpha = .81; Mesters, et al., 2003) was adapted to match program content, creating a 19-item knowledge scale covering basic knowledge about asthma (e.g., response to worsening symptoms, asthma medications, asthma triggers). The total number of correct items was summed to form the knowledge scale.</description>

    <description>The Asthma Attitude Survey (Mesters, et al., 2003), adapted to fit program content, assessed parents' attitudes regarding recognition of worsening symptoms, asthma medications, and triggers management. A 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) was used for responses, and items were summed to create an overall attitudes score.</description>

    <time_frame>45 days</time_frame>
    <description>Three self-efficacy items addressed each child's confidence in being able to recognize warning signs, use his/her quick-relief medicine immediately when having warning signs, and take medications as directed. Response choices were presented on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (no way, I can't do that) to 4 (sure, I can do that).</description>

    <description>The Parent Asthma Self-Efficacy survey (Bursch, et al., 2003), adapted to fit program content, used a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all sure) to 5 (completely sure) to assess parents' confidence about administering medications and responding to worsening symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Asthma Control Test</measure>
    <time_frame>45 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Child-Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) for children 4-11 years old (Nathan, et al., 2004) was used to assess the child's current level of asthma control. The C-ACT contains 7 itemsâ€”4 for the child's response and 3 for the parent's response, summed to create an asthma control score. Response choices for the children were presented on a 4-point Likert-type scale. The 3 parent items asked for frequency of symptoms over the past 4 weeks and were presented on a 6-point scale.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged 5-10 with physican-diagnosed asthma and who had been prescribed any type
             of asthma medication, and one of their parents or primary caregivers. Parents and
             children needed to have access to an internet- and video-capable computer, and the
             parent needed to have a valid e-mail address in order to receive study-related
             correspondence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Only English-speaking participants were accepted because the program was developed
             only for English speakers. Children less than 5 years of age and older than 10 were
             excluded because the program is developed targeted to the developmental abilities and
             interests of children aged 5-10. There were no exclusions based on race/ethnicity.
