      This is a two-part, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, two-period, one-sequence study to
      investigate the effect of itraconazole and rifampin on the PK of vemurafenib following
      multiple 960 milligrams (mg) twice daily (BID) dosing in adult participants with unresectable
      Stage IIIC or Stage IV metastatic melanoma positive for the BRAF V600 mutation, or other
      malignant tumor types that harbor a V600-activating mutation of BRAF where the participant
      has no acceptable standard treatment options.
