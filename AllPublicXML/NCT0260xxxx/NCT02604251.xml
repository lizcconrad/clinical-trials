    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, prospective, controlled study in patients having bilateral
      breast reduction. Objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the KLOX
      BioPhotonic WoundGel System compared with the ones of Silicone Sheets in the treatment of
      surgical wounds.
