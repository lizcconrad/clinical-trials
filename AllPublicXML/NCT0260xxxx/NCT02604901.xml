      The 4-arm factorial design RCT tested the impact of a behavioral intervention (SBI or BI), a
      reminder device (Pillbox), and the combination of the two on adherence in adult patients who
      filled a prescription for oral medications to treat diabetes or hyperlipidemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with chronic diseases often fail to follow their prescribed medication
      regimens, (16355071,19954264,16732693,23111664) which accounts for up to 290 billion dollars
      per year in unnecessary medical costs, largely because medication nonadherence increases
      their risk of disease progression, hospitalization, and premature death.(16355071, 23373139,
      23032359) A number of studies have investigated ways to improve medication adherence;
      (18425859, 18537843) however, few studies on interventions have demonstrated large
      improvements in adherence and few have used scientifically rigorous study methods such as
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs).(24422970) A recent systematic review identified a need
      for adherence interventions and suggested the use of factorial designs in RCTs to study
      multiple interventions and combinations within large patient populations.(24422970)

      This study used a factorial-designed, four-armed, RCT to examine the impact of three
      pharmacy-based interventions versus standard care on improving medication adherence and
      health outcomes in patients with diabetes and hyperlipidemia. The three interventions used in
      this study were a behavioral intervention, a pillbox weekly reminder, and the combination of
      the two.

      Pillboxes (PB) used in this study had compartments for each day (7X1) and for participants
      taking multiple medications, sub-compartments for each medication per day (7X4).

      The behavioral intervention, called Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI or BI), consisted
      of a short 2-5 minute conversation between the patient and the provider aimed to encourage
      modification in the patient's health behavior. While BI has primarily been used to address
      unhealthy alcohol use in patients (11), the researchers hypothesized that this
      patient-centered approach can be particularly useful for improving medication adherence in
      chronically ill patients. In this study, motivational interviewing counseling principles were
      used for motivating patients to take more active roles in self-managing their health.
      Motivational interviewing can take many forms, however, in this study, the BIs used a schema
      of motivational interviewing originally developed by the principal investigator titled
      POLAR*Sâ„¢ .

      The specific aims of this research study included testing the impact of three community
      pharmacy intervention for adult patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia on: (1) medication
      adherence; (2) biologic outcomes associated with medication adherence; (3) self-reported
      health and psychosocial status; and (4) pharmacists' impressions on how BI could be scalable
      to community pharmacy settings.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in medication adherence using the PDC metric, for adult patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and nine-months post-enrollment into the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence was measured as a Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) by calculating (at the patient level) the denominator as the number of days between the first fill of the medication during a measurement period and the end of the measurement period and the numerator is calculated as the number of days covered by prescription fill date and days of supply. For each patient, the PDC was calculated at baseline and 9-months. The baseline PDC was compared to that at 9-months.</description>

    <description>Triglyeride levels were measured for patients who had regular blood samples drawn, at baseline, 6-months, and 9-months, by their physician during the course of the study. The baseline measure was compared to that at 6- and 9-months.</description>
