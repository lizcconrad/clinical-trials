  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has 3 steps and not everyone will have all 3 steps done. The overall goals are to
      see if a new experimental drug is safe to image (step 1) and treat neuroendocrine tumors
      (step 2 and 3).

    <description>Pts get a PET/CT study with approx.150-200 MBq of 68Ga-DOTA-JR11. Lesions with focal radiotracer uptake not explained by physiologic sstr2 expression will be interpreted as metastatic disease. If 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 uptake by metastases with a diameter of more than 2 cm is less than the physiologic radiotracer uptake by the liver, no further imaging &amp; therapy will be performed as part of the study, as it is unlikely that pts with this low radiotracer uptake will benefit from PRRT (2). All other pts will undergo a dosimetric study with 1850 MBq (less than 100 μg peptide) of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11. Results of the dosimetry study, will determine the balance of activity of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 that can be administered without exceeding the radiation dose limits. This activity will be split into 2 equal amounts to be delivered in 2 cycles, approximately 3 months apart. After each therapy cycle, pts will be followed clinically for 3 months.</description>

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic and/or unresectable progressive,
             well differentiated carcinoid or pancreatic NET carcinoids

          -  Progressive metastatic disease defined by one of the following, occurring within 6
             months of study entry:

               -  At least a 20% increase in radiologically or clinically measurable disease

               -  Appearance of any new lesion

               -  Symptomatic disease (including worsening hormonal symptoms or symptoms related to
                  tumor burden)

          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.

          -  At least one metastasis must show uptake of 111In-DTPA-octreotide on SPECT that is
             higher than the physiologic radiotracer uptake by the liver

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%)

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3.0 x 109/L
