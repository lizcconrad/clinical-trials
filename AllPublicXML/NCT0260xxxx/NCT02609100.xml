  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical problem. When patients with
      gastrointestinal bleeding present with melena (dark, tarry stool) the blood loss is usually
      originating in the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach or duodenum) and first
      step in evaluating the patient is an upper endoscopy; which allows direct visualization of
      the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. However, the cause of bleeding is located in the small
      bowel or colon in 20-30% of patients who present with melena. Traditionally colonoscopy has
      been the next test preformed if upper endoscopy does not identify the cause of melena/
      gastrointestinal bleeding, however less than 25% of patients who present with melena have
      bleeding originating in the colon, and the remainder of patients have bleeding originating in
      the small intestine, which can only be fully evaluated with video capsule endoscopy (a pill
      camera which is swallowed and takes pictures while it travels thought the small bowel and
      colon). Currently patients only undergo video capsule endoscopy if colonoscopy does not
      identify the cause of bleeding. The investigators are preforming a randomized study which
      seeks to determine if colonoscopy or video capsule endoscopy is a better way to identify the
      cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who present with melena and have normal
      findings on upper endoscopy. To do this the investigators will enroll patients who present
      with melena prior to their upper endoscopy and if the cause of bleeding is not identified at
      that time patients will be randomized to video capsule endoscopy (with the capsule being
      placed into the small bowel during the upper endoscopy) or next day colonoscopy.

    <description>Randomization arm one is to video capsule endoscopy (VCE) a non-invasive gastrointestinal endoscopy procedure in which a patient swallows a disposable 1.0 X 2.5 cm 'pill' containing a camera electronically linked to equipment housed in a holster outside of the patient which records images as it passes from the esophagus through the entire tract and is excreted in the feces.
Indications Imaging the small intestine between the distant duodeno-jejunal 'junction,' which is beyond the reach of upper GI endoscopy and the terminal ileum and is similarly beyond the reach of colonoscopy. It is of greatest use in identifying points of bleeding and ulcers</description>
