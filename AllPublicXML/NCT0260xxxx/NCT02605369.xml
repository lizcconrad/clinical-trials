  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Universal coverage of good quality facility based care globally could prevent nearly 113,000
      maternal deaths, 531,000 stillbirths and 1.3 million neonatal deaths annually by 2020. Yet,
      only 57% of pregnant Ugandan women choose to deliver at health facilities. This unacceptably
      low coverage of facility based births could explain, in part, the high maternal and perinatal
      mortality estimates in Uganda. While multiple studies have examined factors associated with
      this low utilization of health services around the time of birth, there is inadequate
      implementation research exploring the best systematic methods that could promote uptake and
      scale up of facility based births. This study will therefore examine the effect of an
      intervention package (peer counselling by pregnancy buddies on facility based births, mobile
      phone messaging promoting facility based births and provision of mama-kits) on the frequency
      of facility based births and perinatal mortality. The study, a cluster randomized community
      based intervention trial in post-conflict Northern Uganda, will provide data crucial in
      framing national policy regarding measures to promote the use of health facilities.
