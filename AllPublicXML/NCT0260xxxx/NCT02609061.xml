  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was designed to evaluate the combined efficacy of PRF and 1% ALN in the
      treatment of mandibular degree II furcation defects when compared with PRF and open flap
      debridement (OFD) alone.

      Background: Various regenerative materials have been introduced and tested in the treatment
      of furcation defects. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a reservoir of growth factors and
      cytokines which are the key factors for regeneration of bone and maturation of the soft
      tissue. Alendronate (ALN), a potent member of bisphosphonate group is known to promote tissue
      regeneration by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption and promoting osteoblastogenesis. The
      present study was designed to evaluate the combined efficacy of PRF and 1% ALN in the
      treatment of mandibular degree II furcation defects when compared with PRF and open flap
      debridement (OFD) alone.

      Methods: Seventy two mandibular furcation defects were treated with either OFD alone (Group
      1), OFD with PRF (Group 2), and OFD with PRF+1% ALN (Group 3). Clinical parameters; site
      specific plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD),
      relative vertical attachment level (RVAL) and relative horizontal attachment level (RHAL),
      intrabony defect depth (IBD) were recorded at baseline before surgery and 9 months
      post-operatively. Percentage radiographic defect fill was evaluated at baseline and 9 months.
