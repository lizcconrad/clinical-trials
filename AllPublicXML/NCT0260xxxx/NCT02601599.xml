  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Smoking counselling during hospitalisation with post-discharge follow-up
      increases quitting. However, provision of cessation care for hospitalised patients is
      suboptimal. Students are potentially an untapped resource for providing cessation advice, but
      no studies have investigated this.

      Aim: To determine if medical students can encourage motivation to stop smoking (MTSS; primary
      outcome) in hospitalised smokers .

      Design: 2-arm RCT Setting: RCSI (www.rcsi.ie) and Connolly Hospital
      (www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/hospitals/Connolly/).

      Participants: Inpatient smokers. Intervention and procedures: 60 graduate medical students
      will receive standardised motivational interviewing training in the provision of cessation
      advice. Each student will be randomly assigned to counsel ~1-3 smokers each, including an
      individual in-hospital, face-to-face session and post-discharge phone counselling. Training
      and implementation will cover Sept-2015-May-2016. Smokers will be randomised to 'usual care'
      (n~90), or intervention (n~90, student-delivered motivational interviewing). A researcher
      will enable recruitment and follow-up, and conduct a qualitative evaluation of programme
      participants.

    <description>Motivational interviewing The medical student will deliver a 15 minute consultation with the patient. The goals of this consultation will be to enhance the patient's motivation and self-efficacy regarding quitting, educate the patient about effective behavioral and pharmacological cessation strategies, and collaboratively elicit a plan to stay quit after discharge. Patients will be offered the opportunity to receive a consultation from the attending physician to determine eligibility for pharmacotherapy. Patients who elect to receive this consult with have a coloured sticker placed by the medical student on the medical chart requesting a consultation.</description>

    <description>The medical student will deliver a brief (approximately 15 minute) consultation with the patient that is based on principles of social cognitive theory and motivational interviewing. The goals of this consultation will be to enhance the patient's motivation and self-efficacy regarding quitting, and collaboratively elicit a plan to stay quit after discharge. Patients will be offered the opportunity to receive a consultation from the attending physician to determine eligibility for pharmacotherapy (via a chart sticker).
Each student will counsel 1-3 smokers each over the 8-month academic period, with student training and intervention staggered over this time. Students will also re-contact the smoker at 1-week post-discharge via telephone or personal follow-up, to provide further support.</description>
