  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis of celecoxib in combination with established drugs used to treat tuberculosis
      (TB). Pharmacokinetics (PK) and whole blood bactericidal activity (WBA) will be measured in
      healthy volunteers following administration of the study drugs alone and in combination.

    <textblock>
      The whole blood bactericidal activity (WBA) assay is an ex vivo model for measuring the
      combined effects of administered drugs, host factors and strain factors on mycobacterial
      sterilisation. If performed in parallel with PK measurements, the method can be used to
      evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing cycle. Celecoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor with
      immuno-modulatory properties important in the host defence against tuberculosis (TB). The aim
      of this trial is to investigate the effect on WBA of manipulation of the host response to TB
      using celecoxib, in combination with established TB drugs.
