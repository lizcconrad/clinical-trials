  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This aim of this study is to investigate the prebiotic potential of date fruits in healthy
      human volunteers compared to a control diet. Each arm was 21 days in duration, separated by a
      14 days washout period. Faecal samples, and blood samples will be collected from each
      volunteer and high resolution analytical techniques (HPLC, LC-MS and NMR) will be employed to
      characterise the whole system metabolic response to ingestion of date fruits compared to the
      control. Changes in microbial parameters and metabolite profiles will be correlated with
      changes in biomarkers of chronic disease, including faecal water genotoxicity, cellular
      reactions, blood lipids and bowel movements.

      This aim of this study is to investigate the prebiotic potential of date fruit consumption in
      healthy human volunteers compared to a diet which does not contain dates; control
      (maltodextrin-dextrose, 40.2g) or intervention treatment 7 date fruits (50g) to 22 healthy
      human volunteers. Each arm was 21 days in duration, separated by a 14 days washout period.
      Thus, we will also address fundamental questions about the relationship between fermentation
      of non digestible carbohydrates, the gut microbiota and the changes in faecal short chain
      fatty acids (SCFA profiles), ammonia and bile acids. To this end faecal samples, and blood
      samples will be collected from each volunteer and high resolution analytical techniques (High
      Performance Liquid Chromatography; Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear
      Magnetic Resonance) will be employed to characterise the whole system metabolic response to
      ingestion of date fruits compared to the control. Changes in microbial parameters and
      metabolite profiles will be correlated with changes in biomarkers of chronic disease,
      including faecal water genotoxicity, cellular reactions, blood lipids and bowel movements.
