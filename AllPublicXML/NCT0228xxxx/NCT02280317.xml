        The study will enrol patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. The
        MTD/MAD may also be evaluated in patients with other advanced tumour types for whom no
        standard effective therapy is available and a rationale for use of VAL201 exists.

        The average timeframe is 18-26 weeks per subject and the outcome measured is a composite
        average for each group.

          -  Inclusion criteria:

               -  Specific Inclusion Criteria for Patients with Prostate Cancer

               -  Patients with incurable, locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer where a
                  policy of intermittent hormone therapy has been decided. Who have specific
                  clinical parameters.

          -  Specific Inclusion Criteria for Patients with Other Advanced Solid Tumours

               -  Patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumour
                  for whom no standard effective therapy is available and a rationale for use of
                  VAL201 exists.

               -  Patients with incurable, locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer where a
                  policy of intermittent hormone therapy has been decided. These patients must also
                  have the following:

                    1. Rising PSA on three samples (once non-castrate levels established); each
                       over 2 weeks apart, with the last two values being greater than 2 ng/mL.
                       Higher than and at least 25% over the nadir.

                    2. Absent or very mild prostate cancer-related symptoms.

                    3. No plans for any therapy for prostate cancer in the next two months.

               -  General Inclusion Criteria for all Patients

               -  Adult patients defined by age greater than 18 years at time of consent.

               -  Ability to give written, informed consent prior to any study-specific Screening
                  procedures, with the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the
                  patient at any time without prejudice.

               -  Patient is capable of understanding the protocol requirements, is willing and
                  able to comply with the study protocol procedures, and has signed the informed
                  consent document.

               -  Evaluable disease, either measurable on imaging, or with informative tumour
                  marker(s) and a set of specific biochemical and haematological parameters
                  relating to the specific cancer.

               -  Negative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test in women of childbearing
                  potential.

               -  Sexually active male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to
                  use an effective method of birth control. Female patients may be surgically
                  sterile.

                    -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN);

                    -  AST (SGOT) ≤2.5 times the ULN;

                    -  ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 times the ULN; ≤5 x ULN for patients with advanced solid
                       tumours with liver metastases.

                    -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of
                       &gt;50 mL/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

          -  Exclusion criteria

               -  Specific Exclusion Criteria for Patients with Prostate Cancer Patients has
