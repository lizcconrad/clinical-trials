      Do differences in endometrial gene expression exist after different protocols of endometrial
      preparation for embryo transfer? The recent apparition of endometrial receptive arrays
      technology let us know if endometrial is receptive or not in patients with some problems of
      infertility as implantation failure, for that we want to know if this technology would tell
      us if the different kind of protocols for endometrial preparation origin differences that
      could explain some of the founded results.

      Do differences in endometrial gene expression exist after different protocols of endometrial
      preparation for embryo transfer? The clinical results in different publications showed
      different results, some of them described the natural cycle superior as the substituted
      cycles, and in contrast other large series showed superior results in substituted cycles than
      natural but with an increased of pregnancies losses. The recent apparition of endometrial
      receptive arrays technology let us know if endometrial is receptive or not in patients with
      some problems of infertility as implantation failure, for that we want to know if this
      technology would tell us if the different kind of protocols for endometrial preparation
      origin differences that could explain some of the founded results.

    <description>Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Life Technologies). Approximately 1-2 mg of total RNA was obtained per milligram of endometrial tissue. The RNA quality was assessed by loading 300 ng of total RNA onto an RNA LabChip and was analyzed in an A2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Only samples with a RNA integrity number &gt;7 were selected for microarray analysis.
Sample preparation and hybridization was adapted from the Agilent technical manual. Hybridized microarrays were scanned in an Axon 4100A scanner (Molecular Devices), and the data were extracted with the GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). The ERA microarray validation has been previously published. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for four selected up-regulated genes: GPX3, FXYD2, SPP1, and MT1G.
The ERA gene expression values were preprocessed, normalized, and statistically analyzed. Briefly, the half background</description>
