  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to compare
      Botulinum Toxin Type A for Injection (HengLi®) with placebo on the efficacy and safety of
      treatment in post-stroke subjects with focal wrist, finger and in some cases, thumb
      spasticity. Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled. The core period of the subjects will
      receive a single treatment session of intramuscular HengLi® 200U or 240U (if thumb spasticity
      is present) or placebo in a randomization ratio of 2:1. Research contains two parts: core
      phase and extension phase. In the core phase, subjects will finish 6 visits (12 weeks ) after
      initial injection. During the extension phase, subjects will accept two follow-up visit (6
      weeks). Outcome measures include changes from baseline at every post injection visit as
      measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) and Global
      Assessment Scale(GAS). The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline at week 6
      for wrist flexor muscle tone as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale. Safety parameters
      will also be measured including adverse events, vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) and
      clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry and urinanalysis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to prove the efficacy of treatment administration with Botulinum Toxin
      Type A for Injection (HengLi®) beyond placebo in subjects with post-stroke upper limb
      spasticity of both wrist and fingers flexors as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS).

      Subjects will receive a single treatment session of intramuscular HengLi® 200U or 240U (if
      thumb spasticity is present) or placebo after they first enroll the core phase randomly.
      Totally 180 subjects will be recruited in this part. Each completed subject should finish 8
      (visit 0 to 7) clinic visits. Subjects will receive a single intramuscular treatment with
      either HengLi® or placebo at day 0 (visit 0). The else 7 visits are at week 1, 4, 6, 8, 12,
      16 and 18 (visits 1 to 7) and week 6 (visit 3) is appointed as the primary visit to determine
      efficacy.

      The primary endpoint is the change from baseline at week 6 for wrist flexor muscle tone as
      measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The secondary endpoints involve the area under
      curve (AUC) for the MAS wrist score change from baseline, change from baseline for
      wrist/finger/thumb flexor muscle tone as measured on MAS, DAS and GAS. The safety measures
      involve adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and pulse, blood pressure.

    <description>The investigator, physiotherapist, or occupational therapist extended the participant's wrist as quickly as possible to grade flexor muscle tone. The MAS wrist score was calculated by using the 6-point MAS (0, 1, 1+ [regarded as 1.5], 2, 3, and 4; 0=no increase in muscle tone; 4=affected part[s] rigid in flexion/extension). Change from Baseline at Week 6 was calculated as the value at Week 6 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <description>The investigator evaluates 4 areas of disability, hygiene, pain, dressing, and limb posture, with the 4-point DAS (0=No functional disability to 3=Severe disability). Prior to the initial administration, the investigator, in consultation with the participant, selects 1 functional disability item (The item should be scored 2 or greater as measured by the DAS, indicating moderate to severe disability) from the 4 areas of disability and assessed it as a principal measure. Change from Baseline at the indicated time points was calculated at Week 1, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 18 minus the value at Baseline.</description>
