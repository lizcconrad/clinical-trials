      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD), of FS102(BMS-986186) when administered intravenously (IV) to subjects with
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors that overexpress HER2 and who have no standard treatment
      options.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors
      that over express HER2.

      Subjects with locally un-resectable and/or metastatic solid cancers that over express human
      epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (HER2) by standard clinical pathology
      criteria and who have no standard treatment options will be enrolled into a series of
      escalating dose cohorts.

      Within each dose cohort, subjects will receive weekly (± 1 day) or less frequent IV (Q3W)
      infusions of FS102 during an initial 28-day (4-week) DLT observation period. During the DLT
      observation period, subjects will be assessed for safety, tolerability, dose limiting
      toxicity, PK, immunogenicity, and clinical disease response. Following assessment by the
      Investigator, subjects without clinical disease progression and without unacceptable toxicity
      will be eligible to continue receiving FS102 for up to six 21 (Q3W) to 28-day (weekly)
      cycles.

      Continuation Phase. Subjects who complete six 21-28-day cycles of treatment will be evaluated
      for entry into an extended Continuation Phase of the study. Subjects will be eligible for
      continuation if:

        -  They demonstrate no evidence of disease progression;

        -  In the opinion of the Investigator they are deemed reasonably likely to continue to
           benefit from treatment; and

        -  They have not experienced any toxicity requiring discontinuation. During the
           Continuation Phase, subjects will continue to receive FS102 at the same dose they were
           originally assigned, unless modified downward for earlier toxicity. No dose escalation
           within subjects will be permitted.

      Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:

        -  Disease progression;

        -  Intervening illness that prevents further administration of treatment;

        -  Unacceptable adverse events;

        -  Significant subject non-compliance with protocol;

        -  Pregnancy;

        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study;

        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition that render the subject
           unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the Investigator; or

        -  Sponsor decides to end the study.

                  non-gastroesophageal junction cancers do not require any prior treatment with
                  anti-HER2 therapy if there is no FDA-approved anti-HER2 agent for their specific
                  cancer type, but they must have refractory or relapsed/progressive disease during
                  or following their last prior anti-cancer therapy.

               9. Serum magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus must be within normal reference ranges
                  as per local tests. [If initial screening results are outside of normal reference
                  range, the Investigator may initiate appropriate measures to correct. However
                  administration of FS102 may not proceed until the specified electrolytes have
                  normalized.]

          9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy

             drug.

         10. Women must not be breastfeeding

         11. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the
             duration of treatment with study drug FS102 plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle)
             for a total of 30 days post-treatment completion.

         12. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug FS102 plus 90
             days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 90 days post-treatment completion.

         13. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt
             from contraceptive requirements. However they must still undergo pregnancy testing as
             described in this section.

        Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy.
        Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of
        contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and correctly.

                  study.

         13. Has not recovered from the adverse effects of previous anti-cancer treatments to
             pre-treatment baseline or Grade 1, except for alopecia, anemia (hemoglobin must meet
