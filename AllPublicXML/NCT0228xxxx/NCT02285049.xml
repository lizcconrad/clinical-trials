  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic urticaria symptoms commonly fluctuate from day by day. Consequently the clinical
      presentation of a patient in each visit is not representative of the current disease status.
      Dermatologists are trying to integrate an evaluation process of each treatment visit
      regarding both clinical condition and life quality concern. The Urticaria Control Test is the
      key for a better treatment outcome in a routine management. To translate this questionnaire
      into Thai is essential in our subject of interest for offering local patients a higher
      well-being standard. The Thai-version test will encourage enhanced as well as impactful
      therapeutic options for Thai chronic urticaria patients.

      1. Independently adaption of the UCT questionnaire into Thai version by using
           forward-backward translation by two bilingual translators. The original German version
           is translated into Thai by two Thai native speakers, then the study team reviews the
           Thai-version UCT questionnaire for items comprehensibility and integrates the first
           consensus version which re-translated into German by German native speaker afterwards.
           The comparison between the backward German version UCT questionnaire and the original
           UCT is carried out to find out any misconception and mistranslation in the intermediary
           forward version of questionnaire. The second version will be tested on 15 chronic
           urticaria patients to detect any misunderstanding points. Finally, this Thai-version of
           UCT questionnaire will be used to investigate the validity, reliability,
           interpretability and minimal clinical important difference.

        2. To investigate the validity, reliability and interpretability of Thai-version of
           Urticaria Control Test, the severity of urticaria symptoms will be assessed by
           investigators and patients using UAS28, Patient's global assessment of disease severity
           (PatGA-LS), Physician's global assessment of disease control (PhyGA-LS), the UCT and
           DLQI questionnaire
