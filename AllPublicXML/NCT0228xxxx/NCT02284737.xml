  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by premature death mainly because of
      progressive and severe right ventricular failure. Target drugs are reported to be associated
      with significant improvement of clinical outcome for PAH patients. However, previous studies
      using those target drugs focused on the change of 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and or
      hemodynamic responses. As 6MWD has weak correlation with clinical outcome (time to clinical
      worsening, TTCW), benefits from target drugs for PAH patients are not clear. We previously
      reported the safety and efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) for treatment of PAH
      patients who were unresponsive to target drugs. Hence, we design the randomized study to
      identify the effect of PADN on PAH.

      The current study is designed as a multicenter, randomized and prospective study aiming to
      compare the effect of PADN on PAH patients. Based on the previous studies, the rate of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-related event was around 30% after 6-month treatment
      using target drugs. And our previous data showed that this PAH-related event at 6-month after
      PADN procedure was 15%. As a result, a total of 270 PAH patients was required, with 135
      patients/per group at a ratio of 1:1 randomization.

    <description>PE is classified by suspected and fatal ones. Suspected PE is defined as one of the following: 1) new intra-luminal filling defect on CT scan, MRI scan, or pulmonary angiogram; 2)new perfusion defect of at least 75% on V/Q lung scan; and 3) inconclusive spiral CT, pulmonary angiography or lung scan with demonstration of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities by venography. Fatal PE is PE based on objective diagnostic testing or autopsy or death not attributed to a documented cause and for which deep vein thrombosis/PE cannot be ruled out.</description>

    <description>Contrast pulmonary artery angiography is performed to localize the pulmonary artery bifurcation level and to calculate the PA diameter. Once the anatomy is deemed acceptable, the radiofrequency ablation catheter is introduced into the distal bifurcation area of the main PA. The catheter is then maneuvered within the PA to allow energy delivery to ensure that the electrodes are tightly in contact with the endovascular surface. Two to three ablations at 1-15 W for 120 seconds at each point were performed in the distal bifurcation area of the main PA.</description>
