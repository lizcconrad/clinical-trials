  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive, congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or
      defective coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Prophylaxis is recommended as the standard of care
      for boys with severe haemophilia by WHO and World Federation Of Hemophilia (WFH). The
      efficacy and safety of prophylaxis in preventing bleeds and arthropathy in patients with
      hemophilia has been confirmed in well-designed clinical studies.To keep the factor level
      above 1%, the standard dosage for patients with severe hemophilia A is 20-40 Units
      /kg/infusion (average 30 Units /kg) every other day or three times a week. This dosage has a
      very high consumption of factor, up to 5000-6000 international unit (IU)/kg/year. The high
      consumption of factor and cost present a major barrier to use the standard prophylaxis in
      many countries particularly in the developing world.

      In China the majority of boys with severe hemophilia A can only pay for on-demand treatment
      or low-dose prophylaxis. Ao after the affordability of patients was solved and many patients
      will get more chance to receive standard prophylaxis.

      This study is designed to evaluate the Annual Bleeding rate (ABR), joint health outcomes and
      QoL outcomes in subjects using ADVATE(Recombinant Human Coagulation Factor VIII for
      injection) standard prophylaxis under the conditions of routine practice.

Subjects will initially be treated standard prophylaxis(20 - 40 IU/Kg body weight every 48 ± 6 hours) with Recombinant Human Coagulation Factor VIII for injection(ADVATE) for 1 year. Subjects must be prescribed ADVATE by the treating physician. Data will be collected over a period of 2 years from the time of study enrollment. Study visits are to coincide with routinely rescheduled and emergency visits. Available data from these visits shall be transcribed onto the case report forms (CRFs).</description>
