  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) develop and test the effectiveness of home-based
      interventions on dual-task performance in older adults; and (2) determine the
      generalizability of the four trainings (i.e. single-task motor training, single-task
      cognitive training, dual-task motor-cognitive training, and dual-task cognitive-cognitive
      trainings) to novel tasks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although, dual-task motor-cognitive training has proven to be more effective in improving
      dual-task balance performance than traditional single-task motor training, poor evidence of
      training-related transfer to a novel dual task has been shown. Additionally, another
      important impediment to the development of intervention to improve dual-task balance
      performance is that the previous studies have largely focused on training in a laboratory, or
      clinical setting, often with one-on-one supervision by a therapist or research assistant.
      Even though the home-based approach is more pragmatic, desirable, and encourages
      accessibility, no study has been done to examine the efficacy of home-based dual-task
      training.

      Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps in the literature by conducting a home-based
      program designed to improve dual-task performance with a broader transfer-of-training effects
      in older adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups (i.e.
      single-task motor training, single-task cognitive training, dual-task motor-cognitive
      training, and dual-task cognitive-cognitive trainings).

    <description>The Center of Mass velocity and Base of Support distance is referred as the direction of the center of mass velocity in relation to base of support. It is used to measure the control of dynamic balance throughout gait under single-task and dual-task conditions in order to examine training effect.</description>
