  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to assess in healthy adults the safety and reactogenicity of a
      new candidate vaccine, cAd3-EBOZ, made of a chimpanzee Adenovirus vector encoding the
      glycoprotein of Zaire Ebola virus. The secondary objectives will be to assess the
      immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine and find the most suitable dose for further
      deployment in epidemic areas in Africa. The 120 planned study subjects will be composed of
      possibly exposed volunteers owning to organisations such as &quot;Médecins sans frontières&quot; and
      susceptible to be deployed in the outbreak zone (named as &quot;possibly exposed volunteers&quot;). The
      other volunteers will be adults with no planned travels to the epidemic zone (named as &quot;not
      exposed volunteers&quot;). The first group will be randomly allocated to two different groups (low
      dose = single injection of 2.5x10e10 viral particles (vp), high dose = single injection of
      5x10e10 vp). The second group will be randomly allocated to three different groups (low dose
      = single injection of 2.5x10e10 viral particles (vp), high dose = single injection of 5x10e10
      vp or placebo = single injection of vaccine diluent). The design will be double-blind.
      Follow-up visits will take place at Day 1, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180.

    <description>SAE are defined as AE that result in any of the following outcomes, whether or not considered related to the study intervention:
Death
Life-threatening event
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Hospitalisation
An important medical event (that may not cause death, be life threatening, or require hospitalisation) that may, based upon appropriate medical judgment, jeopardise the volunteer and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Congenital anomaly or birth defect.
A SUSAR is a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction thought to be possibly, probably or definitely related to an IMP. No category of SAE has been defined as 'expected'.</description>
