    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare vascular healing of the stented segment after
      deployment of titanium-nitride-oxide coated cobalt-chromium Optimax™-stent stent and
      Promus-Element™ everolimus-eluting stent in patients with acute coronary syndromes requiring
      percutaneous coronary intervention.

        1. Comparison of OCT and CFR findings of titanium-nitride-oxide coated cobalt-chromium
           Optimax™-stent and Promus-Element™ everolimus-eluting stent at two months after the
           index procedure.

        2. Comparison of intravascular coronary flow reserve measurement to non-invasive
           transthoracic echocardiography-derived coronary flow reserve measurement.

        3. Comparison of epicardial vasodilation to coronary microcirculatory vasodilation

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;18 and &lt;80 years

          2. STEMI or NSTEMI (assumed by investigator to be type 1 myocardial infarction, according
             to universal definitions of MI; EHJ 2007; 28(20):2525-38); or unstable angina
             (clinical symptoms of chest pain, ecg suggestive of reversible ischemia)

          3. Patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations

          4. Patient or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of the
             study, agrees to its provisions and has been provided written informed consent,
             approved by the appropriate Medical Ethics committee or Institutional Review Board

          5. Single de novo or non-stented restenosis lesion

          6. Patients with two-vessel disease may have undergone successful treatment of the
             non-target vessel with approved devices up to and including the index procedure but
             must be prior to the index target vessel treatment

          7. Target lesion (maximum 20 mm length by visual estimation) to be covered by a single
             stent of maximum 23mm length

          8. Reference vessel diameter must be &gt;2.5mm and &lt;4.0mm by visual estimate.

          9. The vessel diameter should be measured after pre-dilation procedure and after
             intracoronary nitroglycerin if vasospasm is suspected

         10. Target lesion &gt;50% and &lt;100% stenosed by visual estimate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-existing diagnosis of diabetes irrespective of its type

          2. Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt;177micromol/l) or on dialysis

          3. Platelet count &lt; 10 e5 cells/mm3

          4. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom
