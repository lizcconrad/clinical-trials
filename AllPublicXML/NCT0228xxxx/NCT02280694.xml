    <textblock>
      This study investigates the activity of a new regimen of treatment for patients with
      metastatic colorectal carcinoma. This includes a combination of well-known chemotherapy
      agents and anti-inflammatory agents, when administered orally at low daily doses and without
      planed brakes (Low Dose Metronomic regimen), in contrast with the conventional and already
      exhausted regimens of treatment at Maximal Tolerated Doses (MTD) which required pre-planned
      brakes between treatment days.

      Patients suffering from metastases of colorectal cancer whose tumor cells develop resistance
      to conventionally administered treatments are in need for new methods of treatment.

      While their chemotherapy had been administered up till then at the classical regimen of
      Maximal Tolerated Doses (MTD), which is aimed to directly killing maximal fractions of tumor
      cells, the present study evaluates the clinical benefit of a treatment which is based on old
      chemotherapeutic and old anti-inflammatory drugs, when these are administered at low doses,on
      daily basis and orally taken, without planed brakes (Low Dose Metronomic regimen).

      Treatments based on this type of regimen have already been studied on other models of cancer
      and showed the capacity of suppressing tumor growth by a new category of anti-tumor effects.
      Namely, by affecting factors and mechanisms which prevail in the microenvironment that
      surrounds tumor deposits, thus circumventing the resistance of their cancer cells to
      chemotherapy.

          3. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status 0-2

          4. Progressing disease following all available chemotherapy treatment lines (including
             chemotherapy, bevacizumab+/-ziv-aflibercept, and an epidermal growth factor receptor
             (EGFR) inhibitor [if WT(wild type)-KRAS]

          5. The central-radiologist's confirmation of PD* under the last (previous) line of
