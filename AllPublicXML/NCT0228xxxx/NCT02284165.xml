    <textblock>
      Retrospective analysis of Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data linked with Medicare claims and
      the AVAIL longitudinal data sets to assess patterns, predictors, and outcomes associated with
      the use of rehabilitation services following hospitalization for ischemic stroke. Primary
      completion defined as the end of primary analyses, consistent with the end of the PCORI Cycle
      I grant period. Study completion defined as acceptance of final research report and lay
      abstract by PCORI.

      The investigators will seek to answer three questions:

        1. What are the person- and system-level factors associated with use of rehabilitation
           services following acute ischemic stroke?

        2. Among stroke survivors discharged to short-term inpatient rehabilitation, are
           high-intensity services performed at an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) more
           effective than lower intensity services performed at a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF),
           at improving patient outcomes at 3 and 12 months?

        3. Among stroke survivors discharged home, is early follow-up with a physician more
           effective than follow-up after 7 days at 3 and 12 months?

Score for each question is added together to provide total score, which is converted to provide a range from 1 (maximum and highest health state for quality of life) down to 0 (lowest health state and quality of life).</description>
