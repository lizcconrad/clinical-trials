      Patients with histologically proven malignancy with documented disease control (objective
      response or stable disease) or Not Evaluable Disease (NED) expectancy &gt; 6 months; only
      HLA-A*02 positive patients.

      The primary objective of the trial is to compare safety and tolerability of four different

          2. Histologically proven malignancy;

          3. Documented HLA-A*02 positivity, as determined by a central laboratory;

          4. Disease control (Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease
             (SD)) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria
             or NED in the case of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy

          5. Patient with disease control or NED expectancy &gt; or = 6 months according to
             investigator opinion;

          6. ECOG performance status 0, 1;

          7. Patients must have adequate renal and hepatic function as assessed by standard
             laboratory criteria;

          8. Patients must have adequate haematological function:

               -  Platelet count &gt; or = 100 x 109/L;

             ovaries who have a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy, ovariectomy or women who
             are post-menopausal). Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at baseline and agree to practice adequate contraception for 30 days
             prior to administration of investigational product, throughout the study treatment

         10. In the investigator's opinion, the patient is capable and willing to comply with the
             requirements of the study;

         11. Willing and able to sign a written informed consent.

             Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) etc) within four weeks prior to the first vaccination;

          3. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents (including corticosteroids) within 2 weeks
             prior to the first vaccination;

             Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or topical steroids is allowed;

          7. Known hepatitis B and/or C infection documented in patient files, testing not
             required;

          8. Known HIV-positivity, testing not required;

          9. Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction (Alanine amino transferase (ALT)&gt;2.5 times
             normal upper limits [ULN], Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST)&gt;2.5 times Upper Limit of
             Normal (ULN), bilirubin&gt;1.5 times ULN);

         10. Clinically significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine&gt;1.5 time ULN);

         11. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure or hypertension, unstable heart disease
             (coronary artery disease with unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months
             before enrolment) or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias at the time of enrolment in
             the study (atrial fibrillation or flutter is acceptable);

         12. Splenectomy or splenic irradiation;

         13. Any infectious condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise
             the patient's ability to develop an immune response;

         14. Pregnant or lactating females (female patients of child-bearing potential will
             undertake pregnancy testing at screening and during study completion/withdrawal
             visits);

         15. Alcohol or drug dependence;

         16. Requirement of concurrent treatment with prohibited medication (investigational
             product, other anti-cancer treatments including chemotherapy, non-palliative
             radiotherapy, biological agents and immunomodulating agents, systemic
             immunosuppressive agents, including systemic corticosteroids);

         17. The investigator considers the patient unfit for the study as a result of the medical
             interview, physical examination, or screening investigations.
