    <textblock>
      The proposed project aims to develop novel electrochemotherapeutic treatment of glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM). Standard treatment has limited effect on survival and quality of life.
      Electrochemotherapy is a novel and promising treatment, which has demonstrated convincing
      results in the treatment of various types of carcinoma. The treatment is based on a
      combination of electrical current stimulation of tumor cells and simultaneous administration
      of chemotherapeutic drugs. Electrochemotherapy works by inducing an electrical current
      between implanted electrodes in the tumor tissue, causing electroporation of the cancer cell
      membranes, and thereby increasing the cellular permeability and drug uptake.
      Electrochemotherapy has proven to be an efficient way of considerably increasing the potency
      of the chemotherapeutic drug bleomycin in malignant cells in skin tumors and carcinoma
      metastases, and thereby increasing cytotoxicity of the drug locally in the tumor tissue. This
      allows for treatment with lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs and more defined, local area
      of effect, thus decreasing systemic effects. The investigators propose to use a novel
      non-invasive and safe technique called focused transcranial magnetic stimulation (focused
      TMS) to induce electrical current in the tumor tissue. TMS is a safe and widely implemented
      technology used to treat multiple neurological diseases such as pain, depression and stroke.
      Studies have shown that effective electroporation of cell membranes can be obtained using
      induction of electromagnetic fields in a cell suspension, and new focused TMS further enables
      focused treatment of selected brain regions without surgical intervention and, thereby
      focusing chemotherapeutic treatment to pathological tissue and avoiding surgery related brain
      tissue damage. Additionally, TMS transiently increases blood-brain barrier permeability,
      theoretically allowing increased uptake of chemotherapeutic drugs in the target area. This
      addresses a significant challenge in the treatment of brain cancer, as most cytotoxic drugs
      have fairly limited ability to pass the blood brain barrier.

      The intention of this research project is to investigate the therapeutic potential of focused
      TMS as an alternative non-invasive source of current induction and thereby means to treat
      several types of brain cancer with electrochemotherapy.
