  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test whether the addition of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (TDCS) to speech fluency training results in improvements in speech fluency in adults with
      developmental stuttering. Half of the participants will receive anodal TDCS on five
      consecutive days, the other half will receive a sham stimulation for the same amount of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies using TDCS have shown improvements in motor performance, and in expressive language
      skills in clinical and healthy populations. The benefits of single sessions of TDCS are
      short-lived. However, stimulation over multiple sessions can increase and prolong learning
      effects that can persist for several weeks after the end of the stimulation period. We aim to
      target left hemisphere frontal regions involved in speech production with TDCS, and to pair
      this stimulation with speech fluency training.
