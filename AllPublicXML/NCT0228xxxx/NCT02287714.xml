  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common causes of heel pain. Approximately 2 million
      Americans seek treatment for plantar fasciitis every year, with 10% of the population
      developing plantar fasciitis over a lifetime. The vast majority of cases respond to
      conservative care; however, the 5-10% of cases that are recalcitrant to conservative measures
      may require surgical intervention. Several surgical options do exist and are cited in the
      literature for treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. One such approach is the instep
      plantar fascial release, utilizing an approximately 2-3 cm plantar incision over the
      prominent fascial band, just distal to the fat pad of the heel. It has been demonstrated that
      many patients with plantar fasciitis also have an isolated contracture of the gastrocnemius,
      known as gastrocnemius equinus. Gastrocnemius recession is performed to correct an isolated
      gastrocnemius contracture and recent studies have demonstrated its successful use in the
      treatment of recalcitrant foot pain. To date, no prospective studies exist examining the
      utilization of the gastrocnemius recession in combination with instep plantar fascial release
      in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. This prospective randomized trial will
      aim to compare the use of instep plantar fasciotomy both with and without gastrocnemius
      recession in the treatment of plantar fasciitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have failed conservative treatment for greater than 6 months.

          -  Patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis and simultaneous gastrocnemius
             contracture in the ipsilateral limb. Contracture will be defined as the inability to
             dorsiflex the ankle past neutral with the knee in extension.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adjunctive procedure at the time of surgery.

          -  History of heel spur surgery, plantar fasciotomy or extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
