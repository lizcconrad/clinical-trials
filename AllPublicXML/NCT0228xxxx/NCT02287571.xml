  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of
      preoperative skin traction and position splint on pain, comfort, complications, difficulty
      level of nursing interventions, satisfaction from treatment and nursing care in patients with
      hip fracture. The sample is comprised of 34 patients with hip fracture in each group, totally
      68 patients. Skin traction and position splint were applied after block randomization. Data
      regarding pain, comfort, satisfaction from care, immobilization comfort, complications, time
      of operation and hospitalization time were collected after intervention.
