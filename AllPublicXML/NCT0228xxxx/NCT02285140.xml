  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clinical equipoise about the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be
      given for a short period or an extended period of time as reflected by inconsistencies in
      major guidelines, current practices at Canadian centers, and as concluded in the three
      systematic reviews. There also is clinical equipoise on whether the addition of vancomycin to
      routine cefazolin prophylaxis can further reduce s-SSI rates. A short duration of combined
      antimicrobial prophylaxis can reduce side effects of exposure to antimicrobials such as
      infections with C. difficile or emergence of resistance, but may also reduce the incidence of
      s-SSIs. The objective of the eventual full scale study is to determine whether adding
      vancomycin to cefazolin can reduce SSIs as well as whether short-term prophylaxis is as
      effective as long-term prophylaxis. The rationale to conduct the proposed pilot study is to
      assess the feasibility to conduct this factorial cluster randomized cross-over trial, the
      adherence to the study protocol at each pilot site, the length of time to fill out the case
      report forms, and to get reliable estimates of event rates for sample size calculation for
      the main study
