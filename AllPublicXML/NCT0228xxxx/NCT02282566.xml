      This study investigates whether a protein-nutrition beverage can increase muscle protein
      synthesis to a similar magnitude as a control beverage.

      Potential participants will be screened, and if eligible, invited to participate. Body
      composition and physical activity level will be assessed during the initiation visit. During
      the trial visits, women receive a protein-nutrition beverage; muscle protein synthesis is
      assessed via blood analytes and muscle biopsies at rest and after exercise. Statistical
      analysis includes mixed model regression approach with change in muscle protein synthesis as
      the primary outcome.
