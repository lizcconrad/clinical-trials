  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of a web cam-based biomedical device
      developed at UVA (not FDA-approved) that is designed to measure heart rate, respiratory rate,
      and oxygen saturation without requiring any patient contact. One potential application of
      such a device would be in the field of infant monitoring allowing parents (and physicians) to
      monitor the vital signs of infants continuously. The investigators therefore propose to
      record the heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 100 infants (defined as
      children aged 12 months or less) who are receiving continuous oxygen, heart rate, and
      respiratory rate monitoring with a traditional vital signs monitor. The relationship between
      &quot;non-contact&quot; and &quot;gold standard&quot; (GE monitoring equipment) heart rate, respiratory rate, and
      oxygen saturation will be analyzed using regression and limits of agreement analysis.

      While multiple investigators have attempted to develop non-contact pulse oximeters, none of
      these devices have achieved accuracy sufficient for clinical use, no such devices have been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and there are currently no such devices on the
      market in the United States. While these devices are typically able to measure the heart and
      respiratory rates with some accuracy,v the accurate calculation of oxygen saturation from the
      arterial pulse (SpO2) using a &quot;non-contact&quot; reflectance oximetry probe is complicated by the
      interference of ambient light, patient temperature changes, as well as the inherent
      limitations of the sensing devices currently utilized. Poh et al have been somewhat
      successful at calculating the heart rate from a video recording using independent component
      analysis. However, Poh's method does not calculate instantaneous rates and requires a facial
      recognition component to track the facial orientation in the image, is not capable of
      measuring respiratory rate, and relies primarily on analysis of reflected green light (which
      cannot be used for the calculation of oxygen saturation). Our work involves modifying a
      commercial off the shelf (COTS) 3-channel (red, green, blue) CCD (charge coupled device) or
      CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) camera in the form of a web cam to detect near
      infrared and infrared spectrum radiation and applying an algorithm based fast Fourier
      transformation (FFT) of individual red pixel intensity to detect motion and color changes.
      Because our algorithm analyzes the first derivative of red pixel intensity, a face-tracking
      component is unnecessary, and we are able to calculate the heart rate and the respiratory
      rate in real time.
