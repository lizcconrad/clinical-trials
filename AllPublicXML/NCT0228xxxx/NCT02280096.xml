  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty four RRMS patients over the age of 18, with similar degree of disability, and with an
      evolution of at last 6 months, who are in first-line immunomodulatory therapy and have a
      stable disease (no more than one outbreak per year) will be included in the present study.
      Patients will be administered a neuropsychological test battery selected for this study and
      divided into two sessions of one and a half-hour each. Emotional state will be assessed with
      the Beck Depression Inventory in a different session. Cognitive impairment is defined as the
      alteration of two or more neuropsychological tests. Patients will be divided randomly into
      two groups where one will receive placebo and the other one 4-AP for a period of four months
      in increasing doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with stable multiple sclerosis are being recruited from the neurological
      services of IMSS at the hospital CMN Siglo XXI over the period of 1 year. Of those meeting
      inclusion criteria, 24 will be selected for the study. After signing an informed consent,
      they will be randomized into 12 for the intervention arm and 12 for the placebo arm. All
      patients will receive capsules for daily consumption according to their assignment, with no
      visible difference between capsules. Dosage will be 6.5-7.5 mg/kg to a limit of 50 mg. These
      capsules will be taken for a period of 4 months. A battery of neuropsychological tests will
      be administered at baseline, after 4 months, and after an additional four months of follow-up
      to assess cognitive performance and motor function. Emotional state will be assessed with the
      Beck Depression Inventory at each of the three aforementioned points.

      After the follow-up period, all test results will be analyzed and compared to determine the
      efficacy and safety of 4-aminopyridine on the cognitive performance and motor function of
      patients. Mann-Whitney U will be used for statistical analysis.

    <description>4-aminopyridine is given as gelatin capsules containing 4-aminopyridine 10 mg and microcrystalline cellulose as the excipient.

The 4-aminopyridine dosage will increase 10 mg/4 weeks by substitution of placebo instead of 4-aminopyridine capsules; such that patients will receive from 40 to 60 mg. distribute in 6capsules/day throughout the study. After 22 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of wash-out period, this group of patients will start placebo branch.</description>
