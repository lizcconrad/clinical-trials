    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test Nilotinib's ability to alter the abnormal protein build up in
      Parkinson disease and Diffuse Lewey Body Disease patients . Patients will receive Nilotinib
      at different doses for 6 months. Patients will then be tested to see if there is change in
      three areas: 1) has the disease symptoms changed. 2) has levels of a specific misfolded
      protein changed in the fluid around their brain and spine. 3) Have inflammatory markers
      changed in the patient's blood and fluid around their brain and spine. If successful, this
      drug could be used to slow down or stop the progression of disorders that involve abnormal
      collection of misfolded proteins. However, the main purpose of this pilot study is to check
      for the safety of using this medication at this level.

    <measure>Change in α-synuclein and Tau concentrations in the CSF and serum of patients</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Working Hypothesis: PD patients have been shown to have elevated levels of α-synuclein in their CSF. Nilotinib has been shown to reduce α-synuclein and Tau in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system in animal models, and similarly, we propose will show changes in CSF and serum α-synuclein concentrations in nilotinib treated PD patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine nilotinib's efficacy by improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Working Hypothesis: By following strict safety guidelines, monitoring patients through physical examinations, self-examinations, laboratory and neurological examinations, nilotinib will be a safe drug to use in patients with PD and PD related patients.
Determine if any clinical benefit is observed in this small, short, limited clinical trial.
Working Hypothesis: In cell culture and animal models of PD, dopaminergic neurons have shown increased cell death with accumulating α-synuclein. Therefore, PD patients treated with nilotinib, which lowers α-synuclein and Tau in vivo and in vitro studies, will have improvement or stabilization of their motor UPDRS and cognition.</description>
