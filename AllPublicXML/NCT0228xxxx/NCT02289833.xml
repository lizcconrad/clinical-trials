  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      trastuzumab emtansine administered as a single-agent in participants with HER2-positive (HER2
      IHC 2+ or HER2 IHC 3+) advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Participants will be treated with
      trastuzumab emtansine administered intravenously at a dose of 3.6 milligrams per kilogram
      (mg/kg) on Day 1 of 21-day cycles until disease progression (as assessed by the
      investigator), unmanageable toxicity, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs
      first.
