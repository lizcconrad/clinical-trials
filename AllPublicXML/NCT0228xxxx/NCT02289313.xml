  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one third of the children and adolescents in the United States are either
      overweight or obese. Childhood obesity disproportionately affects specific racial and ethnic
      groups and households with low socioeconomic status and low parental education. The
      Alternative Learning Center (ALC) within Rochester School District 535 provides viable
      educational options for students who are experiencing difficulty in regular educational
      systems. A greater proportion of students at ALC are minorities, qualify for free and reduced
      lunch and receive special education services. These children are likely to have unique
      barriers to physical activity and healthy eating.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: Examine the association between BMI and ethnic/ socioeconomic variables and behaviors
      related to physical activity and eating in ALC students.

      Aim 2: Develop an age and culturally appropriate on-site program that promotes healthy
      lifestyle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will assess the relationship between BMI and ethnicity, socioeconomic variables
      and behaviors related to nutrition and physical activity among 200 ALC students.
      Investigators will also conduct 6 gender stratified (3 boys, 3 girls) focus groups with
      students (n=24), up to 3 focus groups with their parents (n=24) and one focus group with
      staff and volunteers in order to understand perceived barriers towards healthy
      weight/nutrition/physical activity. Investigators will then utilize this information to
      co-develop a healthy living program at ALC. Investigators will finally test the feasibility
      of the program they develop over a period of 3 months in ALC students. Study findings will
      inform further research to test the efficacy and validity of the program developed at ALC in
      a subsequent school based trial with the future goal of obtaining funding for cluster
      randomized controlled trials among other schools in the region.
