  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting is one of most common complications after general
      anesthesia. Female sex, history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, motion sickness, non
      smoker status, opioid administration are known as risk factors for developing postoperative
      nausea and vomiting.

      It has been suggest that antagonism of residual neuromuscular block with a mixture of
      neostigmine and atropine at the end of the surgery increases the risk of postoperative nausea
      and vomiting.

      Sugammadex is a very safe drug with almost no serious adverse effects. The known adverse
      effects include slight coughing, movement, an altered taste sensation in the mouth, transient
      prolongation of the QT interval, hypersensitivity, and a short term prolongation of the
      activated partial thromboplastin time.

      The aim of this study was to compare the sugammadex versus neostigmine plus atropine for
      reversal of rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade in terms of incidence of postoperative
      nausea and vomiting.
