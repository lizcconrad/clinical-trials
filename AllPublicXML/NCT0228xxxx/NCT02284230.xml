  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will examine the effects of liraglutide treatment during 26 weeks on
      several cardiovascular risk factors in patients with prediabetes and end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD). The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of the treatment on glucose
      tolerance evaluated during a 3h 75g-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Secondary objectives
      include various clinical and biochemical cardiovascular and safety parameters.

      We hypothesise that treatment with liraglutide can improve glucose tolerance in prediabetic
      patients with ESRD by normalizing plasma glucose excursions during an OGTT and ameliorate
      other cardiovascular risk factors.

        rings, and injections) are considered as adequate contraceptives. Females of childbearing
        potential must use one of these contraceptives throughout the entire study plus 1 week
        after last injection with study medication. Surgical sterile (by bilateral vasectomy,
        tubectomy, hysterectomy or oophorectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as amenorrheic for at
