  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of high dose radiotherapy treatment is to deliver enough radiation to the tumour to
      kill all the cancer cells while at the same time giving a low dose of radiation to the normal
      parts of the body to reduce the side effects of treatment. This requires the cancer
      specialist to accurately identify the areas of cancer on a computed tomography (CT) scan.
      Positron emission tomography computed tomography (PETCT) scans use radioactive sugar that is
      injected into the patient. This sugar goes into cancer cells and shows up as a bright spot on
      the PET scan, allowing the doctors to see tumours more accurately. Some cancers move with
      breathing, for example lung, pancreas and oesophageal (or gullet) cancers. Fourdimensional CT
      scanning (4DCT) is a special type of CT scan that allows the motion of the tumour to be seen
      and measured accurately. This information can then be used to help ensure that the
      radiotherapy correctly treats the moving tumour.

      The aim of this study is to see if there are possible benefits to combining PET with 4DCT to
      get a 4D PETCT scan for tumours that move with breathing. This study is divided into three
      cancer types; lung, lower oesophagus and pancreatic cancer.

      First the investigators are going to test the use of 4D PETCT in the radiotherapy planning of
      these tumours to see if it helps the doctor to identify the cancer.

      Secondly, the investigators are going to see if the 4D PETCT helps to show areas within the
      cancer that are potentially more active. This might then allow us to target a higher dose to
      these areas, which could potentially improve the chance of controlling and curing the cancer.
      Patients' standard treatment will not be altered by participating in the study.
