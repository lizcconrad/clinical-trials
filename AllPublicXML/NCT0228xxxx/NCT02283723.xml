  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health TAPESTRY is a delayed intervention pragmatic randomized control trial promoting
      interprofessional team collaboration, facilitating connection to the community through system
      navigation and trained community volunteers, enhancing communication and improving care
      through the use of technology to better understand and assist older adult patients in
      achieving their health goals and to enable them to have optimal aging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the integrated multicomponent Health TAPESTRY approach is to promote
      optimal aging. Optimal aging within the Health TAPESTRY program means supporting people to
      move through life with good health in the best possible way: Being Alive Well. Health
      TAPESTRY is a health and social care approach that centres on meeting a person's health goals
      with the support of technology, trained community volunteers, an interprofessional team,
      system navigation, and better links between primary care and community organizations. The
      Health TAPESTRY intervention takes a complex, multilevel approach to integration, from both
      system level and individual level perspectives. The Health TAPESTRY program will provide
      processes and tools to activate and support individuals to access and use the broad range of
      available primary health care, social and community services to achieve their personal health
      goals and strategies to better integrate care at the system level. More specifically Health
      TAPESTRY will promote optimal aging:

        -  through intentional, proactive conversations about a person's life, health and care
           goals within the primary healthcare setting;

        -  through improved connections between inter-professional primary care teams, community
           service providers and informal caregivers;

        -  by training volunteers to serve as a link between the primary care team and a person in
           their home;

        -  by using technology from the home to link directly with the primary health care team
           which includes

        -  the tablet-based Health TAPESTRY app for volunteers to use;

        -  the Personal Health Record (PHR) and

        -  innovative resources (i.e. Optimal Aging Portal).

      It is anticipated that together these will enable transformation of how primary healthcare
      and interprofessional teams provide care to older adults in a manner that provides value for
      resources used and meets needs and goals of older adults.

    <measure>Progress attaining health goals</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will identify up to 5 areas of health that will serve as the basis for Goal Attainment Scale(GAS) measurement and will assign subjective weights using a scale of 1 to 9 (higher scores indicating greater importance). An indicator for each goal is selected and used to indicate progress in meeting the goal. The expected outcomes for each problem area will be identified. These outcomes will be standardized and as descriptive, objective and observable as possible. The indicators will be applied to the intervention group and control group in the same manner. Participants will be followed up at the end of 6 months by an independent and blinded assessor for the purpose of study comparison to evaluate the patient's level of goal attainment for each priority problem area that has a goal attainment scale constructed for it although participants in the intervention group may have follow occur more frequently as the information about goals is transmitted to the health care team</description>

    <measure>Quality of life measures (2 tools)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>1)The EuroQol-5 Demensop-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) is comprised of six questions investigating patients' present health status. The last question requires patients to rate one's own current health status on a scale from 0-100, 0 being worst and 100 being the best; and 2)Veterans Rand-12 (VR-12) It's a 9 item survey that focuses mainly on physical and emotional health. The survey was developed at RAND Corporation with the support of US Department of Veterans Affairs. Both of these tools are under consideration by the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) led community based primary healthcare indicators group and the proposed TAPESTRY study offers the opportunity to compare the two tools.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures the ability and confidence of patient to self-manage their own health. The scale comprises of 6 items and each item is responded on a 10-point Likert scale with 0 indicates not at all confident and 10 denotes totally confident.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal aging</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Single question, &quot;In terms of your own healthy aging, would you say it is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?&quot; Ratings become a 5-point scale ranging from 1 to 5. A similar question has been used in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging.</description>

Satisfaction score range from 6-18 whereas networking scores ranges from 4-12. The scale facilitates understanding patients' relationships with friends/family and whoever supports them. Those individuals who score less than 10 on the satisfaction scale are considered at risk.</description>
