An AE that occurred more than 9 days after the date of the last dose of double-blind IMP was not counted as a TEAE. Lipid panel parameters included evaluation of total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</description>

        <description>TEAEs were defined as events that either had a start date on or after the first dose of IMP or has a start date before the date of the first dose of IMP, but increased in severity on or after the date of the first dose of IMP. An AE that occurred more than 9 days after the date of the last dose of double-blind IMP was not counted as a TEAE. Urinalysis parameters included evaluation of pH, glucose, protein, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, occult blood, ketones, bilirubin and specific gravity levels.</description>
