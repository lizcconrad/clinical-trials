  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All over the world the increasing prevalence of chronic disorders and its impact on
      functional decline is challenging the sustainability of health care systems. Older
      individuals also frequently experience the reversible &quot;frailty syndrome&quot;, which overlaps with
      chronic diseases, increasing incidence of disability.

      Building a global system aiming to take in charge all causes leading to loss of autonomy is a
      rather complicated task involving numerous Information and Communication technologies (ICT)
      solutions which are not always easy to use in everyday life.

      The SafEE (Safe Easy Environment) project aim is to improve the safety, autonomy and quality
      of life of older people at risk.

      The SafEE project develop non pharmacological therapeutic through diferent ICT (stimulation
      aromatherapy automatic fragrance, training interface based on Kinect sensor...) .

      The goal of this study is to validate the acceptability, sensitivity and efficacy of the
      systems.

      The non pharmacological therapeutic will be install at patient's home :

        -  aromatherapy,

        -  music therapy,

        -  cognitive training in multimedia application offering cognitive games.

      Also smart phone will be given to the patient :

        -  to help him move with a geolocation application,

        -  to remind him of his daily needs (shopping lists, people to call, etc ...) with an alert
           apllication.
