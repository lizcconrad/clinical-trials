      Safety and Efficacy Study in pediatric subjects aged 9 to 17 years of age with suboptimal LV
      EBD on non-contrast 2D echocardiography. Imaging conditions will represent those in routine
      clinical practice and will include LV EBD with harmonic imaging modality.

      This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label study that will be conducted at approximately
      7-12 sites in the United States, Canada and Europe in pediatric patients with suboptimal LV
      EBD on non-contrast 2D transthoracic echocardiography with harmonic imaging. It is estimated
      that 92 patients will be enrolled to provide 73 evaluable patients.

      Three cardiologists unaffiliated with enrolling centers (blinded readers), blinded to the
      patient's identity and clinical profile will independently evaluate the echocardiograms. The
      efficacy analysis will be primarily based on the blinded reader evaluations.

      Imaging conditions will be representative of those used in routine clinical practice and will
      include LV EBD with harmonic imaging modality.

      One of the sites participating in this study will also be requested to consent a subset of
      patients for additional blood sampling for analysis of SF6 concentration in blood from a
      total of 6 patients (3 males and 3 females) in the age group 9 up to 12 years of age and 6
      patients (3 males and 3 females) in the age of &gt;12 up to and including 17 years.

      The current study is designed to assess the efficacy of Lumason-enhanced
