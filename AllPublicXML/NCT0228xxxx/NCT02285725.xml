    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate a treatment for multiple full thickness chondral lesions in the
      knee. Eligible subjects will undergo a microdrilling surgery and up to 12 post operative
      intra-articular injections of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), platelet rich plasma
      (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA).
