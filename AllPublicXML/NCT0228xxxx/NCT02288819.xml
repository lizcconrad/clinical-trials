  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the urinary sodium/creatinine or
      chloride/creatinine ratio might predict successful downtitration of loop diuretics in
      patients with stable heart failure without clinical signs of volume overload. In addition,
      this study will provide information on loop diuretic efficiency and urinary electrolyte
      composition after intake of diuretics in stable outpatients with heart failure.

    <measure>Successful downtitration of loop diuretics (no weight increase &gt;1,5 kg)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>After baseline evaluation, loop diuretics are temporarily downtitrated or stopped for 7 consecutive days. The patient is instructed to measure his/her weight in the morning of these days, immediately after waking up, on the same balance. In case of weight increase &gt;1,5 kg, the original dose of diuretics is restored. To check this, patients are contacted by phone after 3 and 7 days. If the patient has not gained &gt;1,5 kg of weight after 7 days, loop diuretics are considered to be successfully downtitrated.</description>
