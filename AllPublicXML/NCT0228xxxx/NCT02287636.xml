    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) works compared to PET/computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing younger
      patients with cancer. PET/MRI and PET/CT are procedures that combine the pictures from a PET
      scan and an MRI scan or a CT scan. The PET and MRI scans or PET and CT scans are done at the
      same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas
      inside the body than either scan gives by itself. It is not yet known whether PET/MRI works
      better than PET/CT in diagnosing younger patients with cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the diagnostic accuracy of PET/MRI as compared to the standard of reference
      PET/CT in lesion detection and lesion characterization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain quantitative measurements in various body regions of standardized uptake values
      (SUV) in normal tissue and foci of pathologic tracer uptake in PET/MRI of pediatric patients
      with oncologic disease using various magnetic resonance attenuation correction (MRAC) methods
      and compare those to respective SUV based on CT attenuation correction.

      II. Assess the potential for radiation dose reduction with PET/MRI when eliminating CT
      radiation dose.

      III. Assess time efforts and workflow improvement with PET/MRI compared to sequential PET/CT
      plus MRI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT followed by PET/MRI.

    <description>Evaluation of the PET/MR imaging platform will be based on the ability to detect lesions. Evaluation of each lesion will be recorded using the following 5 point rating scale: 1=benign, 2=probably benign, 3=indeterminate, 4=probably malignant, 5=malignant. A Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test and two-sided z-test will be used to compare diagnostic accuracy of PET/MRI with PET/CT.</description>
