    <textblock>
      Multicentric epidemiological non-comparative study in France characterising evolution of anal
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and related lesions and evaluating markers associated
      with the observed evolution.

      Estimated enrolment: 500

      Principal Outcomes

        -  Detection of high-grade cytological and histological anal lesions by high resolution
           anoscopy

        -  Spontaneous regression of high-grade anal lesions

        -  Detection of anal HPV infection

      Intervention (procedure):

        -  Patient medical interview (initial inclusion visit, Month 12 and Month 24 follow-up
           visits and if applicable Month 6 and Month 18 control visits)

        -  Standard proctologic examination with digital rectal examination and 2 anal swabs
           (initial inclusion visit, Month 12 and Month 24 follow-up visits and if applicable Month
           6 and Month 18 control visits)

        -  High resolution anoscopy (initial inclusion visit, Month 12 and Month 24 follow-up
           visits and if applicable Month 6 and Month 18 control visits)

      Only if lesion suggestive of Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN) detected during High
      Resolution Anoscopy (HRA):

      - anal biopsy(ies) during HRA

      Only if high-grade lesion:

      - HRA biannually

      Resolution Anoscopy (HRA):

      - anal biopsy(ies) during HRA

      Only if high-grade lesion (Atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), High grade Superficial Intra-epithelial Lesion (HSIL) or
      AIN2/3):

      - HRA biannually
