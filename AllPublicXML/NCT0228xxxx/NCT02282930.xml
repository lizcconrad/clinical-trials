      This study is designed to answer whether patients with progressive IgA nephropathy, who
      receive Acthar (ACTH) gel injection at a dose of 80 units subcutaneously twice weekly for 6
      months is effective in inducing improvement in proteinuria and renal function.

          -  Significant cardiac or pulmonary disease (including obstructive pulmonary disease).

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complication.
