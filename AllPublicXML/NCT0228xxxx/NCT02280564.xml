  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FL3X is an integrated diabetes self-management system that incorporates modern cell phone
      technology with behavioral modification approaches to improve diabetes self-management in
      high-risk youth. Utilizing such approaches will increase adherence to diabetes management
      behaviors and improve glucose control by providing increased autonomy over diabetes care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FL3X utilizes diabetes care providers (diabetes educators) as health coaches to employ
      behavioral modification techniques including motivational interviewing and problem solving
      skills training. Coaches help adolescents and their families learn these techniques to
      improve diabetes self management behaviors and diabetes care.
