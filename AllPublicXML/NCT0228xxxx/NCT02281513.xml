    <textblock>
      Participants from the Fatigue and Lifestyle Physical Activity and SLE Study will be
      approached to enroll in a 6 week pilot intervention. This study will look at the barriers and
      facilitators to increasing physical activity, improving dietary/nutritional intake, and
      improving sleep.This study will offer support and information for people with SLE to increase
      their physical activity, improve their dietary/nutritional intake, and improve their sleep
      and will utilize a smartphone application to self-monitor changes in these behaviors.

      Description of ANTLER pilot intervention: a 6 week intensive program which combines the
      following goals

        -  Ability of participants to utilize a smart phone application for self-monitoring
           behavior change of physical activity, fruit/vegetable consumption, and sleep. This would
           include entering data on fruit/vegetable consumption, hours of sleep and monitoring
           feedback.

        -  Ability of participants to wear Actigraph accelerometer 24 hours/day and complete a
           sleep log for measurement of physical activity and sleep.

        -  Ability of Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) software to collect adequate
           nutrition data.

      The intervention is a unique combination of two individual counseling sessions and the
      utilization of a combination of a smartphone application and the use of a Fitbit physical
      activity monitor. The individual sessions will provide a tailored personalized intervention
      including problem-solving and goal setting for increasing physical activity, consumption of
      more fruits and vegetables, and getting more sleep. Healthy Lifestyle Coaches (RN or Exercise
      Physiologist) will be responsible for conducting the individual sessions for a limited
      caseload of participants.

      Individual sessions will

        -  utilize motivational interviewing techniques to enhance motivation for meeting
           individualized physical activity, dietary/nutritional and sleep goals

        -  identify specific barriers and supports leading to tailored intervention to increase
           program success (The Arthritis Comprehensive Treatment Assessment)

        -  provide emotional support

      Self-monitoring of behavior change

        -  On a daily basis, participants will log fruit/vegetable consumption and hours of sleep
           via a smartphone application and receive feedback

        -  On a daily basis, participants will monitor their physical activity via the Fitbit and
           receive feedback on the smartphone.

      Online activities will include communication between the client and coach in between and
      after scheduled intervention visits.

    <description>It is measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale and the PROMIS Fatigue Short-Form online via the Assessment Center. Change from baseline to 6-week follow-up is measured. The Fatigue Severity Scale is 9 items scored on a 7-point scale from 1= strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree. Minimum score =9 and maximum score=63. Higher score=greater fatigue severity. The PROMIS Fatigue Short Form is 8 items looking back at the past 7 days assessing amount of fatigue and trouble getting things done because of fatigue on a 5-point scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PA, Diet Assessments and Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity is measured objectively by accelerometer worn for 7 days, 24 hours per day and maintenance of a sleep log and self-report of activity by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) by interview based on the 7 days that the accelerometer is worn. Fruit/vegetable consumption is measured by the Nutrition Data System for Research per interview. Sleep is measured by the PROMIS sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment Short Forms online via the Assessment Center. Change from baseline to 6-week follow-up is measured for all of these secondary outcomes.</description>

    <ipd_description>Plans for Resource Sharing. The final data sets from this project will include lupus disease and damage measurements, raw and processed nutrient intake, raw and processed patient-reported outcomes, raw and processed accelerometer data, and motivational interviewing data. The final data from this project will be de-identified in accordance with HIPAA guidelines. Prior to any type of sharing, all disease activity, nutrient intake, patient-reported outcomes and accelerometer records will be made anonymous by the assignment of a new, unique subject identifier that is not linked to any clinical medical record. Requests for resource sharing will all meet the necessary IRB requirements from Northwestern University and the institution of the individual who requests the data.</ipd_description>
