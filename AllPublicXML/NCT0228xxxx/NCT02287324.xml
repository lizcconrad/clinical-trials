      The purpose of the study is to see if manipulation of the neck will change the way people who
      may or may not have neck pain, walk under differing conditions.

      Volunteers in this study will be asked to do the following: 1) complete a series of
      questionnaires about health status and undergo physical screening of neck to make sure that
      manipulation will not be harmful; 2) walk in socks or bare feet across a computerized mat
      under 3 conditions - normal walking pace, walking while looking up and down repeatedly; and
      walking while looking left and right repeatedly; 3) have one of 2 manual therapy
      interventions to the neck; 4) repeat the walking across the computerized mat under those same
      3 conditions.

      The 2 randomly assigned interventions are: cervical manipulation, or cervical contact. If
      assigned the manipulation, volunteers will lie face up and the trained therapist will move
      the joints in the neck in a gentle, but short and sharp manner which may produce a slight
      'pop' or 'click'. If volunteers are assigned the cervical contact, they will lie on their
      back and the trained therapist will gently hold the head and neck for 45 to 60 seconds as
      they quietly relax.

          2. Aged 18 to 70 years

          3. If neck pain is present, must have Neck Disability Index score of at least 10 out of
             50 points

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. 'Red flag' items indicated in Neck Medical Screening Questionnaire such as history of
             a tumor, bone fracture, metabolic diseases, Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteoporosis, severe
             atherosclerosis, prolonged history of steroid use, etc.

          2. History of neck whiplash injury

          3. Diagnosis from physician of cervical spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal) or
             presence of symptoms (pain, pins and needles, numbness) down both arms

          4. Presence of central nervous system involvement such as exaggerated reflexes, changes
             in sensation in the hands, muscle wasting in the hands, impaired sensation of the
             face, altered taste, and presence of abnormal reflexes
