  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the TrueCPR feedback device (with metronome) to standard
      basic life support (BLS) in terms of the quality of single rescuer pediatric resuscitation.
      Therefore, our hypothesis was that there would be no difference between both CPR methods in
      terms of chest compression quality parameters.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death worldwide. High-quality chest compressions are of
      paramount importance for survival and good neurological outcome. Unfortunately, even health
      professionals have difficulty performing effective CPR. Chest compression (CC) is often too
      shallow, compression ratio is inadequate, and hands-off time is too long. CPR feedback
      devices might be an option for rescuers to in order to increase CC efficiency.
