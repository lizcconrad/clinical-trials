  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more people suffer from stress-related illness and ailments that can greatly affect
      the individual's experienced quality of life and sense of coping since pain, physical, mental
      and social functioning are closely linked. Many of these people will seek primary care for
      help, and thus be referred to the Norwegian psychomotor physiotherapy (NPMP) performed by
      physiotherapists in primary care.

      Data shows that for the first three months of 2009, 42% of patients were referred to NPMP had
      a musculoskeletal diagnosis as the first diagnosis, often in the form of long-term and
      comprehensive pain problems. Many of the patients also had emotional difficulties, but
      without being diagnosed with mental illness. 23% of patients who were referred to NPMP had a
      psychiatric diagnosis as the first diagnosis. The full range of psychiatric diagnoses are
      represented, but the majority of patients were treated for anxiety and depression.

      The investigators want to let people who have had NPMP treatment to consider what effect the
      treatment has given, measured by separate registrations of quality of life, pain, physical,
      mental and social functioning.

      The primary aim of this is project intends to evaluate the effect of Norwegian psychomotor
      physiotherapy (NPMP) on Health related Quality of Life measured by Short-form Health Survey
      (SF-36). The secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of Norwegian psychomotor physiotherapy
      (NPMP) on the variables Subjective Health Complaints Inventory (SHC); Hopkins 's Symptom
      Check List , Örebro Screening for musculo-skeletal pain ,Numeric Pain Rating Scale , Oslo
      Social Support Scale , Coping and The self-esteem scale&quot;

      The study design is based on the guidelines for randomized controlled trials presented in the
      CONSORT statement. The study will address to people who have had NPMP treatment approach, and
      they will be asked to consider what effect the treatment has given, measured by separate
      registrations of quality of life, pain, physical, mental and social functioning.

      Participants Power calculation based on the primary outcome Short-form Health Survey (SF-36)
      proved that minimum 170 participants must be recruited. The participants will be recruited
      among patients on the waiting list for NPMP by all psychomotor physiotherapists who are
      members of the Norwegian Physiotherapists Association. If patients want to participate in the
      study, they will be randomized to an intervention group and a control group by drawing lots.

      The intervention group will have NPMP as usual in 6 months. The control group remains on the
      waiting list for 6 months. Participants in both groups will be asked to fill out the
      self-assessment questionnaire at the start of the project and at the completion of the
      project after six months. Participants in the intervention group will receive the same form
      after 12 months, to examine whether there have been any subsequent change after completion
      NPMF.

      Timing of surveys:

      Participants will be given questionnaires by the NPMP physiotherapist at

        -  Baseline - 2 weeks before NPMF (both groups)

        -  After 6 months (both groups)

        -  After 12 months (intervention group).
