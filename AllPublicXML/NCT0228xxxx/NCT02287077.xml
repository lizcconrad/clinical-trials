      The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of performing umbilical
      cord milking in neonates who are depressed at birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a brain injury in neonates due to inadequate blood
      flow and oxygen delivery to the neonatal brain. Umbilical cord milking can potentially
      improve brain injury in neonates with HIE. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      feasibility of performing umbilical cord milking in neonates who are depressed at birth. The
      investigators hypothesized that umbilical cord milking is feasible and safe in neonates who
      are depressed at birth. The investigators also hypothesized that umbilical cord milking will
      increase stem cells in neonatal blood circulation and improve short term outcomes in neonates
      with moderate and severe HIE.

    <description>The number of neonates who are depressed at birth will be determined and the percentage of depressed neonates in whom UCM performed will be calculated. The investigators expect that more than 80% of neonates who qualify will receive UCM. The investigators will aslo compare resuscitation efforts (use of positive pressure ventilation, intubation, chest compression, medication and fluid boluses) and short term outcomes of resuscitation (5 minutes apgar, severity of HIE, blood gas at 1 hour) in neonates with and without UCM.</description>
