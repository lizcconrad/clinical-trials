  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy and safety of heating and cooling
      combination therapeutic device (OCH-S100) for patients with chronic low back pain (LBP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators targeted the patients with chronic LBP. After treatment in 2 groups - real
      heating and cooling combination treatment and sham heating and cooling combination treatment
      - the investigators will compare the effects of pain relief and improvement in disability and
      range of motion of lumbar region. So the investigators will confirm the efficacy of heating
      and cooling combination therapy, and further the best treatment method. In addition, the
      investigators are going to evaluate the safety of abnormal reaction during the treatment.

    <description>Modified schöber test measures the flexion range of motion of lumbar spine. First, investigator marks the point at patients' lumbosacral junction. Then also marks the points at upper 10cm and lower 5cm of the former point in standing position. After marking the 3 points, patients bend anteriorly as best he or she can. Then, investigator measures the length of the latter 2 points.</description>

    <description>The patients in this group received heating and cooling combination therapy by a certified Korean Medicine Doctor with more than 6 years of oriental medicine college education and 2 years of clinical experience. Doctor press 8 acupuncture points which is treated in LBP patients and select the most painful 2 acupuncture points. Device's probe is attached to the acupuncture points in 15 minutes. Probe's temperature is changed 5 cycles from maximum 45℃ to minimum 15℃.</description>

    <description>The patients in this group received sham heating and cooling combination therapy in same conditions of treatment group except the temperature. Before the treatment begin, caregiver measure the patient's skin temperature. Then probe's temperature is changed 5 cycles from 1℃ over the skin temperature to 1℃ under the skin temperature.</description>
