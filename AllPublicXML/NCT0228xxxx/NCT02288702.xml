  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 1 in every 700 babies born in the United States has Down's Syndrome (DS; Trisomy 21),
      99% of whom have some degree of intellectual disability. Recent advances in medicine have
      resulted in a dramatically improved lifespan of about 25 to 60 years of age. Yet, there is
      limited data about anesthetic management in this increasing patient population. The
      bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a non-invasive monitoring device that reports a value
      between 0 and 100correlating to level of consciousness of an individual. A value of 0
      indicates lack of brain activity while 100 indicates an awake/alert state. This monitor can
      be used to assess the depth of anesthesia. Patients with intellectual disability from
      congenital neurological diseases have lower BIS values compared to patients without any
      neurological impairment (Valkenburg 2009). The results may suggest that DS patients would
      require less anesthetic drugs compared to patients without any neurological impairment. To
      date, there are no studies in DS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the Valkenburg group's study (2009), one might hypothesize that if the BIS value is
      fixed for all patients, then a patient with an intellectual disability such as a patient with
      DS would require less anesthetic drugs compared to a control patient without any neurological
      disability. However, if one is only using a clinical sedation scale, the DS patient may
      receive more anesthetic drugs in order to achieve the same level of clinical unconsciousness
      as a patient without DS.

      This project seeks to elucidate the effect of anesthetic techniques and agents on patients
      with DS compared to those without DS and any intellectual disability. The goal of this
      project is to compare BIS values in patients with DS to those without DS undergoing a
      standardized general anesthetic technique. The investigators hypothesize that patients with
      DS would have lower (&gt;25%) BIS values compared to those without DS.

      Known potential sources of artifact signals that could change BIS values include
      electromyographic activity, electric devices, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and the timing and
      type of anesthetics used (Duarte 2009, Dahaba 2005). These potential sources will be
      identified and reported during the study, and those patients will be excluded from the study

    <description>We will be monitoring BIS in both groups. A BIS monitor may be placed prior to induction or immmeditaely afterwards for monitoring BIS. All patients will receive general anesthesia. A standard inhalation induction agent such as sevoflurane and oxygen will be administered via face mask with or without an oral airway. An inhalation agent will be administered for the duration of the procedure. The MAC goal for inhalation agents will be 1. If the patient moves, the MAC goal will be increased to 1.5 and this change will be recorded.</description>
