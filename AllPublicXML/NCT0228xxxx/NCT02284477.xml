  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Phthalate is an endocrine disrupting chemical, which works as an anti-androgenic agent.

        -  Phthalate is mainly used as PVC plasticizer and easily found in commonly used products
           such as electronic device, paint, lubricant, surfactant, medical supplies, spray etc.
           Especially, PVC blood bag used for blood transfusion have been reported to have high
           level of phthalate concentration.

        -  Previous studies reported that urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites and HOMA
           (Homeostatic model assessment, indicator of insulin resistance) has positive
           association.

        -  Previous studies also reported negative associations between urinary phthalate
           concentration and pulmonary function.

        -  Exposure to phthalates occurs mainly through oral route. Food wrapping with phthalate
           containing package material is expected to be one of the major contributor for phthalate
           exposure.

        -  In this present trial, the investigators are to examine whether increased phthalate
           exposure by consuming beverage stored in PVC containing packing materials actually
           effect insulin resistance, pulmonary function and epigenetic feature.

        -  For this aim, the investigators will conduct a cross-over trial.
