    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if delayed dosing of recombinant human
      papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine in 9-18 year old girls
      elicited an equivalent immune response (geometric mean titers to HPV 6,11,16, and 18 as
      measured one month after receipt of a 3rd dose of HPV vaccine) when compared to vaccine
      delivered according to the recommended dosing schedule.

      This was a prospective observational study of healthy 9-18 year old female patients receiving
      either a second or third dose of HPV vaccine as part of their well child care. Immune
      responses to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 were measured both before and 1 month after the third
      dose of HPV vaccine with the purpose of comparing the immune responses to HPV vaccine when
      administered at naturally occurring longer dosing intervals to the immune response to HPV
      vaccine when administered as routinely recommended.

      In addition, girls receiving a 3rd dose of HPV vaccine as well as concomitantly administered
      vaccines by injection were randomized to receive either the HPV vaccine first or their
      concomitantly administered vaccines first. Pain following vaccination was assessed in each
      arm using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised.

      Please note: This record refers only to the observational portion of the study. Please refer
      to NCT00862810 for the results of the randomized portion of the study.
