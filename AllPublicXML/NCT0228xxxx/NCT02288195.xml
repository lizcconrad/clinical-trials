  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although neoadjuvant radiotherapy greatly decreases local recurrence in locally advanced
      rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery, it inevitably results in short-term and long-term
      toxicities. More importantly, it has not been confirmed that neoadjuvant radiotherapy could
      improve overall survival. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of chemotherapy
      alone using a combination regimen known as XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin ) and
      selective use of the standard treatment to the standard treatment of chemotherapy and
      radiation.

      This randomised, open-label, multicentre,phase 3 trial began in August, 2014, as an adjuvant
      trial comparing capecitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy alone,in
      patients aged 18 years to 75 with clinical stage II-III locally advanced rectal cancer from
      six Chinese institutions.

      Patients with local advanced rectal cancer (T2N+ or T3-4aNany,M0, CRM≥2mm, 5-12cm from the
      anus) were scheduled to Group A: receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (4 cycles of XELOX:
      oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 day 1，capecitabine 2000mg/m2 days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) followed
      by radical surgery and 4 cycles of XELOX ( oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 day 1，capecitabine 2000mg/m2
      days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) and Group B :chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy plus capecitabine
      1650 mg/m² administered orally and concurrently with radiation therapy for 5 days per week.)
      followed by radical surgery and 6 cycles of XELOX ( oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 day 1，capecitabine
      2000mg/m2 days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) The primary endpoint was overall survival;
      analyses were done based on all patients with post-randomization data.
