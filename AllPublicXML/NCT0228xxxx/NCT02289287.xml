  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is defined as a sudden vascular accident that causes brain damage and neurological
      impairment. Literature shows that a stroke has a negative effect on participation.
      Self-Management (SM) is defined as health promotion and education programs used mostly for
      people with chronic diseases, which aim at helping patients to maintain a feeling of
      wellness. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a group-based SM
      program for post-stroke patients in a community setting, and its contribution to improving
      participation, compared to standard care.

      At enrollment eligible patients will be randomized to Intervention + Standard Care or
      Standard Care group. Within 3 weeks after enrollment all participants will undergo baseline
      assessment using a predefined set of scales and questionnaires (intervention group will
      additionally undergo a semi-structured interview). The group-intervention (SM program) will
      begin after enrollment of at least 4 participants to the intervention group, and within no
      longer than 5 weeks since enrollment. The intervention will include 12 weekly sessions, each
      session 2.5 hour long, and will be based on well-known SM interventions that were found
      effective for stroke patients in the U.S. Standard care will include 'one-on-one' sessions in
      each paramedical discipline as given regularly in this setting (average of 15-20 sessions per
      patient). Follow-up measures will be performed within a week after the end of the
      intervention, and 6 months thereafter, in order to examine long term effectiveness. Outcome
      measures are questionnaires; change will be assessed by the difference in total score between
      T1 |(pre-intervention), T2 (post-intervention) and T3 (after 6 months)
