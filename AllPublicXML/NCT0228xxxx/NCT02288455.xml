    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the GTU
      artificial urinary sphincter device in restoring continence in males who have confirmed
      urinary stress incontinence for a minimum of 12 months with primary etiology being radical
      prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

      Prospective, non-randomized multi-center study testing the safety and efficacy of the GTU
      artificial urinary sphincter device in males with urinary incontinence.

      Up to 20 sites in Europe, Australia &amp; New Zealand

      A sample size of 73 subjects is estimated to provide 80% power for efficacy. Accounting for
      10% attrition, 82 subjects will be enrolled to provide non-missing data on 73 subjects.

      First Subject Enrolment: July 2014 Last Subject Enrolment: September 2015 Last Subject
      Follow-up: September 2016 Study Primary Endpoint Completion: January 2016

      Each subject will be followed for approximately 14 months. Study duration is approximately 27
      months.

      Subjects will be evaluated at the screening, pre-implant, implant, 6 weeks post implant for
      device activation, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month post device activation.

      The Sponsor (GT Urological, LLC) will work with a Contract Research Organization (CRO) to
      assist in investigative site monitoring for this clinical investigation.
