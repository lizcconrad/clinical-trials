             nonresponder is defined by a dermal blood flow (DBF) of ≤ 100% increase from baseline
             (normal skin) compared to DBF 30 minutes after application of 0.4 mL (approximately
             300 µg) of capsaicin cream (Axsain®, 0.075% capsaicin w/w).

          -  Subject does not respond to the histamine challenge at screening or day -1. A
             nonresponder is defined by an insufficient wheal (mean diameter &lt; 0.5 cm) and/or flare
             (mean diameter &lt; 2 cm) reaction (visually assessed and measured by trained staff
             member) after 10 minutes of the histamine intradermal injection.

          -  Subject has a history of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior. Any suicidal ideation
             within the last 3 months (a level of 4 or 5 for any 1 item on the scale), or who are
             at significant risk to commit suicide, as judged by the investigator using the C-SSRS
             at screening and on admission to the clinical unit on day -1.

          -  Subject has any of the liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], Alanine
             aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma glutamyl transferase, total
             bilirubin [TBL]) above the upper limit of normal (ULN). In such a case the assessment
             may be repeated once on day -1.

          -  Subject has any clinically significant history of allergic conditions (including drug
             allergies, asthma, eczema, or anaphylactic reactions, but excluding untreated,
             asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

             gastrointestinal, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic,
             urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, and/or other major
             disease or malignancy, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Subject has/had febrile illness or symptomatic, viral, bacterial (including upper
             respiratory infection), or fungal (noncutaneous) infection within 1 week prior to
             admission to the clinical unit.

          -  Subject has any clinically significant abnormality following the investigator's review
             of the physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and protocol defined clinical
             laboratory tests at screening or day -1.

          -  Subject has a mean pulse &lt; 40 or &gt; 90 bpm; mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 140
             mmHg; mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mmHg (vital sign measurements taken in
             triplicate after subject has been resting in supine position for 5 minutes; pulse will
             be measured automatically) on day -1. If the mean pulse, mean SBP or mean DBP is out
             of the range as specified above, 1 additional triplicate measurement may be taken.

          -  Subject has a mean QTc(F) interval of &gt; 430 ms (for males) and &gt; 450 ms (for females)
             at day -1. If the mean QTc(F) exceeds the limits above, 1 additional triplicate ECG

          -  Subject has a skin disease, acute or chronic (e.g., atopic dermatitis) or any active
             dermatological conditions, local pigmentary disorders, or body art (e.g., tattoos)
             that might interfere with the clinical study assessments.

          -  Subject has any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject
             unsuitable for clinical study participation.
