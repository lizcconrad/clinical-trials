  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, increased abdominal fat, fat stored in the liver, and insulin resistance may all be
      associated with adverse maternal and fetal pregnancy outcomes. This study will examine how
      fat storage changes during pregnancy; and if how the body stores fat impacts one's ability to
      metabolize glucose (sugar) during pregnancy.

      This study aims to serially evaluate liver and visceral fat stores during pregnancy and their
      relationship with glucose and lipid metabolism, placental function, and newborn size. To do
      this we will conduct both a prospective cohort study of pregnant women without
      pre-gestational or early gestational diabetes assessed at both 12-16 weeks gestation and at
      32-36 weeks gestation and a case-control study of women with normal and impaired glucose
      tolerance in the early third trimester. Physical assessments will be performed by the Oregon
      Health and Science University bio-nutrition unit and will include the use of magnetic
      resonance imaging, ultrasound, and blood draws.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess visceral adipose fat and intrahepatic lipid stores change during pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>12-16 weeks and 32-36 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare visceral adipose fat and intrahepatic lipid levels in early pregnancy (12-16 weeks gestation) to late pregnancy (32-36 weeks gestation). This will done by comparing changes in accumulation of fat in the visceral adipose tissue, changes in intrahepatic lipid values and changes in total body fat in early and late pregnancy. We will be collecting body composition measurements and utilizing ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</description>

    <time_frame>34 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a matched case-control design with matching for body mass index to compare intrahepatic lipid, visceral adipose tissue, total body fat, and insulin sensitivity among women with gestational diabetes and normal glucose tolerance, as measured at 32-36 weeks gestation.</description>
