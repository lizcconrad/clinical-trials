  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine deficiency remains widespread worldwide with children as among the vulnerable groups
      considering their stage of growth and development. In the Philippines, current data shows an
      optimal status among schoolchildren, however no data exists on iodine status nor intake of
      preschool children. One recent approach to improvement of the vitamin and mineral status of
      the population is home fortification using micronutrient powder or MNP. This contains 15
      vitamins and minerals, including iodine and iron. Current guidelines exist for MNP use to
      improve iron status and reduce anemia among infants and young children 6-23 months old, but
      did not mention use among preschoolers such as those in day care centers. This study,
      therefore, aims to compare the iodine status and growth of day care children given MNP for 6
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iodine is an essential trace element for normal growth and development in animals and man
      (Hetzel, 1989). When iodine requirements are not met, thyroid hormone synthesis is impaired
      resulting in hypothyroidism and a series of functional and development abnormalities called
      iodine deficiency disorders or IDD develop (WHO, 2007).

      WHO estimated that two billion people worldwide, including 1/3 of school-age children (de
      Benoist et al. cited by Zimmerman, 2011) suffer from iodine deficiency. Evidence is lacking
      as to whether schoolchildren are good proxy for other groups such as young children
      (Sullivam, 2010). In the Philippines, no data exists on the iodine status of preschool
      children.

      One recent approach for improving the vitamin and mineral status of the population is the use
      of micronutrient powder which contains 15 vitamins and minerals including iodine (HF-TAG
      2011). While the MNP has been found effective to improve iron status, its effectiveness in
      improving iodine status has yet to be studied. Further, the provision of iodine through MNPs
      as well as the combined impact of salt iodization and use of MNPs, warrant investigation. It
      would also be of interest to generate data on the knowledge, attitude and practices of their
      parents or other caregiver who primarily take care of planning and provision of food for the
      family on iodine, iodized salt and MNP.

      Day care centers (DCC) are chosen as the site of the study considering their conduct of
      120-days supplementary feeding yearly and the organized structure presents a better
      compliance and easier monitoring of use. Further, the day care pupils, more or less,
      represent the preschoolers in the barangay and there may be commonality (homogeneity) of the
      children in age and other characteristics.

      In the absence of guidelines for MNP use among children 24 months or older, the existing
      guidelines such as 60 sachets in 6 months as stipulated in DOH AO 2011-0303 will be followed.
