        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document

          2. Documented diagnosis of MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES), classified according to FAB
             (FRENCH-AMERICAN BRITISH) classification criteria

          3. Adequate course of treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent (azacitidine for
             injection or decitabine) as the last therapeutic intervention for MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC
             SYNDROMES) prior to beginning screening for this study. Adequate is defined as:

             - having received at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with azacitidine for
             injection, or

             - having received at least 4 consecutive 6-week treatment cycles with decitabine
             (3-day regimen) or at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with decitabine
             (5-day regimen), or

             - having demonstrated inability to tolerate treatment with an injectable
             hypomethylating agent because of unacceptable drug-related toxicity after at least 3
             months of attempted treatment: Three 28-day cycles of azacitidine for injection or
             decitabine 5-day regimen; two 42-day cycles of decitabine 3-day regimen.

          4. Documented disease progression or stable disease as best response to treatment (or
             attempted treatment) with azacitidine for injection or decitabine. Those achieving an
             objective response to treatment regimen with an injectable Hypomethylating agent (HMA)
             are excluded from participation in this study.

             Definitions of disease progression are modified from IWG (INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP)
             2006 criteria and include:

             - Pre-injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline bone marrow myeloblasts:

             a. Less than 5%: ≥ 100% increase to ≥ 8% blasts b. ≥ 5%: ≥ 50% increase to ≥ 10%
             blasts Note: ≥ 30% blasts is considered AML (ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIAT) per FAB
             (FRENCH-AMERICAN BRITISH)classification. Subjects known to have ≥ 30% blasts are not
             eligible for inclusion in this study. RECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)
             nizing limitations of blast cell quantification, this protocol will allow subjects
             with pre-enrollment bone marrow blast counts up to 33% on the screening bone marrow
             examination to be considered for inclusion. Assessment may be made according to local
             bone marrow examination to facilitate enrollment of eligible subjects into the
             treatment phase of the study.

             - Any clinical worsening from pre-injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline
             condition, including:

               1. sustained clinically-significant worsening (investigator's assessment) from
                  baseline granulocyte, platelet, or hemoglobin values (≥ 2 values, separated by ≥
                  2 weeks)

                  - worsening granulocytes should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable HMA
                  (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value

                    -  worsening platelets should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable HMA
                       (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value (untransfused)

                    -  worsening hemoglobin should be ≥ 1.5 g/dL decrease from preinjectable HMA
                       (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value in subjects not receiving RBC (RED
                       BLOOD CELL) transfusions

               2. meaningful worsening in RBC (RED BLOOD CELL) or platelet transfusion requirement

             Definition of stable disease is based on modified IWG (INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP)
             2006 criteria:

             - Failure to achieve any objective response (CR - complete remission, PR - partial
             remissino, mCR - marrow complete remission, or HI - hematologic improvement), but no
             evidence of disease progression within the 8 weeks leading to the subject's first dose
             of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) in this study (Cycle 1, Day 1)

          5. Have the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING
             AGENT) - azacitidine for injection or decitabine) not more than 16 weeks prior to
             screening for this study (date of informed consent signature).

          6. No less than 3 weeks between the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable
             HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) - azacitidine for injection or decitabine) and the planned
             date of first dose of IP (IINVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT).

          7. Have an ECOG (EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          8. Females subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP)1 may participate, providing they
             meet the following conditions:

               1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to
                  starting any IP therapy: serum pregnancy test at screening and negative serum or
                  urine pregnancy test (investigator's discretion) within 72 hours prior to
                  starting treatment with IP (Cycle 1, Day 1). They must agree to ongoing pregnancy
                  testing during the course of the study (before beginning each subsequent cycle of
                  treatment), and after the last dose of any IP. This applies even if the subject
                  practices complete abstinence2 from heterosexual contact.

               2. Agree to practice true abstinence2 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and
                  source documented) or agree to the use of highly effective methods of
                  contraception from 28 days prior to starting azacitidine, and must agree to
                  continue using such precautions while taking azacitidine (including dose
                  interruptions) and for up to 90 days after the last dose of azacitidine.
                  Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a
                  responsible physician

               3. Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least
                  90 days after the last dose of IP.

        Note that the screening serum pregnancy test can also be used as the test prior to starting
        IP (Investigational Product) if it is performed within the 72-hour timeframe.

        9. Male subjects must:

          1. Male subjects must:

               1. Either practice true abstinence2 from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to avoid fathering a child, to use highly
                  effective methods of contraception, male condom plus spermicide during sexual
                  contact with a pregnant female or a female of child bearing potential (even if he
                  has undergone a successful vasectomy) from starting dose of IP (Cycle 1 Day 1),
                  including dose interruptions through 90 days after receipt of the last dose of
                  azacitidine.

          2. Refrain from semen or sperm donation while taking IP and for at least 90 days after
             the last dose of IP.

             10. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any
             study-related assessments or procedures conducted.

             11. Be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

             12. Understand and voluntarily sign a biomarker-specific component of the informed
             consent document prior to any study-related procedures conducted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Rapidly-progressing MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES), defined as:

               1. Known clinically-significant doubling in marrow or perIP (INVESTIGATIONAL
                  PRODUCT) heral blood blast percentage (to ≥ 20%) in the 8-week period leading to

             to have ≥ 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this study. Recognizing
             limitations of blast cell quantification, this protocol will allow subjects with
             pre-enrollment (screening/baseline) bone marrow blast counts up to 33% to be
             considered for inclusion.

          3. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant
