  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an ankle foot orthoses (AFO) on
      the primary outcome of peak walking time (PWT) in patients with peripheral artery disease
      (PAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that PAD patients using an AFO during a graded
      exercise test will demonstrate a greater PWT compared to PWT assessed without the use of an
      AFO. Secondary hypotheses include evaluation of the effect of an AFO on: 1) calf muscle
      function, 2) claudication onset time, 3) functional ability, 4) peak oxygen consumption, and
      5) patient-reported outcomes. We will also examine the effects of the AFO on outcomes
      following 12 weeks of community walking.

    <description>Ankle foot orthoses (AFO) are light-weight, low profile carbon fiber devices that store and release energy during ambulation. The AFO, in combination with standard of care advice to walk more, will be used to determine if there is any improvement in PAD patient outcomes.</description>
