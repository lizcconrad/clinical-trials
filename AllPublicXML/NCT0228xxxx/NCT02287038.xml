      The current available treatments for PTSD are not fully effective for cognitive symptoms of
      PTSD and have high drop-out and poor engagement, two factors found to be most indicative of
      overall return to functioning for patients with PTSD. Successful completion of this pilot
      clinical trial may build a platform for future large scale double-blind, placebo-controlled
      studies using either atomoxetine or psycho-stimulants or other cognitive enhancing
      medications. The response inhibition related measurements are sensitive to psychotropic
      medications. Therefore it is advantageous for us to use GNG and Stop Signal approaches to
      investigate individual treatments response in the investigators' future research. The
      investigators believe GNG and Stop signal approaches together with pharmacogenetic approach
      will provide valuable information to direct future individualized medicine.

    <textblock>
      PTSD is a debilitating disorder that is common among Veterans returning from Iraq and
      Afghanistan (OIF/OEF) due to the high risk of exposure to combat and other trauma. Recently,
      emerging evidence suggest a strong link between PTSD and ADHD. The co-occurring ADHD symptoms
      are likely to reflect the impairment in cognitive function, which often expressed as reduced
      attention span, concentration difficulties, impaired decision-making abilities, and memory
      problems (LaGarde et al, 2010). Co-occurring ADHD cognitive impairments add another layer of
      complexity to the disease process and pose more severe impairments in daily function. While
      treatments for the avoidance, arousal, and re-experiencing symptoms associated with PTSD for
      military personnel are readily available, substantial gaps exist in the treatment of the
      cognitive deficits associated with PTSD. Further, ADHD cognitive symptoms are associated with
      poorer patient attendance to medical appointments, poorer medication compliance and increased
      risk for psychotherapy resistance and medication abuse or diversion (Kolar et al., 2008).
      Consistent attendance is the best predictor of patient functional recovery from PTSD (Tarrier
      et al., 2000). Subsequently, untreated co-occurring ADHD cognitive symptoms that increase the
      risk for problems in patients' PTSD treatment engagement, PTSD treatment responses,
      functional impairment, and quality of life have tremendous negative impact on treatment
      outcome. However, in so far, studies have not examined the impact that treating ADHD
      cognitive symptoms have on PTSD treatment engagement, outcome, and functional recovery. The
      proposed study directly addresses this knowledge gap by testing the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of atomoxetine (ATX) in treatment of ADHD cognitive symptoms among those
      with comorbid ADHD/PTSD. The investigators' research is directly responsive to the mission of
      RR&amp;D-SPiRE &quot;to maximize functional recovery&quot; of cognitive function in PTSD. The outcome of
      the proposed research will be significant, because it will provide a knowledge base to help
      determine who is at risk for developing problems with treatment engagement among PTSD
      patients, thereby allowing for development of early intervention strategies before drop-out.
      More importantly, the new knowledge may lead to discovering new targets for novel and more
      effective treatments for PTSD. This novel clinical trial may have immediate benefit to
      Veterans by enhancing their cognitive function, reducing ADHD symptom related disabilities
      and further improving quality of life for Veterans with comorbid ADHD/PTSD.

    <description>Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales-Self-Report: Short Version (CAARS-S:S, Conner et al, 1999): The CAARS-S:S is a 26-item questionnaire that assesses symptoms of ADHD in persons aged 18 years. T-scores above 65 indicate a likelihood of moderate to severe ADHD symptoms and impairment. (This is a crossover design, which means that subjects either take placebo or medication for four week and then it will blindly switch to either medication or placebo depending on what the subjects took at previous period. Therefore, the investigators have to have two primary outcome measures for each subject, either placebo first then the medication second, or medication first then placebo second. One is at week 5(Day 36) and the other at week 9 (Day 71) both are the end of the trials for either placebo or medication).</description>

    <description>The Adult ADHD Quality of Life-29 (AAQOL-29, Brod et al, 2006): AAQoL-29 is a participant-reported outcome measure used to examine disease specific functional impairments and quality of life for adults with ADHD. The AAQOL-29 includes Life Productivity, Psychological Health, Quality of Relationships, and Life Outlook subscales. Higher scores on the AAQOL-29 indicate better functioning.

        Subjects will be recruited from Charleston VAMC OIF/OEF Screening Clinic. Additionally,
        Veterans with or without PTSD may be recruited through Savannah CBOC referrals if
        Charleston VAMC does not have a sufficient number of participants. The study will be open
        to all Veterans from Iraq Freedom Operation and Afghanistan who meet eligibility criteria
        regardless of ethnicity, gender or socioeconomic status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans age 20 to 60 with PTSD and significant ADHD symptoms (CAARS-S:S &gt; 65);

          -  Good physical health.

          -  Evidence of combat as defined by:

               -  Trauma exposure sufficient to meet Category A of PTSD criteria (Breslau and
                  Kessler 2001)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age younger than 20 or greater than 60.

          -  Known sensitivity to ATX

          -  Presence of disorders that could conceivable be exacerbated by atomoxetine
             (specifically, narrow angle closure glaucoma, urinary outflow obstruction,
             hypertension, and neurological disorders, particularly tics and Tourette's syndrome,
             or a history of epilepsy or seizures).

          -  Use of concomitant medication that could potentially interact with atomoxetine
             including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), antihypertensive medication, or any
             concomitant medication that was a cytochrome 2D6 inhibitor (CYP2D6), since
             atomoxetine's elimination involves the CYP2D6 system.

             otherwise specified. The project will allow presence of depressive disorders if the
             depressive episodes are secondary to PTSD.

          -  Current substance dependence and abuse (within 3 month).

          -  Females who are pregnant.
