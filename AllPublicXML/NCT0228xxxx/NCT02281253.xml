  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a bakery product enriched with dietary
      fibre and L-carnitine on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in overweight patients
      with or without metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conceivably, different biochemical changes in insulin-mediated signalling pathways may
      contribute to an impaired insulin-mediated glucose transport and metabolism that eventually
      results in insulin resistance and the clinical features of metabolic syndrome. According to
      this, both compounds -L-carnitine and dietary fiber- interacting by different mechanism of
      action could improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the health
      beneficial effects of the combination of both compounds are not shown and confirmation of the
      functionality of such products must be accomplished by conducting the appropriate studies
      intervention nutrition.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess changes in hydrocarbonated metabolism parameters before and after fibre+carnitine/placebo administration</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected in vacutainer serum separator tubes, after 12-hour overnight fasting, to analyze glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentration at baseline (after a four weeks run-in period of a healthy diet), and 12 weeks after fibre+carnitine/placebo administration.
Glucose was determined using enzymatic techniques and insulin and C-peptide were measured by an enzymatic luminescence technique in an autoanalyzer. Insulin resistance was calculated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA = (fasting insulin (μU/mL×) fasting glucose (mg/dl)/405).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate changes in lipid parameters before and after fibre+carnitine/placebo administration</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected in vacutainer serum separator tubes, after 12-hour overnight fasting, to analyze lipid profile at baseline (after a four weeks run-in period of a healthy diet), and 12 weeks after fibre+carnitine/placebo administration. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by means of enzymatic assays, and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) concentrations were recorded with an autoanalyzer using a direct method. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration was calculated using the method of Friedewald. Non-HDL concentration was obtained by calculating the difference between total cholesterol and HDL. LDL subfractions were separated by high-resolution polyacrylamide gel tubes. The LDL electrophoretic profile allows 2 patterns to be defined: pattern A or large and buoyant LDL, and pattern non-A or small and dense LDL.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate changes in a composite measure of inflammatory parameters before and after fibre+carnitine/placebo administration</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected in vacutainer serum separator tubes, after 12-hour overnight fasting, to analyze inflammatory markers at baseline (after a four weeks run-in period of a healthy diet), and 12 weeks after fibre+carnitine/placebo administration. Levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were analysed using a flow analyser system</description>

    <description>Before dietary therapy was initiated, in order to stabilise dietary patterns prior to intervention, patients were submitted to a 4-weeks run-in period of a caloric restriction of 500 Kcal to their usual diet. After this adaptation period, two intervention groups were evaluated: a calorie-restricted diet plus bread-enriched product that received 15.08 g of dietary fibre (9.49 g of insoluble fibre and 5.59 g of soluble fibre) plus 2325 mg of L-carnitine/day in 130 g of bread (enriched group) and a calorie-restricted diet plus placebo bread group whose diet included 130 g/day of not-enriched bread (placebo group).</description>

    <description>The enriched bread consisted of a mix of wheat flour, vegetable flour, rye flour, wheat gluten, soy protein, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre, inulin, guar gum, L-carnitine salt, diacetyl tartaric, enzymes, ascorbic acid, water and yeast.
Patients were recommended to consume the bread twice per day with main meals.</description>
