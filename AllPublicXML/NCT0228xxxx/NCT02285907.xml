  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the consumption of a beef-rich lunch improves appetite control, satiety,
      and energy intake regulation while reducing food reward and food cravings compared to the
      consumption of a soy-rich lunch when matched for macronutrients and fiber content or when
      match for serving size. The mechanisms of action surrounding the differential responses of
      beef versus soy proteins were also explored.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, crossover design, acute study was completed in 21 healthy adults (age 23 ±1 y;
      BMI: 23.8 ± 0.6 kg/m2) to compare 400 kcal lunch meals varying in protein quality. Two
      separate comparisons were performed. The first comparison consisted of macronutrient and
      fiber-matched lunches which varied in protein quality: 24 g beef protein vs. 24 g soy
      protein. The second comparison matched serving size only: 1 serving of beef (24 g protein
      with 0 g fiber) vs. 1 serving of soy (14 g protein; 5 g fiber). For each treatment, the
      participants completed 2 testing days per lunch treatment. During the &quot;Appetite Assessment
      Days,&quot; each participant reported to the lab to consume one of the lunch meals. Pre and 7-h
      post-lunch appetite and cravings questionnaires were completed throughout each testing day
      along with plasma, hormonal responses, and plasma amino acid concentrations through repeated
      blood sampling. Ad libitum dinner energy intake was also measured. During the &quot;Reward
      Assessment Days,&quot; the participants reported to our facility to again consume one of the lunch
      meals. Pre and post-lunch neural responses to food stimuli, through functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), occurred followed by ad libitum consumption of a lunch dessert.

    <measure>Net Incremental Area Under the Curve (niAUC) of Perceived Hunger and Fullness</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Computerized questionnaires, assessing perceived sensations of hunger and fullness were completed throughout the testing days. The questionnaires contained a visual analog scale incorporating a 100 mm horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded as &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; with anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; Each reported score can be a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100 mm. niAUC was calculated for perceived hunger and fullness by computing the summation of the average change from baseline score (units of mm) for each time point and the subsequent time point, multiplied by the difference in time (units of min) between the two measures (also referred to as the trapezoidal rule). For reported feelings of hunger, a higher score can be interpreted as &quot;feeling more hungry&quot; throughout the day. For reported feelings of fullness, a higher can be interpreted as &quot;feeling more full&quot; throughout the day.</description>

    <measure>Net Incremental Area Under the Curve (niAUC) of Plasma Total Glucagon-like Peptide (GLP-1) and Total Peptide YY (PYY)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>The samples were collected in test tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Protease inhibitors (pefabloc SC and dipeptidyl peptidase) were added to some of the tubes to reduce protein degradation. The plasma was separated and stored in microcentrifuge tubes at -80°C for future analysis. Plasma total glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) were measured for all time points using the Milliplex multi-analyte profiling magnetic bead-based multi-analyte, metabolic panel, 2-plex assay (Millipore, St. Charles, MO) and Magpix Luminex technologies (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). niAUC was calculated for perceived circulating GLP-1 and PYY throughout the testing period by computing the summation of the average change from baseline score (units of pg/ml) for each time point and the subsequent time point, multiplied by the difference in time (units of min) between the two time instances (also referred to as the trapezoidal rule).</description>

    <measure>Food Cue-stimulate fMRI Brain Scans</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants viewed 3 categories of pictures including food, nonfood (animals), and blurred baseline images. The pictures from each category were presented in blocks of images. Animal pictures were used to control for visual richness and general interest (i.e., appealing but not appetizing). To determine the effects of protein type on neural activity associated with food motivation, repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on the brain activation maps within the Brain Voyager software with use of stimulus [food (i.e., appetizing and appealing) vs. nonfood (i.e., animal, nonappetizing but appealing] and protein source (BEEF vs. SOY) comparisons within the macronutrient and fiber-matched condition and the serving size-matched conditions, separately. The mean percent signal change in the maximum voxel within each region that displayed significant activation after the BEEF and SOY meals was then determined. Talairach coordinates for each region are presented for each row as (x;y;z).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Amino Acids</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured from the pre and hourly postprandial time points until dinner request following the Macronutrient and Fiber Matched BEEF meal and the Serving Size Matched Beef Meal. An average amino acid concentration was then determined from the change from baseline concentration for all available time points. Plasma amino acid analyses were performed through the University of Missouri-Columbia Agricultural Experiment Station Chemical Laboratories using cation-exchange chromatography (cIEC-HPLC) coupled with post-column ninhydrin derivatization and quantitation.</description>

One participant was withdrawn due to protocol violations prior to beginning the fourth treatment. All 21 remaining participants completed all interventions of a randomized cross-over study to compare 400-kcal lunch meals varying in protein quality but matched for either macronutrient or fiber content or serving size (Macronutrient and Fiber Matched BEEF, Macronutrient and Fiber Matched SOY, Serving Size Matched BEEF, and Serving Size Matched Soy). The participants completed 2 testing days per lunch treatment. On the first day, participants completed the 8 hour testing day with repeated blood sampling and appetite questionnaires. During the second testing day, pre- and post-lunch food cue–stimulated fMRI brain scans were completed. Within each treatment, the first and second testing days were separated by 2–7 days. However, there was 7–14 days in between each treatment.</description>

In the macronutrient and fiber–matched comparisons, both lunch meals contained 24-g protein and 2-g fiber, differing only in the type of protein consumed (beef vs. soy). In the serving size–matched comparisons, the lunch meals contained 1 serving of beef (24-g protein/1-g fiber) or 1 serving of soy (14-g protein/5-g fiber). The participants completed 2 testing days per lunch treatment. On the first day, participants completed the 8 hour testing day with repeated blood sampling and appetite questionnaires. During the second testing day, pre- and post-lunch food cue–stimulated fMRI brain scans were completed. Within each treatment, the first and second testing days were separated by 2–7 days.

        <title>Net Incremental Area Under the Curve (niAUC) of Perceived Hunger and Fullness</title>
        <description>Computerized questionnaires, assessing perceived sensations of hunger and fullness were completed throughout the testing days. The questionnaires contained a visual analog scale incorporating a 100 mm horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded as “how strong is your feeling of” with anchors of “not at all” to “extremely.” Each reported score can be a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100 mm. niAUC was calculated for perceived hunger and fullness by computing the summation of the average change from baseline score (units of mm) for each time point and the subsequent time point, multiplied by the difference in time (units of min) between the two measures (also referred to as the trapezoidal rule). For reported feelings of hunger, a higher score can be interpreted as &quot;feeling more hungry&quot; throughout the day. For reported feelings of fullness, a higher can be interpreted as &quot;feeling more full&quot; throughout the day.</description>

        <title>Food Cue-stimulate fMRI Brain Scans</title>
        <description>Participants viewed 3 categories of pictures including food, nonfood (animals), and blurred baseline images. The pictures from each category were presented in blocks of images. Animal pictures were used to control for visual richness and general interest (i.e., appealing but not appetizing). To determine the effects of protein type on neural activity associated with food motivation, repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on the brain activation maps within the Brain Voyager software with use of stimulus [food (i.e., appetizing and appealing) vs. nonfood (i.e., animal, nonappetizing but appealing] and protein source (BEEF vs. SOY) comparisons within the macronutrient and fiber–matched condition and the serving size–matched conditions, separately. The mean percent signal change in the maximum voxel within each region that displayed significant activation after the BEEF and SOY meals was then determined. Talairach coordinates for each region are presented for each row as (x;y;z).</description>
