    <textblock>
      As part of the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) commitment, the objectives of the study
      are to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and to determine the safety and
      tolerability of diclofenac potassium oral solution in pediatric subjects experiencing mild to
      moderate acute pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study with pediatric subjects, ages 2-12 years, who will be dosed with
      diclofenac potassium oral solution, based on weight, every 6 hours as needed for the
      treatment of mild to moderate acute pain for up to 4 days. PK samples will be collected
      through 6 hours after the first dose. Safety data will be collected throughout the study.
