      Open- Label, Single Arm Study. To evaluate the safety profile of Orectalip® (oxaliplatin),
      fluorouracil and leucovorin as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of high-risk stage-Ⅱ
      colorectal cancer.

      Primary end point:To evaluate the incidence of grade 0-3 neurosensory symptoms (paresthesia)
      in the end of study.

      Other end points:The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea,
      diarrhea vomiting over the 12 weeks.

      Safety will be evaluated including vital signs are recorded at all visits.

      There were 18 out of 20 patients who completed the trial and eligible for statistical
      analysis, 2 patients withdraw because the wound infection. There were 11 (61%) male patients
      and 7 (39%) female patients. The patients aged from 30 to 73 years and their mean age was
      50.4 years.

      The grade of each adverse event evaluation mainly allocated in Grade 0 and Grade 1. The
      incidence of Grade 3 or 4 was only found for the following symptoms: leucopenia, neutropenia,
      and anemia. One (6%) adverse event of leucopenia occurred at visit 1 and visit 2,
      respectively. One (6%) adverse event of neutropenia occurs at visit 1, visit 2, and visit 3,
      respectively; while 2 (13%) events occurred at visit 5. One patients suffered adverse event
      of anemia at visit 5 and visit 6.
