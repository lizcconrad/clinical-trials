  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this investigator-initiated trial is to evaluate the impact of platform
      algorithm products designed to rapidly identify pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic
      (PD) genomic variation on treatment outcome of depression in adolescents. This new technology
      may have the potential to optimize treatment selection by improving response, minimizing
      unfavorable adverse events / side effects and increasing treatment adherence

      Treatment seeking adolescent patients with a moderate to severe major depressive episode
      defined as a 40 or greater on Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) will be
      invited to participate in this study evaluating the GeneSight® platform. This new technology
      can rapidly assess PK and PD genetic variation that can potentially impact antidepressant,
      anti-psychotic, and stimulant treatment selection. These patients will have GeneSight®
      testing and will be randomized to one of two groups. In Group 1 (n=138), GeneSight® testing
      results will be available to the patient's treating clinician prior to treatment selection.
      In Group 2 (n=138), testing results will not be available to the patient's research treating
      clinician. However, all testing results will be made available to all participants and
      clinicians after the 8-week trial (upon completion of blinded assessments at week 8). The
      patients and the clinical raters will be blinded to group assignment.
