      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and feasibility of
      next day discharge home in patients undergoing balloon-expandable transfemoral TAVR utilizing
      the Vancouver 3M Clinical Pathway in low, medium, and high volume North American centres.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing elective transfemoral TAVR with
        a balloon expandable transcatheter heart valve

          1. Considered at increased surgical risk by the Multidisciplinary Heart Team.

          2. Informed written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non -cardiovascular co-morbidity reducing life expectancy to &lt; 3 years

          2. Any factor precluding 1 year follow-up

          3. Inadequate CT image acquisition to perform area-based annular CT sizing, exclude
             adverse root features, and determine a coaxial valve deployment angle (CT is not
             required for valve-in-valve procedures)

          4. Predicted inability to perform uncomplicated percutaneous vascular access and closure

          5. Iliofemoral diameter &lt; 6 mm for SAPIEN XT or &lt;5.5 mm for SAPIEN 3 (measured at or
             above the mid-femoral head)

          6. Inpatient (unless clinically stable, mobilizing at baseline, and primarily in hospital
             for logistical reasons.

          7. Significant communication barrier(s) that interfere with ability to follow
             peri-procedural and discharge instructions

          8. MMSE &lt; 24/30 (unless language barrier or limited formal education), 5-metre gait &gt; 7
             seconds (unless chronic mobility impairment not affecting ability to perform ADLs),
             and ADL &lt; 6/6

          9. Insufficient social support to facilitate next day discharge

         10. Airway unfavourable for emergent intubation

         11. Inability to lay supine without conscious sedation or general anesthetic

         12. Not receiving a balloon expandable transcatheter heart valve
