      The purpose of the study is to establish wether a contrast medium applied to the middle ear
      can be used to diagnose pathology in the auditory tube. We will examine patients with and
      without middle ear disease with CT after the application of an iodine based contrast medium.

      Introduction Dysfunction in the auditory tube / Eustachian tube (ET) is a frequent problem
      that may cause a series of middle ear conditions. Middle ear atelectasis, retraction of the
      tympanic membrane, in some cases &quot;retraction pocket type-cholesteatoma&quot; (5), chronic otitis,
      perforation of the tympanic membrane and conductive hearing loss due to poor middle ear
      ventilation are all associated with ET-dysfunction. The ET consists of two parts, the mobile
      cartilaginous part medially, and the fixated bony part laterally. The bony part is demarcated
      by thin bony walls and situated in the close proximity of vulnerable anatomical structures,
      while the cartilaginous part is supported by parapharyngeal soft tissue. Recent years, a new
      treatment procedure of ET balloon dilation has emerged. Restoration of ET function has
      offered a new approach for this large group of patients with great reduction of symptoms and
      secondary middle ear disease.

      Only the cartilaginous part of the ET is accessible for treatment procedures. We also know
      that 20% of the patients dilated do not respond to dilation, and relapse of middle ear
      disease occurs (2). At present, no diagnostic procedure can distinguish between later
      responders and non-responders to dilation. Therefore, level diagnostics of obstruction and
      possibly identification of other discriminating parameters are important. Computer tomography
      (CT) is considered necessary before any type of tube intervention, mainly to exclude
      obstruction in the bony part of the tube or identification of any other pathoanatomical
      condition to contraindicate balloon dilatation. Visualisation of obstructions in the
      cartilaginous part is not possible with today's methods. Nor does the method provide any
      information on tube function.

      There is a need for better diagnostic imaging of the ET. In this project we plan to develop a
      method for contrast medium application to the ET via the middle ear followed by CT imaging.
      The purpose is to tell whether the ET is open or on which level it is obstructed. So far some
      publications have showed that contrast media can pass through the ET (6,7,8), but no
      systematic trials have been published, clarifying the potential of the method.

      We have recently conducted studies on temporal bone specimens from human cadavers and on 8
      living rabbits. Results from these studies are not yet published, but our hypotheses are
      supported that the method for ET visualisation is feasible, safe, and that contrast media
      passes unhindered through a normal ET after application in the middle ear (6,7,8).

      Hence the next step of the trial is to explore whether the method provides new information in
      human subjects with and without tube dysfunction.

      Hypotheses Contrast medium applied in the middle ear passes through the ET and is visualised
      in the epipharynx in the following CT examination of the temporal bone in individuals with
      healthy middle ears and ET.

      Contrast media applied in the middle ear does not pass through the entire ET and is not
      visualised in the epipharynx in the following CT examination of the temporal bone in
      individuals in the patient group.

      It is possible to identify a highest level of obstruction after contrast media application in
      the middle ear based on visual identification of the lowest visible level of contrast medium
      in the ET in the following CT examination of the temporal bone in the patient group.

      Level of obstruction of the ET predicts outcome of ET balloon dilation.

      Material One fifth of chronic patients with otitis media with effusion (OME) have no
      beneficial effect of balloon dilation (2). We hypothesize that contrast media will not pass
      through the bony part of the ET in a majority of these patients, while it does in a majority
      of the patients experiencing successful relief of disease after balloon dilation. Variation
      is not known, but is presumed not to exceed 20%. Sample size calculation is not
      straight-forward in this case, handling dichotomous variables. Power calculation indicates a
      needed number of 80 individuals in the patient group to have a power of at least 80% for the
      detection of difference between these 2 groups with an alpha level of 5% with two-sided
      tests. Additionally, we include 15 controls with presumed healthy middle ears and ET to
      verify significantly better contrast media passage to epipharynx in these individuals than in
      the group of patients with chronic OME, based on similar power calculation.

      Recruitment of this number to undergo a CT examination with contrast carefully administered
      through the tympanostomy tube will be done during a clinically indicated and planned CT to
      avoid excess radiation dose and additional visits to the hospital for the patients.

      Mb Meniere patients are occasionally treated with tympanostomy tubes, although they do not
      have middle ear pathology. This patient group also routinely undergoes CT-examination of the
      temporal bone. Hence we plan to include 10 patients with mb Meniere and tympanostomy tubes to
      be examined with a similar contrast medium CT protocol as described above as a healthy
      control group.

      Method Out patients referred to the Ear, nose and throat (ENT)-clinic for OME will be offered
      to be part of the study, given that they qualify according to the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. All patients will be given written information and a consensus form.

      At their first visit, the ENT- surgeon will control the status of the eardrum and middle ear
      by otomicroscopy. The extent of pneumatisation / atelectasis and fluid in the middle ear will
      be evaluated in addition to the state and position of the tympanic membrane. With a nasal
      endoscope the condition of Rosenmullers fossa and the function of torus tubarius will be
      examined. The latter is controlled by asking the patient to equalize pressure while the scope
      is in the nasopharynx, and the opening of the torus can be seen. The patients and controls
      are interviewed structurally for symptoms related to middle ear and temporal bone disease.

      Included patients without a tympanostomy tube will be given one the same day as the clinical
      examination. The patients who are not treated with nasal corticosteroids will be prescribed
      them for use up until the first control.

      CT will be performed after 3-4 weeks. At the CT-lab an ENT-surgeon will drip 2 ml iodixanol
      contrast medium diluted with saline (NaCl) to 20% into the tympanostomy tube while the
      patient lies on his / her back with the head slightly turned to the opposite side. After
      turning the head to a neutral position and a delay of 10 minutes the CT examination will be
      conducted using 200 milliampere (mA) and 120 kilo volt (kV).

      Reconstructions will be made from the raw material. In addition to axial and coronal
      reconstructions, images series will be reconstructed in an oblique coronal image plane.

      The physicist will contribute to achieve the best possible protocol. As an example it is
      possible to use different kV values while keeping the dose parameters (CTDIw) on the same
      level as for the existing temporal bone protocol. By allowing the mAs value to change, we
      will be able to decide on the optimal kV level for this study, without exposing some of the
      patients to higher radiation dose.

      The physicist will also be involved in the optimisation of the reconstruction of the images
      of ET. The images will be reconstructed with different filters and degrees of iterative
      reconstruction. Using radiologists as observers, the optimal reconstruction settings for the
      Eustachian tube will be selected. The physicist will also calculate organ doses and effective
      dose for the patients.

      All patients included in the study will be treated with balloon dilation in general
      anaesthesia, 3 - 4 weeks after the CT procedure. The ENT surgeon will be blinded to the
      result from the contrast media part of the CT examination. In relation to the hospital stay
      for balloon dilation patients will be repeatedly examined and interviewed similarly to the
      examination at inclusion.

      Follow-up is conducted 3 months and 6 months after balloon dilatation with renewed clinical
      examination and interview, according to the presently established routine follow-up.

      Parameters to be noted from the different time points are CT findings including contrast
      media passage, clinical and biochemical signs on inflammation and/or infection, symptoms
      related to middle ear or temporal bone disease and/or general infection, and clinical result
      from ET balloon dilation finally dividing the patient group into responders or non-responders
      from dilation.
