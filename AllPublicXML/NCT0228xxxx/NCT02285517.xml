    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial study that compare two plastic surgery techniques in patients with
      third degree of burning and both techniques are used in all patients but in different areas
      of burning sites of the patients.

      PATIENT REGISTRATION:

      The patients are registered after careful examination for third degree of burning and based
      on the need for skin grafting and of course a written consent were acquired. Excluded
      patients were those with an infected lesion or those who did not allow us to enter them into
      the study.

      Progression of the treatment results of both techniques were visited by the surgeon
      regularly.

      At the end of the study the data were checked with other similar studies. The acquired data
      were compared to other external data sources via medical records.

      There were two standard operating techniques: modified meek skin grafting technique and mesh
      skin grafting technique.

      The data was analyzed by chi-square and t-test.
