  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to explore whether associations exist between metrics
      obtained from PET/MRI incorporating advanced MRI sequences and features of bladder cancer,
      including grade, stage, and treatment response.

      The investigators will assess an advanced non-Gaussian diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) model
      termed diffusion kurtosis imaging, multi-echo T2 mapping, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI
      using a motion-robust high-temporal and high-resolution radial acquisition scheme employing
      compressed sensing, and simultaneously acquired 18-fluoro (18F)- fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG)
      data. Preliminary data demonstrates the investigators ability to execute and evaluate all of
      these techniques at the investigators center. The investigators hypothesize that these
      techniques will be sensitive to functional and metabolic differences between subsets of
      bladder cancer cases and will improve upon the performance of current imaging protocols in
      bladder cancer characterization. Moreover, the investigators believe that these techniques
      will provide complementary information, such that they may be combined in a synergistic
      fashion for bladder cancer evaluation.

          -  Inability to tolerate MRI including conditions such as claustrophobia or inability to
             lay flat for &gt; 45 minutes.

          -  Presence of pacemaker/implantable cardiac device (ICD) or perfusion pumps

          -  Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial
             heart, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, bullets, tattoos near the
             eye, or steel implants.

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with
             the patient's participation in the study
