  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erdheim-Chester Diseases (ECD) is a very rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis of unknown
      origin and pathogenesis. It has been reported mainly in adult males over the age of 40 years,
      although cases have been reported in females as well. Children are rarely affected. Mutation
      of the BRAF gene, specifically BRAFV600E, has been recently identified in 50% of Erdheim
      Chester lesions in a French cohort. This somatic mutation is believed to be the driver
      mutation in positive cases. The clinical characteristics of ECD range from asymptomatic to
      multisystemic involvement; longitudinal progression and natural history are becoming better
      understood. ECD commonly affects the bones, kidneys, retroperitoneal space, skin and brain.
      If untreated, the disease progresses rapidly, causing fatal outcomes due to severe lung
      disease, chronic renal failure, cardiomyopathy and other complications. The diagnosis of ECD
      relies upon imaging studies and specific pathologic findings in biopsies of affected organs,
      i.e., fibrosis and infiltration of tissues with foamy histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma
      cells. Immunohistochemistry reveals cells positive for CD68 and CD163 and negative for CD1a,
      with 20% positivity to S-100. There is no standard treatment for ECD, although chemotherapy,
      radiation, stem cell transplantion, alpha-interferon, anakinra, imatinib and sirolimus have
      been proposed. The recent discovery of the BRAFV600E mutation in several ECD patients has
      opened a new area for treatment options. Vemurafenib, an FDA approved BRAF inhibitor for the
      treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma with the V600E mutation, binds
      to this form of mutated BRAF causing protein inactivation. The use of vemurafenib in patients
      with ECD has been reported in 3 patients who experienced remission of the disease, and is
      currently being studied in the U.S. and Europe as monotherapy. Tumor/disease resistance to
      vemurafenib has occurred in melanoma and other cancers, although it has not been reported in
      patients with ECD. In this protocol, we propose to clinically evaluate ECD patients with the
      BRAFV600E mutation and administer combination therapy with dabrafenib, a BRAFV600E inhibitor,
      and trametinib, an inhibitor of MEK, downstream of BRAF. Screening for possible
      contraindications will be made prior to the administration of the first dose. With this
      trial, we will determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib
      in patients with ECD who harbor the BRAFV600E mutation. Dabrafenib 150mg will be given twice
      daily p.o.; trametinib 2mg will be given once daily p.o. Patients will be seen 1 week, 1
      month, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months, 8 months, 10 months and 12 months to complete a
      oneyear trial.

      NRAS, MAP2K1, PIK3CA, ARAF and other genes of the RAS pathway that are currently being
      studied. The clinical characteristics of ECD range from asymptomatic to multisystem
      involvement; longitudinal progression and natural history are becoming better understood. ECD
      commonly affects the bones, kidneys, retroperitoneal space, skin and brain. If untreated, the

      enrolled after amendment #6 of 12/27/2015) at a dose of 100mg will be given twice daily p.o.;
      trametinib 2mg will be given once daily p.o. Patients will be seen at 1 week, 1 month, 2
      months, 4 months, and 6 months, 8 months, 10 months and 12 months to complete one year of
      therapy and off therapy follow ups will happen at 15 months, 18 months and 24 months to
      complete a 2 year trial.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  All patients will be previously or simultaneously enrolled in the natural history ECD
             protocol #11-HG-0207, Clinical and Basic Investigations into Erdheim Chester disease .
             Eligible patients must have been diagnosed with Erdheim Chester disease, confirmed by
             pathological evaluation of the affected tissue with adequate staining. Affected tissue
             must harbor the BRAF V600E or V600K mutation.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than or equal to 20 mm
             with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to 10 mm with spiral CT scan,
             MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Patients must have BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutations, identified by an FDAapproved test
             at a CLIAcertified lab. If test at CLIAcertified lab used a nonFDA approved method,
             information about the assay must be provided. (FDA approved tests for BRAF V600
             mutations in melanoma include: THxID BRAF Detection Kit and Cobas 4800 BRAF V600
             Mutation Test).

          -  Prior treatment, involving interferon, anakinra, imatinib, steroids, chemotherapy
             with, but not limited to cladribine, vinblastine, 6-mercaptopurine and etoposide, or
             other medications used empirically for the treatment of ECD, will be acceptable. These
             therapies should have been completed and discontinued 4 weeks or more prior to
             enrollment in this study.

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in
             patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible
             for future pediatric trials.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 (Karnofsky greater
             than or equal to 70%).

        Exception will be made for patients with ECOG performance status less than or equal to 3
        and Karnosfky performance scale greater than or equal to 50%, who require the use of
        wheelchairs, walkers or canes as well as assistance with daily routines secondary to
        disabilities caused by ECD cerebellar or brain disease that has been stable for greater
        than or equal to 3 months.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any clinically
             significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as
             malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to1.2x10(9)/L

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to100x10(9)/L

               -  Albumin greater than or equal to2.5 g/dL

               -  Serum bilirubin less than or equal to1.5x institutional upper limit of normal
                  (ULN) except subjects with known Gilbert s syndrome

               -  Aspartate aminostransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or
                  equal to2.5x institutional ULN

               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to1.5 mg/dL OR calculated creatinine
                  clearance (Cockroft-Gault formula) greater than or equal to 50 mL/min

               -  Prothrombin time (PT)/International normalized ratio (INR) and partial
                  thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to1.3x institutional ULN; subjects
                  receiving anticoagulation treatment may be allowed to participate with INR
                  established within the therapeutic range prior to randomization.

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to institutional lower
                  limit of normal (LLN) by ECHO

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to registration or randomization.

          -  Pregnancy and breast feeding.

        The effects of dabrafenib and trametinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
        this reason women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception
        (barrier method of birth control, or abstinence; hormonal contraception is not allowed due
        to drug-drug interactions which can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective) for the
        duration of study participation, and for at least 2 weeks after treatment with dabrafenib
        or for 4 months after dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Should a woman become
        pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should
        inform her treating physician immediately.

        Based on studies in animals, it is also known that dabrafenib may cause damage to the
        tissue that makes sperm. This may cause sperm to be abnormal in shape and size and could
        lead to infertility, which may be irreversible.

        Safety and efficacy of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in pediatric
        populations have not been investigated. Dabrafenib or trametinib-dabrafenib combination
        should not be administered to pediatric populations outside clinical trials.

          -  Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by
             the site. Exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus
             warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR. Consequently, when
             discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring
             via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate.
             Prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency.

             preceding the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days (or five half-lives, whichever is
             shorter; with a minimum of 14 days from the last dose) preceding the first dose of
             study treatment and during the study. Patients that have used other BRAF or MEK
             inhibitor are excluded.

             of study enrollment.

          -  Patients with history of RAS mutation-positive tumors are not eligible regardless of
             interval from the current study. Note: RAS testing and absence of RAS mutation are
             required for eligibility.

          -  Leptomeningeal or brain metastases or metastases causing spinal cord compression that
             are symptomatic or untreated or not stable for greater than or equal to 3 months (must

             corticosteroids &gt;1 month or who have been off of corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks
             can be enrolled with approval of the CTEP medical monitor. Subjects must also be off
             of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants for &gt;4 weeks.

             interfere with the subject s safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with
             study procedures.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             dabrafenib/trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to treatment with
