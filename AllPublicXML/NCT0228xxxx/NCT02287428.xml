  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new type of vaccine as a possible treatment for patients
      with MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which
      tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate
      dose of the intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the
      intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It
      also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized
      NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a
      vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the
      participants tumor. It is known that glioblastomas have mutations (changes in genetic
      material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor. These mutations can cause the
      tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is
      possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may
      help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the glioblastoma to come back in the
      future.

      It is known that glioblastomas have mutations that are specific to an individual patient's
      tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very
      different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may
      induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could
      cause glioblastoma to recur.

      Methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein which can be increased in some
      cancers, including glioblastoma. MGMT works to repair the DNA of cancer cells that are
      damaged by treatment. If a tumor is found to be &quot;unmethylated&quot;, it means there is more MGMT
      present in the tumor than one that is &quot;methylated&quot;.

      Methylation of MGMT is believed to make tumor cells more responsive to drugs like
      temozolomide. Studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in
      outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated. This study is for patients
      with MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma.

      Patients with glioblastoma usually receive six weeks of radiation with a daily chemotherapy
      called temozolomide after their surgery, followed by six to twelve months of additional
      temozolomide. In this study, participants will not take temozolomide, as their tumors are
      MGMT-unmethylated, and studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement
      in outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.

      Instead, on this trial, participants will receive the Personalized NeoAntigen Vaccine after
      completing six weeks of radiation:

      - Therapy On This Study:

        -  Surgery

        -  Followed by six weeks of radiation therapy

        -  Followed by a series of vaccine administrations (~ 7 months)

      The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points
      and will examine the participant blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune
      response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        NOTE: Eligibility will be confirmed and participants registered on 2 separate, serial
        occasions on this trial: 1.) Initial Study Screening: Shortly after initial resection,
        newly diagnosed patient is identified and screened. Once overall trial eligibility is
        confirmed and participant is registered to study, the creation of the participant's vaccine
        is initiated. 2.) Secondary Screening: As participant's 1st study vaccine dose may not be
        administered until 10-17 weeks from initial study registration, there will be a secondary
        &quot;screen&quot; conducted after participant has completed RT and his/her vaccines have been
        prepared, to ensure s/he meets criteria to receive study treatment. If confirmed eligible
        for this next phase of the study (eligible to treat), participant will proceed to receive
        vaccines on study.

                  Molecular Diagnostics and Cytogenetics Laboratory in the Center for Advanced
                  Molecular Diagnostics (CAMD); there they will utilize their standard clinical
                  two-step methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect DNA
                  methylation within the promoter region of the MGMT gene. Fully methylated and
                  unmethylated control DNAs are run concurrently with each assay to ensure quality
                  control

               -  Only those results that read &quot;Unmethylated&quot; will be eligible for this trial;

             contraception to prevent pregnancy or to abstain from sexual activity throughout the
             study, starting with visit 1 through 4 weeks after the last dose of study therapy.
             Approved contraceptive methods include, for example: intra uterine device, diaphragm
             with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male condoms, or female condom with
             spermicide. Spermicides alone are not an acceptable method of contraception

             (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
             of HCG) within 7 days prior to start of study medication, because the effects NeoVax
             on the developing human fetus are unknown. It is the investigators' responsibility to
             repeat the pregnancy test should start of treatment be delayed
