      of the intra-arterial infusion of stem cells in diabetic patients type 2.

      Diabetic patients will include with critical ischemia chronicle of at least a low member limb
      (CLI) and without possibilities of revascularization. 48 evaluable patients will be included,
      of which 36 patients will be included in the experimental group (12 for every cellular group)
      and 12 in the group control by conventional treatment. The population to studying will be
      constituted by 48 evaluable patients.
