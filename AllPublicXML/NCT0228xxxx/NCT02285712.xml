    <textblock>
      Peripheral intravenous access is a major intervention in patients admitted to an intensive
      care unit. Systematically performed by nurses, it is also an essential intervention when the
      central venous access has to be removed. However, in the intensive care unit, patient
      centered-characteristics such as previous history of intravenous drug abuse, obesity, history
      of multiple vascular punctures or fluid overload most often affect the success rate of this
      procedure. For these patients, failure consequences are numerous: 1) delayed discharge from
      the intensive care unit, 2) increased pain and dissatisfaction, 3) increased incidence of
      catheter-related bloodstream infections. The use of ultrasound has gained increasing
      popularity particularly for obtaining central venous access. We hypothesize that, among
      trained nurses, ultrasound-guided peripheral venous access could represent an attractive
      alternative compared to the traditional anatomical method in order to increase the success
      rate.
