      This study aims to observe the effects of the availability of plerixafor on the time and
      effort associated with autologous peripheral blood stem cell collection.

      This non interventional study will consist of two parts:

      I. Retrospective study:

      A medical record review will be conducted covering 200 patients file undergoing peripheral
      blood stem cell mobilization in some European centers.

      II. Prospective study :Time/Motion evaluation of actual apheresis - 20 events each center The
      actual apheresis events will be measured in consecutive patients scheduled to be candidates
      for peripheral blood stem mobilization in the apheresis area of the hospital. Each apheresis
      will be considered as one event . Should the patient receive more than 1 apheresis, each
      apheresis will be considered as one different event.

        The study will consist of two parts:

        I. Retrospective study:

        A medical record review will be conducted covering 200 patients file undergoing peripheral
        blood stem cell mobilization in different European centers. Patients will be selected from
        each of centers, evenly divided between two eras: 1) prior to approval of plerixafor= Pre-P
        era (July 2009); and 2) after approval of plerixafor= P era .

        II. Prospective study :Time/Motion evaluation of actual apheresis - 20 events each center
