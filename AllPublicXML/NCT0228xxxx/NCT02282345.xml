  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if talazoparib can help to control
      breast cancer that has a BRCA mutation (genetic change). The safety of talazoparib will also
      be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Talazoparib is not FDA-approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Main Study:

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take talazoparib
      capsules by mouth 1 time each day at about the same time every morning. While it is not
      required, if you have a caregiver, you should advise them to wear gloves when handling the
      talazoparib capsules.

      You will be given a study drug diary to write down what time you take talazoparib and if you
      miss or vomit any doses. You will return your completed study drug diary and study drug
      bottles with any unused study drug to each study visit. While it is not required, if you have
      a caregiver, you should advise them to wear gloves when handling the talazoparib capsules.

      If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower your study drug dose or have
      you stop taking the drug. You may be able to restart the study drug at the same or a lower
      dose. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      On the days that you have study visits, you will take your dose of study drug at the clinic.
      Do not take your dose of study drug at home on these days.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every week, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor
      approves it, you may not have to return to the clinic on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 2. You may
      have these blood draws done at a local laboratory and have the results sent to the study
      doctor. Your study doctor will discuss this with you.

      On Days 1, 8, and 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker,
      PGt, and proteomic testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may be related
      to your reaction to the study drug.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2,you will have an ultrasound of your breast(s) to check the status of the
      disease.

      Within 7 days before completing treatment with talazoparib:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker, PGt, and proteomic testing.

        -  You will have a core biopsy and an image-guided FNA to check the status of the disease
           and for biomarker, PGt, and proteomic testing.

      After your last dose of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ultrasound of your breast(s) to check the status of the disease.

      After Cycle 2, you will receive chemotherapy and/or have surgery to remove the tumor as part
      of the standard of care for the disease. You will be given a separate consent form that
      describes this procedure and its risks. During the surgery, some of the tissue that is
      removed will be collected to check the status of the disease and for biomarker, PGt, and
      proteomic testing. After the surgery, you may be called by the study doctor to ask how you
      are doing. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      Cell lines will be created using your collected tissue. Cell lines are blood or tissue cells
      that are grown in a laboratory or in research animals.

      Xenograft models will be created using your collected tissue. A xenograft is taking a graft
      of tissue from one donor and transplanting it into another. For this study, we will take a
      graft of your tissue and transplant it into a mouse to help us better understand BRCA
      mutations.

      After surgery, you will receive chemotherapy as part of the standard of care for the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You will receive up to 2 cycles of study drug.You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      If you stop taking the study drug because the disease got worse, you will have an
      image-guided core biopsy and FNA performed for biomarker testing, including genetic
      biomarkers, proteomic testing, and PGt testing. This will be performed before you start any
      new chemotherapy treatments as part of your standard care.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the surgery.

      Expansion Cohort:

      Study Visits:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take talazoparib
      capsules by mouth 1 time each day at about the same time every morning. While it is not
      required, if you have a caregiver, you should advise them to wear gloves when handling the
      talazoparib capsules.

      You will be given a study drug diary to write down what time you take talazoparib and if you
      miss or vomit any doses. You will return your completed study drug diary and study drug
      bottles with any unused study drug to each study visit.

      you stop taking the drug. You may be able to restart the study drug at the same or a lower
      dose. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Do not take your dose of study drug at home on these days.

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 only, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.
      You may have these blood draws done at a local laboratory and have the results sent to the
      study doctor. Your study doctor will discuss this with you.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 only, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      biomarker, PGt, and proteomic testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may
      be related to your reaction to the study drug.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and Day 1 of Cycle 5, you will have an ultrasound of your breast(s) to
      check the status of the disease.

      After receiving study drug for up to 6 cycles, you will have surgery to remove the tumor as
      part of the standard of care for the disease. You will be given a separate consent form that
      describes this procedure and its risks. During the surgery, some of the tissue that is
      removed will be collected to check the status of the disease and for biomarker, PGt, and
      proteomic testing. After the surgery, you may be called by the study doctor to ask how you

      You will receive up to 6 cycles of study drug.You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      If you stop taking the study drug because the disease got worse, you will have an
      image-guided core biopsy and FNA performed for biomarker testing, including genetic
      biomarkers, proteomic testing, and PGt testing. This will be performed before you start any
      new chemotherapy treatments as part of your standard care.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the surgery.

    <description>Response assessed by radiographic evaluation of tumor by ultrasound during the 2 months of single agent Talazoparib. Bi-dimensional measurements used to evaluate response. A 20% increase in bi-dimensional primary tumor size or 20% increase in size of any measurable, biopsy-proven regional lymphadenopathy constitutes progression and removal from the Talazoparib single agent treatment. In addition, pathologic complete response (pCR) and residual cancer burden (RCB) measured. pCR defined as complete absence of any viable invasive cancer cells in resected breast and lymph nodes.</description>
