  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals older than 60 years old, discharged after suffering brain stroke with referral to
      the rehabilitation outpatient clinic, will be assessed for orthostatic balance. Patients with
      positive Romberg test are invited to participate in the trial. Participants will be
      randomized to either the current rehabilitation protocol or to an supplemental intervention
      focused on oculomotor and gaze stability exercises to be applied at home for three weeks.
      Participants will be assessed with standardized, validated tools.

      The study aims to evaluated the effect of a home program of oculomotor and gaze stability
      exercises on improvement the balance in stroke patients.

      Individuals older than 60 years old, discharged after suffering brain stroke and referred to
      the neurologic rehabilitation outpatient clinic, will be assessed for a neuro-motor deficits.
      Patients will be consider eligible if they had positive Romberg test (disorder of orthostatic
      balance) and they will be invited to participate in the trial. Patients with previous balance
      problems will be excluded.

      Participants will be allocated in two intervention groups through block randomization, either
      the current rehabilitation protocol or to an supplemental intervention focused on oculomotor
      and gaze stability exercises to be applied at home for three weeks. Participants will be
      assessed with Motor Assessment Scale, Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test.
