    <textblock>
      Up to 20 enrolled subjects will be treated. Subjects will receive two Ulthera® treatments on
      the axillas provided 30 days apart. Follow-up visits will occur at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days
      following the last treatment.

      Protocol amendment: The study was expanded to enroll an additional 20 subjects into Group A.

      This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial. Up to 20 subjects who
      are naïve to Ultherapy for treatment of hyperhidrosis will be enrolled and treated at a 2.0mm
      depth at two different treatment densities (Group A and Group B).

      Group A will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid,
      12 treatment squares, 60 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at
      0.30 J of energy.

      Group B will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid,
      12 treatment squares, 40 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at
      0.30 J of energy.

      Gravimetric sweat production measures and starch iodine tests will be completed at baseline,
      treatment visit #2, and at all follow-ups for all study groups. Digital images of the starch
      iodine test will be obtained. Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) scores will be
      obtained at baseline, each treatment visit, and at all follow-ups for all study groups.
