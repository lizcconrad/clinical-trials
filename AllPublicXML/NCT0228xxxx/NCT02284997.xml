    <textblock>
      Along the edge of the eyelids, there are glands (meibomian glands) that produce and deliver
      oils (meibum) onto the tear film. These oils serve to slow down the evaporation of tears. The
      meibomian glands may become obstructed due to change in meibum quality. When meibum thickens
      and solidifies, it plugs the gland openings and oils can no longer reach the tear film. The
      blockage of the glands is the primary cause of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), and may
      result in symptoms of dry eye (burning, stinging, grittiness, etc.). The typical treatment
      for MGD is a procedure called &quot;warm compresses&quot;. It is a combination of applying heat and
      pressure to the eyelids for approximately 10 minutes to melt the meibum, unplug the gland
      openings, and allow oils to flow normally onto the tear film once again. One way to apply
      heat to the eyelids is by using the MGDRx® EyeBag. The EyeBag is microwaved for 30-40 seconds
      under full power, and is placed over the closed eyes for approximately 10 minutes. The eyes
      are gently massaged afterwards.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective the EyeBag is at improving MGD and
      dry eye symptoms.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Prior to treatment (if applicable). The OSDI is a questionnaire that consists of 12 questions about ocular irritation and the effect of dry eye on vision. For every question, participants check a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals &quot;none of the time&quot; and 4 equals &quot;all of the time&quot;. OSDI scores are calculated according to: OSDI = [(sum of scores for all questions answered)*100] / [(total number of questions answered)*4]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>Class 1 Medical Device, registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. UK Patent: GB2421687B. The EyeBag is made of silk and 100% brushed black cotton and filled with flax / linseed. When heated, this device is intended to warm the eyelids. This melts the meibum and clears the meibum obstruction of the MGs.</description>

          3. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          4. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable;

          5. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect a study outcome variable

          6. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

          7. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment, as determined

             ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which requires therapeutic
             treatment. An exception is made for lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland
             dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye.
             Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or
             inflammation and are therefore not active.
