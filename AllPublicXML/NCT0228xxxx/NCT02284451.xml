  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all patients should
      receive information about HIV/AIDS and HIV testing orally or in writing at every HIV testing
      encounter. However, for busy emergency departments (EDs), delivering information orally is a
      barrier to HIV testing, and written brochures likely are not useful for those with lower
      health or general literacy. Videos might be as or more efficacious than orally-delivered
      information in improving HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge, particularly for those with
      lower health literacy skills. However, the resources required to show videos might limit
      their use in EDs. Pictorial brochures are a promising alternative, but are of unknown
      efficacy.

      The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine if HIV/AIDS and HIV testing information
      should be delivered by a video or pictorial brochure to emergency department (ED) patients to
      improve short-term (in the ED) knowledge about HIV/AIDS and HIV testing; (2) determine if
      longer-term retention (over 12 months) of HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge is greater for
      those who watch a video or review a pictorial brochure; (3) determine if short-term
      improvement and longer-term retention in HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge is better after
      watching a video or reviewing a pictorial brochure for those with lower health literacy, and
      if improvement and retention also varies by language spoken (English or Spanish); and (4) if
      willingness to be tested again in one year is greater for those who watch the video or review
      the pictorial brochure, and if this willingness also varies by health literacy level and
      language spoken.

      Regardless of how patients are informed, the investigators do not know how well or for how
      long HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge is retained, if this information should be delivered
      according to patient needs and abilities, and if retention of this knowledge impacts future
      HIV testing behavior.

      The investigators will conduct a multi-site, randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial among
      600 English- and 600 Spanish-speaking 18-64-year-old ED patients to investigate these
      questions. Using a valid measure of health literacy, the investigators will stratify our
      sample within language by health literacy level (lower vs. higher). The investigators will
      randomly assign patients to receive HIV/AIDS and HIV testing information by video or
      pictorial brochure. At one year post-enrollment, the investigators will offer participants an
      opportunity to be tested again for HIV.

      At each study site (Birmingham,Cincinnati, Los Angeles, and Providence), the investigators
      will recruit 300 patients for a total of 1200 patients. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive HIV/AIDS and HIV testing information from a comparable pictorial brochure
      or a video. Randomization will be stratified by health literacy level (lower vs. higher) and
      language (English or Spanish). Those who are study eligible will undergo verbal consent to
      conduct the pre- and post-information questionnaires and information delivery portions of the
      study (video or pictorial brochure). No patient identifiers will be collected during the
      screening process, pre- or post-information questionnaires, or the information delivery phase
      of the study. For those who agree to be in the next portion of the study, written consent to
      participate will be obtained. Written consent will be obtained at this juncture because HIV
      testing and follow-up is performed, and because patient identifiers are needed for the
      remainder of the study. Participants will complete the study instruments at enrollment and at
      3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up. At the end of one year, they will be offered the
      opportunity to be retested for HIV.

      As primary aims, the investigators will compare the efficacy of pictorial brochures and
      videos in improving short-term (in ED) HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge and retaining this
      knowledge over 12 months. More specifically, the investigators will determine if and how
      short-term improvement and longer-term retention of knowledge interacts with information
      delivery mode (pictorial brochure or video), patient health literacy level (lower or higher)
      and language (English or Spanish).

      As secondary aims, using the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB model as a
      heuristic framework, the investigators will examine components of the IMB model relevant to
      our study and their interrelationships, their impact on HIV re-testing behavior, and the
      moderating influence of information delivery mode, language and health literacy level through
      the model. In regards to HIV re-testing behaviors, the investigators will assess: (1) testing
      uptake at one year post-enrollment when offered as part of the study, (2) testing utilization
      during the study period but not as part of the study, and (3) change in testing utilization
      one year pre vs. post study enrollment.

      Study findings will guide ED-based delivery of HIV/AIDS and HIV testing information; that is,
      whether delivery modes (video or pictorial brochure) should be selected for patients by
      language and/or health literacy level, or whether either mode could be used. The results also
      will inform EDs when, how, and for whom information needs to be provided for those testing
      again for HIV within one year.
