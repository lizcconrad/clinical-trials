  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evidence for poor inhaler technique is both well established and observed worldwide. What
      is unclear from the evidence is why individuals demonstrate poor technique, despite the
      majority admitting to having previously had instruction on inhaler technique. The primary
      research question is 'Will there be a difference between post education inhaler technique
      scores when comparing structured education against informal education?'

      To try and establish why individuals use inhalers incorrectly a semi structured interview is
      proposed
