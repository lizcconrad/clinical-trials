      This study will evaluate patients &gt; 18 years of age with transfusion-dependent
      gastrointestinal bleeding due to documented gastrointestinal vascular ectasia with or without
      concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This study will focus on documented
      bleeding sites in the small bowel, including the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Eligible
      patients will have endoscopically-documented sites of vascular ectasia and will have required
      at least 4 units of blood transfusion or episodes of intravenous iron administration over the
      preceding four months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study that will investigate the efficacy and safety profile
      of pomalidomide in patients with genetically-documented Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
      (defined by characteristic mutations in Eng, Alk-1 or Smad-4) or idiopathic vascular ectasia
      with no documented mutations, leading to refractory bleeding of the small bowel. This study
      will be limited to patients with documented bleeding from the small bowel, including the
      duodenum, jejunum or ileum. Eligible patients will be dependent on transfusion or intravenous
      iron therapy (requiring at least 4 units of blood transfusion or 4 iron infusions over the
      preceding 4 months) and will have endoscopically-confirmed areas of vascular ecstasia.
      Therapy for all eligible patients will be initiated with a 1 mg daily dose of pomalidomide.
      The principal investigator will determine whether intrapatient dose escalation is indicated
      based on the response of the patient's bleeding during the first 30 days of therapy. If dose
      escalation is indicated, pomalidomide will be increased at the investigator's discretion to a
      maximal dose of 5 mg/day. Cessation of GI bleeding will be defined as maintenance of stable
      hemoglobin without blood transfusion or intravenous iron therapy over a 4 week period. Once
      GI bleeding has ceased, patients will be maintained at a stable pomalidomide dose for an
      additional 4 months, and the dose then tapered by 1 mg per month, or until bleeding recurs.
      Patients will be followed for a total of six months post-therapy to determine whether the
      response is maintained.
