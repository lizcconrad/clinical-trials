      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study to compare the PK of 21 desacetyl-DFZ
      and, if data permits, deflazacort in 8 subjects with ESRD to that of 8 healthy matched
      control subjects (age, body mass index [BMI], and gender).

      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study to compare the PK of 21 desacetyl-DFZ
      and, if data permits, deflazacort in 8 subjects with ESRD to that of 8 healthy matched
      control subjects (age, body mass index [BMI], and gender).

      All subjects with ESRD will be on hemodialysis (HD). Dosing of deflazacort followed by PK
      evaluation of 21 desacetyl DFZ and, if data permits, deflazacort, will only be performed on a
      non-HD day.

      On Day 1, that will be scheduled on a non-HD day for subjects with ESRD, a single oral dose
      of deflazacort will be administered followed by serial blood sampling for 24 hours to assess
      the PK of 21 desacetyl-DFZ, and, if data permits, deflazacort.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory
      evaluations.

      Subjects will return to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) 3 days (± 1 day) following study
      drug administration to determine if any adverse events (AEs) have occurred since the last
      study visit. Subjects who terminate the study early will be contacted if the Principal
      Investigator (PI) deems necessary.

      A total of sixteen (16) adult male and female subjects will be enrolled. Renal Impaired
      Cohort: Eight (8) subjects with ESRD on HD. Healthy Match Control Cohort: Eight (8) healthy
      subjects with estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥ 90 mL/min. Subjects will be matched for
      age [± 15 years], BMI [± 15 %], and gender [1:1] to the subjects in the ESRD cohort.

      Each subject will receive a single oral dose of 18 mg (3 X 6 mg tablets) deflazacort,
      following an overnight fast.

      Study drug will be administered orally with approximately 240 mL of water.

    <description>Deflazacort, a glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, is used in treating a variety of diseases. Pharmacologically it is an inactive pro-drug which is metabolized immediately to the active metabolite 21-desacetyl-DFZ. The elimination of this metabolite is primarily via the urine in humans. Its potency is approximately 70 to 90% of prednisone and 6 mg of deflazacort has approximately the same anti-inflammatory potency as 5 mg of prednisolone or prednisone</description>
