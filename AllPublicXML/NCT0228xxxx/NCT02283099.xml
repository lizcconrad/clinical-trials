  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to establish safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP
      (BPSC1001), an Ebola Virus Vaccine candidate (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
      expressing the envelope glycoprotein of Ebola Virus Zaire), investigated at three different
      dose levels in 30 healthy adults in Germany. This study is part of the WHO led VEBCON
      consortium that is aiming to generate harmonized data for the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001)
      vaccine candidate to allow optimized rapid decisions on dose and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess safety and immunogenicity of an experimental ebola
      vaccine.

      An outbreak due to the Ebola Zaire (ZEBOV) strain of unprecedented magnitude and scope and
      with a high mortality continues to spread across West Africa. No vaccine is currently
      licensed.

      The specific opportunity at hand with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) is to achieve long-lasting
      protective immunity to ZEBOV on a time scale of weeks in humans upon a single-shot
      vaccination, offering a discrete benefit over prime-boost vaccination protocols. The current
      outbreak represents a global health emergency and the need for access to therapeutic
      intervention and vaccines is paramount.

      The vaccine investigated in this study might provide a critical tool to suppress future
      out-breaks of EVD in areas at risk.

      This study is 1 of 4 clinical trials currently conducted as part of the WHO-led VEBCON
      consortium, aiming to generate harmonized data for the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) vaccine
      candidate to allow optimized rapid decisions on dose and safety.
