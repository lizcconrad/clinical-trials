  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The last ten years sexually transmitted infections (STI) have substantially increased among
      adolescents. STI can lead to individual suffering and have a negative effect on the future
      reproductive health and also increase the need for health care, thus it is important to
      reduce the number of STIs. HPV vaccination is included in the school-based vaccination
      program since 2012, a catch-up vaccination is offered to older girls and young women aged
      13-25. School nurses have a key role regarding information about HPV and HPV vaccine, and the
      school-based vaccination program has a substantial higher coverage rate. Knowledge is an
      important factor associated with attitude to preventive methods against HPV. In previous
      studies the results indicate that young people have low awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine.
      Interventions can decrease sexual risk taking and influence the intention to receive HPV
      vaccination and increase the use of condom.

      The aim of this study is to increase primary prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV) by
      promoting HPV vaccination and increase condom use among upper secondary students. The aim is
      also to increase the knowledge about HPV, risk and prevention.

    <description>The educational intervention consists of education about HPV and a special designed leaflet and self-reported questionnaires. The educational intervention is included in the regular health interview with the school nurse (scheduled for about one hour) and includes information about HPV; facts about the virus, transmission, what it can cause and prevention (i.e. safe sex with condom use and HPV vaccination), facts about HPV vaccine and the importance of attending future cervical cancer screening controls. Students complete questionnaires before the health interview at baseline and after three months. A follow-up with parts of the boys will be performed with qualitative interviews. Participants (n=40)</description>
