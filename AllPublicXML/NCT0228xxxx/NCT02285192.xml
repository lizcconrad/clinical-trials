  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a radioactive substance called 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose
      (18F- FDG), injected into the cervix during a PET/CT scan done before surgery can show us
      more clearly which lymph nodes in the pelvis (the area near your uterus and cervix) contain
      cancer.

    <description>will assess the ability of SUV to predict malignant disease. The continuous variable of SUV assigned to a given lymph node during Positron Lymphography will be compared with the pathologic assessment (benign vs malignant) of each labelled lymph node. The SUV assigned to a given lymph node is done using the the imaging software and not up to the discretion of the radiologist.</description>

    <description>The first 20 eligible patients will be consented to undergo intracervical 18F-FDG injection during a dynamic PET/CT scan. Study enrollment will occur in the clinic during the visit in which they are consented for surgery. Recruited patients will undergo 18F-FDG-guided PET imaging on the day of their scheduled staging surgery. The experimental PET/CT is anticipated to take 2 hours. The second stage of accrual will replace PET/CT with PET/MRI imaging. In every other aspect, patients will receive standard peri- and postoperative care.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population will include women with stage IB1 cervical cancer (any histologic
             subtype) deemed eligible for surgery, and women with a clinical stage I high-grade
             endometrial cancer planning to undergo surgical staging. High grade is defined by the
             following:

               -  Uterine serous carcinoma

               -  Clear cell endometrial carcinoma

               -  Grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma

               -  Endometrial carcinosarcoma

               -  Clinical stage I grade 1-2 endometrial cancer also eligible with deep myoinvasion
                  ≥ 50% shown on preop MRI and/or elevated preop CA-125 &gt; 35 U/ml.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL

          -  Plasma albumin ≥3 g/dL

          -  Plasma glucose ≤200 mg/dL

          -  Plasma creatinine ≤1.6

          -  Well-controlled hypertension

          -  Medical clearance for surgery and considered an appropriate surgical candidate

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test, if of child-bearing potential

          -  If, based on surgeon's assessment, the patient is recommended to undergo surgical
             staging for histologically confirmed endometrial cancer or if IB1 cervical cancer is
             deemed eligible for surgical treatment of disease

          -  Participation in other research protocols does not exclude a patient from
             participation in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL

          -  Plasma albumin &lt;3 g/dL

          -  GOG performance status &gt;2

          -  Plasma glucose &gt;200 mg/dL

          -  Renal insufficiency with plasma creatinine &gt;1.6

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patient does not meet medical clearance for surgery and is not considered an
             appropriate surgical candidate

          -  Pregnancy

        For Stage 2:

          -  Patient who are unwilling or unable to undergo MRI including patients with
             contraindications to MRI such as the presence of cardiac pacemakers of non-compatible
             intracranial vascular clips, claustrophobia, inability to lie flat for the duration of
             the study etc.

          -  Patients with a metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device in the
             pelvis that might distort local magnetic field and compromise quality of MRI
