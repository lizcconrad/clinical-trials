      This is a single site trial to assess metabolic effects in subjects after a Jejunal Diversion
      procedure was performed.

    <textblock>
      The Jejunal Diversion procedure is an adaptation of a jejuno-jejunostomy, which is a surgical
      procedure often used to address a mix of pathological conditions. The safety of the Jejunal
      Diversion procedure is not in question, but rather understanding the gastrointestinal
      signalling effects. Up to 25 eligible subjects will be enrolled into the trial. Enrollment
      will stop once 15 subjects have undergone the Jejunal Diversion procedure

    <description>The jejuno-jejunostomy surgical procedure is a well-known general surgical operation performed for multiple acute and chronic conditions including Crohn's disease, ovarian cancer, and small bowel obstruction. The jejunal diversion procedure is an adaptation of a jejuno-jejunostomy. The proximal end of the anastomosis is approximately 100 cm distal from the ligament of Treitz. The distal end of the anastomosis is approximately 250 cm proximal from the ileocecal junction.</description>
