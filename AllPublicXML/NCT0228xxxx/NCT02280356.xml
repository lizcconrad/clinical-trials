  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and side effects &quot;of &quot;ultra-hypofractionated&quot;
      radiation therapy when used after brachytherapy (radiation implants). This treatment delivers
      a higher radiation dose with each treatment over a shorter period of time.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to assess urinary functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS index is a seven item questionnaire designed to assess urinary functioning, specifically urinary frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying, and urgency. Questions are rated on a six point Likert scale with higher scores indicating more difficulty in urinary functioning.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo low dose rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy using Pd-103 followed approximately 4 weeks later with hypofractionated image-guided external beam radiation therapy (25Gy in 5 fractions; 5Gy x 5 fractions every other day) to the prostate &amp; seminal vesicles. Both brachytherapy as well as external beam will be performed according to our current standards of practice using the same equipment, techniques, &amp; treatment planning procedures. Pts will be followed post-treatment at 1, 3, 6 (+/- 4 weeks) &amp; every 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) thereafter until 36 months. During the post-treatment followup, pts will be evaluated for urinary, bowel/rectal &amp; sexual toxicity. Baseline measures of these domains will be obtained prior to treatment at the time of enrollment. Serum PSA levels will be drawn on the same schedule as clinical followup. Post-treatment prostate biopsies will be obtained once between 24-36 months post-treatment to evaluate pathologic response to therapy</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Intermediate risk prostate cancer patients will be eligible for this study.
             Intermediate risk grouping will be assessed per NCCN guidelines as:

          -  Pathologically-proven diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  PSA 10-20ng/mL or

          -  Gleason =7 or

          -  Clinical stage T2b/c

          -  Clinical stage T2b/c Additionally, patients will be required to meet the following
             criteria

          -  Age ≥18

          -  KPS≥70

          -  Prostate volume ≤ 60cc (cytoreductive androgen deprivation therapy prior to
             brachytherapy of ≤ 6 months duration will be allowed to achieve this goal). For
             patients with a prostate volume between 50-60ccs, hormone therapy will be at the
             discretion of the physician.

          -  International Prostate Symptom Score ≤15

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior prostate surgery (including TURP)

          -  Prior history of chronic prostatitis or urethral stricture

          -  Inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Prior history of pelvic radiotherapy

          -  Unable to give informed consent

          -  Metastatic disease.
