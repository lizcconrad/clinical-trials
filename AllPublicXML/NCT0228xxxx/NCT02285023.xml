      In the majority of patients with the chronic urticaria, the etiology is unclear, leading to
      difficulties in treatment and high rates of recurrence. According to the International
      EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO Guidelines (the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of
      Allergology and Clinical Immunology(EAACI), the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network
      (GA2LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) in
      Urticaria, using the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire in a routine management
      is the key for a better treatment outcome. To translate this questionnaire into Thai is
      essential in our subject of interest in order to effectively apply it to local patients. The
      Thai-version questionnaire will encourage enhanced as well as impactful therapeutic options
      for Thai chronic urticaria patients.

      1. Adaption of the Cu-Q2oL questionnaire into Thai version by using forward-backward
           translation that is independently performed by two bilingual translators. The original
           Italian version is translated into Thai by two Thai native speakers, then the study team
           reviews the Thai-version Cu-Q2oL questionnaire for items comprehensibility and
           integrates the first consensus version which re-translated into Italian by an Italian
           native speaker afterwards. The comparison between the backward Italian version Cu-Q2oL
           questionnaire and the original Cu-Q2oL is carried out to find out whether there are any
           misconception and mistranslation in the intermediary forward version of questionnaire.
           After that, the second consensus version will be tested on 15 chronic urticaria patients
           to detect any misunderstanding points based on patients' comments. Finally, this
           Thai-version of CU-Q2oL questionnaire will be used to investigate the validity,
           reliability, interpretability and minimal clinical important difference.

        2. To investigate the validity, reliability and interpretability of Thai-version of Chronic
           Urticaria Quality of Life Questionaire (CU-Q2oL), the severity of chronic urticaria
           symptoms will be assessed by investigators and patients using the Urticaria Activity
           Score (UAS7), the DLQI and CU-Q2oL questionnaire.
