    <textblock>
      This Phase I multi-center placebo controlled study is conducted in healthy women with a
      history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) aged between 18 and 70 years.

    <textblock>
      GlycoVaxyn is a Swiss company that has developed a multivalent bioconjugate vaccine for the
      prevention of E.coli-infections. Cystitis is the most common UTI, however kidney infections
      or bacteremia are possible. The E. coli bacterium is responsible for 85 % of all UTIs.

      The objectives of this trial are to assess the safety and ability to elicit an immune
      response of the candidate vaccine as well as the effectiveness of the vaccine in the
      reduction in UTIs .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects with a history of recurrent UTI, which is defined as: ≥ 3 UTI
             independent episodes in the previous 12 months or ≥ 2 UTI episodes in the last 6
             months. At least one UTI during the last 5 years was caused by E. coli (as single
             pathogen or part of polymicrobial infection) and was culture-confirmed and documented

          2. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years

          3. Subjects should be in a healthy state without ongoing or suspected symptomatic UTI at
             the screening visit and at injection day (V2)

          4. General good health, without clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities per clinical judgment of the
             investigator

          5. Willingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been
             explained and fully understood, and written informed consent form obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of more than 10 recurrent UTIs in the year before the screening visit

          2. Use of any short-term urinary catheter within 7 days prior to screening

          3. Use of any permanent catheter within 30 days prior to screening

          4. History of any unresolved urinary tract diseases/abnormalities

          5. Evidence of impaired immune function

          6. Significant cardiovascular, liver, renal diseases and/or insufficiency

          7. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          8. Significant abnormalities in screening results for hematology, serum chemistry or
             urinalysis

          9. Positive test for HIV, and/or evidence of HBV or HCV

         10. BMI &gt;34

         11. Previous immune stimulatory therapy for UTI prevention (such as Urovaxom®, Strovac® or
             Urovac®) in the last 3 months, or planned use during the study period

         12. Current use of any medication known to affect immune function (e.g. corticosteroids
             ≥0.5 mg/kg Body weight/day)

         13. Use of UTI-related vaginal estrogen treatment newly started less than 6 months before
             injection and continuing during the study or planned start during the active study
             period

         14. Use of any antibiotic therapy within 1 week preceding injection

         15. Planned use of post-coital antibiotics for UTI prevention during study period

         16. Any vaccination planned within 30 days before and 30 days after injection

             duration of the study

         18. Previous treatment with immunoglobulins or blood products in the 3 months preceding
             the injection

         19. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine

         20. Presence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator precludes participation in the study

         21. Acute illness at the time of injection

         22. Women of child bearing potential who either have a positive pregnancy test or refuse
             to use an effective contraception

         23. Women who are lactating at any time throughout the study period

         24. Subjects with an elective surgical intervention, planned during the study period

         25. Any other significant finding that in the opinion of the Investigator would increase
