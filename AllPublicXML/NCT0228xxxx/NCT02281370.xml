  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A drug-drug interaction study between eltrombopag and cyclosporine is being conducted to
      support the use of these drugs together in subjects, such as those with severe aplastic
      anemia or immune thrombocytopenia purpura. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate
      the effect of cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag. This is a Phase I,
      open-label, randomized, three-period cross-over study in healthy adult subjects. The study
      consists of a screening visit and three treatment periods. All subjects will be randomized to
      receive one of the three treatments in each treatment period separated by washout periods of
      3-10 days. The total duration of a subject's participation in the study from screening to
      final discharge is up to approximately 6 weeks (assuming 3 day washouts between treatment
      periods). Approximately 39 healthy subjects will be enrolled with the goal of completing at
      least 10 subjects per sequence (total 30).
