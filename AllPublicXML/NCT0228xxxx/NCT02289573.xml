    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) is a common disease among people. Acute
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(AECOPD) is the acute and aggravating
      phase of COPD which may lead to respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation is a very
      important therapy for those patients,but traditional ventilation modes have some defects, so
      investigators need to find new modes to solve these problems. In this study, the
      investigators compare neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and PSV to observe the
      effects on AECOPD patients' air distribution and dead space to determine if NAVA is a more
      appropriate ventilation mode for AECOPD patients.
