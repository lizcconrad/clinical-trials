  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this work is to investigate the influence of dietary salt intake on immune
      function in multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects and healthy controls. This study primarily tests
      the hypothesis that higher dietary salt intake will be associated with a higher frequency of
      pathogenic Th17 cells and impaired function of protective regulatory T cells. If a
      relationship between dietary salt intake and immune function is observed, this study will
      also test: a) whether this relationship is unique to MS subjects or whether it is also
      present in healthy controls, and b) whether healthier immune function can be restored by
      restricting dietary salt intake.

      and b) whether healthier immune function can be restored by restricting dietary salt intake.
      This is a 5-week pilot study of a dietary intervention of 25 subjects with MS or Clinically
      Isolated Syndrome (CIS) by 2010 Diagnostic Criteria who will be identified and recruited from
      the Yale MS Center and/or referred from outside MS centers. 25 age-matched healthy controls
      will be recruited from friends, family members, spouses and the patient waiting room at the
      Yale MS Center.
