  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn more about how Inner Resources for Veterans (IRV)
      meditation therapy helps Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI). PTSD is a disorder that occurs after exposure to one or more
      traumatic experiences. People with PTSD may experience anxiety, pay extra attention to their
      surroundings, involuntarily remember their traumatic experiences, and/or want to avoid
      situations where these symptoms are increased. MTBI may result from being in a blast
      explosion, with pressure from the blast potentially disrupting the brain's structure and
      function. At this time, it is not well known how PTSD and mTBI may affect each other.

      In this study, the investigators will be looking at the behavioral and neurological changes
      (changes in the brain) and the reductions in PTSD symptoms that may come from participating
      in this treatment. The investigators are interested in determining if treatment does reverse
      changes in the brain caused by PTSD and mTBI. To help the investigators understand changes in
      how the brain functions, the participants will complete a functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) scan before and after either a 8-week course of IRV or 8 weeks of education
      about PTSD and mTBI. Participation will help the investigators understand how therapy for
      PTSD and mTBI impacts the brain's response to emotions and therapeutic processes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18-22% of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation New
      Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) Veterans have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
      and 15-30% of Veterans report mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The effects of mTBI and
      PTSD have been evident since military personnel first came home and continue to be difficult
      to eradicate. At 3-4 months post-deployment, OIF Veterans with mild TBI were more likely to
      endorse PTSD symptoms than those without mTBI. The co-morbidity may be long-lasting, or at
      least recurrent, as TBI-related symptoms were strongly associated with traumatic stress five
      years after injury. In an examination of factors associated with postconcussive symptoms,
      PTSD was a strong factor. In active duty marines, mTBI during deployment predicted PTSD after
      deployment, and in a study of OEF-OIF-OND Veterans, 57.3% of those with mTBI had PTSD.

      The literature on how mTBI and co-morbid PTSD affect each other and the effects on Veterans
      several years post-deployment is sparse. Treatment recommendations specific to Veterans with
      both mTBI and PTSD are in flux, and while treatments address each disorder independently,
      they may not be effective when the two disorders co-occur. Further impacting successful
      treatment of Veterans is the fact that many Veterans do not seek treatment, in part due to
      the distance they travel to obtain VA services and stigma.

      Treatments that are accessible and improve symptoms in patients with mTBI and PTSD alone may
      facilitate rehabilitation in Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD. Meditation has been
      suggested to be effective in Veterans with PTSD and in civilians with TBI, improving quality
      of life. The current study proposes a type of meditation targeted for Veterans, Inner
      Resources for Veterans (IRV).

      Inner Resources for Veterans (IRV) meditation intervention is based on Inner Resources for
      Stress, an intervention which utilizes mindfulness, techniques that encourage non-judgmental
      attention to oneself in the present moment. The Inner Resources protocol targets PTSD and has
      been associated with reduced PTSD and anxiety symptoms, reduced number of depressive
      symptoms, and depression remissions at a 9-month follow-up, as well as increased perceived
      self-efficacy. Pilot results of older combat Veterans with PTSD indicated that Inner
      Resources is a safe, feasible, and acceptable intervention. In a previous study with IRV in
      veterans at the Michael E. DeBakey VA, the control condition provided education on the
      symptoms and effects of PTSD. For example, subjects learned to recognize the circumstances
      that triggered their symptoms, how to identify and participate in healthy activities, and how
      to monitor their sleep.

      In addition to the changes in functional and psychological symptoms and neural pathways, IRV
      would offer Veterans a treatment they could utilize whenever challenging situations occur
      regardless of location. Since the treatment would be relatively cost-free after initial
      training, IRV could also dramatically reduce financial burden to both Veterans and VA. Few
      treatment studies focusing on Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD support the innovation of
      this study, as does generation of community integration data to relate to changes in
      functional connectivity.
