    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional (NI) study evaluating the
      safety and efficacy of sunitinib in Chinese patients with progressive, unresectable, advanced
      or metastatic well-differentiated, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors(pNET). 100 adults with
      progressive advanced or metastatic well-differentiated unresectable pNET will be recruited in
      China hospitals. Each subject will be followed up overall survival (OS) time or the date of
      withdrawal and subjects who remain alive after study completion will have their OS time
      censored on the last date known to be alive. Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive at
      least one dose of sunitinib orally at 37.5 mg once a day on a continuous daily dosing regimen
      (CDD) or dosage modification is based on daily clinic practice. Subjects will be treated
      until disease progress, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal from the study at their own
      request, or until the final analysis for the study is performed. The NI study will capture
      observations that will be used for evaluating the safety profile of sunitinib, including:
      subject demographics, medical history and medications. Safety assessments, treatment data and
      any other laboratory examination results, which were done according to routine clinical
      practice, will be collected at all visits.

    <textblock>
      The sunitinib non-interventional (NI) study is a real world observational study which
      represents the usual and customary treatment of patients and being proposed to collect data
      systematically and to assess the safety and efficacy in Chinese patients with progressive,
      unresectable, advanced or metastatic well-differentiated, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.It
      is designed and conducted to meet CFDA post-marketing commitments. non-probability sample

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to &lt;X&gt; days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

PFS data will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment on study for subjects who do not have objective tumor progression and who do not die while on study. Subjects lacking an evaluation of tumor response after enrollment will have their PFS time censored on the date of enrollment.</description>
