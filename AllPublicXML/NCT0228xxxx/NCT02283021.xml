  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcium is an extremely important ion used in our body for many processes. One of its tasks
      is to control gene expression. Cells intake calcium from their surroundings though special
      calcium channels located on the surface membranes of the cells.

      The great many studies on such calcium channels were performed on excitable cells such as
      muscle, heart or neuronal cells, where the calcium ions are controlled by voltage.
      Surprisingly, not much is known about the identity of calcium subunits in non-excitable cells
      like epithelial cells (which compose most of the connective tissue in the body), liver cells,
      lung cells, immune system cells, etc.

      Recently, the investigators have shown that calcium channels from muscles are, in fact,
      expressed in T cells of the immune system, where they are used for proliferation. The
      investigators postulated that probably other cell types, especially cancerous cell types,
      might be using these subunits similarly.

      The aim of this study is to determine the identity and sequence of calcium subunits expressed
      in non-small cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC), which accounts for 80% of the worldwide lung cancer
      deaths.

    <textblock>
      Initial examination of NSCLC cell lines determined that they express the mRNA of voltage
      gated calcium subunits, found normally in neurons. Furthermore sequence analysis of these
      subunits has shown that modifications have occurred.

      The aim of the study in NSCLC patients is to sequence and clone the calcium channel subunits
      expressed in their tumor. Expression and Sequence will be compared between the normal and
      cancerous lung tissue for each patient.

      Lung specimen biospsies are routinely taken from NSCLC patients and sent to pathological
      evaluation. We will obtain small samples from these biopsies from the pathologist, which are
      normally discarded. mRNA will be extracted from these samples.
