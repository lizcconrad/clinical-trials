  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of a Prothrombin Complex
      Concentrate (PCC), BE1116. BE1116 will be used for the rapid reversal of coagulopathy induced
      by vitamin K antagonists in Japanese subjects who require immediate correction of
      international normalized ratio (INR) due to a major bleed or emergency surgery.

    <time_frame>At baseline and at 30 minutes after the end of infusion</time_frame>
    <description>A rapid reversal of (Vitamin K antagonist) VKA effect is a reduction of the INR to ≤ 1.3 at 30 minutes after the end of infusion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Hemostatic Efficacy During Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of surgery/procedure until the end of surgery/procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Hemostatic efficacy is the binary endpoint of effective or non-effective hemostasis, where 'effective' is a hemostatic efficacy rating of &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;satisfactory&quot;, and 'non-effective' is a hemostatic efficacy rating of &quot;questionable&quot; or &quot;none&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Hemostatic Efficacy of Stopping an Ongoing Major Bleed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline CT scan, baseline haematology or the end of infusion, until 24 hours after the end of infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Hemostatic efficacy is the binary endpoint of effective or non-effective hemostasis, where 'effective' is a hemostatic efficacy rating of &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good,&quot; and 'non-effective' is a hemostatic efficacy rating of &quot;poor/none&quot;.</description>

    <description>The increase in plasma levels is assessed through response and in vivo recovery (IVR) of FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and protein C and protein S. The incremental IVR [(IU/dL)/(IU/kg)] is calculated as follows: (IU/dL activity rise in plasma)/(IU/kg body weight infused) = [maximum increase in component plasma level within 3 hours compared to pre-infusion (IU/dL)]/{[exact dose of component in drug administered (IU)]/[body weight (kg)]}.</description>

    <measure>Mean Volume (mls) of Wound Drainage for all Surgical/Invasive Procedures</measure>
