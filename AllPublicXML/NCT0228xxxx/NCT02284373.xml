  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pneumatic compression in improving
      symptoms, quality of life and wound healing in patients with venous ulcers and/or lymphedema.

      This investigation is a randomized clinical trial of a prospective cohort of an estimated 140
      subjects with venous ulcers, with an observational cohort of 50 subjects with lymphedema.
      Venous ulcer subjects will be randomized into two arms:

      Randomization Arm 1: 70 subjects with venous ulcers will receive pneumatic compression with
      the Flexitouch® for the duration of one month in addition to routine care of venous ulcers
      and lymphedema. A pre- and post-PCD treatment CIVIQ-2 quality of life questionnaire will be
      administered to the subjects. For subjects with venous ulcers, wound area pre- and
      post-treatment will be recorded.

      Randomization Arm 2: 70 subjects with venous ulcers will receive routine care of venous
      ulcers and lymphedema. A quality of life questionnaire will be administered at enrollment and
      again after one month. For subjects with venous ulcers, wound area pre- and post-treatment
      will be recorded.

      Observational Arm 3: 50 subjects with lymphedema will ALL receive PCD treatment. A pre-and
      post- PCD treatment CIVIQ-2 QOL questionnaire will be administered to all subjects at
      enrollment and again after one month of treatment.
