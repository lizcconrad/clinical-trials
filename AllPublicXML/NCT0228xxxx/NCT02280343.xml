  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalation of dust containing asbestos results in a process of interstitial pulmonary
      fibrosis called asbestosis. The Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) evaluates the respiratory
      mechanics describing resistive, elastic and inertial properties. We believe that this
      technique may contribute to the early diagnosis of asbestosis.

      The aims of this study were (1) to use the FOT to analyze how respiratory mechanics is
      affected in patients with asbestos exposed, (2) to identify the best FOT parameters for the
      diagnosis of respiratory changes in these patients (3) Assess whether the presence of
      obstructive changes is associated with the smoking habit.The control group (CG) included 24
      subjects with normal spirometric data and without a history of smoking or pulmonary disease
      formed by workers and students UERJ and FioCruz. Volunteers with asbestos exposure were from
      the Department of CESTEH/ FioCruz, totaling 24 exposed and 7 with diagnoses of asbestosis.

      The diagnosis of asbestosis was established based on a history of substantial exposure to
      asbestos dusts and compatible radiological features, together with exclusion of other
      competing diagnoses.

      The tests included a standardized questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, clinical evaluation;
      Plain radiography of the chest; FOT, plethysmography and spirometry, in that order.
