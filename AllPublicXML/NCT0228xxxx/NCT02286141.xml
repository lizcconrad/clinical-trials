      Back pain is one of the most common, controversial and costly problems in healthcare. Despite
      numerous studies, care for back pain has deteriorated over time and become much more
      expensive. The risk stratification approach developed in England and found effective in
      National Health Service general practices in the UK provides a very promising strategy for
      improving care for back pain in the U.S.

      The MATCH trial will use a cluster randomization design involving 6 primary care clinics at
      Group Health. Of these 6 clinics, 3 will be randomized to receive Group Health's standard
      training in the use of Group Health back pain guidelines and 3 clinics will receive this
      standard training plus supplemental training. Primary care clinicians and physical therapists
      in the intervention group will receive training in the use of the STarTBack risk
      stratification strategy for matching the most appropriate evidence-based treatments to the
      needs of patients in each risk level. We will evaluate the effect of this supplemental
      training on patient outcomes, clinician and physical therapist knowledge and comfort treating
      patients with back pain, and utilization of services for back pain.

      Many Americans suffer from back pain for which no specific cause has been identified. Doctors
      in the United States do not have a standard toolkit of helpful treatments for addressing
      non-specific back pain. This contributes to frustration and unrelieved suffering for many
      patients and a sense of helplessness for many doctors. Recently, researchers in England
      developed a tool called &quot;STarT Back&quot; which helps doctors identify the types of treatments
      that are most likely to help patients with different pain experiences. This tool divides
      persons with back pain into three categories based on their answers to 9 simple questions
      about their pain and its effect on their lives. Doctors can then recommend treatments that
      are most likely to be helpful for patients in each category. This method has not yet been
      tested in the United States where healthcare is very different than in England. This project
      will test an enhanced version of the method at Group Health, a healthcare system in
      Washington State.

      OBJECTIVES: A research team at Group Health will test how well an enhanced version of the
      STarT Back method works for patients with back pain. Since this method is new in the United
      States it is important to find out if it meets the needs of patients and doctors, and whether
      it can be easily used in the doctor's office.

      The goals of this project are to:

        1. Adapt the STarT Back method for use at Group Health, using its computerized health
           record system.

        2. See how well the method works in three Group Health clinics, compared with three similar
           clinics where the method is not in place. We will learn from patients and doctors
           whether the method improved the treatment process and provided patients with greater
           relief from their back pain.

        3. Share the results of this study with other groups, including patients, doctors,
           healthcare leaders, and other scientists.

      METHODS: It is important to understand whether using the method helps provide patients with
      more pain relief and improves their quality of life. We will invite patients visiting their
      primary care doctors for back pain to take part in the study. We will also ask doctors and
      care teams from these clinics to be part of this research. Patients who agree to be in the
      study will be asked questions about their back pain soon after their doctor visit and again 2
      and 6 months later. These questions will be asked in a telephone or mailed survey. This
      information will allow us to see if using this approach in doctors' offices reduces pain and
      improves quality of life. We will also ask a small number of patients more in-depth questions
      to find out if there are ways we can improve this approach. Persons with back pain will be
      part of the research team. They will give their opinions about all details of the study,
      including the strategy for implementing the approach, the questions we ask patients and
      doctors, and how we report the results of the study.

    <measure>Back pain related dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Back-related dysfunction will be measured with the modified Roland Disability Questionnaire (&quot;Roland scale&quot;), which asks whether 23 specific activities were limited due to back pain during the past week (yes or no). This measure has been found to be reliable, valid and sensitive to clinical changes and is appropriate for telephone administration and patients with moderate disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Back Pain Symptom Bothersomeness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom bothersomeness will be measured by asking participants to rate how &quot;bothersome&quot; their back pain has been during the previous week on a 0 to 10 scale (0 = &quot;not at all bothersome&quot; and 10 = &quot;extremely bothersome&quot;). This question worked well in our previous trials and is highly correlated with a 0-10 measure of pain intensity (r=0.8 to 0.9). It is also highly correlated with measures of function and other outcome measures.</description>
