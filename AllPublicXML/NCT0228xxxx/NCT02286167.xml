  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility and biologic activity of a
      modified Atkins-based diet combined with short-term intermittent fasting, a GLioma
      Atkins-based Diet (GLAD), in patients with central nervous system GBM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas have a high glycolytic rate and are dependent on glucose for energy
      metabolism. This so called &quot;Warburg effect&quot; or the reliance of central nervous system (CNS)
      tumor cells on glucose utilization through glycolysis has been identified as a potential
      therapeutic target in cancer metabolism. Preclinically, reduced cerebral glucose via calorie
      restriction has been repeatedly associated with tumor reduction and improved survival in
      glioma animal models. Such work has led to several early clinical studies evaluating the
      ketogenic diet (KD) in patients with recurrent GBM.

      The modified Atkins diet (MAD) is designed to provide a more palatable, less restrictive but
      effective alternative to the strict KD, particularly for adults. The MAD does not require
      inpatient admission for initial fast, weight of foods, or severe dietary restrictions and is
      generally well tolerated, easier to administer, and more practical for adults. The MAD lacks
      calorie restriction, an important component to dietary therapies in preclinical
      investigations. Emerging evidence also suggests that short term fasting may provide superior
      anti-cancer activity to long term calorie restriction and that these benefits have been
      observed without substantial weight loss that can be observed with longer term calorie
      restriction.

      In glioma patients, a diet therapy that combines the broad clinical application of the MAD
      with the caloric impact of short-term intermittent fasting is therefore optimal. Moreover,
      initiation of this diet when the cancer has already undergone induction therapy and is
      clinically and radiographically stable, may provide the optimal time for metabolic
      intervention to prevent recurrence or progression.
