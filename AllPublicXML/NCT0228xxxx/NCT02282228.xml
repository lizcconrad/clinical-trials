      An open study evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of a microwave-based device,
      Medfield Strokefinder MD100, to detect chronic subdural hematoma, by comparing measurements
      on patients recruited for surgery of chronic subdural hematoma to an age- and gender-matched
      group of healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This open study will enroll patients admitted for surgery of chronic subdural hematoma at the
      Department of Neurosurgery at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and compare them to
      measurements of healthy volunteers. Patients will be asked to participate in the study, as
      early as possible after admission. After physical examination, checking the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and after informed consent has been acquired, the
      microwave-based measurement will be performed. The diagnostic procedure is estimated to take
      30 min whereof total subject measurement time will be less than five minutes. Healthy
      volunteers will be recruited in parallel and the same procedure as for the patients will be
      followed.

      Safety will be followed throughout the study, and a safety follow-up will be performed 12
      hours after the microwave-based investigation is finalized.

      To avoid measurement bias all measurements, for both patients and healthy volunteers, will be
      performed by the same operator.
