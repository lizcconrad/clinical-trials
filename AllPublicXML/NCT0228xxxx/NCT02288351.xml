  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate small intestinal remodeling and reprogramming of
      glucose metabolism in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who undergo laparoscopic
      Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Our specific goal is to determine if the gene and protein
      expression levels of GLUT-1 are up regulated in the Roux limb and whether this is a major
      mechanism for the remission of T2DM following RYGB.

      The two aims of the study are: 1) to demonstrate that the basement membrane glucose
      transporter 1 (GLUT-1) is upregulated in the Roux limb following RYGB, and 2) to demonstrate
      that the upregulation of GLUT-1 is a major mechanism for the improvement in glycemic control
      observed in T2DM patients undergoing RYGB.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Elevated Glut-1 gene and protein expression levels</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gene and protein expression levels of GLUT-1 will be analyzed from the specimens obtained intra-operatively (baseline) and at 2 months post-operatively to determine if levels are significantly elevated above baseline. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot techniques will be utilized as described in C below.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glut-1 level change in fasting glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in GLUT-1 levels will be correlated with changes in fasting glucose, mixed meal stimulation test, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Secondly, at 2 months post-operatively, whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning with Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) will be performed to evaluate glucose uptake and utilization in the Roux limb.</description>

    <description>Before Surgery: Subjects will have a visit where they will have a mixed nutrient stimulation test. They will be asked to fast for 12 hours prior to this visit (except water). During the visit they will drink an 8 ounce mixed nutrient liquid meal in 5 minute intervals over 20 minutes. During this visit a catheter will be placed in a vein in their arm for blood sample collections. A total of 50 ml of blood will be collected, (10 ml before drinking the mixed nutrient drink, at 30 minutes, at 60 minutes, at 90 minutes and 120 minutes after the mixed nutrient drink).</description>
