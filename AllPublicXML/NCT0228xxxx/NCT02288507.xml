      yttrium-90 radioembolization to patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies in Asia of unresectable hepatocellular cancer (HCC) demonstrated that sorafenib could
      be administered safely at 400mg twice a day (BID) when initiated 14 days following
      radioembolization (RE). However, the ideal sequence of RE and sorafenib may not be completely
      elucidated, the two treatments given concurrently may be more effective than the sequential
      approach studied in the Asian trials. Preclinical models have demonstrated that sorafenib
      acts synergistically with radiation, increasing apoptosis. Furthermore, case reports suggest
      profound responses in patients who have received sorafenib concurrent with transarterial
      radioembolizatoin (TARE) as evidenced by improvement in symptoms, &gt;80% decrease in alpha
      fetoprotein (AFP), and conversion from unresectable to resectable. Sorafenib concurrent with
      TARE may take advantage of the synergistic relationship between the two therapies and prove
      to be a more effective treatment strategy than sequential administration of TARE and
      sorafenib.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be monitored and evaluated for clinical toxicities during the treatment period and queried at each follow-up visit for Adverse Events (AEs). Patients may volunteer information concerning AEs. All AEs will be graded by using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0).</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Response: Response will be evaluated by contrast enhanced MRI or CT and response rates will be reported separately as measured by RECIST and mRECIST criteria. Duration of response will also be measured according to RECIST and mRECIST guidelines.
Survival: The time to progression, progression free survival, and overall survival will be measured. TTP and PFS will be calculated based on progression as defined by RECIST and mRECIST and both intervals will be reported.</description>
