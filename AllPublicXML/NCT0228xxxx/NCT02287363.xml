  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to analyze the genetic variance between thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP)
      patients and pure hyperthyroidism individuals. Meanwhile, the investigators also intended to
      evaluate the morphological difference in effected skeletal muscles and investigate their
      relation with genetic variance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chinese males of their third and forth decades are extremely predisposed to periodic
      paralysis when they are hyperthyroid. Due to their imbalanced predilection to the disease,
      genetic variance is considered to be critical to the pathogenesis. In addition, since
      proximal limb skeletal muscles are the major sites of target, and they are also believed to
      play a role in the disease generation. Thus, we intend to analyze the genetic and
      morphological variances between TPP patients and pure hyperthyroidism patients and
      simultaneously the relation between genetic variance and morphological difference. In this
      way, we hope to provide evidence for a better understanding of the disease.

    <description>TPP patients(between episodes of paralysis), the inclusion criteria consisted of a certain history of acute limb muscle weakness, hypokalemia and decreased TSH with elevated free FT4, FT3. Subjects who suffered from hyperthyroid myopathy with long term muscle weakness, family periodic paralysis, renal tubular acidosis, hyperaldosteronism, hemiplegia, paraplegia, or any history of other metabolic or traumatic muscular disease were excluded.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>hyperthyroidism group</arm_group_label>
    <description>Control group, we included subjects with evidence of aberrant thyroid function (decreased TSH, elevated FT4, FT3) without paralysis. Graves' disease(GD) was preferred which required information concerning either increased thyrotrophin receptor antibody(TRAb) level, ophthalmopathy or diffusively enlarged goiter. Individuals with pure thyroid associated ophthalmopathy, history of thyroidectomy due to malignancy or adenoma as well as subacute thyroiditis and pituitary hyperthyroidism were excluded.</description>
