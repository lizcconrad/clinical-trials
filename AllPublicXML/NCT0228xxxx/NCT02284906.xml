    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone at 24 months compared
      with placebo on cognitive decline in high-risk participants who have completed the
      AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study [NCT01931566] with an adjudicated diagnosis of mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called pioglitazone. This study is designed to further
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pioglitazone on cognitive function in participants
      who have completed the AD-4833/TOMM40_301. This study will look at the effectiveness of
      pioglitazone on cognitive decline in high-risk participants who have completed the
      AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

      The study is anticipated to enroll approximately 316 participants, but is dependent on how
      many decide to continue treatment in an extension phase after completing the main (301)
      study. Participants will continue to receive the same study medication they received during
      the pivotal AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study, either:

        -  pioglitazone 0.8 mg tablets or

        -  placebo (this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient).

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-centre trial, like its precedent pivotal trial, will be conducted worldwide. The
      overall time to participate in this study is minimum 2 years and a maximum of 7 years
      depending on when subjects roll over from the 301 study. Participants will make approximately
      2 visits per year to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 3 months after each
      treatment visit for a follow-up assessment, and 2 weeks after the final visit.
