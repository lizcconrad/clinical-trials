  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) will affect
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) symptoms and how it will affect motor and nervous system
      function in participants Subtypes of SCA to be examined will include SCA types 1, 2, 3, 6, 10
      and 11.

    <description>IVIG will be infused over a course of five days in the form of GAMMAGARD LIQUID 10% solution, available from Baxter. For neurological and autoimmune diseases 2 grams per kilogram of body weight is implemented for three months over a five day course once a month.
There is very limited reliable dose ranging data for IVIG in the treatment of any condition, and most dosing has been empiric. In our experience, we have empirically observed a more potent immunomodulatory effect from &quot;induction dose&quot; IVIG (2 g/kg) continued each month, than with the &quot;booster dose&quot; maintenance dose of 1gm/kg. Though there is no category one evidence to support this practice, neither is there such evidence to refute it. Additionally, results from previous trials of IVIG in SCAs show this dosage to be relatively safe and effective at this rate of infusion</description>

             specialist.

          -  Age 18 years to 80 years.

             provide a negative pregnancy test at entry into the study.

          -  Serum creatine kinase, complete metabolic panel, complete blood count, liver function
             tests, renal function tests, platelets and EKG do not reveal clinically significant
             abnormalities (results obtained from primary care physician and dated within the past
             6 months or obtained at screening visit).

          -  Stable doses of all medications for 30 days prior to study entry and for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. See exclusion criteria 3 for specific types of
             peripheral neuropathy to be excluded.

          -  Throughout the study, all possible efforts will be made to maintain subject levels of
             activity, exercise or physical therapy.

          -  Subject permission (informed consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any unstable illness that in the investigator's opinion precludes participation in
             this study.

          -  Use of any investigational product within the past 30 days.

             consent (MMSE less than 25).

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity.

          -  Presence of severe renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) or
             hepatic disease (as evidenced by labs reported within the past 6 months).

          -  Clinically significantly abnormal white blood cell count, hemoglobin or platelet count
             (as evidenced by labs reported within the past 6 months).

          -  Immunoglobulin A, Vitamin B (1, 3, 6, or 12), vitamin E or folate deficiencies
             (evidenced by screening lab evaluations).
