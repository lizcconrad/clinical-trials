  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are routinely asked to sign an &quot;informed consent&quot; document prior to starting
      chemotherapy, indicating they understand the risks and benefits of treatment. Although this
      could be a strategic moment to equip patients with information they need to make truly
      informed medical decisions, many patients and caregivers note that these conversations are
      less useful than they could be. The informed consent process and its associated documents
      suffer several limitations: 1) risks are emphasized over benefits; 2) educational materials
      focus on individual drugs instead of regimens; 3) information is presented in written instead
      of alternative written/audiovisual format; and 4) the patient perspective is lacking.

      The overarching objective of this project is to develop a library of communication tools for
      the most common chemotherapy regimens used to treat advanced gastrointestinal cancers. Tools
      will include video clips and written documents that can be readily distributed, modified, and
      customized. This toolkit will be crafted in collaboration with oncologists and patients
      living with gastrointestinal cancer and improves upon existing resources in several ways: 1)
      balanced discussion of benefits as well as risks, 2) focus on regimens rather than drugs, 3)
      use of both written and video format, and 4) inclusion of the patient perspective (e.g. video
      clips of patients describing their experience). A panel of oncologist and patient
      stakeholders will evaluate the acceptability of the tools. The investigators will then
      conduct a randomized clinical trial to demonstrate if the informed consent toolkit improves
      the quality of informed consent for palliative chemotherapy. If effective, the tools will be
      amenable to broad dissemination via patient accessible cancer education websites and oncology
      clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research indicates that many patients with advanced cancer receive palliative chemotherapy
      without sufficient understanding of its likely risks and benefits. In surveys, many patients
      receive palliative chemotherapy without expressing an understanding that cure is unlikely.

      The root of this problem is undoubtedly complex, but may relate to gaps in communication and
      patient education about the risks and benefits of treatment. Patients are routinely asked to
      sign an &quot;informed consent&quot; document prior to starting chemotherapy, indicating they
      understand the risks and benefits of treatment. Although this could be a strategic moment to
      equip patients with information they need to make truly informed medical decisions, many
      patients and caregivers note that these conversations are less useful than they could be. The
      informed consent process and its associated documents suffer several limitations: 1) risks
      are emphasized over benefits; 2) educational materials focus on individual drugs instead of
      regimens; 3) information is presented in written instead of alternative written/audiovisual
      format; and 4) the patient perspective is lacking.

      The overarching objective of this trial is to test a suite of patient-centered videos and
      booklets to support informed consent for common chemotherapy regimens used to treat advanced
      gastrointestinal cancers. In this study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, locally
      advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer considering treatment with first or second-line
      palliative chemotherapy were randomized to the usual process of chemotherapy informed
      consent, or usual care supplemented by access to the appropriate investigational chemotherapy
      informed consent video and booklet. Patients were surveyed at baseline, 2-weeks
      post-treatment initiation, and 3 months regarding their understanding of chemotherapy risks
      and benefits, decisional conflict, and other metrics of informed decision-making.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Accurate Understanding of Chemotherapy Benefits</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked &quot;How likely do you think that chemotherapy is to cure your cancer?&quot; with response options of not at all likely, a little likely, somewhat likely, very likely, and don't know. A response of &quot;not at all likely&quot; was considered accurate. All other responses, including don't know, were considered inaccurate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Accurate Understanding of Chemotherapy Risks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to rate the likelihood that they would experience specific side effects as a result of the chemotherapy under consideration, with separate items for nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, neuropathy, and hair loss. Patients' responses were correlated to the known side effect profile of their chemotherapy regimen and coded as accurate or inaccurate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Accurate Understanding of the Goals of Palliative Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked &quot;according to your doctor, what is the goal of the chemotherapy?&quot; with the ability to choose any/all of the following response options: cure, control cancer growth, alleviate symptoms, prolong life, or other. Selecting either control cancer growth, and/or alleviate symptoms, and/or prolong life were defined as accurate understanding; &quot;to cure&quot; was considered inaccurate.</description>

    <measure>Decisional Conflict When Making a Chemotherapy Treatment Choice: Modified SURE Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional Conflict was assessed by a modified version of the 4 item SURE instrument of Legare at al which assesses whether patients 1) are sure of the best treatment option, 2) know the risks and benefits of their treatment options, 3) are clear about which risks and benefits matter to them, and 4) whether they have sufficient support to make their treatment decision. We expanded items 2 and 3 into four separate items assessing risks and benefits individually. Responses were summed, resulting in a scale of 0-6, where 0 indicates maximum conflict and 6 indicates no conflict</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieve Their Preferred Role in Treatment Decision Making Process</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Achievement of preferred role in decision-making was assessed by the Control Preferences Scale; patients indicate the role they played in their treatment decision which is compared to their preferred role (assessed at baseline).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction When Making a Chemotherapy Treatment Choice: PACE Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with communication during treatment decision-making process was assessed via 5 items from the Patient Assessment of Cancer Communication Experiences (PACE). Scores were averaged (&quot;does not apply&quot; excluded), creating a score of 1 to 4, with 4 being the most satisfied.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Prognostic Understanding in Median Years</measure>

        <description>Decisional Conflict was assessed by a modified version of the 4 item SURE instrument of Legare at al which assesses whether patients 1) are sure of the best treatment option, 2) know the risks and benefits of their treatment options, 3) are clear about which risks and benefits matter to them, and 4) whether they have sufficient support to make their treatment decision. We expanded items 2 and 3 into four separate items assessing risks and benefits individually. Responses were summed, resulting in a scale of 0-6, where 0 indicates maximum conflict and 6 indicates no conflict</description>
