      Prospective randomized (rhythm control or rate control) Objective of study

        1. To analyze long term outcome of patients with acute stroke with atrial fibrillation
           according to the rhythm control

        2. To analyze recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation or recurrence stroke in patients with
           acute stroke according to the rhythm control (by antiarrhythmic drug, cardioversion,
           catheter ablation)
