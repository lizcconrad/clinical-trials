    <textblock>
      BIND-014 (docetaxel nanoparticles for injectable suspension) is being studied in patients
      with v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation positive or
      squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed after treatment of one
      prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen.
