  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol frequently used as an inducting medication for insertion Laryngeal mask airway(LMA).
      But propofol alone can be not sufficient for inhibiting upper airway reflex and also result
      in cardiovascular suppression under enough amount. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alplh2
      receptor agonist with analgesic and sedative effects but sparing respiratory function.
      Therefore propofol combined with dexmedetomidine induction could be more effective in
      preserve respiration under same condition for LMA insertion than propofol alone. In this
      study, the investigators investigate the clinical dose of propofol for LMA insertion with
      premedication of dexmedetomidine, and evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine.

    <description>After preoxygenation for 3 minutes, normal saline would be injected to patient for 10 minute. First, 1% lidocaine 3 ml were given for reducing injection pain of propofol and the settled amount of propofol was injected during 15 seconds.
After 90 seconds, other anesthesiologist who did'nt know the injected drug tried to insert LMA.</description>
