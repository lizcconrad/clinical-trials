    <textblock>
      The American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) and the Berlin definitions of the Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) could be adequate for epidemiologic studies, but it is
      not adequate for inclusion of patients into therapeutic clinical trials. Despite recent
      reports on the effects of standardized ventilator settings on PaO2/FIO2 and fulfillment of
      AECC and Berlin definitions of ARDS, it is still a matter of debate whether the assessment of
      hypoxemia at 24 hours is the most appropriate tool for stratifying lung severity in patients
      with ARDS. The investigators will perform an observational, multicenter, prospective audit in
      a network of intensive care units in Spain and China for validating and confirming that the
      assessment of hypoxemia at 24 hours after ARDS onset is the most valuable tool for
      stratifying and predicting outcome in patients with ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 1994, the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) defined ARDS as follows: 1) acute
      and sudden onset of severe respiratory distress, 2) bilateral infiltrates on frontal chest
      radiograph, 3) absence of left atrial hypertension or no clinical signs of left heart
      failure, and 4) severe hypoxemia, as PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;200 mmHg, regardless of FIO2 or PEEP
      levels. Although this definition could be adequate for epidemiologic studies, it is not
      adequate for inclusion of patients into therapeutic clinical trials. In 2012, a proposal for
      updating the ARDS definition (the Berlin criteria) was published and an empirical
      classification was proposed according to three PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values at ARDS onset: severe
      (≤100 mmHg), moderate (&gt;100-≤200), and mild (&gt;200-≤300) on PEEP≥5 cmH2O. However, despite
      that there is sufficient evidence about the interactions between PEEP and FiO2, the Berlin
      criteria did not mandate the assessment of hypoxemia at 24 hours under standarized
      guidelines.

      The PaO2/FIO2 can be easily manipulated. Alterations in PEEP and FIO2 can dramatically change
      the PaO2/FIO2. Despite recent reports on the effects of standardized ventilator settings on
      PaO2/FIO2 and fulfillment of AECC definitions of ARDS, it is still a matter of debate whether
      the assessment of hypoxemia at 24 hours is the most appropriate tool for stratifying lung
      severity in patients with ARDS.

      The investigators will examine whether the assessment of hypoxemia at 24 h after ARDS
      diagnosis under standard guidelines for ventilatory management have an impact on the
      stratification of lung severity and on predicting mortality of ARDS patients in the intensive
      care unit.
