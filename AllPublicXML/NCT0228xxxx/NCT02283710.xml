    <textblock>
      This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in patients with non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease.They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification alone or lifestyle
      modification plus Pentoxifylline groups. Liver function tests, metabolic profile and
      anthropometric measurements were checked at baseline and six months later.

      This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in patients with the evidence of
      fatty liver in ultrasonography. After excluding other causes, participants with persistent
      elevated serum aminotransferase levels were presumed to have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver
      fat score greater than (-0.64) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle
      modification alone or lifestyle modification plus Pentoxifylline groups. Fasting serum
      glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase,
      triglyceride, cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein,homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR), and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and
      waist circumference) were checked at baseline and six months later.
