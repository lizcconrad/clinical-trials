  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulnar nerve compression at the elbow is a common problem and can significantly affect hand
      function in severe cases. The current, standard treatment is Ulnar nerve decompression with
      or without transposition (moving the ulnar nerve to a site where there is less compression).
      In severe compression, the clinical results after this surgery are typically poor. Distal
      transfers of functioning nerves (at the level of the wrist) to the compressed ulnar nerve
      (anterior interosseous nerve to ulnar motor fascicles) have been suggested to &quot;supercharge&quot;
      or augment hand muscles while nerve axons regenerate from the level of the elbow after
      decompression/transposition. In fact, this treatment is becoming widely adopted without clear
      evidence that it changes outcomes. The investigators propose to prospectively compare the
      effectiveness of ulnar nerve decompression/transposition versus decompression/transposition
      and distal nerve transfer.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the outcomes of patients with severe
      (intrinsic hand muscle dysfunction) compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow treated with
      ulnar nerve decompression and subcutaneous transposition alone versus ulnar nerve
      decompression with subcutaneous transposition and AIN to ulnar nerve reverse end-to-side
      transfer. The study objectives of this project are the following: 1. To prospectively compare
      the clinical outcomes of patients with severe ulnar neuropathy at the elbow who receive ulnar
      nerve decompression with subcutaneous transposition and AIN to ulnar motor reverse
      end-to-side nerve transfer versus decompression and subcutaneous transposition alone. 2. To
      prospectively compare the electrophysiologic outcomes (nerve conduction studies and EMG) of
      patients with severe ulnar neuropathy at the elbow who receive ulnar nerve decompression with
      subcutaneous transposition and AIN to ulnar motor reverse end-to-side nerve transfer versus
      decompression and subcutaneous transposition alone.

    <description>Surgery: a &quot;reverse&quot; end-to-side AIN to ulnar nerve transfer whereby the motor branch of the ulnar is left intact and the end of the AIN nerve is coapted to the side of the ulnar motor fascicle(5,6). The advantage of this technique is it preserves the continuity of the ulnar motor branch for axons if they do eventually reinnervate the intrinsic muscles while augmenting or &quot;babysitting&quot; these muscles during the time period until this occurs.</description>

    <description>Surgery: the anterior interosseous (AIN) to motor branch of the ulnar nerve transfer has been established as an effective means to reinnervate ulnar innervated intrinsic hand muscles (without loss of function from using the AIN) when nerve injury is too proximal for recovering axons to reach the hand by 18 months. . The procedure (surgery) is presently the standard of care</description>
