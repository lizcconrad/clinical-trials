  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, in-patient trial evaluating
      the prophylactic efficacy of rifaximin against campylobacteriosis following challenge with C.
      jejuni.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      28 healthy volunteers who gave informed consent were enrolled to participate in a study to
      determine the efficacy of prophylactic rifaximin in preventing diarrheal illness following
      challenge with C. jejuni, strain CG8421. Volunteers were screened for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and were admitted to the inpatient unit of the Center for Immunization Research at
      Johns Hopkins University. Volunteers were treated with rifaximin or placebo in a double blind
      manner for four days, beginning the day prior to challenge. On the day of challenge, the
      volunteers were given 5x10(5) C. jejuni with bicarbonate buffer and were then monitored and
      treated for any symptoms. Stools were cultured daily for the excretion of C. jejuni and all
      subjects were treated with antibiotics to insure that the challenge strain has cleared prior
      to to discharge. Subjects were followed for six months following the inpatient phase to
      detect adverse events following the study.
