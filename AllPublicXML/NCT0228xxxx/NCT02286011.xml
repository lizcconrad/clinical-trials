      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Intramuscular Infusion of Autologous
      Bone Marrow Stem Cells in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis by a prospective,
      single-center, randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated number of motor units (MUNE)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Several techniques for estimating the MUNE, all based on the relationship between the amplitude or area of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and amplitude or area corresponding to a single motor unit response. The differences between the techniques are due to the different ways of estimating the amplitude of the responses for individual motor units. The study will use two techniques:
Incremental Technique: The unitary amplitude (or area) of individual motor units are calculated from the responses to increasing intensities stimuli near of intensity threshold (Dantes and McComas, 1991) Statistical technique: The unit amplitude (or area) of the individual motor units are calculated from the amplitude variations (or area) of the muscle action potential obtained in response to stimuli from a fixed intensity (Daube, 2006)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compound muscle action potential (CMAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>CMAP is registered after supramaximal stimulation intensity (0.1-0.2 ms pulses at 1 Hz) of the common peroneal nerve at the level of the head of the fibula. The electrical stimulus is placed in a fixed position during the entire registration process. CMAP will be recorded simultaneously in 5 positions along longitudinally oriented TA muscle. To determine these 5 positions bony landmarks that are reproducible between members and between different patients will be used.</description>

    <measure>Fiber density (FD)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Quantifies the average number of muscle fibers per motor unit. It is obtained from single fiber recordings made with electrodes. The average number of motor unit potentials is calculated in 20 different positions in the muscle.</description>

    <description>All patients included in the clinical trial will receive an intramuscular infusion of autologous mononuclear cells (MNC) of Bone Marrow (BM) in TA muscle of one of the lower limb (experimental group). The lower limb on the CMN infuse autologous BM will be determined randomly.
The average dose is 550 millions of cells (100-1200 million) diluted in 2 ml. saline</description>

    <description>The cells are infused into the TA muscle of the lower limb randomized as Group A (experimental) intramuscularly. The infusion is made with a needle, 26 gauge, at 4 points of the TA muscle a specific depth given by the neurophysiological study. The total volume infused will be 2 ml, 0.5 ml at each point.
For infusion is as painless as possible for the patient to comply exactly with stereotactic indications of neurophysiology, the infusion was made at a uniform controlled rate and for this, the syringe is placed on a Yesargil arm, equipped with a microinjector and controlled infusion device.</description>
