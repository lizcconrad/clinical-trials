  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if talazoparib can help to control
      advanced cancer in patients who have a specific type of alteration (a type of genetic
      change). The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Talazoparib is not FDA-approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take talazoparib
      capsules by mouth 1 time each day. You should take the study drug at about the same time
      every day with or without food.

      If you miss a dose, you should skip that dose and take your next dose as scheduled. If you
      vomit after taking the study drug, do not take another dose to make it up. Wait and take your
      next dose as scheduled.

      Study Visits:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      During Weeks 1 and 2 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing.

        -  During Week 1, urine will be collected for routine tests, including a pregnancy test if
           you can become pregnant.

      During Weeks 3 and 4 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing.

        -  During Week 3, depending on when you are enrolled, you will have a tumor biopsy for PD
           testing. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      During Week 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests.

      During Weeks 2, 3, and 4 of Cycles 2-12:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Week 4 only, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic
           testing.

      Every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 12 weeks after that, you will have a CT or MRI scan
      to check the status of the disease. If the disease appears to get better, you will have a
      repeat scan within 4 weeks.

      Starting at Cycle 13:

        -  Every 4 weeks, blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.
           °You can perform this test at your local doctor's office and the results will be sent to
           the study staff.

        -  Every 12 weeks, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic
           testing.

        -  Every 12 weeks, if you can become pregnant, urine collected will also be used for a
           pregnancy test.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after 1 year of follow-up calls.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Right after your last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-treatment visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker and
           DNA testing.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for and biomarker and DNA testing.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      The study staff will call you to ask how you are doing every 12 weeks for up to 1 year. Each
      call should last about 5 minutes.
