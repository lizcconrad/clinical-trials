      Twelve subjects with current diagnosis of depressive episode will be recruited to undergo a
      brief course of 4 intravenous infusions of ketamine, given twice weekly for two weeks in
      combination with CBT, given twice weekly. The CBT course will be 16 total sessions (given
      over 8 weeks), will begin the day following the initial ketamine infusion, and will be
      performed by a therapist who has successfully completed extensive training at the Beck
      Institute for Cognitive Therapy and Research and has experience with similar studies.
      Homework assignments will include thought records and activity charts which are used in
      standard practice to facilitate CBT interventions.
