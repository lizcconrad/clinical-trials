  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role among metabolic syndrome and breast cancer risk is not well understood and must be
      further explored. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between
      metabolic syndrome and breast cancer in Southern Brazil. In this case-control study, breast
      cancer patients and controls without malignant disease, matched for age (±5 years) and
      menopausal status, were interviewed and asked to make a glucose, HDL-cholesterol and
      triglycerides test. Waist circumference and blood pressure were measured using standardized
      procedures. Metabolic Syndrome was considered by NCEP ATP III (2001) and IDF (2006)
      definitions. Cases and controls were compared in relation to the presence of diagnosed MetS
      (yes/no), number of metabolic abnormalities identified (1 to 5) for each definition, and
      according to each metabolic abnormality cutoff point.

        Between December 2013 and August 2014, newly diagnosed (within 6 months) BC female patients
        referred to the oncology sector of the Teaching Hospital of the Federal University of
        Pelotas and to the Radiotherapy and Oncology Center of Santa Casa de Misericordia of
        Pelotas were invited to the study, before starting any adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment.
        Women with a recidivated tumor, HIV infection, renal, heart or liver disease,
        hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, mobility or neurological limitations, chronicle use of
        corticosteroids, pacemakers or identified with severe edema were excluded. For each cancer
        case, one female control should be matched for age (± 5 years) and menopausal status (pre
        and post-menopausal). Apart from being free from all the exclusion criteria used for BC
        cases, controls should also have no signs of malignant disease. These women were invited to
        participate in the study while frequenting the Gynecologic Ambulatory of the same
        institutions, in the same period.
