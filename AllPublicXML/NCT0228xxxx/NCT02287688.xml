      This safety surveillance study of Novartis quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine
      (Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197) among children 2 months through 23 months of age is a
      post-marketing study required by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

      It is an observational study of children 2-23 months of age who receive at least one dose of
      MenACWY-CRM vaccine at a Kaiser Permanente Southern California facility (KPSC) while enrolled
      as a KPSC health plan member.

      The objective of the infant study is to describe medical events that require emergency room
      visit or hospitalization in 6 months following MenACWY-CRM vaccination in children 2-23
      months of age in a health maintenance organization in the United States. Outcomes include
      medical events that require emergency room visits or hospitalizations in children 2-23 months
      of age following any dose of MenACWY-CRM vaccination. Events with a history of the same
      diagnosis prior to the first dose of MenACWY-CRM vaccination will be excluded as a
      pre-existing condition.
