  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the minimum effective concentration of local anesthetic
      (ropivacaine 40mL) required to produce an effective double-injection USG-SCB for surgical
      anesthesia in 90% of patients (MEC90) in young group (18-40 years) and in middle aged group
      (40-65 years) of patients scheduled for elective surgery of one upper limb distal to the
      shoulder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on biased coin design, and the concentration of LA for the next patient is
      determined by the result of the last one. In the case of block failure, the concentration
      will be increased by 0.025%. Conversely, block success will result in either a reduction in
      concentration by 0.025% (probability 11%) or no change in concentration (probability 89%). A
      blinded assistant will assess sensory and motor blockade in each nerve territory ( the
      median, radial, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves) at 10-min intervals up to 30 min after
      completion of the block. Finally, MEC90 is calculated by isotonic regression.

    <description>The Minimum Effective Concentration (MEC) of Ropivacaine in Ultrasound-guided Supraclavicular Block is based on 60 measurements in 60 patients (secondary outcome measure: block success). MEC is determined by biased coin design method when all patients have been tested in the study.</description>
