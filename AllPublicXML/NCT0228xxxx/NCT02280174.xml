  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overproduction of intestinally derived triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) (chylomicrons)
      has recently been described in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), as is known for hepaticTRL
      (very-low-density lipoprotein) production.

      There is an interest in identifying therapies that would favourably influence postprandial
      concentrations of lipids in T2DM.

      linagliptin is a potent and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), and has
      been shown to reduce fasting and postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mainly through incretin hormone-mediated improvements in islet function.

      Although clinical studies to date indicate that fasting lipid levels are minimally affected
      by DPP-IV inhibitor treatment, animal studies suggested that DPP-IV inhibition reduce
      intestinal triglycerides (TG) absorption and apolipoprotein (apo) production and increased
      chylomicron catabolism. Interestingly, a recent study supporting this hypothesis showed that
      vildagliptin therapy was able to reduce postprandial intestinal TRL particles in patients
      with type 2 diabetes. Recently, it had reported that sitagliptin treatment significantly
      reduced plasma apoB-48 and TG concentrations in the postprandial state.

      The action of DPP-IV inhibitors may be explained by insulin secretion or action of
      glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) on metabolism of TRL.

      Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of linagliptin treatment
      (LT) vs standard treatment (ST) on the metabolism of TRL apoB-48 in patients with type 2
      diabetes over a 12 weeks-period.

      The investigators will study the patients in three different moments defined as: Time 0 (2
      weeks before LT or ST, Time 1 (4 weeks after LT or ST), Time 2 (12 weeks after LT or ST).
      With areas under the curve (AUCs) of apoB48 in postprandial conditions.

      Uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes patients with HbA1c between 7 and 10% Patients must have
      received the maximum tolerated dose of metformin for at least 3 months before randomization.
      Patients will be randomised to receive linagliptin or standard therapy.

      A total of seven study visits will be scheduled: at screening, at weeks -4, -2, 0, 4, 6, 12
      and 24 week follow-up. During each visit, an endocrinologist will make the physical and
      metabolic assessment. Safety and tolerability data will be collected at screening and
      throughout the study, and includes incidence of serious and non serious adverse events (AEs)
      in linagliptin arms and standard arms. Clinical laboratory data, vital signs, and 12-lead
      electrocardiogram parameters at each visit, will be collected. The causal relationships
      between study drugs and AEs will be evaluated by the investigators at site. All drug-related
      AEs occurring during the study will be followed up until relieved or judged to be no longer
      clinically significant. Changes in body weight from baseline until week 12 will also be
      assessed. Hypoglycaemic event intensity will be defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia
      accompanied by a fingerstick glucose value of ≤ 50 mg/dl.

      The investigators will study the patients in three different moments defined as: Time 0 (2
      weeks before LT or ST), Time 1 (4 weeks after LT or ST), Time 2 (12 weeks after LT or ST). T1
      show the direct effect (independent of metabolic changes) and T2 show indirect effect (depend
      of metabolic changes).

      In each phase, following an overnight fast, an intravenous catheter will be inserted into a
      superficial vein in each forearm for blood sampling. After an overnight fast, subjects were
      admitted in the research unit for a 24-h period and received un isocaloric (900 kcal), mixed
      meals (75 g carbohydrates, 50 g fat (60% saturated), 35 g protein), at time points 7.00 a.m.
      (breakfast). Blood samples will drawn before and 2, 4, 6, 8, after the meal. The area under
      curve (AUC) and incremental AUC (IAUC) for postprandial variables will calculate in each
      phase.

      In the morning after each phase study: basal (T0) and incretin conditions (T1 and T2),
      subjects will undergo hyperglycaemic clamp and hyperinsulinaemic clamp, successively. The
      insulin secretion rate and insulin sensitivity index will be measured during the last 30
      minutes of the clamp, respectively in two arms of the study.
