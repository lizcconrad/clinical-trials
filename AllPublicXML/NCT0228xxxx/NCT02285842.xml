    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this PMCF study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of its THA and resurfacing components marketed in the EU. These types of studies are required
      by regulatory authorities for all THA and resurfacing devices that do not have medium to
      long-term clinical evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU.
      This study has been designed in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2.
