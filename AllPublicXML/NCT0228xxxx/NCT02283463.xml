  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a suction-based method of engaging the cervix. Bioceptive has developed
      a device that more gently and atraumatically attaches to the cervix with no bleeding. This
      novel attachment mechanism may diminish pain and discomfort. Pre-clinical testing has been
      performed on the device including testing on synthetic uterine models, human cadavers, and
      human uteri immediately post-hysterectomy (Utah IRB # 00059096). Results from these efforts
      have shown effective attachment to the cervix and the ability for the device to maintain
      suction throughout a procedure atraumatically. This study proposes to introduce this minimal
      risk device in a clinical setting to determine the response of women undergoing gynecologic
      procedures.

    <description>Suction based method for stabilizing the cervix and uterus. Achieves suction 360 degrees around cervical os creating a portal through which instruments can be passed into the cervical canal and uterus. Provider can still place traction on uterus with this device just as with tenaculum.</description>
