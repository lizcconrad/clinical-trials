      BACKGROUND Nursing homes are important locations for palliative care. Through comprehensive
      geriatric assessments (CGAs), evaluations can be made of the palliative care needs of nursing
      home residents. The interRAI Palliative Care instrument (interRAI PC) is a CGA that evaluates
      diverse palliative care needs of adults in all healthcare settings. The evaluation results in
      Client Assessment Protocols (CAPs: indications of problems that need addressing) and Scales
      (e.g. Palliative Index for Mortality (PIM)) which can be used to design, evaluate and adjust
      care plans. This study aims to examine the effect of using the interRAI PC on the quality of
      palliative care in nursing homes. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the feasibility and
      validity of the interRAI PC.

      METHODS This study covers phases 0, I and II of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework
      for designing and evaluating complex interventions, with a longitudinal, quasi-experimental
      pretest-posttest design and with mixed methods of evaluation. In phase 0, a systematic
      literature search is conducted. In phase I, the interRAI PC instrument is adapted for use in
      Belgium and implemented on the BelRAI-website and a practical training is developed. In phase
      II, the intervention is tested in fifteen nursing homes. Participating nursing homes fill out
      the interRAI PC during one year for all residents receiving palliative care. Using a
      pretest-posttest design with quasi-random assignment to the intervention or control group,
      the effect of the interRAI PC on the quality of palliative care is evaluated with the
      Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS). Psychometric analysis is conducted to evaluate the
      predictive validity of the PIM and the convergent validity of the CAP 'Mood' of the interRAI
      PC. Qualitative data regarding the usability and face validity of the instrument are
      collected.

      DISCUSSION This is the first study to evaluate the validity and effect of the interRAI PC in
      nursing homes, following a methodology based on the MRC framework. This approach improves the
      study design and implementation and will contribute to a higher generalizability of results.
      The final result will be a psychometrically evaluated CGA for nursing home residents
      receiving palliative care.
