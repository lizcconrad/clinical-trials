  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the end-tidal carbon
      dioxide (EtCO2) and cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and to identify the covariates in the
      pharmacodynamic relationship between EtCO2 and rSO2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though mild hypercapnia in the beach chair position (BCP) under general anesthesia was
      effective in reducing cerebral desaturation, there is no comprehensive data with regard to
      the dose-effect relationship of EtCO2 on rSO2 in the BCP under general anesthesia.
      Pharmacodynamic modeling can be useful in describing this relationship in which concurrent
      mean arterial pressure changes and disease state can be considered as covariates. Therefore,
      we investigated the relationship between the EtCO2 and rSO2 and identified the covariates in
      the pharmacodynamic relationship between EtCO2 and rSO2.

    <description>Initial data collection during BCP was performed following three conditions were satisfied: after start of surgery; at least 15 min after BCP (for stabilization of MAP); after ventilation frequency was adjusted to produce EtCO2 of 27-29 mmHg with tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Data was collected every 3 min after decreasing ventilation frequency by 1-2 breaths/min to increase EtCO2 until 42-45 mmHg. Once the value of EtCO2 42-45 mmHg was reached, ventilator frequency was increased in the same way to decrease EtCO2 until 27-29 mmHg. Fraction of inspired oxygen of 50% was maintained and end-tidal desflurane concentration was adjusted to achieve bispectral index values of 40-55 during data collection.</description>
