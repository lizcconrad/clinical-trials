  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effectiveness of using
      lower-intensity radiation and chemotherapy to treat human papillomavirus (HPV) associated
      low-risk oropharyngeal and/or unknown primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.
      The cure rate for this type of cancer is estimated to be high, &gt; 90%. The standard treatment
      for this cancer is 7 weeks of radiation with 3 high doses of cisplatin. Sometimes surgery is
      performed afterwards. This standard regimen causes a lot of side effects and long term
      complications. This study is evaluating whether a lower dose of radiation and chemotherapy
      may provide a similar cure rate as the longer, more intensive standard regimen. Patients in
      this study will receive 1 less week of radiation and a lower weekly dose of chemotherapy.

      The proposed study is a follow-up study to NCT01530997. In NCT01530997, patients with HPV
      positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) received
      de-intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by a limited surgical evaluation. The primary
      endpoint of NCT01530997 was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after CRT. Power
      computations were performed for N=40 and were based on the null hypothesis (H0) that the pCR
      for de-intensified chemoradiotherapy is at least 87%, the historical rate. The type 1 error
      for this calculation was 14.2%. 43 patients enrolled and 38 were evaluable for the primary
      endpoint. The observed pCR rate was 89% (34/38). Since the observed pCR rate was excellent in
      NCT01530997 and was in concordance with the expected rate, in the proposed study we will not
      mandate a post-CRT surgical evaluation. Instead a PET/CT 10 to 16 weeks post-CRT will be used
      to determine whether a surgical evaluation is needed.

    <description>Patients will receive Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatments (IMRT), 60 Gy at 2 Gy/fx. The acceptable weekly chemotherapy regimens are Cisplatin 30 to 40 mg/m2 (first choice), Cetuximab 250mg/m2 (second choice), Carboplatin AUC 1.5 and paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 (third choice), Carboplatin AUC 3 (fourth choice). Chemotherapy will be given intravenously weekly during IMRT, 6 total doses. Chemotherapy will not be given to patients with T0-2 N0-1 disease, ≤ 10 pack years smoking history. Decision for surgical evaluation will be based on the results of the PET/CT and clinical exam 10-16 weeks after CRT. Patients with a positive PET/CT scan will undergo surgical evaluation at the discretion of the surgeon. Patients with a negative PET/CT scan will be observed.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatments (IMRT). Dose painting IMRT will be used and all doses will be specified to the planning target volume (PTV). The high risk planning target volume (PTV-HR) and standard risk planning target volume (PTV-SR) will be treated to the following respective total doses: 60 Gy and 54 Gy. The dose per fraction to the PTV-HR and PTV-SR will be 2 Gy per day and 1.8 Gy per day respectively. The PTV-HR will include the gross tumor and the PTV-SR will include areas at risk for harboring subclinical microscopic disease.</description>

    <description>Cisplatin is the preferred mandated first choice chemotherapy, however alternative weekly regimens are permissible. Justification for not using cisplatin must be documented. Chemotherapy will be given intravenously weekly during IMRT. 6 total doses will be given. It is preferred that the doses be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; however, this is not mandatory. Chemotherapy will not be given to patients with T0-2 N0-1 disease, ≤ 10 pack years smoking history.</description>

    <description>Decisions for surgical evaluation will be based on the results of the PET/CT 10 to 16 weeks after CRT and clinical exam (including fiberoptic laryngoscopy) at that time. Other optional imaging studies may be performed. Patients with a positive PET/CT scan will undergo surgical evaluation at the discretion of the surgeon, with the goal being to remove any suspected residual tumor with a negative resection margin while maintaining organ preservation. This may include biopsies and/or oncological resections of the primary tumor and lymph node metastases. Patients with a negative PET/CT scan will be observed.</description>
