      This is an, open-label, protocol designed to evaluate the activity of targeted therapy in
      anaplastic/undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Arm A will evaluate ATC/UTC with mutations or
      rearrangements detected in the ALK gene.

      There is no effective treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer in the locally recurrent or
      metastatic setting. Ceritinib will be administered to the patient until disease progression
      by RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of the trial
      for any other reason.

      The primary focus of this arm of the protocol is identifying ceritinib's activity in
      anaplastic or undifferentiated thyroid cancer patients. Those patients with mutations
      identified in their ALK gene by sequencing their tumor samples, or with the established ALK
      abnormalities will be treated with ALK-inhibitors. These include the Ventana assay and Vysis
      FISH probe, and patients with tumors positive by this assay will also be considered eligible
      for therapy on the trial.

      Therapeutic Portion:

      ARM A: ALK Abnormality IND Ceritinib 750 mg orally daily on Day 1 Continue q4 weeks x 2
      cycles

      Primary Endpoint: The development of progression; new recurrence or distant metastasis, as
      well as enlargement of an existing metastasis on radiographic imaging.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        1. Overall response rate for patients treated with ceritinib as part of the study.

        2. Death of study participant due to any cause.

      This is an, open-label, protocol designed to evaluate the activity of targeted therapy in
      anaplastic/undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Arm A will evaluate ATC/UTC with mutations or
      rearrangements detected in the ALK gene.

      There is no effective treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer in the locally recurrent or
      metastatic setting. Ceritinib will be administered to the patient until disease progression
      by RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of the trial

      The primary focus of this arm of the protocol is identifying ceritinib's activity in

      FISH probe, and patients with tumors positive by this assay will also be considered eligible
      for therapy on the trial.

      The goal of this multi-center, multi-arm trial is to measure the impact of treating
      metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer patients with targeted therapy selected for these
      patients due the presence of a genetic mutation or other aberration. This trial will serve as
      a framework by which new biomarker-drug combinations can be identified and added as new arms.

      Therapeutic Portion:

      ARM A: ALK Abnormality IND Ceritinib 750 mg orally daily on Day 1 Continue q4 weeks x 2
      cycles

      Primary Endpoint: The development of progression; new recurrence or distant metastasis, as
      well as enlargement of an existing metastasis on radiographic imaging. CT scans of the neck,
      chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed at baseline and every two cycles (cycles are 28
      days long) according to standard of care. Other imaging of these areas such as PET/MRI will
      be allowed if CT cannot be performed. MRI of the brain will be performed at baseline and as
      clinically indicated. Wherever it can be safely given, radiographic contrast agents should be
      given for the imaging studies.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        1. Overall response rate for patients treated with ceritinib as part of the study.

        2. Death of study participant due to any cause.

                  positive hCG laboratory test.

              11. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of
                  contraception during dosing and agree to continue for 3 months after the last
                  dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:

                    -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                       lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception.

                    -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
                       study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                       assessment.

                    -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the
                       appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the
                       ejaculate. For female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner
                       should be the sole partner for that subject.

                    -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):

                         1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                            other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy
                            (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal
                            hormone contraception.

                         2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                         3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository.

                  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
                  ligation at least six weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
                  follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
                  potential.

              12. Sexually active males unless they agree to use a condom during intercourse while
                  taking drug and agree to continue for 3 months after the last dose of study
                  treatment. Male patients for 3 months should not father a child in this period. A
                  condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
                  delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
