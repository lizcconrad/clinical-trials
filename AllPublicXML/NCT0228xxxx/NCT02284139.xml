  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have been demonstrated
      in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer (PC) and colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Dermatological reactions can cause significant physical and psycho-social
      discomfort to patients. In the present study, the investigators evaluated the effect of
      epidermal growth factor (EGF) ointment on EGFR inhibitor-related skin side effects (ERSEs).

    <textblock>
      The current study includes patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC or PC or CRC, with
      pathological confirmation. The inclusion criteria were NSCLC treated with erlotinib alone and
      PC treated with gemcitabine and erlotinib combination chemotherapy and CRC treated with
      cetuximab and5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)+Irinotecan+leucovorin(LV) (FOLFIRI), 5-FU+Oxaliplatin+LV
      (FOLFOX) and sufficient liver, kidney, and bone marrow function to undergo treatment. All the
      patients had Grade ≥2 ERSEs according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v. 4.03.

      The patients will be randomized 3 groups; Placebo group, Arm 1, and Arm 2. Arm 1 will be
      treated with 1ppm concentration EGF ointment. Arm 2 will be treated with 20ppm concentration
      EGF ointment. And placebo group will be treated with 0ppm concentration EGF ointment.
