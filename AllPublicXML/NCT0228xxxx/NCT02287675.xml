  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the kinetics and efficacy of two functionally different diagnostic agents,
      Lymphoseek (CD206 receptor targeted) and 99mTc-SC (Sulfur Colloid non-specific mapping agent)
      in intraoperative lymphatic mapping (ILM) and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB).

    <textblock>
      Single center, blinded, randomized, parallel-group, comparative study of Lymphoseek and
      99mTc-SC in the preoperative and intraoperative detection of lymph nodes in subjects with
      known breast cancer. All subjects will receive a single dose of 50 μg Lymphoseek radiolabeled
      with 0.5 mCi Tc 99m or 0.5 mCi of 99mTc-SC. Subjects may also receive up to 1 mL of vital
      blue dye (VBD) as a companion ILM agent. All radio-labeled agents will be administered in a
      single intradermal injection.

    <description>Subjects will receive a single intradermal injection of Lymphoseek followed by SPECT imaging conducted in two phases: initial sequential planar imaging at 30 to 60 second intervals for the first 60 minutes and repeated at 90 minutes and 120 minutes, as indicated, for identification of the SLN followed by SPECT/CT for higher resolution imaging in transaxial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Subjects will then proceed to surgery for lymphatic mapping. Lymphoseek positivity will be based upon radioactivity counts derived from the application of the handheld gamma probe ex vivo. Tumor resection or mastectomy will be performed according to standard procedures.</description>
