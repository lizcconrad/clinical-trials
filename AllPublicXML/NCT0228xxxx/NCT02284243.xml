  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, on Post-Operative
      Day (POD) 1, of DEX-IN compared with placebo, using the summed pain intensity difference over
      the first 48 hours (SPID48) in subjects with acute moderate to severe pain following
      unilateral bunionectomy.

    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Difference Over the First 48 Hours (SPID48).</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was recorded using a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (Range 0-10) where 0 equates to no pain (better), and 10 equates to the worst pain imaginable (worse). Pain intensity scores were to be recorded at the following time points: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post Dose 1. Thereafter pain assessments were to be recorded every 2 hours until 48 hours post Dose 1. Pain intensity differences from baseline were calculated at each time point and a time weighted summed pain intensity difference (SPID) was then calculated. Time weighted SPID calculations were computed by multiplying a weight factor to each score prior to summation. The weight factor at each time point was the time elapsed since the previous observation.</description>

    <description>Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to perceptible and meaningful pain relief for 50th percentile of subjects. Time to perceptible pain relief and time to meaningful pain relief were measured using the double-stopwatch method. The first stopwatch was given to each subject with the instructions to stop the watch when they first perceive pain relief to occur (time to perceptible relief). Once the first watch was stopped, the second stopwatch was given to the subject with the instructions to stop the watch when they are first experiencing meaningful pain relief (time to meaningful relief). A shorter time to pain relief is better.</description>

    <description>Kaplan Meier analysis of time to first use of rescue analgesia 50th percentile of subjects. Rescue analgesia (oral oxycodone) was available to subjects with inadequately controlled pain. All doses of rescue analgesia administered were recorded and the time from the first study dose to first rescue analgesia in each subject was evaluated. A longer time to first rescue is better.</description>

        <description>Pain intensity was recorded using a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (Range 0-10) where 0 equates to no pain (better), and 10 equates to the worst pain imaginable (worse). Pain intensity scores were to be recorded at the following time points: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post Dose 1. Thereafter pain assessments were to be recorded every 2 hours until 48 hours post Dose 1. Pain intensity differences from baseline were calculated at each time point and a time weighted summed pain intensity difference (SPID) was then calculated. Time weighted SPID calculations were computed by multiplying a weight factor to each score prior to summation. The weight factor at each time point was the time elapsed since the previous observation.</description>

        <title>Time to Perceptible and Meaningful Pain Relief</title>
        <description>Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to perceptible and meaningful pain relief for 50th percentile of subjects. Time to perceptible pain relief and time to meaningful pain relief were measured using the double-stopwatch method. The first stopwatch was given to each subject with the instructions to stop the watch when they first perceive pain relief to occur (time to perceptible relief). Once the first watch was stopped, the second stopwatch was given to the subject with the instructions to stop the watch when they are first experiencing meaningful pain relief (time to meaningful relief). A shorter time to pain relief is better.</description>
