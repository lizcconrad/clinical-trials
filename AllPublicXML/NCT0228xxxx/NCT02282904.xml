  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) causes immune system problems. Treatment is usually a
      bone marrow transplant from a fully matched donor. Researchers want to try using partially
      matched donors for patients who do not have a fully matched donor available. The researchers
      will also use the drug cyclophosphamide to try to improve the outcomes when using a partially
      matched donor.

      Objective:

      - To learn the effectiveness of using cyclophosphamide with a transplant from a partially
      matched donor in treating CGD.

      Eligibility:

      - Recipients: age 2-65 with CGD with an ongoing infection that has not been cured by standard
      treatment and no fully matched donor available in an appropriate timeframe.

      Design:

        -  Recipients will:

             -  be admitted to the hospital 2 weeks before transplant.

             -  be screened with blood and urine tests, breathing and heart health tests, X-rays,
                and/or magnetic resonance imaging. They may have a bone marrow aspiration and
                biopsy.

        -  meet with a social worker and dentist.

        -  get chemotherapy, radiation, and other medicines.

        -  get an intravenous (IV) catheter in their chest.

        -  have the transplant.

        -  get more medicines and standard supportive care.

        -  have blood drawn frequently.

        -  have to stay in the Washington, D.C. area for 3 months post-transplant.

        -  be followed closely for the first 6 months, and then less frequently for at least 5
           years.

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic transplant using HLA matched donors, both related and unrelated, has proven
      curative for patients with various immunodeficiencies, including those with ongoing
      infections. However donor availability remains a limiting factor in the application of this
      treatment modality. The use of haploidentical donors has in the past been fraught with a
      greater rate of complications related to both higher rates of GvHD and delayed
      immunorecovery. Newer transplant regimens appear to have diminished these risks and improved
      outcomes. We propose using a subablative conditioning regimen followed by post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide for patients with CGD who do not have an HLA matched donor but whose
      circumstances necessitate the use of a potentially curative, albeit high-risk treatment
      modality.
