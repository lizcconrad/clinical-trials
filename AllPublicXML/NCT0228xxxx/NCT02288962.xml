  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to lack of hormone overproduction in non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs), only the
      symptomatic adenomas or large adenomas with proven growth and risk for symptoms in near
      future will undergo pituitary surgery. The remaining adenomas are monitored regularly.
      Operation of these large adenomas will rarely remove all tumour tissue, and there is also a
      risk of worsening of pituitary function. Often, adenomas with the highest growth potential
      are operated several times and some also need radiation therapy, providing additional risk
      for pituitary failure. Unlike some of the hormone-producing adenomas, there is no established
      pharmacological treatment for NFPAs. However, there are a few non-randomized studies
      suggesting that treatment with dopamine agonists may slow growth, and also induce tumour
      shrinkage. At present, cabergoline is the dopamine agonist most widely used in the treatment
      of pituitary adenomas secreting prolactin.

      Aim is to study the effect of medical treatment with cabergoline in non-functioning pituitary
      adenomas on the change in tumour volume.

    <description>Target dose for cabergoline is 2 mg/week.The medication is administered in the evening to minimize side effects. If intolerable side effects occur despite this, it may be necessary to treat with a lower dose than 2 mg per week.
Treatment scheme: 0.5 mg x 1 per week the first 2 weeks, then 0.5 mg x 2 per week the next 2 weeks, then 1 + 0.5 mg per week the next 2 weeks, then 1 mg x 2 per week (target dose) for the rest of the study</description>
