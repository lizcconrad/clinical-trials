    <textblock>
      This research trial studies germ-line mutations in blood and saliva samples from patients
      with cancer. Studying samples of blood and saliva from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about how inherited genetic mutations can affect cancer
      predisposition (an inherited increase in the risk of developing cancer), their impact on
      treatment response, and their role in cancer development.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect germ-line deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and nucleic acids from cancer patients to
      further investigate the association and identify new germ-line mutations that impact cancer
      predisposition.

      II. To investigate the role of germ-line mutations in predicting cancer outcome and response
      to therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of the identified variants on tumor micro-ribonucleic acid
      (miRNA), protein and gene expression.

      II. To study expression of DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein in the blood of cancer
      patients with and without variants of interest to discover correlations between such levels
      and the presence of cancer and/or response to therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and saliva samples 1-3 times at the discretion of the
      investigator for germ-line mutation analysis.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of germ-line variants of interest will be compared to the baseline prevalence found using available large human genomic DNA collections. The primary statistical analysis will involve comparisons of genotypes between with (cases) and without (controls) the germ-line mutation. This analysis will include Pearson's chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test and computation of odds ratios to assess the relationship of the genetic polymorphism and cancer risk.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall genotype frequencies</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The overall genotype frequencies among the cases and expected control levels will first be compared with the frequencies expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by goodness-of-fit chi-square. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be used to estimate risk associated with the variant genotypes by using both univariate and unconditional multivariate logistic regression models.</description>
