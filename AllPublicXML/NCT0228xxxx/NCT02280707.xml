  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, randomized, delivered, and analyzed at the school level, evaluated the effect of
      simple, structural changes to school lunch rooms to make drinking water easier for students
      during lunch time. Half of the schools received posters promoting drinking water and
      installed cup dispensers stocked with cups next to lunchroom water fountains, while the other
      half received no intervention. The intervention outcomes were average water consumption and
      the proportion of students in the lunchroom who opted to drink water, as well as the
      proportion of students with sugary drinks at lunch. No identifying information on individual
      children was collected.
