  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Its prevalence is in progression and COPD is expected to become the fourth leading
      cause of death by 2030. COPD is characterized by periods of stability interspersed with acute
      infectious/inflammatory flare-ups, also called acute exacerbations, during which patients
      deteriorate, sometimes to the point of requiring immediate medical assistance. Although most
      patients eventually recover, repeated episodes of exacerbations may accelerate COPD
      progression. Exacerbations may further compromise the integrity of limb muscles by promoting
      further loss in muscle mass and strength.

      The overall objective of this substudy is to elucidate how an acute COPD exacerbation may
      affect limb muscles.

      Focusing our attention during exacerbations, a period of aggravated systemic inflammation,
      should be more rewarding in terms of understanding the link between inflammation burst and
      muscle disease in COPD. We have recently acquired experimental data supporting a role for the
      ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the worsening of limb muscle structure and function during an
      acute exacerbation, providing a solid framework for this investigation. The overall objective
      of this proposal is to substantiate these preliminary findings and elucidate how systemic
      inflammation during acute COPD exacerbation may affect limb muscles. Ultimately, our research
      could open new therapeutic avenues to minimize the systemic consequences of an acute
      exacerbation.

    <description>Our view is that targeting exacerbation is likely to unravel important mechanisms linking systemic inflammatory processes to downstream consequences on remote organs such as limb muscles. Inflammatory burst observed during exacerbation may be associated with upregulation of ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Atrogin-1, MuRF-1, Nedd4, ubiquitin C, poly-Ub), the main proteolytic pathway in this tissue, and thus with the occurrence of atrophying process.</description>
