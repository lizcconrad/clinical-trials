  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of 3% oregano extract ointment
      prepared in aqueous solution versus 1% hydrocortisone ointment, a standard treatment, in
      decreasing the inflammation associated with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. We plan to
      recruit 40 patients on the ages comprised between 2 and 17 years old and the study duration
      for each of the patient is 1 month.

      A single-center, investigator initiated, randomized controlled, double-blind trial will be
      conducted to determine the effects of an oregano extract in aqueous solution versus 1%
      hydrocortisone in the treatment of acute-subacute pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD). We
      suspect that topical oregano will serve as an effective, non-steroidal AD therapy,
      simultaneously offering extra benefits to pediatric patients as oregano is a natural product
      with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic properties that lacks reports of
      adverse effects associated with steroids, which children have been noted to be more
      susceptible to.

    <measure>The Clinical Efficacy Rated by the Patient or Caregiver on Days 0 and 25</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 25</time_frame>
    <description>This was measured with two questions. The first one referred to the description of the lesion and it included six characteristics: clear, dry, scaly, redness, cracks/opening and oozing. The second questions asked to grade how itchy was the patient.
All characteristics were measured on a scale from 0 to 5 (0 none, 5 extremely bothered/losing sleep).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the Clinical Efficacy Rated by a Study Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Physician was asked to grade four characteristics: erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification. The grade was none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Histological Improvement Measured by Confocal Microscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Confocal microscopy was done to the patient on day 0, day 14 and day 28. Due to technical difficulties, this outcome measure was not collected.</description>

    <measure>Measure Presence of S. Aureus Colonization on Affected Skin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Bacterial culture of the affected area was done on day 0 and day 14.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate Cosmetic Acceptability of Topical Agents</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 7 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The patient or caregiver rated how the product felt on their skin after applying the product, measuring the cosmetic acceptability on day 7 and 14. The scale was excellent, good, moderate and poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate Skin Tolerance of Topical Agents</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 7 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The patient or caregiver rated how well the patient tolerated the product after applying it on day 7 and 14. The scale was excellent, good, moderate and poor.</description>
