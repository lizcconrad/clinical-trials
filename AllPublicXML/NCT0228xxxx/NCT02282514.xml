  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-myeloablative regimens (as the investigators use herein) are designed to maximally
      suppress the immune system without destruction of the bone marrow stem cell compartment.

      When using a non-myeloablative regimen recovery occurs without infusion of stem cells and the
      stem cells are autologous. While not necessary for recovery, stem cell infusion may shorten
      the interval of neutropenia and attendant complications. Thus in reality there is no
      transplant only an autologous supportive blood product.

      Based on our encouraging results of non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation, for patients with multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      polyneuropathy, the investigators will investigate the role of non-myeloablative
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with SPS who require assistance to
      ambulate.

      mcg/kg/day subcutaneous (SQ) will start on day +5 and will continue until apheresis is
      discontinued. Apheresis will begin when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.0 x 109/L and
      continue until &gt;2.0 x 106 cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34)+ cells/kg patient weight are
      cryopreserved. A 10-15 liter apheresis will be performed unless stopped earlier for clinical
      judgment of toxicity (e.g., numbness, tetany). A maximum of four apheresis will be performed.
