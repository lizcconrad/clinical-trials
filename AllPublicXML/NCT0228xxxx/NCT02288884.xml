      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a silver containing dressing
      (Acticoat Post-Op) compared to a standard dressing (OpSite PostOp) on post elective cesarean
      section wound complications in obese women (BMI &gt;35).

      Women scheduled for an elective cesarean section at term will be recruited to participate in
      this study. The investigators plan to recruit 100 women. Baseline demographic information
      will be obtained at the pre-op visit. Eligible subjects will be randomized to received a
      silver containing dressing (Acticoat PostOp) or the standard dressing (OpSite PostOp). A
      randomization table will be computer generated in blocks of 20. A sealed opaque envelope
      containing the assigned dressing will accompany the patient to the operating room. Standard
      antibiotic prophylaxis will be provided prior to skin incision. A subcuticular suture will be
      used for skin closure. At the time of skin closure, the envelope will be opened and the
      assigned dressing will be applied. The dressing will only be changed if it is saturated. The
      dressing will be removed at the time of discharge from hospital. A questionnaire regarding
      wound complications will be completed at the time of discharge from hospital, at 2 weeks
      post-op and 6 weeks post-op.
