  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection is the principal cause of preterm births. Most (90%) women with preterm deliveries
      have no abnormal history. It is widely agreed that preterm delivery is often associated with
      bacterial vaginosis. One of the major difficulties at this time is that the diagnosis of
      bacterial vaginosis is based on heterogeneous criteria. The technique currently used is the
      Nugent score, but it lacks the characteristics necessary for widespread use in the general
      population. It must be performed on a fresh swab, and any delay in transporting it can cause
      drying that makes the test difficult to perform.

      The investigators have developed a rapid diagnostic tool for bacterial vaginosis using
      molecular biology based on a point of care model and obtained a patent (European Patent
      Office N° 2087134). In comparison with the reference techniques, our tool's performance has
      been excellent, in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive
      values. In particular, our work showed that 57% of the flora samples rated as intermediate on
      the Nugent score were in reality true bacterial vaginosis. Molecular biology therefore
      identifies a homogeneous population of women with vaginal flora anomalies. The investigators
      recently showed that the carriage of Atopobium vaginae and/or Gardnerella vaginalis &gt;105/mL
      shortens the time to delivery in a population at risk of preterm delivery (PHRC 2006).
      Vaginal flora anomalies are therefore an important target for preventing preterm delivery.

      The principal objective is to use a cost-effectiveness study to assess the medical and
      economic impact of a new strategy for the screening and subsequent treatment of vaginal flora
      anomalies before the 20th week of gestation- molecular biology techniques (PCR for A. vaginae
      and G. vaginalis by point-of-care testing) will test self-collected vaginal samples in a
      population of pregnant women at low risk of preterm delivery. There are multiple secondary
      objectives, including assessment of the effect of the strategy on the following indicators-
      delivery before 26, 32, and 37 weeks. Methods-An open-label prospective randomized study will
      compare 2 groups with different management of their pregnancies. Pregnant women at low risk,
      regardless of any symptoms, will be randomized into 2 groups. The study will not include
      women at high risk of preterm delivery. Innovative strategy (group A)- these women will
      undergo routine screening for bacterial vaginosis by analysis of their self-collected vaginal
      samples with this innovative technique.

    <description>these women will undergo routine screening for bacterial vaginosis by analysis of their self-collected vaginal samples with this innovative technique; if the test is found to be positive, an appropriate treatment will be prescribed. The POC (point-of-care) test will be considered positive if: A. vaginae is detected at a threshold &gt; 105.copies per ml and/or G. vaginalis &gt; 105 copies per ml. The women with vaginosis will be screened monthly for recurrences through 28 weeks, and recurrence will be treated.</description>
