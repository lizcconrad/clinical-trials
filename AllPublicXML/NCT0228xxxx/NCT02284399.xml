      Information on pregnant women undergoing non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) at one of the
      Obstetrix Medical Groups Outpatient Centers between January 2012 and June 2014 will be
      retrospectively gathered and an analysis of the impact and prevalence of NIPT. This will be
      compared to a control group of pregnant women in those same practices undergoing prenatal
      testing during the months of January 2010-July 2010.

      Information regarding the frequency of non-invasive testing (NIPT), the impact of screening
      on the need for and frequency of invasive testing, and the indications for testing are
      important for the clinicians in this country to not only understand the impact that this
      testing has had but also to plan for allocation of personnel and resources in their prenatal
      testing units, as well as many other more subtle changes including describing changes to
      referring clinicians and patients and projecting financial impacts. Information on pregnant
      women undergoing NIPT at one of the Obstetrix Medical Groups Outpatient Centers between
      January 2012 and June 2014 will be retrospectively gathered and compared to a control group
      of pregnant women in those same practices undergoing prenatal testing during the months of
      January 2010-July 2010. An analysis of the impact of NIPT will be done.
