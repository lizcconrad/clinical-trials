  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of an experimental treatment (termed
      BATE-G) for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) in Veterans compared to the current, VA-approved
      standard of care treatment. Currently, treatments for grief in Veterans remain understudied.
      Our research group has recently completed pilot work on an innovative, technology-leveraged
      treatment protocol for PGD that combines Behavioral Activation with Therapeutic Exposure
      (BATE) and appears readily applicable to the Veteran and Military populations. Per the VA /
      DoD Iraq War Clinician Guide, 2nd ed., the current standard of treatment is Cognitive
      Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling.

      The study will enroll 140 Veterans, aged 21 years and older, who served in any combat era.
      All Veterans will meet criteria for PGD. There will be assessments at baseline, 1 week, 3
      months, and 6 months post treatment. During the treatment phase, Veterans will undergo 7
      weekly sessions of either BATE-G or standard treatment. Sessions 2-6 will be delivered via
      televideo to the Veteran's home.

      We hypothesize that BATE-G will be more effective than standard treatment in reducing
      symptoms of PGD, both at post-treatment and follow-up. Moreover, BATE-G will be more
      effective in reducing acute emotional distress and preventing long-term emotional distress in
      terms of general depression and anxiety symptoms. BATE-G will result in increased frequency
      of completed positively reinforcing, community-based events when compared to Cognitive
      Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling. BATE-G will also result in greater
      improvements in perceived social support and health.

      Note: This project is the first evidence-based treatment for PGD in military populations,
      thus addressing a significant service gap.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 'dual burden' of (a) loss of a fellow service member in the context of (b) experiencing
      repeated extreme life threat is unique to military combat personnel and a core characteristic
      of combat-related Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), a disorder as prevalent as Post-traumatic
      stress disorder and associated with functional impairment, disability, and suicidality.
      Effective treatments for depression and PTSD have proven less than adequate in treating PGD
      when each is offered in isolation; and simply combining these 12-16 week treatment regimens
      into a 24-36 week treatments is not a viable approach, particularly with a population
      predisposed to avoiding extended mental health care. This project addresses the need for a
      Veteran/ military specific treatment of PGD, and uses technology to deliver this treatment in
      a format that is far more likely to be accepted by military personnel and Veterans. This
      study will impact clinical practice by providing the first evidence for effective treatment
      of PGD in Veterans.
