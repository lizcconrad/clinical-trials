  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the objective of this protocol is evaluate the safety and tolerance of a communication system
      for severely disable patients with myopathies. The system analyses the brain electric
      activity in real time and converts it into digital commands for a spelling device, which is
      refered to as the P300 speller in the scientific literature. The secondary objective is to
      compare the performance of such tool with a more traditional assistive technology for the
      communication of severely disabled patients : scanner systems.

      This is a pilot study for which 15 patients with myopathies will be included. The primary
      objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerance of a system for communication
      named P300 speller. The P3Speller is a brain computer interface (BCI) that records the brain
      electric activity with the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and analyzes it in real time
      in order to identify slight changes generated in relation to a visual stimulation (evoked
      potentials). The identification of such brain potentials is translated into a digital command
      for a spelling device. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of
      this spelling device with a more traditional assisitve technology called scanner interface. A
      scanner interface uses single clicks that can be obtaines with an adequate interface which
      exploits the remaining muscular activity from a patients.

      Every patient will use each interface (P300 sepller and Scanning) with a randomized order.
      Results will bec o,pared in terms of information flow from the patient to the computer
      expressed in bit rate per minute.

    <description>The comparison criteria for performance was the bitrate, br, that is defined by (Wolpow et al. 2000):
〖br=log〗_2 (M)+p.log_2 p+(1-p) 〖log〗_2 (1-p)/(M-1) where M=36 is the number of symbols p the spelling accuracy (the percentage of correctly identified symbols).</description>
