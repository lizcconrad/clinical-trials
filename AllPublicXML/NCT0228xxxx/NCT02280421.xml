  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASP2151 is an experimental treatment for herpes. Patients undergoing organ and tissue
      transplantation may be prescribed ciclosporin to suppress their immune system to give the
      transplant an increased chance of not being rejected. A patient with a compromised immune
      system is more susceptible to infections such as herpes, which will require treatment.

          -  Sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the trial and any hazards of
             participating in it. Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the investigator and
             to participate in, and comply with the requirements of, the entire trial.

          -  Any of the following liver function tests higher than 1.5 times the ULN at the
             screening visit: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT).

          -  Platelet counts outside normal limits.

          -  Presence of acute or chronic illness or history of chronic illness sufficient to

             by the investigator and sponsor). See Appendix 1 for common CYP3A4
             interactors/substrates.

             over-the-counter medicine, with the exception of paracetamol (acetaminophen).

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription
             medicine within the previous 3 months.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months before the trial, eg as a blood
             donor.

          -  Presence or history of drug or alcohol abuse, or intake of more than 21 units of
             alcohol weekly or more than 5 cigarettes daily.

          -  Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing.

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg); or positive test for hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb).

          -  Positive test for hepatitis C, HIV1, HIV2, or active and latent tuberculosis.

          -  Blood pressure and heart rate in seated position at the screening examination outside
             the ranges 90-140 mm Hg systolic, 40-90 mm Hg diastolic; heart rate 40-100 beats/min.

          -  Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Objection by General Practitioner (GP) to volunteer entering trial.
