    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction when CHF5993
      (pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) is administered with Cimetidine (probe inhibitor of
      the organic cation transport in the kidneys), by comparing the systemic exposure (AUC0-t) of
      Glycopyrronium Bromide (GB), after a single dose of the fixed combination CHF 5993 pMDI
      administered alone or at steady-state of Cimetidine

      the safety and tolerability of study treatments based on evaluation of vital signs,
      electrocardiograms and clinical laboratory assessments will be also evaluated.
