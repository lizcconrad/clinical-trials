    <textblock>
      The recent data suggest that cancer cells at the origin of prostate cancer metastases can be
      detected in an early stage. Available techniques allow phenotypic analysis of cancer cells in
      circulating blood (cellsearch) or in marrow hematopoietic (flow cytometry). Pilot study on
      180 patients infected by prostate cancer at all stage of disease, show that c-met marker ,
      integrin alpha 2 and 6 expressed in marrow and quantified by flow cytometry were predictor of
      metastatic progress. In this new study the investigators will analyze antibody panel by
      cellsearch and flow cytometry on marrow sample of castration-Resistant prostate cancer
      patients.
