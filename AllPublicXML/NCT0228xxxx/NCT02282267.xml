  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was proposed to validate the efficacy of gefitinib as first-line therapy in
      advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation determined by plasma cf-DNA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients without enough tissue for EGFR mutation detection can also have opportunity to use
      EGFR-TKI as first line therapy. Meanwhile, this study was also proposed to explore the best
      intervention time of anti-resistant drugs (such as AZD 9291, a T790M inhibitor) through the
      quantitative and dynamic analysis of EGFR sensitive and resistant mutation in plasma cf-DNA
      during EGFR-TKI treatment process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures.

          -  Male or female patients aged ranging from 18 to 75 years old.

          -  Histological confirmation of lung adenocarcinoma. Attention: the paraffin embedded
             cytological samples extracted from pleural effusion are acceptable. Adeno-squamous
             carcinoma is not allowed to enroll. Sputum cytology alone cannot be acceptable.
             Bronchoalveolar lavage and fine needle aspiration cytology specimens for lesions also
             cannot acceptable.

          -  Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (stage Ⅳ, IASLC, 2009).

          -  EGFR sensitive mutation (including exon 19 del and/or exon 21 L858R) in plasma cf-DNA
             by ddPCR.

          -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and other systemic anti-cancer treatment (such as EGFR
             inhibitor including other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and EGFR antibody, and
             anti-vascular therapy including vascular epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor
             and Endostar) naïve. Radical surgery and radiotherapy must be completed at least 6
             months before start of study treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed and must be
             finished at least 6months before start of study drug. Palliative radiotherapy must be
             completed at least 2 weeks before start of study treatment with no persistent
             radiation toxicity.

          -  At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at
             baseline as 10mm in the longest diameter (lymph nodes must have short axis more than
             15mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is
             suitable for accurate repeated measurements.

          -  WHO Performance Status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Criteria for laboratory examinations:

        Blood white cell count≥3.0*109/L, Neutrophile cell count ≥1.5*109/L Platelet count
        ≥100*109/L Total bilirubin (TB) ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal Aspartate
        aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2 times upper limit of normal; for

          -  Considered to require radiotherapy to the lung at the time of study entry or in the
             near future.

          -  Newly diagnosed symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis or spinal cord
             compression unless treated with surgery and/or radiation and stable without steroid
             for at least 2 weeks.

          -  Uncontrolled massive pleural or pericardial effusion.

          -  Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial disease,
             radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment or any evidence of clinically
             active interstitial lung disease.

          -  The presence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in baseline CT scans.

             sicca, serious exposure keratitis or other potentially increased epithelial lesions.

          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe of uncontrolled systemic disease
             (e.g. active infection, uncontrolled hypertension unstable angina, congestive hear
             failure, liver, kidney or metabolic diseases).

          -  Could not accept oral administration, need intravenous nutrition, previous operation
             that affect absorption or active peptic ulcer.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Prior administration of other study drug or drug without approval within 30 days
             before the first day of study drug administration.

          -  Other co-existing malignancies on malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years, with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ or completely
