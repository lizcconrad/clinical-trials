  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-dose aspirin started in the first-trimester has been associated with a decrease of
      preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and preterm birth in high-risk pregnancies. Multiple
      pregnancies are considered a risk factor for all those adverse outcomes. The main objective
      of the current trial is to evaluate whether a dose of 80 mg of aspirin is associated with an
      improvement of birthweight compared to placebo in twin pregnancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twin pregnancies represent approximately 3% of births and are associated with increased risks
      of complications such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. All of
      these complications are commonly associated impaired placental function and low birth weight.

      Most prophylactic measures tested over the years have failed to prevent these adverse
      outcomes in twin pregnancies. Since administration of low-dose of aspirin can improve
      placental function and all these adverse outcomes in high-risk pregnancies, mainly in women
      with prior adverse outcomes, we suggest that similar benefits could be seen in twins. We are
      expecting that the administration of low-dose of aspirin starting in the first-trimester in
      twin pregnancies could lead to an improvement of placental function, a reduction or these
      adverse perinatal outcomes and therefore to an improvement of birthweight.
