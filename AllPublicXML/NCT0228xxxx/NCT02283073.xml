  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to design and validate the blood based PDx gene expression
      assay for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease patients. Differential diagnosis
      includes patients with Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Corticobasal
      Degeneration, Lewy Body Dementia, Essential Tremor and Normal Controls.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the PDx assay will be designed and validated in order to distinguish between
      Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) to patients with similar symptoms and healthy controls.
      The differential diagnosis cohort includes patients diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy
      (MSA), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), Essential
      Tremor (ET) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and Healthy Controls.

      This is a prospective observational study. Blood samples and clinical data will be collected
      at the first and only study visit. The expression levels of 5 to 6 genes will be analyzed by
      blinding technicians concerning the diagnosis, demographic data and clinical data, which will
      be revealed after sending PDx gene expression values to the clinical sites. The gene
      expression levels will be compared between Parkinson's disease patients to the differential
      diagnosis cohort and healthy controls. The primary aim of the study is to design and validate
      a clinical classifier that will aid the physician in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease
      patients. The analysis will be performed in two stages: Stage 1) Exploration analysis and
      Stage 2) Validation. After one year of taking a blood sample, the study physician will
      contacted to confirm the patient's diagnosis.

      Blood samples will be collected at specialized movement disorder clinics.

      Medical history, clinical diagnostic features, family history in regard to Parkinson's
      disease, use of medication and routine imaging assessment (not mandatory) will be collected
      at the first and only patient visit.

    <measure>The Diagnostic Accuracy of PDx mRNA Assay in Diagnosing Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>One year from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the PDx gene expression assay, comprised of 5-6 expressed genes (mRNA - RQ-PCR), to differentiate patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease from the Differential Diagnosis Group. Diagnostic Accuracy includes sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Diagnostic Accuracy will be calculated by comparing the PDx assay results to the Gold Standard Diagnosis, which will be the Clinical diagnosis of the Patient one year after the first and only visit (day of blood collection). The physician investigator will be contacted if there was any change in the baseline diagnosis one year after blood collection according to routine clinical findings.</description>
