  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early dementia diagnosis improves patient and carer experience, links them to appropriate
      care and support and enables timely symptomatic treatment. The guidelines of the UK National
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
      assist with the diagnosis in suspected dementia. Recently, computerised analysis of MRI
      scans, also known as automated brain morphometry, has shown potential to detect the brain
      changes characteristic of early dementia, and may therefore be a useful addition to the
      standard reporting performed by a neuroradiologist. The present pilot study will assess
      whether adding brain morphometric analysis to the usual diagnostic pathway improve diagnosis
      in clinical practice as an addition to the existing diagnostic pathway in a memory clinic
      setting. The main purpose of the study is to compare measures of the clinicians diagnostic
      confidence in patients with and without brain morphometry.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects referred to a South London and Maudsley (SLaM) memory clinic for suspected
             dementia.

          -  Cognitive scores (standardised MMSE of 15 or more inclusive) and impairment in
             activities of daily living consistent with a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia or
             mild cognitive impairment.

          -  Working knowledge of English.

          -  Must consent to the imaging and follow-up aspects of the study. If the patient lacks
             capacity to consent to the study, they will not be invited to participate.

          -  If the patient has a partner or carer able to provide an independent evaluation of
             functioning and able and willing to be involved in a follow-up interview about their
             experience of the diagnostic process, the carer should also consent to participate in
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for MRI

          -  Patients 50 or younger (cognitive impairment in this younger population is only
             exceptionally due to a neurodegenerative condition). There are no upper age limits.
