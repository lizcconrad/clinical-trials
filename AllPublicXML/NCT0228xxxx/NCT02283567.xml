      The investigators aim to compare elasticity of the uterine cervix in singleton and twin
      pregnancies of similar gestational age.

      Softening of the uterine cervix occurs during pregnancy.There is a possibility that this
      process occurs earlier in twin versus singleton pregnancies.The softening of the cervix is
      reflected by the level of its elasticity which can be measured sonoelastographically. A two
      dimension image of the cervix is obtained in the midsagittal section and the length is noted.
      A 2nd sonoelastography image is obtained before pressure is applied with the transducer in
      the area of the internal os and a third sonoelastography image is obtained until no more
      shortening of the anterior-posterior diameter is observed.Elastography measurements of the
      internal os are performed using a color map: red (soft), yellow (medium soft), blue (medium
      hard) and purple (hard) before and after the application of strain.The change between the
      color maps before and after strain application in singleton pregnancies will be compared to
      the change in twin pregnancies of similar gestational age.
