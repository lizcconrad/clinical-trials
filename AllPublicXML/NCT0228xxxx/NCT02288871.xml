  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine why sutureless aortic bioprostheses apparently
      offer better haemodynamic properties compared to sewed-in aortic bioprostheses in patients
      who underwent aortic valve replacement.

      Our approach to address this question is the combination of clinical data with the
      application of specifically validated experimental and computer based analyses to compare the
      performance of these valves under patient-specific conditions.
