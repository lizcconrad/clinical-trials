  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to provide a mechanism that allows for a better understanding of
      patient outcomes following rehabilitation. This includes functional outcomes measured by
      standardized and validated tools from the published literature. It incorporates comorbidities
      and patient demographic characteristics. It includes measures of general health as well along
      with activities of daily living and behavioral health aspects. Measures of quality and
      satisfaction and use of Net Promoter Scores also are included. All of these components come
      together to form a remarkably comprehensive picture of patients and their associated
      outcomes. This is a unique milestone in rehabilitative care and will act to inform and direct
      evidence-based approaches and treatment guidelines.

      Data are collected via the investigators proprietary electronic medical record system and are
      synthetic to the clinical process—that is, the data are collected in real-time with patients
      and the scores are immediately provided to the treating therapist as well as archived for
      later Registry and scientific use. Subsequent reporting can be risk adjusted to any variable
      collected which yields robust insights as to idiopathic patient conditions. However, no PHI
      information will be available.

      This is a retrospective, longitudinal, observational registry study to provide a unique and
      effective mechanism to acquire real‐world data on patients receiving physical therapy in a
      variety of settings, regardless of disorder being treated.

      In addition to the standard visit/data collection, patients in the AEGIS™ Registry will also
      be asked to complete a Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF‐12) and a standardized functional
      outcome instrument. Generally, the following will be available:

      Patient Initial Assessment for Physical Therapy:

        -  De-identified Protected Health Information in accordance to 45 CFR 164.514

        -  Diagnosis and history Baseline functional outcome measure(s)

        -  DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand)

        -  Modified Oswestry (lumbar spine)

        -  Knee Outcome Survey

        -  Foot &amp; Ankle Ability Measure

        -  Lower Extremity Functional Scale

        -  Neck Disability Index Questionnaire

        -  Pain rating

        -  Global Rating of Change Scale

        -  Baseline Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF‐12)

      Patient Start of Care:

        -  Patient information (age, BMI, sex, de-identified Protected Health Information in
           accordance to 45 CFR 164.514)

        -  Medical/surgical history

        -  Therapy review (diagnosis, therapy)

        -  Treatment plan

      Ongoing Patient Assessment:

        -  De-identified Protected Health Information in accordance to 45 CFR 164.514

        -  Treatment plan update(s)

        -  Concurrent (every 10th visit) administration of functional outcome measure(s)

        -  Concurrent (every 10th visit) administration of Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF‐12)

        -  Patient Satisfaction

        -  Mailed to discharged patient within a week of discharge from physical therapy with a
           self-addressed, stamped return envelope Insurance Information

        -  Insurance carriers

        -  Insurance coverage
