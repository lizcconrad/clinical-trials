      A randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate the capability of Straumann® VivOss™
      compared to Geistlich Bio-Oss in sinus floor augmentation to demonstrate superiority of
      Straumann® VivOss™ compared to Geistlich Bio-Oss in regards to the ratio of newly formed bone
      to residual bone substitute.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study. The total study duration for each
      patient should be 9-14 months (from screening to last visit).

      Enrolled subjects are randomized to one of the following groups:

        1. Sinus floor elevation with Straumann® VivOss™

        2. Sinus floor elevation with Geistlich Bio-Oss®

      In total 6 visits per patient are scheduled in this study. The histological evaluation of the
      ratio of newly formed bone to residual bone graft, survival and success rate of study
      implants and adverse events (AEs) will be assessed.

      The study devices Straumann® VivOss™ and Geistlich Bio-Oss are CE-(Conformité Européenne,
      meaning European Conformity) marked products.

      Two centers, one in Germany and one in Switzerland will participate.
