        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  At least 12 months since last adjuvant chemotherapy

          -  At least 6 weeks since prior radiotherapy providing that the extent and site of
             radiotherapy fields are such that marked bone marrow suppression is NOT expected

          -  Patients who have received palliative radiotherapy must have recovered from any
             reversible toxic effects e.g. nausea and vomiting caused by radiation of fields

             risk

          -  Sexually active patients refusing to practice adequate contraception; Patients with
             conditions which might affect absorption of an oral drug (for example intermittent
