      The telavancin observational use registry (TOUR) will collect data to support study of the
      efficacy, safety, and pattern of use of telavancin in hospital-based inpatients and in
      outpatients being treated in infusion centers who are receiving clinician directed telavancin
      therapy.

      This is a retrospective medical chart review, multicenter, observational study to examine
      telavancin efficacy and safety in a real-word setting and to characterize the pattern of use
      of telavancin in hospital-based inpatients and in outpatient infusion centers. All treatment
      decisions and clinical assessment will be made at the discretion of the treating physician
      per usual care and are not mandated by study design or protocol.
