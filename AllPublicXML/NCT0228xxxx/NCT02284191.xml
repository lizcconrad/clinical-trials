      This study aims to investigate the effect of early CTCA in patients with suspected or
      confirmed Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) or
      Medical Assessment Unit (MAU), upon interventions, event rates and health care costs in a
      pragmatic clinical trial and economic evaluation up to 1 year after the trial intervention.
      The primary objective will be to investigate the effect of the intervention on the proportion
      of patients with all-cause death or recurrent non-fatal type 1 or type 4b myocardial
      infarction (MI) at one year.

      DESIGN: Open parallel group randomised controlled trial of early computed tomography coronary
      angiography (CTCA) in patients presenting with suspected/confirmed acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) to Emergency Departments (ED) and Medical Assessment Units.

      SETTING: 30 EDs, radiology, cardiology and acute medical services in tertiary/district
      general National Health Service (NHS) hospitals.

      TARGET POPULATION

      Inclusion Criteria: Patient ≥18 years with symptoms mandating investigation for suspected or
      confirmed ACS with at least one of: ECG abnormalities e.g. ST segment depression &gt;0.5 mm;
      History of ischaemic heart disease (where the clinician assessing patient confirms history
      based on patient history or available records); Troponin elevation above the 99th centile of
      the normal reference range or increase in high sensitivity troponin meeting European Society
      of Cardiology criteria for 'rule-in' or myocardial infarction (NB troponin assays will vary
      from site to site; local laboratory reference standards will be used). Exclusion Criteria:
      1.Signs, symptoms, or investigations supporting high-risk ACS: ST elevation MI; ACS with
      signs or symptoms of acute heart failure or circulatory shock; Crescendo episodes of typical
      anginal pain; Marked or dynamic ECG changes e.g. ST depression of &gt;3 mm; Clinical team have
      scheduled early invasive coronary angiography on day of trial eligibility assessment. 2.
      Patient inability to undergo CT: Severe renal failure (serum creatinine &gt;250 µmol/L or
      estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min); Contrast allergy; Beta blocker intolerance
      (if no alternative heart rate limiting agent available/suitable) or allergy; Inability to
      breath hold; Atrial fibrillation (where mean heart rate is anticipated to be greater than 75
      beats per minute after beta blockade). 3. Patient has had invasive coronary angiography or
      CTCA within last 2 years and the previous investigation revealed obstructive coronary artery
      disease, or patient had either investigation within the last 5 years and the result was
      normal. 4.Previous recruitment to the trial; 5.Known pregnancy or currently breast feeding;
      6. Inability to consent; 7.Further investigation for ACS would not in the patient's interest,
      due to limited life expectancy, quality of life or functional status; 8.Prisoners HEALTH
      TECHNOLOGIES BEING ASSESSED: Early use of ≥64-slice CTCA as part of routine assessment
      compared to standard care.

      MEASUREMENT OF COSTS/OUTCOMES: Primary end-point will be one-year all-cause death or
      recurrent type 1 MI. Secondary endpoints: 1. Hospital stay, coronary care stay; 2. Proportion
      of patients receiving invasive coronary angiography during index hospitalisation; 3.
      Proportion of patients receiving coronary revascularisation during index hospitalisation; 4.
      Proportion of patients receiving subsequent unplanned coronary revascularisation after index
      hospitalisation; 5. Proportion of patients receiving invasive coronary angiography despite no
      significant lesion on CTCA; 6. Proportion of patients prescribed ACS therapies and/or
      discharged on secondary prevention treatment during index hospitalisation; 7.
      Rehospitalisation/presentation with chest pain within 12 months; 8. Patient symptoms and
      quality of life up to 12 months; 9. NHS resource utilisation; 10. Patient satisfaction.
      Safety: 1. Proportion of patients with allergy/anaphylaxis/acute kidney injury; 2. Proportion
      of patients with alternative diagnoses e.g. aortic dissection or incidental but potentially
      concerning e.g. malignancy; 3. Total radiation exposure in each arm. Cost effectiveness:
      estimated in terms of the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)
      gained.

      SAMPLE SIZE: 2,500 patients.
