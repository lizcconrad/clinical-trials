      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if Apixaban will decrease the complication of having
      another stroke for people who have atrial fibrillation if initiated earlier than standard of
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open label, randomized, active control, parallel-group pilot trial to examine the
      effect of initiation of APIXABAN at days 0-3 (TIA), days 3-5 (small stroke) and days 7-9
      (medium stroke) to decrease fatal and/or recurrent stroke/TIA in 120 subjects who have
      suffered a recent( 0 to 48 hours from symptoms) TIA, or small to medium ischemic stroke
      compared to standard of care warfarin treatment regimen. Subjects will be randomly assigned
      in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms (apixaban or warfarin). Subjects will be followed
      for a total of 180 days during from screening through monthly follow-up visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Written Informed Consent

          2. Males and Females over 18 years of age.

          3. History of Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) by documentation in the medical
             history or newly diagnosed nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation at time of study
             randomization by ECG, device or telemetry .

          4. Diagnosis of TIA or small or medium ischemic stroke 0 to 48 hours from signs or
             symptoms.

          5. Women of child-bearing potential must use a reliable method of contraception and must
             provide a negative pregnancy test at entry into the study and within 24 hours of study
             treatment initiation.

          6. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the
             duration of treatment with study drug Apixaban plus 5 half-lives (approximately 3
             days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 33 days post-treatment
             completion.

          7. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with Apixaban plus 5
             half-lives (approximately 3 days) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a
             total of 93 days post-treatment completion.

          8. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt
             from contraceptive requirements. However they must still undergo pregnancy testing as
             described in this section.

        Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy
        Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of
        contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and correctly.

        At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of one method of highly effective
        contraception as listed below:

        HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

          -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal
             ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena by WOCBP
             subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects
             participating in the study may use hormone based contraceptives as one of the
             acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug

          -  IUDs, such as ParaGard™

          -  Tubal ligation

          -  Vasectomy.
