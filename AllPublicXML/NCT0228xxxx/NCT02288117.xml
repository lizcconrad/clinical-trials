    <textblock>
      The objective of this PMCF is to collect clinical and radiographic outcome information on
      Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) performed with LINK® SP-CL® Hip Prosthesis Stem under routine
      conditions.

      The results collected will be used to clinically confirm the performance and safety of the
      LINK® SP-CL® Hip Prosthesis Stem in terms of the manufacturer's obligation to perform a PMCF.
      Furthermore the results can be used for future regulatory processes if needed.

      Post Market Clinical Follow-ups (PMCF) through observational studies are an important tool to
      detect infrequent complications or problems, events specific to defined patient populations
      and long term performance issues under routine conditions [2,3]. Against this background a
      prospective multi-center outcome study of the LINK® SP-CL® is planned.
