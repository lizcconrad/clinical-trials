  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an evaluation of the immune response to pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (PRV)
      after a fourth dose is given at 9 months of age with local WHO Expanded Programme on
      Immunization (EPI) vaccines in Mali.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, individual-randomized, parallel-group, comparative
      immunogenicity trial. Participating infants randomized to Group A will receive one dose each
      of measles vaccine (MV), yellow fever vaccine (YFV), and meningitis conjugate vaccine
      (PsA-TT-5μg) at 9 months of age, and infants randomized to Group B will receive one dose each
      of MV, YFV, PsA-TT-5μg, and PRV at 9 months of age.

      The study will simultaneously evaluate two primary objectives, one for noninferiority of the
      response to MV given with PRV (co-primary objective 1) and one for noninferiority of the
      response to YFV given with PRV (co-primary objective 2). For evaluation of co-primary
      objectives, venous blood specimens will be collected immediately prior to receipt of study
      vaccines and 4 weeks (to plus 1 week) later. Measles immunogenicity will be evaluated by
      measuring the MV neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates and geometric mean concentration
      (GMCs) 4 weeks post-vaccination. Yellow fever immunogenicity will be evaluated by measuring
      the yellow fever serum neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates and geometric mean titers
      (GMTs) 4 weeks post-vaccination

      For the secondary objectives of noninferiority of the response to PsA-TT-5μg given with PRV
      and superiority of a supplemental dose of PRV, PsA-TT-5μg immunogenicity will be evaluated by
      measuring the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) seroconversion rates and GMTs 4 weeks
      post-vaccination. PRV immunogenicity will be evaluated by measuring the anti-rotavirus
      Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroconversion rates and GMCs 4 weeks
      post-vaccination.

      Immediate adverse reactions, solicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and
      serious adverse events, especially intussusception, will be assessed through home visits and
      study clinic visits on Days 1-5, 7, 28, 56, and 84. As part of safety evaluations, a malaria
      test will be conducted on Days 0, 28 and 84.
