  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are a quite common congenital disorder. Over years,
      surgical excision was proposed to the patients because transformation into a malignant skin
      tumor (melanoma) was feared. Recent data proof that the risk for malignancy was
      overestimated. Nowadays still a lot of patients express their wish for surgical removal out
      of aesthetic reasons and psychological impacts. Many patients and families experience
      stigmatization because of the nevus. To proof a medical indication for surgical removal the
      investigators want to evaluate the quality of life and stigmatization before and after nevus
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All children with CMN that will have their nevus removed in our surgical department will be
      asked to participate. The investigators will send a package of questionnaires to evaluate
      quality of life and stigmatization before nevus surgery. One year after surgical therapy is
      finished (sometimes more then one session is necessary), the scar will be clinically
      evaluated and also another questionnaire package will be sent to evaluate the same parameters
      again. All parameters are checked for the patients and the families as well. Therefore self
      and proxy reports of the parents are asked. Moreover, for the patients this is done with
      interviews in case they are older than 7 years.
