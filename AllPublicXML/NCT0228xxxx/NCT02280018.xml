  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (the
      study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of JNJ-49122944 in
      healthy male participants after a single intravenous ([IV] within a vein) dose
      administration.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an
      inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical
      trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), and single-center study. The study
      will consist of Screening Period (2 to 21 days prior to participants' dose administration),
      Double-blind Treatment Period (single dose of JNJ-49122944 or placebo on Day 1), and Safety
      Follow-up Period (4 to 7 days after discharge). The total duration of participation for each
      participant, including screening, will be up to approximately 4 weeks. Blood samples will be
      collected for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
