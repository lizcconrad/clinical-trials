  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional study designed to provide preliminary data on the human
      use of the WAK. Up to 10 subjects currently receiving intermittent hemodialysis (HD)
      treatment three times per week for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) via an indwelling tunneled
      catheter will be studied.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo 24 hours in-hospital treatment with the Wearable Artificial Kidney
      (WAK). Up to 10 subjects with ESRD will complete the protocol in its entirety.

      The objective of this protocol is to provide additional preliminary data supporting the
      hypothesis that the WAK safely and effectively delivers dialysis therapy that is at least
      equal to the current standard of care for treatment of ESRD using conventional machines for
      thrice weekly hemodialysis treatments. These objectives would be accomplished by absence of
      adverse events during treatment with the WAK, along with effective removal of fluid and
      solutes at least equal to those delivered with conventional currently used dialysis machines.
      The WAK will be the only investigational device used in this study.

      The reason for this trial is to advance the eventual approval of this device to be legally
      commercialized as it potentially may respond to the unmet public health needs to improve
      outcomes and reduce costs in the treatment of ESRD patients.
