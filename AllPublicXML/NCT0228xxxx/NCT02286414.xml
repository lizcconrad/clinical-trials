      The aim of the study is to compare, in real life, the risk benefit (including both major
      bleeding and thrombotic events (TE) and death from any cause) associated with direct oral
      anticoagulants (DOA) and with anti vitamin K (VKA) in older adults (≥ 80 years) suffering
      from non valvular atrial fibrillation and living in community or nursing home settings.

      An observational multicenter prospective inception cohort will be conducted within the
      PRESAGE-Network, an ongoing active network on drug safety in older adults in France involving
      a sample of general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists, for an active surveillance of drug
      safety in older adults. GPs and pharmacists will prospectively include all octo+ patients
      they care for, newly treated with an oral anticoagulant (VKA or DOA) for nv AF and will
      follow them during 2 years at least.

      -  Context: Oral anticoagulation is recommended for prevention of stroke and
           thrombo-embolic events in people aged 80 years and over (octo+) suffering from non
           vavular atrial fibrillation (nv AF) and without contraindication to anticoagulant
           therapy. Two drug classes are available to achieve this oral anticoagulation: the
           vitaminK antagonists (VKA, warfarin, fluindione and acenocoumarol) or the direct oral
           anticoagulants (DOA, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban). The data of evidence-based
           and post-marketing literature on the benefit/risk ratio of DOA comparatively to VKA are
           limited, conflicting, potentially biased and finally inconclusive in this population.
           Nevertheless, octo+ are the age bracket the most at risk for nv AF and the population
           with the highest risk of both anticoagulant-related major bleedings and AF-related
           thrombotic (TE) events.

        -  Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess and compare the real benefits and harms of
           the two therapeutic strategies available in routine practice, for the anticoagulation in
           octo+ suffering from nvAF. The main objective is to estimate and compare a composite
           event including major bleeding, TE events and death from any cause of DOA and VKA in
           octo+ suffering from nv AF and living in community or nursing home settings. The
           secondary objectives are, in this population: to estimate and compare the composite
           event of each DOA (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) with the composite event of
           VKA, to estimate and compare the rate of occurrence of each component of the composite
           event in patients exposed to DOA as compared to patients exposed to VKA, to identify
           factors associated with the occurrence of major bleeding events and TE events in
           patients exposed to oral anticoagulants (OAC), to describe others adverse drug reactions
           (ADRs) (not serious bleeding and TE events; other serious or not serious ADRs) and to
           provide related rates in users of VKA and DOA as well as individual DOA, to describe the
           utilization patterns of oral anticoagulants.

        -  Design: An observational multicenter prospective inception cohort will be conducted
           within the PRESAGE-Network, an ongoing active network on drug safety in older adults in
           France involving a sample of general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists, for an active
           surveillance of drug safety in older adults.
