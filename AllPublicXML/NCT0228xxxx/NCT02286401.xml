      The purpose of this pilot study proposal is to test the ability of Transluminal Flow Encoding
      (TAFE) to evaluate vessel specific ischemia in patients with a clinical indication for
      invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements for
      suspected coronary disease.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the ability of Transluminal Flow Encoding (TAFE)
      to evaluate vessel specific ischemia in patients with a clinical indication for invasive
      coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements for suspected
      coronary disease. TAFE is a novel method that derives coronary blood flow from easily
      obtainable non-invasive coronary CT angiograms.

      Participants will undergo a rest coronary CTA, a regadenoson stress CT, and a clinically
      indicated invasive coronary angiogram. The study aims to determine the accuracy of TAFE
      compared to invasive fractional flow reserve.

      We hypothesize that TAFE-derived coronary blood flow, coronary flow reserve, and myocardial
      CT perfusion imaging can accurately diagnose an abnormal FFR (&lt;0.80) measured in vessels in
      patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography.

    <description>We will test the diagnostic accuracy of Coronary CTA, myocardial CT perfusion, and transluminal attenuation flow encoding (TAFE) to predict fractional flow reserve (FFR). Coronary CTA and myocardial CT perfusion results will be dichotomous, either normal or abnormal. Coronary CTA will be defined as abnormal when there is a &gt; or = 50% diameter stenosis in a coronary vessel. Myocardial CT perfusion will be defined as abnormal when there is a visually determined myocardial perfusion deficit. TAFE will be a continuous variable in units of ml/min.
The reference standard will be invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). FFR will be defined as abnormal when it is less than 0.80.</description>
