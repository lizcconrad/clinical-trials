  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to collect real life information and to document the
      performance and user friendliness of iFR in daily diagnostic practice and treatment
      strategies for MVD patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.

      The REAL Registry will enroll a maximum of 3,000 patients in approximately 300 sites across
      multiple European and Middle East countries, where product has received CE approval and is
      marketed. An average of 10 cases with a maximum of 50 patients will be enrolled per
      participating site.

      No follow-up will be performed. The REAL Registry will only collect data during diagnostic
      angiogram or PCI procedure, when performed.

    <description>Patients enrolled into this prospective registry will be derived from Stable Coronary Artery disease or Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) population undergoing cardiac catheterization. Patients with ACS may be evaluated by functional assessment in the non-culprit stenosis during the index PCI revascularization or in a staged procedure. The registry will enroll patients in whom physiological assessment (iFR/FFR) is particularly helpful in identifying haemodynamically significant stenosis: MVD patients defined by patients with lesions &gt; 40% and &lt;100% in 2 or more vessels.</description>

    <description>• The Volcano iFR®-FFR option, which is a measurement modality for the Volcano system that provides the capability to make FFR and instantaneous wave-Free Ratio™ (iFR®) measurements (CE-Marked). iFR® is a pressure-derived, hyperemia-free index for the assessment of coronary stenosis relevance. This option consists of an FFR-iFR® specific patient interface module (PIM-FFR) which can be connected to the Volcano system - VOLCANO s5 or s5i™ platform equipped with iFR® option. This PIM-FFR is compatible with all Volcano pressure measurement guide wires.</description>
