  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some people who need a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have leg arteries that
      are too small and are too sick for standard techniques. But they may benefit from a new
      technique called transcaval TAVR. For this technique, doctors make a hole between the largest
      vein (vena cava) and largest artery (aorta) in the body, inside the abdomen. Then they
      replace the valve through a tube they put in the groin vein. Then they close the hole between
      the vein and the artery using a device designed to close holes in the heart. This study tests
      the device for this new, off-label use.

      Objective:

      - To further study the safety and effectiveness of transcaval TAVR.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 21 and older who would benefit from TAVR but for whom standard techniques are
      not suitable.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be selected by a team of heart specialists and others.

        -  Participants will have a computed tomography (CT) scan with or without contrast dye.

        -  Participants will have blood tests.

        -  Participants will have transcaval TAVR.

        -  Participants will receive the same standard care as for all patients with TAVR.

        -  Participants will also have another CT scan, or an MRI or ultrasound, before they leave
           the hospital, and again after about 30 days and after about 12 months.

        -  Participants will be contacted 1 and 6 months afterwards and will have another visit 1
           year later. They will have a CT, MRI, or ultrasound. They will have blood tests and a
           physical exam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcaval access to the abdominal aorta from the neighboring inferior vena cava (IVC) has
      enabled transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a small number of patients who have
      no good options for standard percutaneous femoral access or for standard surgical access to
      the cardiac apex or to the ascending aorta. In this prospective registry we will collect data
      from multiple medical centers as they offer transcaval TAVR to patients with extreme or
      prohibitive risk of conventional TAVR.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Adults age greater than or equal to 21 years

          -  Severe symptomatic de novo aortic valve stenosis or bioprosthetic aortic valve failure
             for which transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is felt beneficial according
             to the consensus of the institutional multidisciplinary heart team

          -  Extreme risk or inoperability for TAVR via conventional femoral artery, trans-apical,
             or trans-aortic access in the determination of the multidisciplinary heart team. This
             determination includes an in-person consultation by at least one cardiac surgeon
             member of the heart team.

          -  Anatomic eligibility for caval-aortic TAVR, graded as favorable or feasible based on
             NHLBI core lab assessment of the baseline CT examination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Unable or unwilling to consent to participate

          -  Anatomic eligibility for caval-aortic TAVR graded as unfavorable based on NHLBI core
             lab assessment of the baseline CT examination

          -  Unlikely to benefit from caval-aortic TAVR

          -  Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant prior to completion of all protocol follow-up
             requirements.
