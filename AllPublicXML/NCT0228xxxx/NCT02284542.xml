  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a non-awake implantation
      method (EMG neuromonitoring) of a SCS paddle lead as compared to an awake implantation method
      (with local anesthesia and patient feedback).This is a post-market, prospective, multicenter,
      parallel designed, non-randomized, non-blinded, 6-month study. A minimum of 50 patients will
      be implanted from up to 4 active sites, coordinated by a single lead investigator.

      Patients who have had a successful SCS trial and are indicated for permanent implantation
      will be approached to participate in this study prior to permanent implantation. Patients
      will be recruited and enrolled by physicians at any one of the involved sites. Each
      Investigator will only use one method (awake or non-awake) according to his/her typical
      practice. Patients will receive treatment from their enrolling physician.

    <description>Upon approximate lead positioning, the patient is brought to a conscious sedated state while maintaining local anesthetic. Stimulation of the spinal cord through the paddle lead is accomplished with an external pulse generator, while communicating with the patient regarding paresthesia coverage of painful regions.</description>

    <description>The patient is maintained under general anesthesia for the full duration of the implant. Upon approximate lead positioning, bilateral EMG of myotomes overlapping dermatomal regions of pain are monitored. Stimulation is delivered through the lead by an external pulse generator in order to elicit compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) in the target regions. Lead placement is targeted to have symmetric CMAPs (i.e. physiologic midline) and adequate coverage of the painful regions as described by Falowski et al.
(Falowski et al., 2011).</description>
