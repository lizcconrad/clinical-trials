  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication safety is an important concern in hospital Emergency Departments (EDs), which
      provide approximately 136 million patient visits annually in the US. An accurate list of the
      patient's medications is often needed to inform medical decision-making. Moreover, health
      care facilities are required to provide patients with an accurate, reconciled list of their
      medications upon completion of the visit. However, for 37-87% of patients in the ED, errors
      are present in the documented medication list, and patients often leave without an updated
      list of their medications or a good understanding of their self-care instructions. This
      increases the risk of harmful adverse drug events. Health disparity populations, who are more
      likely to seek care in EDs and who more often have difficulty providing a complete medication
      history, are disproportionately affected.

      Health information technology has the potential to improve medication safety in this setting.
      PictureRx is an internet-based platform designed to improve medication management in
      vulnerable populations. It allows users to generate illustrated medication lists in an
      easily-understood, patient-centered format, in either English or Spanish. The investigators
      have developed a process for importing prescription fill data from the Surescripts Medication
      History service, which covers 96% of US pharmacies, into the PictureRx platform. The
      investigators are developing a mobile tablet PC-based medication history platform that
      receives and processes the Surescripts data, as well as prompts verification and additional
      information about the medication regimen.

      This trial will assess the effect of the PictureRx medication history platform on the
      accuracy and efficiency of the medication reconciliation process, as well as patient
      understanding and satisfaction, in hospital Emergency Departments.

    <description>Assessment of patient understanding of their medication regimen using 4 questions:
I understand what medicines I am supposed to take.
I understand how much medicine I am supposed to take at a time.
I understand what time of day to take each of my medicines.
I understand what each of my medicines is for. Participants had the following response options: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree Due to formatting restrictions on this site and the results being nearly identical for each question, only answers to question 1 are reported below.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 250 patients were enrolled into the intervention group. However, only 244 patients could be matched to suitable controls, and 6 were therefore excluded from the analysis of results. Thus the number of patients recruited was 494 (250 intervention + 244 control), but results are presented for 488 (244 intervention + 244 control).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>ESI acuity level</title>
          <description>The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a widely-used triage tool, which Emergency Department nurses use to rate patient acuity and resource needs (range 1-5). Briefly, level 1 patients require immediate life-saving intervention. Level 2 are high-risk, have altered mental status, are in severe pain/distress, or may have certain vital sign abnormalities. Level 3 require many resources. Level 4 require one resource. Level 5 require no additional resources. (See www.esitriage.org for more information.)</description>
