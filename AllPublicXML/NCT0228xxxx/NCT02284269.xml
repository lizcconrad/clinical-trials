    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to integrate the post-marketing surveillances data (Specified
      use-results surveys on long-term treatment) of the 6 SGLT2 inhibitors approved or applied in
      Japan and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of each under actual clinical
      practice conditions.

      In each post-marketing surveillance, 3000 patients who complete a 3 years treatment are
      enrolled. A total of 18000 patients are assessed in the meta-analysis.
