      The goal of this study is to understand how and why insulin resistant individuals respond
      differently to exercise as compared with insulin sensitive individuals at the skeletal muscle
      and gene expression level. The study has four aims including testing if MZF1, NFKB1, RELA,
      SP1/KLF and EGRI expression responses are outside of the normal range in insulin resistant
      individuals and how insulin resistance changes the cell biosynthesis process/ post
      translational modifications. It also aims to define the response of MiRNAs in healthy and
      insulin resistant individuals and determine if treatment with Gemfibrozil inhibits
      transcription processes.

    <measure>Transcription Factor Response to Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether expression of the transcription factor MZF1 is induced by exercise to a greater degree in control patients than in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MZF1 expression will be determined using quantitative rt-PCR analysis on RNA isolated from muscle biopsies taken from the patients. An repeated measures analysis of variance will be performed on the PCR data, for the three groups (lean, obese, type 2 diabetic), with the difference between the lean and diabetic groups being the primary measure. A P value of 0.05 will be considered significant.</description>

    <description>Diabetic patients will have a BMI between 30-50. We will recruit patients with mild or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are treated with diet, sulfonylureas, or other drugs working through enhanced insulin secretion. Patients taking metformin or TZDs will not be recruited due to the effects of those drugs on insulin action.

    <description>Patients will be nondiabetic, although we will include patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Patients will meet criteria for treatment with fibrates to lower plasma triglyceride concentrations (triglyceride&gt;300 mg/dl for nondiabetics, 250 mg/dl for patients with impaired glucose tolerance). We will aim at recruiting equal numbers of men and women. All participants will be between the ages of 30 and 59. Patients will have a BMI of 25-50 and not be taking any other medication that affects glucose metabolism. All participants will be sedentary (not reporting more than 10 minutes per day of light to vigorous leisure time physical activity.

    <intervention_name>Percutaneous needle muscle biopsies</intervention_name>
    <description>Skeletal muscle biopsies, blotted free from blood, are frozen within 30 seconds in liquid nitrogen, and stored in liquid nitrogen until processing. We routinely obtain 150-300 mg muscle (wet weight), which is more than sufficient for the analyses proposed, with some muscle remaining for any additional validation assays that may arise during the course of the research. Muscle will be processed either for isolation of mRNA/microRNA or protein, as described (2, 3, 12).</description>
