  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, Investigators will be comparing the effects of a medication
      Saxagliptin versus placebo (a similar looking pill that contains no medication) on
      inflammation in the body.

      Research Hypothesis DPP-4 inhibition by saxagliptin (ONGLYZA™) reduces adipose tissue
      inflammation in obese individuals and this is characterized by decreases in a) reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) production, b) toll-like receptors (TLR) and NF-kappa B pathway
      activation, c) expression of pro-inflammatory genes, d) macrophage infiltration, and e)
      secretion of pro-inflammatory factors.

      This is a randomized, prospective, double-blind study. Randomization to Saxagliptin and
      placebo will be in a 2:1 fashion. Treatment duration will be approximately 6 weeks.

    <description>Saxagliptin (trade-name ONGLYZA™) is used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with Type II diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally). Saxagliptin is in a class of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. It works by increasing the amount of insulin produced by the body after meals when blood sugar is high As the blood sugar returns towards normal, the medication effect on insulin is decreased.</description>
