  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel wireless capsule endoscopy is the investigation modality of choice for suspected
      diseases of the small bowel. The procedure is safe and noninvasive, the main risk being
      capsule retention occurring in approximately 2% of procedures. Other problems such as
      incomplete examinations occur in 10-20% of procedures. Reasons include delayed gastric
      emptying, slow small bowel transit, faulty equipment and poor bowel preparation.

      Some protocols identify the capsule position 30 minutes after ingestion using a 'realtime'
      viewer. If the capsule remains in the stomach, mobilisation is encouraged followed by an
      intramuscular prokinetic injection if this fails. This approach has disadvantages since an
      intramuscular injection is uncomfortable for patients. Additionally metoclopramide, commonly
      used for this purpose, has a risk of acute dystonic reactions particularly in young patients.

      Recently a handheld magnet (Intromedic Ltd.) has been developed to enable control of the
      capsule in the upper GI tract. We propose that this could be used, alongside positional
      changes, to expedite capsule transit through the stomach thus improving completion rates and
      avoiding the risks of unnecessary medication. We wish to undertake a randomised controlled
      study comparing a standard protocol for small bowel capsule endoscopy against a hand held
      magnet and positional change protocol to enhance gastric emptying of the wireless capsule.

    <description>Wireless capsule endoscopy is the investigation modality of choice for suspected diseases of the small bowel. A small pill-sized capsule contianing a camera is swallowed by the patient. The procedure is safe and non-invasive. Normally, the pill camera travels through the gut an exits the bowel via natural means. In a small number of cases the capsule is maintained. If the capsule is still in the stomach, mobilisation is encouraged followed by an intramuscular pro-kinetic injection if this fails.</description>

    <description>A handheld magnet (manufactured by Intromedic Ltd.) has been developed to allow some control of the pill camera (that contains a small amount of magnetic material) in the upper GI tract. We propose that this could be used, alongside positional changes, to expedite capsule transit through the stomach thus improving completion rates and avoiding the risks of unnecessary medication.</description>
