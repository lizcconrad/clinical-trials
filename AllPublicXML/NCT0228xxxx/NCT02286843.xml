  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some breast cancer cells make a protein called Human Epidermal Growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2). Patients with HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer receive medicine that attacks HER2,
      which helps these patients live longer. Some HER2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer patients
      also benefit from medicines that attack HER2, but we do not know why or which patients will
      benefit. This study uses a new imaging method, HER2-targeted PET/CT, to identify patients
      that may benefit from medicines that attack HER2. This is experimental.

    <description>Both SUVmax and SUVpeak will be recorded for lesions, and SUVmax and SUVaverage will be recorded for background measurements. Only those foci qualitatively scored conspicuously positive by both readers (scores of 4 or 5) will be considered as &quot;positive&quot;.</description>

    <description>Pts with confirmed HER2- breast cancer will then undergo HER2-targeted PET/CT. 89Zr-trastuzumab is a novel radiotracer which allows excellent visualization of HER2+ lesions. 89Zr-pertuzumab is a novel radiotracer which may allow for specific visualization of HER2+ lesions. PET/CT imaging with these novel radiotracers will allow evaluation of all identifiable malignant lesions, rather than evaluation of only single lesions by biopsy. Avid lesions will be considered suspicious for HER2+ malignancy. Pts with at least one 89Zr-trastuzumab or 89Zr-pertuzumab avid lesion will be biopsied to confirm HER2+ pathology. From these 50 pts, we will determine the proportion of HER2- primary breast cancer pts that express HER2+ malignancy imagable by HER2-targeted PET/CT. Pts recruited to the protocol, but then drop out prior to HER2-targeted PET/CT due HER2+ disease being identified on retesting of the patient's archived tissue samples, will be replaced with newly recruited pts.</description>
