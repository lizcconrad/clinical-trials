  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety of PEG-BCT- 100 given as
      an infusion to treat patients who bear advanced solid tumors that are dependent on arginine
      (melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma), and who have
      progressed after receiving approved or established therapies. This is a Phase 1 study;
      PEG-BCT-100 is an enzyme that degrades arginine and is an investigational drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multiple sites, open label and non-randomized study to evaluate the safety
      of PEG-BCT-100. Patient enrollment and sample size will follow a classical 3 + 3
      dose-escalation design. The study will enroll a maximum of 36 patients. Cohorts of 3 patients
      will receive an initial single dose of PEG-BCT-100 beginning at 0.5 mg/kg. Single dose safety
      parameters including hematology and chemistry laboratory profiles will be monitored for 3
      weeks. Patients not demonstrating a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) following the single dose
      may then receive two additional doses of PEG-BCT-100 at the same dose level on Day 22 and Day
      29. After these 2 additional doses, patients will undergo a full tumor and safety assessment
      after Day 29. Patients whose cancer is stable or responding may then receive weekly doses of
      PEG-BCT- 100 until disease progression. Dose escalations are planned for the next cohorts of
      3 patients, which will be enrolled after Day 22 of the previous cohort, assuming that no
      single dose DLTs were reported. Each cohort of 3 patients may begin weekly administration if
      there is no DLTs by Day 22, and if the previous and lower dose cohort has successfully passed
      Week 4 of the study (doses on Days 1, and 22 + one week).

      As of the beginning of 2018, an additional 22 patients will include only malignant melanoma
      patients. All newly enrolled patients will be enrolled at the dose level of Cohort Four (2.7
      mg/kg) of PEG-BCT-100.
