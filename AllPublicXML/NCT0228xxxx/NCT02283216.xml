  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate different stimulation parameters for a new
      noninvasive approach for modulating the brain that could potentially be beneficial for
      decreasing tinnitus perception. The new approach is called Multimodal Synchronization Therapy
      (mSync). mSync uses a combination of acoustic stimulation played through headphones and low
      levels of electrical current delivered via electrodes placed on the surface of different body
      regions. The timing interval between the acoustic and body stimulation is varied in order to
      cause different types of changes in the brain. In addition to acoustic and body stimulation,
      noninvasive cortical stimulation will also be presented as part of mSync to attempt to
      further modulate or decrease the tinnitus percept. Cortical stimulation will be performed by
      placing a magnetic coil over a spot on the head and sending a brief magnetic pulse that can
      travel through the skin and bone to create electrical current inside the head. For this
      study, different body locations as well as specific timing intervals among acoustic, body,
      and cortical stimulation will be investigated to identify appropriate parameters that can
      modulate and potentially decrease tinnitus perception. Different mSync parameters will be
      investigated across multiple testing sessions (up to 16 weekly sessions) and the tinnitus
      percept will be closely monitored throughout the study.

      This study is not specifically seeking to treat tinnitus but is designed to investigate
      various mSync parameters that can alter the tinnitus percept. Findings from this study will
      help identify specific mSync parameters that can be more effective at decreasing or fully
      suppressing the tinnitus percept that will be systematically explored in a follow-up study.
