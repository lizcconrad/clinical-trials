      There are three main forms of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes and genetic
      diabetes. The treatment for each is very different because they have different causes. People
      with Type 1 diabetes stop making their own insulin, so need insulin injections instead,
      whereas people with Type 2 diabetes can keep making their own insulin but it may not work as
      well as it should, so they need to watch what they eat, and may also need tablets or
      eventually insulin injections. Genetic forms of diabetes have specific treatments according
      to the subgroup.

      It is not easy for doctors to be able to say for definite what kind of diabetes a person has,
      particularly in young adults, where the distinction between the types is less clear. Because
      of this, sometimes (in about 10% of cases) people are given the wrong diagnosis. This can
      have a huge impact as it means they could be on the wrong treatment from the start, so they
      cannot control their blood sugars properly, which can lead to increased problems with their
      health and poor quality of life.

      We think we have a way of improving this situation. We have developed a tool called an
      &quot;Optimised Diagnostic Strategy&quot; (ODS). This combines a person's clinical features (such as
      their age and weight), with blood tests looking for changes in their body's immune (defence)
      system, and a blood test looking for specific changes in their genetic code, to help
      accurately diagnose what kind of diabetes that person has. We now need to test this ODS to
      see if it is better at getting the right diagnosis and treatment from the start compared with
      what we do in routine clinical practice at the moment. This kind of project is called a
      Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and would involve patients from General Practitioner (GP)
      surgeries all over the United Kingdom (UK). The project would be expensive as it involves a
      lot of work by many people to get it set up and to keep it running. Before we can do this we
      need to do a &quot;pilot&quot; to see if the bigger study would be possible and practical to do. This
      pilot project will be done locally in Exeter and test all the parts needed for the larger
      scale RCT.

      Diabetes is stratified into recognised subtypes with major implications for patients'
      treatment. The treatment of Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Maturity-onset
      diabetes of the young (MODY) is markedly different and based on clear differences in
      underlying pathophysiology. The difficult part of this stratification is correctly diagnosing
      the subtype especially in young adults. The clear differentiation of T1D as slim and young,
      and T2D as obese and old, no longer holds with the rapid increase in obesity in the
      population: T1D patients may be obese and T2D patients may be diagnosed young. 90% of MODY
      patients are misdiagnosed with T1D or T2D as the diagnosis of MODY is rarely considered. This
      results in 7-15% of young adults with diabetes being wrongly classified and incorrectly
      treated. Initial clinical diagnosis is not systematic and once made is rarely changed.
      Misdiagnosis of T2D or MODY as T1D results in unnecessary initial insulin treatment leading
      to higher drug/monitoring costs, more side effects (weight gain, hypos), and patient
      inconvenience/dissatisfaction. Misdiagnosis of T1D as T2D, or MODY (initial treatment
      diet/tablets), results in poor glycaemic control, frequent contact for increased treatment,
      inappropriate insulin regimes and the risk of life threatening ketoacidosis.

      We have developed an optimized diagnostic strategy (ODS) based on integrating Clinical
      information (a validated clinical probability model), Biomarkers (GAD, Islet antigen-2 (IA2)
      and ZnT8 autoantibodies) and Genetic testing for MODY. This has the potential to determine
      the subtype of diabetes in young adults leading to improved treatment and care. Prior to
      undertaking a comprehensive RCT to test our ODS against standard care, we must first
      undertake this pilot study to assess the feasibility of such a project.

      Objectives: To assess the feasibility of recruitment and retention for a proposed large scale
      RCT, optimize recruitment and retention strategies, develop and assess the protocols and
      procedures, test delivery of the ODS, assess the impact of the ODS and obtain pilot data to
      inform sample size calculations for the proposed RCT Potential participants will be
      identified from routine clinical care, with clinicians informing patients of the project in
      general terms and seeking permission for their contact details to be passed to the research
      team. A range of referral strategies will be assessed and all potential participants who
      appear to meet the entry criteria will be invited to participate.

      Referral strategies to be assessed will include: referral to research team by GP/ Practice
      Nurse/diabetes specialist nurse, regular GP practice database searches, via pathology lab
      following raised Hba1c Initial visit (I hour): Participants will meet with a member of the
      research team who will obtain consent and collect baseline blood samples, demographic and QoL
      data. Participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control arm using a
      computer generated randomisation schedule. For participants in the intervention arm the blood
      samples will be analysed at the Royal Devon &amp;Exeter National Health Service Foundation Trust
      (RD&amp;E NHS FT) Biochemistry Department for HbA1c, C-peptide and islet autoantibodies (GAD, IA2
      and ZnT8) with DNA extracted and stored for genetic testing if appropriate. These blood
      results will then be immediately incorporated into the ODS for feedback to Clinicians and
      participants with recommendations that appropriate national guidelines for the ODS diagnosis
      (e.g. NICE guidelines for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes) are followed. For participants in the
      control arm their current clinical features will be recorded and their blood samples will be
      stored for future analysis. At the end of their involvement in the study, both recorded
      clinical features and results from stored blood samples will then be and incorporated into
      the ODS for feedback to both clinicians and participant.

      Follow up (6 monthly intervals over 3 years): Participants will then be followed up at 6
      monthly intervals over a 3 year period (choice given of text, phone, or email) to maintain
      participant engagement and enable collection of details of current treatment, treatment
      changes and frequency of hypoglycaemia. Results from routinely collected HbA1cs will be
      obtained from clinical practice.

      At 3 years, participants will be seen again by the research team for collection of a further
      blood sample, details of final treatment and quality of life measures. This will end their
      participation. At the end of the study individual results from the ODS for those in the
      control (standard care) arm will be generated and fed back to clinicians and participants.

      All participants will be assigned a unique study ID. All data collected will be recorded and
      stored under this ID number. Data will be initially recorded onto a study specific data
      collection form (DCF). Data will then be recorded onto a study specific database.
      Hard/scanned copies will be stored in the study specific site file. Data will be screening
      for discrepancies and missing data prior to analysis.

      Baseline data will include: personal identifiers, anthropometry, diabetes and medication
      history and blood biochemistry. Permission will be obtained to access medical notes should
      this be required for diabetes data relevant to taking part in the project.

      All participant data will be held in a link-anonymised format, Participants' research and
      sample data will be identified by unique study ID numbers and all data will be held on
      password-protected computers. Only the CI or designated research team member will have access
      to personal identifiable data.

      Data Storage and Archiving: All consent and paper data collection forms will be scanned onto
      discs and stored in locked filing cabinets within the controlled access ECRF for the duration
      of the project. Paper copies will be shredded. Should a full RCT be developed from this
      project participant data and samples will be transferred and used for analysis in the larger
      study. If at the end of this study the RCT has not yet been commenced, remaining samples and
      data will be transferred for safe keeping to the Peninsula Research Bank (PRB).

      Sample analysis: Blood samples will be analysed for HbA1c, C-peptide and islet autoantibodies
      (GAD, IA2 and ZnT8) on site at the RD&amp;E NHS FT blood sciences department. DNA will be
      extracted and stored for genetic testing if appropriate.

      Primary Outcome measures:Time to optimum treatment following diagnosis. Optimum treatment
      will be determined at 3 year follow up on the basis of whether insulin is required or not
      (using C peptide testing if on insulin and HbA1c testing if not on insulin). If insulin is
      not required then the optimum treatment will be determined using the treatment guidelines for
      T2D or the subtype of MODY diagnosed. Treatment will be recorded 6-monthly up to 3 years.

      Secondary outcome measures: Mean glycaemic control over the first 3y after diagnosis, patient
      satisfaction, number of hypos, weight change.

      Statistics and Power Calculations The aim of this study is to determine feasibility for a
      future RCT, not to determine clinical differences. We have therefore taken a pragmatic
      approach based on the number of potential recruits available over a one year period. We
      estimate 220 people are diagnosed per year in Exeter and surrounding area. We will invite all
      patients who fulfil the entry criteria to participate. This will enable us to determine a
      realistic recruitment rate and obtain estimates of rates of misclassification to inform the
      full RCT. Therefore, analysis will be restricted to descriptive statistics only

      Ethical considerations: We have discussed the potential ethical considerations with members
      of our PRB steering committee and addressed them as follows:

      Blood sampling: a routine part diabetes care, may result in slight pain and bruising, risks
      minimized by sampling undertaken by staff experienced in venepuncture procedures. Patient
      burden: participation involves 2 blood samples (3 years apart) and 5 follow up contacts over
      the 3 year period (via participant choice of phone/e-mail/text). This was not considered
      unduly burdensome. Immediate/delayed ODS feedback: following considerable discussion around
      the acceptability of immediate or delayed feedback of results from the ODS, our lay members
      felt that considering all participants would receive treatment based on current clinical and
      NICE guidelines the delay in feedback of ODS results would be acceptable.

      Subject Withdrawal: Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study
      at any time up until the samples and data are coded but not anonymised. When samples are
      fully anonymised, the participants will still be able to withdraw but their samples and
      associated data will be retained for use in analysis.

      Study Management:The study will be managed by the National Institute of Health s Research
      (NIHR) Exeter Clinical Research Facility providing infrastructure support and facilitate
      recruitment and sample collection.

      Timescale: 4 years. This is a relatively long time for a pilot study and is necessary to
      enable data collection from each participant, over a 3 year period, to provide a clinically
      relevant definition of optimal treatment.

      All costs will be met by existing research funding:

      Sample analysis costs (HbA1c/Serum c-peptide, islet autoantibodies (GAD, IA2 and ZnT8) and
      Genotyping where appropriate) will be covered by the CI's existing Welcome Trust senior
      Investigator award. Service support costs will be provided by the NIHR Exeter Clinical
      Research Facility.

      Project development and user involvement: The study team will have access to the user
      representative group of the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility (ECRF). In keeping with
      the NHS Patient Carer and Public Involvement (PCPI) strategy the ECRF invites user
      representatives to contribute to the development of various projects within its portfolio.
      These individuals have agreed to maintain contact and regular meetings have been established
      at which researchers discuss the development of current projects within the ECRF.

      Reporting adverse effects: This is a low risk study and it is not anticipated that
      participants involved in this project will be subject to adverse effects, other than slight
      bruising from blood sample collection. The CI will be informed of any adverse effects within
      24 hours and they will be reported following local NHS R&amp;D SOPs with a copy of any adverse
      event form stored in the project site file.

      Participant Feedback: Depending on the randomization arm feedback from the ODS will be fed
      back to participants and their GP immediately or at the end of the study. Should any
      biochemistry immunological or genetic result potentially impact on clinical care, the results
      will be initially discussed with the ECRF Clinical Director and a decision may be made to
      contact that individual participants GP or healthcare team. A statement to this effect is
      included in the consent form.

      Dissemination/implementation of research: Results will be written up and submitted for
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Abstracts will be submitted to national and
      international conferences.

      Potential impact and benefit of the research: short term-we hope to obtain the necessary
      information to conduct a definitive RCT. Longer term-evidence that the ODS can improve
      diagnosis and treatment for patients diagnosed with diabetes will lead to improved treatment
      and quality of life for patients and a reduction in the NHS costs associated with
      inappropriate treatment and monitoring and complication rates.

      End of Study: the study will finish when all initial and follow up data has been collected
      and analysed on all participants.
