  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares aripiprazole once-monthly injection to standard of care oral
      antipsychotic medication in non-adherent outpatients with schizophrenia to see which
      treatment helps people take their medicine more regularly and have more positive outcomes.

      It is hypothesized that non-adherent schizophrenia outpatients receiving aripiprazole
      once-monthly will be more likely to respond and have lower symptom severity over 3 months of
      treatment than those receiving standard of care oral antipsychotics.

             agree to remain abstinent or to practice double barrier forms of birth control from
             study screening through 30 days (for females) and 90 days (for males) from the last
             dose of study drug for SOC oral antipsychotics and 150 days for females and 180 days

          -  Has any medical condition that might preclude safe completion of the study (e.g.,
             agranulocytosis, severe and unstable heart disease, AIDS, end-stage renal disease).
