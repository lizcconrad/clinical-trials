  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if a 12-week, individually-tailored walking program, using
      pedometers will be a more clinically and cost-effective option for the management of chronic
      low back pain than standardized advice and education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific objectives of the study are:

        1. To determine perceived levels of disability and baseline levels of walking activity in a
           sample of those with chronic low back pain (CLBP)

        2. To determine the uptake and adherence to a pedometer-driven walking program for people
           with CLBP

        3. To test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a walking programme to improve outcomes
           for CLBP compared to a standardized back care education package

        4. To test the feasibility of a walking programme in a sub-sample of rural Saskatchewan
           farmers/agricultural workers.
