  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telephone medical advice in general practice is expanding. The Cochrane Database concludes in
      2008 that there is not enough data about its use regarding out-of-hours general practitioners
      workload, emergency department visits, cost, safety and patient satisfaction. The aim of this
      study is to assess the effectiveness of telephone medical advice given by a general
      practitioner in a call centre for patient presenting isolated fever or gastroenteritis
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, cluster randomized trial of 2 880 expected patients who
      calling a French emergency medical service Dial 15 for fever or gastroenteritis symptoms
      during out-of-hours periods. All calls will be taken by a general practitioner (GP).
      Out-of-hours period is defined as 8 PM to 8 AM on weekdays, 1 PM to 8PM on Saturdays in
      addition to Sundays and holidays.To be exhaustive, we will enrol patients during one year.

      In the experimental arm, the GP will implement a protocol of care to each patient call. The
      protocol includes medical advice, drug prescription by phone and supervisory board. Patients
      are invited to recall in case of worsening or onset of new symptoms and to get an appointment
      with their GP during working hours.

      In the non-interventional arm, the GP will decide the need of telephone advice with or
      without drug prescription, home visit by a doctor, emergency department services with or
      without EMS system.

      We will recall every patient at 15+/-4 days.
