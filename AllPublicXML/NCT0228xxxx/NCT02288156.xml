    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinitis is affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Its prevalence is
      estimated to be as high as 30% of the Western population. Rhinitis is defined as symptomatic
      inflammation of the inner lining of the nose and is characterized by the following symptoms:
      rhinorrhea, nasal blockage, nasal itching and/or sneezing. The cut-off point for defining
      rhinitis as chronic rhinitis is considered to be persisting symptoms for over more than
      twelve weeks Chronic rhinitis can be divided into three major subgroups; based on the
      knowledge of the major etiological factor: infectious rhinitis, allergic rhinitis and
      non-allergic, non-infectious rhinitis, in literature also referred to as nonallergic
      rhinitis. Non-inferiority in efficacy of the two novel treatment regimes i.e. capsaicin nasal
      spray 0,01mM (2puffs/nostril/day) during 4 weeks and capsaicin nasal spray 0,001mM
      (2puffs/nostril/day) during 4 weeks compared to the current treatment of capsaicin nasal
      spray 0,1mM (5/day administered on a single day) with regard to the change from baseline in
      VAS for major nasal symptom on week 4.

      (Estimated placebo effect is 25%.)
