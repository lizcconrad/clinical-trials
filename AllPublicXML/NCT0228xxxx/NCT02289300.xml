  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an investigational drug DCB-BO1202 is
      effective and safe in the treatment of liver fibrosis in HBV patients having experienced
      intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include the first 188 subjects who are randomized. The purpose of study is to
      collect efficacy results to evaluate treatment effect on the primary endpoint. The second
      endpoints is to evaluate drug safety on the incidence of the primary endpoint through the
      treatment period.
