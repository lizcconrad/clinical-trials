  <brief_title>Closed-loop Control of Overnight Glucose Levels (Artificial Pancreas) in Type 1 Diabètes Adults With Hypoglycemia Unawareness and Documented Nocturnal Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Randomized, Cross-over Study to Assess the Efficacy of Single-hormone and Dual-hormone Closed-loop Strategy in Regulating Overnight Glucose Levels in Type 1 diabètes Adults With Hypoglycemia Unawareness and Documented Nocturnal Hypoglycemia</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone and
      dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to regulate overnight glucose levels in a in-patient study
      in type 1 diabetes adults with hypoglycemia unawareness and documented nocturnal
      hypoglycemia.

      The investigators hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy is more effective in
      regulating overnight glucose levels compared to single-hormone closed-loop strategy.

      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The investigators aim to conduct the 1st randomized cross-over trial comparing single-
      hormone and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to regulate overnight glucose levels. The
      investigators aim to compare the two interventions for 10 hours in two subgroups of adults
      with type 1 diabètes. Patients from both subgroups will present documented nocturnal
      hypoglycemia. One subgroup will consist of patients with hypoglycemia unawareness while the
      other subgroup will consist of patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. This study will allow
      to determine if there is a greater benefit of a closed-loop strategy in a higher-risk
      hypoglycemia unaware group.

    <description>Subjects will be admitted at the research facility at 19:00. A cannula will be inserted into an arm or a hand vein for blood sampling purposes. On dual-hormone closed-loop visits, glucagon will be reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions and a MiniMed® Paradigm® Veo™ pump containing the glucagon solution will be installed. At 20:30, a snack containing 20g of carbohydrate will be given. Closed-loop strategy will start at 20:00 until 7:00 next morning. A glucose sensor reading will be entered manually in a tablet every 10 minutes. The tablet will generate a recommendation for the basal rates of insulin delivery and glucagon mini-boluses (glucagon recommendations will only be generated during the dual hormone closed-loop visits). Pumps' parameters will then be changed manually to implement the tablet generated recommendations.</description>
