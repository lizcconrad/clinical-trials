  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of
      emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents
      virologically suppressed (defined as having &lt; 50 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA for a period of at
      least 6 months) while on a stable 2-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      (NRTI) containing regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will be on a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or any other 3rd ARV agent
      and will switch their current 2-NRTI-containing regimen to open-label F/TAF while continuing
      their boosted PI or 3rd agent through 48 weeks. A minimum of 10 participants each in Groups 1
      and 2 of Cohort 2, and Cohorts 3 and 4, who are on boosted-ATV as their 3rd ARV agent will be
      enrolled. Participants in Cohort 2, Group 1 receive boosted PI agents only. Cohorts 2, 3, and
      4 will be enrolled by cohort into a two-part study (Parts A and B).

      After completion of 48 weeks, all participants will be given the option to participate in an
      extension phase of the study. Gilead will provide F/TAF until a) The participant turns 18
      years old and F/TAF is commercially available for use in adults in the country in which the
      participant is enrolled or b), F/TAF becomes commercially available for pediatric use in the
      country in which the participant is enrolled or c), Gilead Sciences elects to terminate
      development of F/TAF in the applicable country.
