  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of microsurgical approaches in periodontal therapy have been described. The main
      focus of this study is to determine if using microsurgical LMCAF technique would improve the
      outcomes of the therapy for the Miller Class III isolated recession-type defects.

      Six months results of this study showed that LMCAF with microsurgical approach offered better
      complete and mean root coverage results over macrosurgical LMCAF technique. The superior
      effect of microsurgical approach on post-operative morbidity can make this technique more
      preferable for the patients who expected comfortable postoperative period.

      This study supports that using the microsurgical aproach with LMCAF procedure significantly
      affects the clinical and patient-centered success of treating Miller Class III isolated typed
      defects.

    <intervention_name>laterally moved coronally advanced flap with microsurgical instruments and x2.5 loupe</intervention_name>
    <description>The recipient area for the laterally moved flap was prepared. When the flap was moved in the distal-mesial direction another short horizontal incision was performed at the most apical extension of this vertical incision. Once the mucogingival line was reached, flap elevation was continued split-thickness. Flap elevation was terminated when it was possible to passively move the flap laterally above the exposed root. Flap was sutured.</description>
