      The current study is designed as a multicenter, randomized and prospective study aiming to
      compare the effect of two-stenting and simple stenting techniques in patients with complex
      bifurcation lesions. Based on the previous studies, the rate of 1-year target lesion failure
      events was around 25% after PCI with provisional stenting. And our previous data showed that
      this event at 12-month after DK crush procedure was 15%. Considering the lost to follow-up,
      it is anticipated that up to 660 patients will be enrolled in the trial. All patients will
      have repeat angiography at 13 months, with clinical follow-up to 5 years.
