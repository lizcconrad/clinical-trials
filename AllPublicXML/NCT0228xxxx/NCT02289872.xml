  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare time and success rates of TruView PCD video laryngoscope
      and Macintosh laryngoscope for the pediatric emergency intubation with three airway scenarios
      in a standardized manikin model.

    <description>the time to intubation, defined as the time from insertion of the laryngoscope blade between the teeth to the first manual ventilation of the mannequin's lungs</description>

    <measure>Success of intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>success of the intubation attempt (i.e. tracheal or oesophageal placement of the tube) with was recorded when the success of the ventilation attempt was seen by the manikin's ventilation indicators.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dental compression</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>dental compression, with was assessed using a visual scale grading the pressure applied on the upper teeth (n=none, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3).</description>

    <measure>Ease of intubation (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To access subjective opinion about the difficulty of the each intubation method, participants were asked to rate it on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a score from 1 (extremely easy) to 10 (extremely difficult).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The chest compression scenario, where continuous chest compression was applied using chest compression system LUCAS-2 (Physio-Control, Redmond, WA, USA). Chest compression was provided at a rate of 100 min-1 to a depth of 5-6 cm during all intubation procedures.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The chest compression with cervical stabilization scenario, where both chest compression using Lucas-2 and cervical stabilization were applied. A correctly fitting standard cervical immobilization collar (StifNeck Select, Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) was applied to the manikin's neck to prevent movement of the cervical spine.</description>
