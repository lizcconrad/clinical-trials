      A multi-centre randomised controled single blind clinical phase IV trial with the aim to
      determine the most effective treatment in terms of lesion reduction, costs and patient
      satisfaction in treatment of actinic keratosis (AK), when comparing topical treatment with
      photodynamic therapy (PDT), 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream, 5% Imiquimod (IMI) cream and
      ingenol mebutate (IM) gel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Caucasians and therefore a major public health
      issue. Its incidence is increasing rapidly. Actinic keratosis (AK) is the most prevalent
      precancerous chronic skin condition. It can transform into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
      AK's generally arise in a skin area that has diffuse precancerous damage, a phenomenon called
      field cancerization. Because of its precancerous character, it is advised to treat AK and
      herewith prevent development into SCC. The most frequently used field-directed treatments in
      the Netherlands are photodynamic therapy (PDT), topical 5% f-fluorouracil (5% 5-FU) and
      topical 5% Imiquimod (5% IMI). Lately another topical product is approved by Dutch healthcare
      insurances: Ingenol mebutate (IM). Up to date, which treatment the patient will receive, does
      not rely on evidence-based-medicine, but generally on the preference of the physician.
      Current national and international guidelines state no clear recommendations for the best
      choice of therapy. The aim of this study determine which treatment is the most effective
      treatment in terms of lesion reduction, costs and patient satisfaction when comparing topical
      treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT), 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream, 5% Imiquimod (IMI)
      cream and ingenol mebutate (IM) gel, in treatment of actinic keratosis (AK).
