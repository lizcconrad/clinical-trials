      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of 18-FDG positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging in the management of patients with suspected or proven
      IE in detecting cardiac valve damages and other extracardiac complications. The study will
      evaluate whether this procedure can change the clinical decisions (treatments, valve surgery,
      patients' overall care) and modify the diagnosis of IE.

      Introduction:

      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare disease, often difficult to diagnose with a high
      mortality rate. Extra-cardiac manifestations, which can occur in 30 to 80% of cases, impact
      the outcome of the disease. Identifying these manifestations may help confirm an uncertain
      diagnosis and optimize patients' management.

      18-FDG PET/CT imaging, widely used for cancer staging, may also detect hyper-metabolic areas
      related to extracardiac infectious complications of IE. It provides the opportunity to detect
      all extracardiac IE infectious complications through a single examination. The impact of
      18-FDG PET/CT imaging on the management of IE has yet to be completely evaluated.

      Hypothesis:

      18-FDG PET/CT implementation could result in both shortening of the initial diagnostic
      work-up of IE and therapeutic optimization.

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the impact of 18-FDG PET/CT on patients' management, as measured by changes in IE
      therapeutic plans.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the impact of 18-FDG PET/CT on the Duke-Li criteria for IE diagnosis

        -  To evaluate the performance of 18-FDG PET/CT in detecting valve damages and extracardiac
           complications induced by the IE

        -  To evaluate whether 18-FDG PET/CT may help identify the infection's portal of entry

        -  To evaluate whether the detection of extracardiac complications by FDG PET/CT is
           associated with the 6-months survival rate

        -  To identify clinical and biological determinants of extracardiac IE localizations and
           prognosis

        -  To determine the inter-reader interpretation of the18-FDG PET/CT results and the
           reproducibility in preparation and acquisition method
