      To document indications for cholangioscopy and clinical utility of the SpyGlass Direct
      Visualization System in China when used per standard of practice.

      Patients who presenting with an indication for cholangioscopy or presenting with a possible
      indication for cholangioscopy to be determined during the ERCP procedure immediately
      preceding the SpyGlass procedure will join this study, totally 500 patients across 16 sites
      throughout China will participate in study. After SpyGlass operation, all patients will be
      followed for 72 hours to observe adverse events, and patients with indeterminate stricture or
      undefined filling defect indication with tissue sampling not yielding histopathology positive
      for malignancy and unresolved device and/or procedure related SAE at 72 Hours will continue
      to be followed up until 6 months. Finally, procedure success rate will be analyzed as primary
      endpoint, and SAEs and impact of patients management will be analyzed as secondary endpoint.

    <description>For indeterminate strictures or undefined filling defects cases procedural success is defined as 1) ability to visualize stricture or defect, and 2) ability to provide visual impression of malignancy, and 3) when applicable, ability to obtain SpyBite biopsy adequate for histology
For biliary stone cases procedural success is defined as 1) ability to visualize the stone(s), and 2) ability to successfully initiate stone fragmentation, and 3) ability to achieve stone clearance in one or more SpyGlass procedures.
For other indications procedural success is defined as ability to establish diagnosis and /or complete therapy in the following categories: 1) pre-operative assessment of extent of peri-ampullary and biliary tumors, 2) selective guidewire placement, 3) assessment of unexplained hemobilia, 4) assessment of portal biliopathy, 5) assessment of intraductal biliary ablation therapy, 6) extraction of migrated stents, or 7) other.</description>
