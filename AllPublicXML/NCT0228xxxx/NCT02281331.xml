  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As we age we tend to lose muscle mass and strength. These losses contribute to the increased
      incidence of falls and fractures, metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, loss of
      independence and reduced quality of life in the elderly. As the number of seniors increases
      worldwide, it is becoming more and more important to develop strategies to counteract this
      loss of muscle mass and strength, and promote healthy aging. Fortunately, relatively simple
      lifestyle modifications are the most potent defense strategies. Exercises such as weight
      lifting and high-intensity interval exercise (HIIT), which consists of short, repeated bouts
      of vigorous aerobic exercise interspersed with period of rest, are the most effective in
      promoting gains in muscle mass and strength. Additionally, components of foods like whey (a
      protein found in milk), creatine (found in meat), calcium and vitamin D have been shown to
      independently increase strength. In this study, we are looking to determine how much we can
      increase muscle strength in older men who are put on an 12 week exercise training program
      that combines weight lifting and HIIT, and who consume a daily supplement that contains whey
      protein, creatine, calcium and vitamin D.
