  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two portions: The first portion- Phase 1, or dose-escalation portion,
      that will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax in combination with
      low-dose cytarabine (LDC), define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and generate data to
      support a recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) in treatment-naïve subjects with Acute Myelogenous
      Leukemia (AML). Second portion, initial Phase 2 that will evaluate if the RPTD has sufficient
      efficacy and acceptable toxicity to warrant further development of the combination therapy.
      Subsequently, Phase 2 Cohort C, will evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) for subjects
      allowed additional supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if medically indicated.
