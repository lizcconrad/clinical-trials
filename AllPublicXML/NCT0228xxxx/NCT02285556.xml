      The study will increase the sample size based on the preliminary work,also, establish drug
      dependence induced craving associated environmental experiments , by using the multi-lead
      biofeedback instrument , CogState tester, event-related potentials Recorder and 3.0T
      high-field magnetic resonance imaging system to record the physiology , electrophysiology and
      brain changes during craving, taking a subjective self-assessment , clinical observations and
      physiological responses combined system to evaluate the ATS addiction degree.
