      This study will determine whether a genetic test of Pap samples detects ovarian and
      endometrial cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of deaths from ovarian cancer are from the high-grade serous cancer (HGSC)
      subtypes. The currently available tests for ovarian cancer diagnosis such as, blood tumour
      marker CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound scan of the ovaries, have poor sensitivity and
      specificity therefore are not suitable for diagnosing early disease. Indeed, results from
      screening trials suggest that testing women in the general population for ovarian cancer may
      do more harm than good, due to the high proportion of false positive results.

      Accumulating evidence suggests that a high proportion of HGSC of the &quot;ovary&quot; actually starts
      in the fallopian tube. The cancerous cells from the tube can escape into the uterus and
      eventually into the cervix. Furthermore, the cancer present as a microscopic lesion in the
      tube is capable of spreading to the ovary and abdomen.

      As for endometrial cancer, the disease is increasing in incidence. Approximately, 10% of
      women with endometrial cancers with high-grade subtypes account for almost half the deaths of
      patients with an endometrial cancer diagnosis as a result of early spread.

      Combined, cancers from the uterus, tubes and ovaries account for the 3rd most common cause of
      death from cancer in high resource countries.

      Thus, a screening tool for cancers of the uterus, tubes and ovaries would greatly benefit
      women. Seminal work has shown it is possible to identify a few cancer cells among the
      thousands of normal cells, in cytology samples. More specifically, those collected from the
      uterus, cervix and vagina by a variety of sampling techniques using innovative methods of DNA
      tagging.

      We have developed our own technology for DNA barcoding. Additionally, we have also evaluated
      different methods of sample collection to determine which is the most acceptable to women and
      their doctors, while still yielding the highest number of abnormal cells.

      Our preliminary results indicate a brush sample taken from inside the uterus yields the best
      proportion of cancer cells with respect to both ovarian/tubal cancers, as well as, uterine
      cancer.

      The objective of this project is to develop, by building on this discovery, a test that can
      be used as a screening tool to detect cancer of the endometrium, ovary and tubes, in its very
      early stages.

      We are enrolling women with known or suspected cancer of the ovary or endometrium, as well as
      women scheduled to undergo hysterectomy and salpingectomy +/- oophorectomy for a variety of
      benign reasons to serve as controls.

      We will develop, refine the technology and validate a screening test, DOvEEgene, that is
      specific and safe to screen women in order to diagnose cancer of the uterus, tubes and
      ovaries early enough to save lives.
