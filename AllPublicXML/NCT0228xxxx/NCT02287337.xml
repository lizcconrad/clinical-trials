  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a recently developed clinical prediction rule (CPR)
      will successfully identify which patients with neck pain will respond rapidly and favorably
      to manipulation of their cervical spine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consenting patients with a primary complaint of neck pain will be screened for
      contraindications to cervical spine manipulation and if eligible to participate in the study,
      will undergo a detailed subjective (history) and objective (physical) examination. At the
      completion of the examination, they will be assigned to one of two treatment arms - cervical
      manipulation and exercise or exercise only. They will receive up to 5 treatment sessions and
      be followed at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after initial visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary complaint of mechanical neck pain with or without unilateral upper extremity
             symptoms (mechanical neck pain is defined as neck pain/ symptoms that are altered/
             affected by activity, movement and posture)

          -  NDI score at least 10 points out of 50.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Red flags noted in the patient's Neck Medical Screening Questionnaire (i.e. tumor,
             fracture, metabolic diseases, Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteoporosis, prolonged history of
             steroid use, etc.)

          -  History of whiplash injury within the past six weeks

          -  Diagnosis of cervical spinal stenosis or bilateral upper extremity symptoms

          -  Evidence of central nervous system involvement, to include hyperreflexia, sensory
             disturbances in the hand, intrinsic muscle wasting of the hands, unsteadiness during
             walking, nystagmus, loss of visual acuity, impaired sensation of the face, altered
             taste, the presence of pathological reflexes (i.e. positive Hoffman's and/or Babinski
             reflexes), etc.

          -  Two or more positive neurologic signs consistent with nerve root compression,
             including any two of the following: a. Muscle weakness involving a major muscle group
             of the upper extremity b. Diminished upper extremity muscle stretch reflex (biceps
             brachii, Brachioradialis, or triceps reflex) c. Diminished or absent sensation to
             pinprick in any upper extremity dermatome

          -  Prior surgery to the neck or thoracic spine

          -  Pending legal action regarding their neck pain

          -  Insufficient English language skills to complete all questionnaires

          -  Inability to comply with treatment and follow-up schedule
