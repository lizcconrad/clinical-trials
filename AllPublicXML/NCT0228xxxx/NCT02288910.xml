  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project investigates the feasibility of assessing the relative blood volume of
      carcinomas in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastases from
      pancreatic or colorectal cancer compared to normal liver from DynaCT acquisitions on an
      interventional platform.

      This project will enroll patients with non-diffuse liver disease who are candidates for chemo
      or radioembolization to treat or manage the disease during an image guided intervention.
      Subjects will undergo a CT perfusion study of the liver prior to the radioembolizaiton
      mapping procedure or prior to the chemoembolization treatment. During the radioembolization
      mapping or chemoembolization procedure, 2 DynaCT acquisitions on the interventional C-arm
      will be acquired (the second during an injection of an iodinated contrast material) and will
      be processed using Siemens' PBV software to generate blood volume maps. The diagnostic
      accuracy of the two approaches to assess the vascularity of the tumors will be assessed.

    <description>A Spearman's correlation coefficient will be used to test the rank-based correlation of the BV values in tumor from the DynaCT BV acquisition to the body CT perfusion values. Furthermore, a paired t-test will be used to test for differences in BV using the two approaches.</description>
