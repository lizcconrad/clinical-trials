      This phase II trial is studying how well pemetrexed disodium works in treating patients with
      Lung Adenocarcinoma With Brain Metastases
    </textblock>

      -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with Lung
           Adenocarcinoma With Brain Metastases treated with pemetrexed disodium.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma With Brain
           Metastases treated with pemetrexed disodium.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the radiographic response in patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma With Brain
           Metastases treated with pemetrexed disodium.

        -  Determine the time to response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Collect safety data on patients with intracranial tumors treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A
      total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.

             electrocardiogram (ECG) indicative of cardiac disease) that, in the opinion of the

             complete study.

          -  Inability to discontinue administration of aspirin at a dose &gt;1.3g/day or other
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days after
             the dose of pemetrexed (5 days prior for long-acting agents such as piroxicam).

          -  Presence of fluid accumulations in third spaces, e.g., ascite or pleural effusion,
             which can be detected clinically (during physical examination), and which cannot be
             adequately controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to inclusion in the study.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt; CTC Grade 2

          -  Patient compliance or geographic distance precluding adequate follow up.
