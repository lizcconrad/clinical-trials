    <textblock>
      Skin abscesses are among the most common soft tissue infections cause emergency room visits
      frequently. Management of abscess drainage and prevent further complications are important
      entities for emergency physicians. Historically primary incision and drainage (I&amp;D) technique
      has found very effective method of abscess drainage, however a novel technique loop drainage
      holds promising. The purpose of our study is comparison efficacy of I&amp;D and loop drainage
      techniques in patients with cutaneous abscess.
