  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled double-blinded trial is to determine if the
      addition of an oral antifungal to typical post-operative medical therapy can prevent or
      reduce the incidence of recurrence of nasal polyps in fungal sensitive patients with chronic
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CRSwNP patients scheduled for medically-indicated sinus surgery will undergo screening
      ELIspot assay to identify patients with fungal sensitivity based on positive fungal induced
      IL-4 ELIspot. Enrolled fungal sensitive CRSwNP patients will undergo their sinus surgery and
      randomized into either placebo or itraconazole 200 mg PO BID for 24 weeks in addition to
      standardized post-surgical regimen (9 days of perioperative prednisone, saline irrigations
      and pain medication as needed). Patients will be followed as outpatient in rhinology clinic
      for 48 weeks total. During these post-op visits, compliance with medications will be
      determined. Patients will be questioned about any possible side effects or adverse events to
      post-operative medications. Then, the patients will be evaluated by 2 nasal specific quality
      of life questionnaires and nasal endoscopy. The goals of the nasal endoscopy are to evaluate
      the state of the sinus mucosa and to determine recurrence of nasal polyps.
