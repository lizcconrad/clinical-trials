      This is a pilot prospective single blind controlled trial comparing magnetically steerable
      gastric capsule endoscopy to conventional oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in diagnosing upper
      gastrointestinal pathology in patients with recurrent/refractory iron-deficient anaemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroscopy (OGD) is a useful test for investigating a variety of suspected upper GI
      disorders. But it is uncomfortable for patients and incurs the risk of intubation and
      sedation, plus a large proportion of procedures reveal insignificant or no pathology. Capsule
      endoscopy (CE) is the investigation of choice for diseases of the small bowel. It is safe,
      noninvasive and well tolerated.

      The use of CE is traditionally restricted to the small bowel, although newer capsules to
      image the oesophagus and colon are currently in use. Previous capsules have failed to
      adequately image the stomach due to its large volume and rugal folds. Recently a magnetic
      capsule and handheld magnet has been developed (Microcam Navi, Intromedic Ltd, Seoul, Korea)
      to enable an element of manoeuvrability of the capsule. This is unnecessary in the small
      bowel where the capsule is propelled along its' tubular structure by peristalsis, but in the
      capacious stomach this may allow the capsule to be steered to examine all areas of the
      stomach.

      The investigators have already conducted two feasibility studies in porcine models with
      promising results and a trial is currently underway using this equipment to steer the small
      bowel capsule through the stomach into the duodenum. The next logical step is to compare this
      technique to the conventional standard of upper GI investigationÍ¾ OGD. Patients with
      recurrent or refractory iron deficiency anaemia require a combination of gastroscopy and
      small bowel capsule endoscopy as part of their diagnostic investigations. The investigators
      wish to undertake a pilot prospective single blind controlled trial comparing magnetically
      steerable gastric capsule examination to conventional OGD in diagnosing upper
      gastrointestinal pathology in patients with recurrent/refractory iron deficiency anaemia.

    <description>Capsule endoscopy uses a swallowable pill camera which passes through the GI tract by the action of peristalsis. The procedure utilizes a battery powered wireless capsule to transmit images of the gastrointestinal tract as it passes through the small intestine. The images are later downloaded to a computer and reviewed by a trained physician. Magnetically steerable gastric capsule endoscopy uses a pill camera containing a small amount of magnetic material, that can be manoeuvred in the gut and intestine by the physician using a handheld magnet. This technique will be compared to conventional gastroscopy which uses a flexible endoscope. Both techniques will be used to diagnose upper gastrointestinal pathology in patients with recurrent/refractory iron deficient anemia.</description>
