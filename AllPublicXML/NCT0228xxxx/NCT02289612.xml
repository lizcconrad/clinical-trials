  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the specific properties of a variety of dietary
      fibres that lead to different postprandial glycemic and satiety responses in individuals at
      risk for type 2 diabetes. This is accomplished by utilizing a variety of dietary fibres that
      demonstrate a wide range of properties in a pudding product, and by examining the ability of
      each of these to limit gastric emptying, limit glucose absorption, limit insulin secretion,
      and improve satiety, versus a low fibre control product.

      and improve satiety, versus a low fibre control product. To accomplish this, a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo controlled, crossover study design will be used, in order to
      determine the different effects of a variety of fibre-enriched pudding products on markers of
      type 2 diabetes and satiety response, versus low-fibre control puddings.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting and postprandial blood glucose response for each pudding and control product</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood glucose will be analyzed for each study visit (10 in total) at times 0 (fasting), 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, to compare responses between different treatment products.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose will be measured in the fasting state and postprandially through finger prick blood samples at each study visit. Participants will have an initial fasted blood sample taken, then consume one of 10 treatment products over a 10 minute period, and will then have blood taken at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minute intervals. This will occur once a week for 10 weeks until all treatments have been consumed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting and postprandial insulin response for each pudding and control product</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood insulin will be analyzed for each each study visit (10 in total), at times 0 (fasting), 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, to compare responses between different treatment products.</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting and postprandial acetaminophen absorption for each pudding and control product</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood acetaminophen will be analyzed for each study visit (10 in total) at times 0 (fasting), 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, to compare responses between different treatment products.</time_frame>
    <description>Acetaminophen will be measured in the fasting state and postprandially through finger prick blood samples at each study treatment visit. Participants will have an initial fasted blood sample taken, then consume one of 10 treatment products over a 10 minute period, and will then have blood taken at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minute intervals.

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satiety-producing effect for each pudding and control product</measure>
    <time_frame>Satiety will be analyzed for each study visit (10 in total) at times 0 (fasting), 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, to compare responses between different treatment products.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaires during each treatment visit to subjectively measure satiety. They will be asked to complete an initial VAS questionnaire when fasted, and will then consume one of 10 treatments within 10 minutes, and complete VAS questionnaires 5 minutes before each blood sample at times 10, 25, 55, 85, and 115 minutes. After 120 minutes have passed, participants will consume an ad libitum pizza lunch buffet meal to objectively measure satiety, and once comfortably full they will complete a final VAS questionnaire. Weighed food records will be used to objectively measure food intake for the rest of the day. This will occur once a week for 10 weeks until all treatments have been consumed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3-Day food records</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 days before the first treatment study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete 3-day food records before the first treatment study visit to provide information about their background nutrient intake and dietary habits.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Fasted body weight</measure>
    <time_frame>At each study treatment visit</time_frame>
    <description>Fasted body weight will be measured at each study before consuming the treatment product.</description>
