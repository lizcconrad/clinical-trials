        Study includes patients, in a real-life setting, who are hospitalized for acute coronary
        syndrome (ACS) within 24 hours of symptom onset and who have a final diagnosis of Unstable
        Angina (UA), Myocardial Infarction (MI) and were discharged. Including transferred to
        another medical institution after 24 hours from the moment of hospitalization; transferred
        from other medical institutions within 24 hours from the moment of initial hospitalization
        to hospital.

        Principal of choice in the Single-cohort study: only patients with ticagrelor at
        discharged.

        Patients received the standard medical care as determined by the treating cardiologist.
