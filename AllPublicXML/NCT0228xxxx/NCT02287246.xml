      To study post-operative efficacy of Exparel® for pain control in patients undergoing any
      Urogynecology surgery involving the posterior vaginal wall using a randomized, double-blinded
      placebo controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective post-operative pain management is a crucial component of a patient's surgical
      course following Urogynecologic surgery. Narcotics are the cornerstone for post-operative
      analgesia with a frequent re-dosing requirement, a lengthy list of side effects and adverse
      reaction risks5. The colorectal, orthopedic and general surgery literatures have reported on
      an extended-release bupivacaine liposomal injection, Exparel®, which remarkably reduces acute
      post-operative pain; however, this medication has not yet been reported within Urogynecology
      literature.

      We propose a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial with 120
      subjects recruited from the WRNMMC Urogynecology Clinic to study post-operative efficacy of
      Exparel® for pain control in patients undergoing Urogynecology surgery involving the
      posterior vaginal wall. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 20mL of
      extended-release bupivacaine or 20mL placebo.

      The primary objective of the trial will be to evaluate the cumulative post-operative vaginal
      pain using front side of Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale16 at days 1 and 3
      post-procedure.. We hypothesize a 30% difference in post-operative pain measurements between
      the active medication group and placebo group.

      Additional objectives of this study are to evaluate vaginal pain on post-operative day 7,
      total medication usage on days 1, 3 and 7 and any post-operative voiding dysfunction,
      comparing the study group to the control.
