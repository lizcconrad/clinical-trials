  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To combine Brentuximab Vedotin with Dexamethasone, AraC and Cisplatin (DHAP) chemotherapy in
      patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) refractory to first line chemotherapy or in first relapse
      is expected to induce a significantly higher (metabolic) complete remission (CR) rate prior
      to consolidation with BEAM, as judged by FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
      fluorodeoxyglucose)-PET negativity. This will be compared with published data on DHAP salvage
      only. Increasing the metabolic CR rate prior to consolidation with high dose chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is expected to improve progression free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
