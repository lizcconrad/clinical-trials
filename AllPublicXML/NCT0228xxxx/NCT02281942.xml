  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low self-control has been associated with a number of unhealthy behaviors with low treatment
      success. Alternative non-pharmacological approaches have the potential for enhancing
      self-control. This pilot study will investigate if the practice of yoga and/or health and
      wellness education improve self-control in the context of nicotine addiction, and will set
      the stage for larger clinical trials using behavioral interventions to supplement or replace
      existing treatments and increase the rates of recovery from disorders in which low
      self-control is a susceptibility factor.
