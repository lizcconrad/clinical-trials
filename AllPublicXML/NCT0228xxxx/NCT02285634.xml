  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nosebleeds (epistaxis) are a frequent cause of emergency department visits, reportedly
      inciting 1 in 200 visits. They are most common in those less than ten and older than seventy,
      often occurring in the winter months secondary to dry indoor heating. Epistaxis is associated
      with elevated blood pressures, but it is controversial whether hypertension is actual a
      contributing cause.

      In non-life-threatening epistaxis, the first step in management is commonly the application
      of a topical vasoconstrictive medication. In many cases this will lead to cessation of the
      bleeding or facilitate the exam in those that continue to bleed. Frequently used medications
      include phenylephrine, oxymetazoline, and lidocaine with epinephrine.

      Classic teaching has been to avoid the use of these medications in patients with elevated
      blood pressures due to concerns of inducing hypertensive crisis. Strict avoidance of topical
      vasoconstrictors in this patient group with epistaxis severely limits the treatment options
      for a many patients given the association between the two conditions.

      Though universally taught, the actual effect of these agents on blood pressure remains
      unquantified. Studies investigating the prevention of nose bleeding during nasotracheal
      intubations suggest that the effect might be minor with little variation between agents.

      Clinical question:

      What is the effect of commonly used intranasal vasoconstrictors on blood pressure in
      volunteers without a history of hypertension.
