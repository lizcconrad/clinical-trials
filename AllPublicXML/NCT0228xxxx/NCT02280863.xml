  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a hybrid
      closed loop (HCL) system in participants with type 1 diabetes. This HCL system utilizes the
      PID-IFB controller during the day and night in a closely monitored outpatient environment to
      allow assessment of the practical aspects of using the system for both the participant with
      diabetes and their parent or designated remote monitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be asked to use the CGM and the study insulin pump provided for
      approximately 3 to 7 days prior to initiation of the HCL PID-IFB system. All participants
      with diabetes and the parent/ guardian of participants &lt; 18 years of age will be asked to
      stay overnight in a hotel while the HCL PID-IFB system is on and to remain close to Stanford
      University during the day. For participants &gt; 18 years of age, designated remote monitors
      will be asked to receive alerts for low/ high glucose levels.

      In order to assess user experience/ evaluation of the system both the participants with
      diabetes using the HCL and the parent/ legal guardian of participants &lt; 18 years of age or
      the designate remote monitor for participants &gt; 18 years of age will also be asked to provide
      their consent to participate in these evaluations.

    <description>Our definition of a subject successfully participating in a cohort is:
No more than one meter glucose value &lt;50 mg/dL and no values &lt;40 mg/dL
No more than two episodes with meter glucose values remaining &gt;300 mg/dL for more than 1 hour that are unrelated to an infusion set failure
No ketonemia &gt;1.0 mmol/L, while the system is functional unless related to an intercurrent illness or infusion set failure
No seizures or loss of consciousness while system is on and functional</description>

We will also separately analyze daytime (7AM to 12AM) and nighttime (12AM to 7AM) sensor values. 7. Sensor accuracy will be assessed by the MARD for each day in the study 8. Human factors analysis: Did the intervention meet expectations, areas for improvement 9.

    <description>Research staff will be remotely monitoring subjects at all times. If their sensor reads &lt;70 mg/dl or &gt;300 mg/dl, a health care member will intervene if no response from pt. or monitor within 5 and 10 minutes respectively. Treatment will be given as per the treatment interventions in the MM JDRF Hotel Studies Protocol (Table 2-1- Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia Monitoring and Treatment Procedures). At night a bedtime glucose, 3 AM glucose and a morning glucose will be obtained. During the day meter readings will be obtained before all meals and exercise.</description>
