      Aims of the study : 1) To determine whether the presence of the V158 allele of Fc gammaRIIIA
      gene is associated with a better outcome of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults and
      especially with a higher response-rate to rituximab. 2) To analyze the impact of therapy and
      especially rituximab on some B and T cells autoreactive subsets in the peripheral blood.

      Patients and Methods :

      Inclusion criteria : age ≥ 18 years, primary ITP defined according to the recent consensual
      criteria (Rodeghiero F et al. Blood 2009), active ITP defined as an ITP with a platelet count
      &lt; 50 x 109/L requiring treatment, informed consent. Main exclusion criteria : secondary ITP.

      Blood samples (serum, plasma, DNA) will be collected in every patient at time of inclusion
      (pre-treatment) and then sequentially at 3, 6 and 12 months after inclusion in patients
      treated with rituximab or during the remission phase for other treatments for immunological
      studies. When a marrow analysis is indicated, some marrow specimens will also be collected
      and studied and if a patient will have to undergo a splenectomy as a standard of care, some
      spleen specimens will also be collected. Fc gamma RIIIA V/F158 polymorphism will be assessed
      by means of an allele-specific PCR. The sequential analysis of anti-platelets
      (anti-GpIIbIIIa) antibodies producing B cells will be performed by means of flow cytometry
      and ELISPOT analysis. T cells subsets will be harvested in presence of GpIIbIIIa
      immunodominant peptides and and cytokines expression will be measured on supernatants on days
      2 and 11 in vitro by using Luminex technology in order to characterize and distinguish TH1,
      TH2, TH17, TFH and Tregs subsets.

      The primary outcome will be the overall response rate 1 year after inclusion defined by a
      platelet count &gt; 30 x 109/L with at least a two-fold increase of the initial (pre-treatment)
      count. For the patients treated with rituximab as a standard of care, based on the overall
      expected response-rate (40-50%) and based on preliminary data on FcgammaRIIIA V/F158
      distribution, the inclusion of 85 patients should be sufficient to show an association of the
      V158 allele and the response (b risk 20% and a 5%). Responders and non responders will be
      compared by non parametrical tests, a multivariate analysis will be than performed using a
      logistic regression model. The immunological data B and T cells subsets) obtained in both the
      responders and the non responders will be compared over time (To, M3, M6 and M12) by non
      parametrical matched tests.
