  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our research is to investigate the effects of applying cold therapy, or
      &quot;icing,&quot; to injured muscles in terms of strength recovery and muscle soreness amelioration
      following unaccustomed exercise.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine whether or not injured muscles that are subject to icing after
      eccentrically damaging exercise recover their strength quicker and/or have less muscle
      soreness than those that do not receive any icing treatment after damaging exercise and if
      any differences in effectiveness between two icing protocols exist. Baseline measures of peak
      torque of the dominant arm's elbow flexor muscles will be measured by concentric and
      isometric contractions prior to participants undergoing eccentric muscle damaging exercise.
      Participants will be randomly assigned into 3 different experimental groups of approximately
      15 participants each. The first group will begin &quot;Icing Protocol 1&quot; at time 0 (or as close
      to). The second group will begin &quot;Icing Protocol 2&quot; six hours after their initial eccentric
      muscle damaging exercise. The remaining group will not receive any icing treatment; they are
      the control group. Participants will be brought back into the lab at specific post-exercise
      times (0h, 24h, 48h, 96h, and 7 days) to complete peak torque measures as they did with
      baseline measures prior to eccentric muscle damage. Measures of delayed onset muscle soreness
      (DOMS) will also be taken at baseline and during scheduled follow up times for participants.

    <description>Will perform the eccentric muscle damage exercise and will begin the icing intervention immediately after the muscle damage. The icing protocol will be icing the elbow flexor muscles for 10 minutes with a cold pack followed by 10 minutes with no icing and another 10 minutes of elbow flexor muscle icing. The participants will perform this protocol every day at approximately the same time for the duration of the study.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomly assigned into 3 experimental groups. Icing Protocol 1 has participants apply cold packs under the supervision of the principal investigators to their elbow flexor region for 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off, followed by an additional 10 minutes on, starting at time 0. Icing Protocol 2 follows the same procedure but it begins 6 hours after the participant has completed their eccentric muscle damaging exercise and is to be done at home without the supervision of the principal investigators. Both protocols require the participants to repeat their icing procedures every 24 hours until their involvement with the study is finished, which is 7 days in duration. The third experimental group is the control group and will not participate in an icing therapy during the duration of the study.</description>
