    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common complication of illness especially among the elderly with serious
      sequelae including increased mortality, morbidity and length of stay. This neuropsychiatric
      emergency has key features including acute onset, fluctuating level of consciousness, poor
      attention and cognitive deficits with a presentation which may include hallucinations and
      delusions.

      A critical precipitating and maintaining feature of delirium is disrupted sleep. Melatonin is
      a widely available natural health product with evidence in normalizing circadian rhythms and
      sleep. There is also preliminary evidence that melatonin can be used to prevent the
      development of delirium in hospitalized patients. We hypothesize that daily administration of
      melatonin (1.5mg) in the evening, beginning at first admission to hospital and continuing for
      14 days, will lead to decreased rates of delirium compared to placebo-treated comparison
      subjects.
