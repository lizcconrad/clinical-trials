  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determines whether NF-кB dependent proinflammatory state found in type 2 diabetes
      yield to a higher RAGE activation in the mesenchymal stem cell, as well as the effects of the
      proinflammation on osteoblast differentiation impairment and cellular apoptosis in type 2
      diabetic patients. This study will compare non-diabetic control subjects and type 2 diabetic
      patients with metformin monotherapy failure in the aspect of 1) serum markers for NF-кB
      dependent proinflammatory state and its intracellular signals, 2) osteogenic differentiation
      and apoptosis of the mesenchymal stem cells, and 3) serum AGE, RAGE and cellular RAGE
      activation.

      This study aims to explore whether proinflammation in type 2 diabetes is an mechanism
      underlined higher RAGE activation and osteoblast differentiation defect demonstrated in the
      MSC of type 2 diabetes, as well as the effects of the proinflammation on cellular
      differentiation and apoptosis of the MSC. Type 2 diabetes was known to be in proinflammatory
      state due to NF-кB-dependent cytokine secretion (for example, TNF-α, IL1 and IL6), which in
      turn contribute to NF-кB upregulation. Because RAGE expression is partly regulated by NF-кB
      signal, the NF-кB upregulation in proinflammatory state observed in type 2 diabetes may
      entail RAGE overactivation in this population. Therefore, the proinflammatory state and its
      correlation to cellular NF-кB-dependent RAGE activation is noteworthy to be determined in the
      MSC of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the effect of proinflammation on differentiation
      potential and apoptosis of the MSC in type 2 diabetes remains to be elucidated.
