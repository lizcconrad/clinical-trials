      This is second phase of a larger project funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
      Institute to help heavy smokers make informed decisions about lung cancer screening with
      low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). The aim of this phase is to compare outcomes for
      promoting informed screening decisions about lung cancer screening in a randomized trial of
      patients who smoke recruited through state-based smoking cessation quitlines, where patients
      will be randomly assigned to the updated patient decision aid or to standard educational
      materials on lung cancer screening.

    <description>DCS measures personal perceptions using survey response categories. DCS Value Subscale includes a designated number of associated survey items which are scored according to response categories (3 -5 responses, i.e. 0='Yes'; 2='Not Sure'; 4='No'). Total scores will range from 0 [feels extremely clear about personal value for benefits &amp; risks/side effects] to 100 [feels extremely unclear about personal values]. For scores or subscores reported as sum of items that used response category scale [ranging from low decisional conflict to high decisional conflict] scores will be converted to equivalent 0-100 scale. Knowledge outcome assessed at week 1 then 3-month and 6-month follow-up (overall participation 6 months).</description>
