      1. Procedures 1.1 Start-up stage (-14~0 Day)

        1. Inquire medical history, medication use, accompanied treatment, etc;

        2. Sign informed consent;

           from outpatient service (without medicate);

        7. Allocate screen number, hand out Guanxi Shutong Capsules Placebo and record card of
           angina/nitroglycerin used;
