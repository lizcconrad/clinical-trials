  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With a growing body of knowledge on the promising advancements and recent clinical data of
      the third generations of the Greenlight PVP/XPS, it seems to be a real contender in the world
      of MIS. Contenders of Greenlight laser technology includes bipolar as well as Holmium laser
      technology.

      In this study the investigators planned to test the Greenlight (532-nm) laser PVP using (XPS)
      180W system compared to bipolar electro-vaporization, in reduction of LUTS secondary to small
      to moderate sized BPH in a prospective randomized trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with LUTS due to BPH seen through the outpatient prostate clinic in the Mansoura UNC
      were assessed to evaluate if the patient is eligible to the study inclusion criteria.
      Patients who are meeting these criteria were asked to participate in this randomized
      comparative study and were provided with an informed consent form. Study participants were
      enrolled and randomized, and the appropriate scheduled procedures were performed.

      Preoperatively, all patients were thoroughly evaluated by medical history and physical exam,
      digital rectal exam (DRE), prostate specific antigen (PSA), urinalysis and urine culture,
      international index of prostate symptom score (IPSS), Quality of Life (QOL), transrectal
      ultrasound (TRUS) measurement of prostatic volume and biopsy whenever indicated, measurement
      of post-void residual assessment (PVR), and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). Preoperative
      flexible urethrocystoscopy was done when hematuria was the presenting symptom.
