  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of vascular occlusion test (VOT) during
      cardiac surgery to predict postoperative outcomes in pediatric patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After induction of anesthesia, pediatric SomaSensor for INVOS 5100C is attached at calf
      muscle and non-invasive blood pressure cuff is applied to ipsilateral thigh. VOT is performed
      as: after baseline oxygen saturation value is recorded, cuff pressure is rapidly increased to
      30 mmHg over than systolic blood pressure. After 3 minutes of ischemic time, cuff pressure is
      rapidly decreased. It is performed at 3 time periods : before start of operation, during
      cardiopulmonary bypass, and after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative outcome
      variables are recorded after surgery : major adverse event, use of inotropic and vasoactive
      drugs, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. The relationship between the results
      of VOT and postoperative outcome will be investigated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Major adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Major adverse event is defined as cardiac compression, re-sternotomy because of hemodynamic instability, ECMO support, Cr&gt; 2mg/dL, cerebral hemorrhage or infarct and mortality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of inotropic and vasoactive drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Use of inotropic and vasoactive drugs is evaluated using vasoactive-Inotropic scores (VIS). VIS is calculated as: dopamine dose (㎍/kg/min) + dobutamine dose (㎍/kg/min) + 100 x epinephrine dose (㎍/kg/min) + 10 x milrinone dose (㎍/kg/min) + 10,000 x vasopressin dose (U/kg/min) + 100 x norepinephrine dose (㎍/kg/min).(7) VIS at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery ended are collected in all patients.</description>

    <description>Pediatric patients aged under 8 years old are enrolled in this study. VOT is performed in 3 times : after induction of anesthesia, during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for main surgical procedure and after weaning from CPB. The relationship between postoperative outcome variables and the dynamic parameters from VOT, such as desaturation and reoxygenation rate, and reactive hyperemic area, will be evaluated.</description>
