  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study. This means that BCG therapy has already been found to be safe in
      humans. The investigators just want to see if using more treatments works better.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have high risk non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma (Tis,
             TaHG, or T1) that is pathologically confirmed by the Memorial Sloan Kettering
             Department of Pathology or a documented history of TaHG or T1 non-muscle invasive
             urothelial bladder tumors.

          -  18 years and older

          -  All visible papillary lesions must be macroscopically resected within 60 days of
             treatment initiation.

          -  Absence of urothelial carcinoma involving the upper urinary tract (documented by
             radiological imaging or biopsy) preferably within 12 months from the start of
             treatment. Should the imaging or biopsy be performed outside this window it will be up
             to the physicians discretion to re-scan/biopsy.

          -  Patients who have received a single dose of mitomycin C following staging TUR.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently being treated or scheduled to have radiation treatment for bladder cancer
             during the study.

          -  Treatment with intravesical BCG or chemotherapy for a patient's current &lt;T2 tumor
             during the 12 months prior to the current diagnosis.

          -  Currently being treated or scheduled to have treatment with any systemic or
             intravesical chemotherapeutic agent during the study.

          -  Currently being treated with or having been treated in the last 12 months with any
             investigational drug for high risk superficial bladder cancer.

          -  Previous muscle-invasive (i.e., stage T2 or higher) transitional cell carcinoma of the
             bladder.

          -  Currently being treated for metastatic transitional cell carcinoma.

          -  Scheduled to have surgery for bladder cancer during the study.

          -  Presence of clinically significant infections or congenital or acquired
             immunodeficiency.
