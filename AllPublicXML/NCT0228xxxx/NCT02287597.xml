  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This local, non-interventional, cohort study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC) will prospectively collect data from standard clinical practice of second-line
      treatment with chemotherapy plus Avastin (bevacizumab). There will be no additional
      diagnostic or therapeutic procedures required by this study, apart from those performed in
      everyday clinical practice for second-line treatment of mCRC in Croatia.
