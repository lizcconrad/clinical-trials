      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare different dose levels of CPX-351. The
      safety and efficacy of the drug will be studied in all dose levels.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive a lower dose of CPX-351.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive a higher dose of CPX-351.

      Up to 15 participants will be assigned to each study group. You and the study staff will know
      which group you are in. If both groups are found to be safe, a third group of up to 15
      participants will receive an even higher dose of the study drug. The group that appears to
      have the best results will also enroll an additional 10 participants.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is about 4-8 weeks long, but may be longer depending on how the disease
      responds to the study drug. The study cycles will be Induction and Consolidation Cycles.
      Induction Therapy is designed to remove the signs of leukemia that can be seen and to allow
      normal blood cells to be restored. This is called remission. Consolidation Therapy is
      designed to cause the disease to stay in remission.

      You will receive CPX-351 by vein over about 90 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5 of an Induction
      Cycle. If the disease does not appear to go into remission, you may receive a second
      Induction Cycle, in which you receive the drug on Days 1 and 3. No more than 2 Induction
      Cycles will be given.

      If the disease appears to go into remission, you may receive up to 4 Consolidation Cycles, in
      which you receive the drug on Days 1 and 3.

      Study Visits:

      Because the length of study cycles will depend on how the disease responds to the study drug,
      some of the visits listed below may not be needed. For example, if a study cycle is only 4
      weeks, you will not have a Day 42 visit in that cycle.

      On Days 14 and 42 of each course, you will have a physical exam.

      On Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, then at least 1 time every week after that, blood (about 2
      teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Before the next cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoons) will be drawn to check your copper levels.

      On Day 28 of each Induction cycle, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to
      check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing. If the doctor thinks it is
      needed, you will have another bone marrow aspiration/biopsy 5-10 days after this one.

      Before every 2 cycles of treatment, you will have an ECHO or MUGA scan to check your heart
      function. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, this will be done before every cycle.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drug for up to 2 induction and 4 consolidation cycles. You will no
      longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if you are not able to follow the study directions.

      End of Treatment Visit:

      Within 30 days after the last dose of the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your copper
           levels.

        -  You will have an EKG, ECHO, and/or MUGA scan to check your heart function.

      Follow-Up:

      After the end-of-treatment visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Every month for as long as the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will be called and
           asked about how you are doing. Each call should last about 5-10 minutes.

        -  Every 2-3 months for up to 1 year, then as often as the study doctor thinks it is
           needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your
           copper levels. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood will be drawn for copper
           level testing every month.

        -  Every 3-4 months for up to 1 year, then for as often as the study doctor thinks it is
           needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, every 3-4 months for up to 1 year, you will
           have an ECHO or MUGA scan to check your heart function.

      This is an investigational study. CPX-351 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 55 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Preliminary efficacy (as determined by the rate of CR or CRi) of 2-3 dose levels of CPX-351 in participants with newly diagnosed AML at high risk for induction mortality. Inductions and consolidations administered as courses where a course consists of therapy administration with scheduled assessments to evaluate treatment response. The first induction may end before the completion of all evaluations if a second induction is necessary. The response assessment for CR or Cri follows induction (first 28 day cycle, up to 2 cycles for 56 days) and defined as Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow blasts &lt;5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.0 x 109/L (1000/μL); platelet count &gt;100 x 109/L (100,000/μL); or CR with incomplete recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (&lt;1.0 x 109/L [1000/μL]) and/or thrombocytopenia (&lt;100 x 109/L [100,000/μL]).</description>
