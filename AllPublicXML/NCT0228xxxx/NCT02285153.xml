  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets play a central part not just in homeostasis and thrombosis as the primary effector
      cells, but they are also key cells in the regulation of the immunological response to various
      stressors. After activation, platelets release their granules which store different
      inflammatory mediators that induce coagulation, recruit further platelets, activate
      complement, attract neutrophils and leukocytes and regulate the vascular tone. Platelets
      activated by systemic inflammation and infection, may also contribute to the development of
      multiple organ failure. Thus, inhibition of platelet activation may have beneficial effects
      on critically ill patients.

      the investigators hypothesize that acetylsalicylic acid reduces the mortality of medical
      intensive care unit patients. In a retrospective study acetylsalicylic acid use was
      associated with a substantial reduction in a medical intensive care unit population (Winning
      et al., 2010).

      The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind study including 460 patients
      (2x230), who will be randomized to receive 100mg acetylsalicylic acid(daily, intravenous) or
      a placebo (0,9% sodium-choride solution) to assess whether acetylsalicylic acid reduces the
      mortality of medical intensive care unit patients.

      Main outcome criteria will be 28/90day-mortality. Furthermore the investigators will assess
      whether acetylsalicylic acid reduces the risk of suffering thromboembolic complications.

      Post-mortem examinations will be conducted in all patients who die in the course of the
      study.

      Furthermore we will assess bleeding rates, intensive care unit mortality and pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic properties of acetylsalicylic acid in the intensive care unit population.
