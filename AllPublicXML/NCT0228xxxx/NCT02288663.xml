  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the recommended parameter to assess renal function. The
      reference technique to measure GFR (clearance of a glomerular agent) is not commonly used.
      Instead, estimations (eGFR) are routinely taken from serum creatinine (SCr) with several
      published formulae: Cockcroft and Gault, MDRD, CKD-EPI. Basically, all these formulae aim at
      predicting the endogenous creatinine production by morphological parameters (age, body
      weight...) However, in the elderly, muscular mass is extremely variable and sarcopenia is
      quite commonly encountered (frequently linked to Alzheimer disease). This is probably the
      main reason why the aforementioned formulae are not valid in this population: for a given
      renal function, a lower muscular mass induces a lower creatinine production and, henceforth,
      a lower SCr value, which gives an overestimation of eGFR.

      Muscular mass is closely linked to lean body mass (LBM), which can be properly assessed by
      whole-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Alternatively, Bioelectric Impedance Spectroscopy
      (BIS) can also be used.

      Investigators postulate that it is possible to estimate GFR in the elderly from both SCr and
      LBM estimation from DXA. Proof of concept has already been made by others but until now, no
      specific formula for the elderly has been devised and properly validated.

      Investigators'aim is thus to propose a new formula to predict GFR from both SCr and LBM
      (estimated from DXA) in the elderly. This formula will be elaborated from a first series of
      100 patients and validated on a second series of 100 other patients.
