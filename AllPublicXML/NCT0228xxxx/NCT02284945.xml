  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spread of cancer to the spinal column is a growing problem in patients with cancer. It can
      cause a number of problems including pain, instability and neurologic problems. If left
      untreated, progressive weakness, numbness and bladder/bowel disturbance occurs. The aim of
      treatment is to help with pain and to reduce the risk of these neurological problems. This
      treatment has traditionally been radiotherapy to the spine. Surgery has always meant large
      open operations with a long recovery time and significant risk of complications. There has
      been new technology that has allowed less invasive operations to take place to stabilise the
      spine. The aim is to relieve the pressure on the spinal cord in addition to stabilising the
      spinal cord. These techniques are called 'minimally invasive' and include surgical techniques
      such as cement augmentation and percutaneous instrumentation.

      The aim of this study is to compare traditional open operations with these new minimally
      invasive techniques to see if they do result in reduced complications and quicker recovery in
      addition to achieving the goals of surgery.
