          3. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not
             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy

          8. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          9. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab abnormality that

             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
