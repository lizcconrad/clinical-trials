      Background and objectives:

      Recently the news of intern doctors' death due to overloaded work or committing suicide has
      made the authorities concerned put emphasis on the mental health care of medical staffs and
      related policies of psychological interventions. The prefrontal lobe plays an important role
      in the working memory, executive function and problem-solving abilities of the brain.
      Currently, no neuroimaging studies investigating the impact of job stress on the prefrontal
      love functions in intern doctors. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures the
      cortical functions of the frontotemporal regions and has been widely used as a biomarker to
      aid in differential diagnoses in major psychiatric illnesses in Japan. The present study will
      investigate impact of the job stress on brain cortical activity during a verbal fluency test
      (VFT) by using fNIRS.

      Materials and methods:

      A total of 100 participants will be recruited. Clinical measurements of mood status by Beck's
      Depression Inventory and Beck's Anxiety Inventory, as well as job stress by Chinese Version
      of the Job Content Questionnaire and the Chinese version of Copenhagen Burnout Inventory will
      be arranged. The relationship between clinical measurements and cortical activity during a
      VFT will be analyzed by Pearson's correlation. Multiple regression analysis will be applied
      to investigate the independent contributions of mood status and job stress.

      Expected results and contributions of the study:

      Job stress, depression, and anxiety are significantly negatively correlated with cortical
      activity of prefrontal regions. The importance of mental health of medical staffs under high
      job stress should be stressed.

      A total of 100 intern doctors will be recruited. The data including Chinese version of
      Copenhagen burnout inventory, BDI, BAI, average working hours per day, and average sleeping
      times were acquired. They will undergo NIRS investigations to detect frontal activities
      during performing a verbal fluency test. The correlation between stress parameters and
      cortical activities were examined.
