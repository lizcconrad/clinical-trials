  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, multi site, single-arm study is to capture the efficacy of
      treatment using the ExAblate Transcranial System and to further demonstrate safety in
      medication-refractory tremor in patients with essential tremor (ET).

      This study is evaluating a new technique for performing Thalamotomy for tremor control. While
      current techniques have possible invasive or radiation effects, the use of ExAblate if
      totally non-invasive and without any radiation. After informed consent and screening,
      eligible subjects will be undergo an ExAblate treatment. All subjects will be followed at 1
      day, 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and for up to 5 years as directed by their doctor.
