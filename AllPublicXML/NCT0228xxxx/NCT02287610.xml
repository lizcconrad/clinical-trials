  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of switching from
      immediate-release prednisone (conventional) therapy to delayed-release prednisone (RAYOS) in
      patients with moderately to severely active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), managed according to
      standard of care in clinical practice settings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) participants previously receiving immediate release
      prednisone were enrolled in the trial if they and their physicians both consented. Once
      entered, participant baseline data were captured and they were switched to delayed-release
      prednisone and followed for approximately 12 weeks.

    <measure>Change in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints Calculated With Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) From Baseline to Final Visit (Final Follow-up Visit)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Follow up visit (up to 18.7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is an index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender joint counts (TJC), both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), as well as acute phase response determined by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), and patient global assessment (PGA) on a visual analogue scale (higher scores indicate higher disease activity).
DAS28-ESR was calculated according to the following formula: DAS28-ESR equals (=) [0.56 multiplied by (*) the square root (√) of TJC] plus (+) [0.28 * √ of SJC] + [0.70 * the natural logarithm (ln) ESR in millimeters per hour (mm/h)] + [0.014 * PGA in mm]. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.
As this study was a non-interventional research initiative and no assessments or visits were mandated, the change in DAS28-ESR was only calculated for participants that had measurements at both baseline and final follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Follow up visit (up to 18.7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response is based on change (improvement) in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints score from baseline to last follow-up visit. DAS28 scores were broken into 3 categories: ≤3.2 at last follow-up (low disease activity), &gt;3.2 and ≤ 5.1 at last follow-up (moderate or high disease activity), and DAS28 &gt;5.1 at last follow-up (high disease activity). Then based on the category and magnitude of the change in DAS28 from baseline, the EULAR response of Good, Moderate or No Response was determined.
DAS28 is an index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender joint counts (TJC), both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), as well as acute phase response determined as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), and patient global assessment (PGA) on a visual analogue scale (higher scores indicate higher disease activity).</description>

        <description>Mean change in severity of morning stiffness was assessed using a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0 corresponded to “Not Severe at All” and 100 to “Extremely Severe”. This measure was collected at baseline and at the last follow-up visit. As this study was a non-interventional research initiative and no assessments or visits were mandated, the mean change was only calculated for participants that had measurements at both baseline and final follow-up.</description>

          <title>Change in Physician’s Overall Assessment in Disease Activity From Baseline to Final Visit (Final Follow-up Visit)</title>
          <description>Physician’s Overall Assessment in Disease Activity was measured with a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 corresponded to “Very Well’ and 10 to “Very Poor”. As this study was a non-interventional research initiative and no assessments or visits were mandated, the change in Physician’s Overall Assessment in Disease Activity was only calculated for participants that had measurements at both baseline and final follow-up.</description>
          <population>56 participants were in the per protocol follow-up analysis set. Change in Physician’s Overall Assessment in Disease Activity was calculated for participants who had both baseline and follow-up Physician’s Overall Assessment in Disease Activity data. For this measure, the mean change from baseline is based on 37 participants.</population>

        <title>Change in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints Calculated With Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) From Baseline to Final Visit (Final Follow-up Visit)</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is an index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender joint counts (TJC), both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), as well as acute phase response determined by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), and patient global assessment (PGA) on a visual analogue scale (higher scores indicate higher disease activity).
DAS28-ESR was calculated according to the following formula: DAS28-ESR equals (=) [0.56 multiplied by (*) the square root (√) of TJC] plus (+) [0.28 * √ of SJC] + [0.70 * the natural logarithm (ln) ESR in millimeters per hour (mm/h)] + [0.014 * PGA in mm]. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.
As this study was a non-interventional research initiative and no assessments or visits were mandated, the change in DAS28-ESR was only calculated for participants that had measurements at both baseline and final follow-up.</description>

        <title>Change in Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID3) From Baseline to Final Visit (Final Follow-up Visit)</title>
        <description>Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID3) was calculated by summing three measures: physical function (0 to 10 with higher scores indicating less function), pain (0 to 10 with higher scores indicating higher pain), and patient global assessment (0 to 10 with higher scores indicating the participant was doing very poorly considering the ways in which the illness was affecting them). As this study was a non-interventional research initiative and no assessments or visits were mandated, the change in RAPID3 was only calculated for participants that had measurements at both baseline and final follow-up.
RAPID3 scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores meaning worse condition. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement in condition.</description>

        <title>Change in Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) Psychological Status (PS) Component From Baseline to Final Visit (Final Follow-up Visit)</title>
        <description>The change in Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) – Psychological status (PS) was assessed by asking participants to score how they were sleeping, dealing with anxiety/nervousness, and dealing with depression as “without any difficulty” (score of 0), “with some difficulty” (score of 1.1), “with much difficulty” (score of 2.2) or “unable to do” (score of 3.3). The results were summed to give a score ranging from 0 to 9.9. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. As this study was a non-interventional research initiative and no assessments or visits were mandated, the change in psychological status was only calculated for participants that had measurements at both baseline and final follow-up.</description>

        <title>Change in Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) Morning Stiffness Component From Baseline to Final Visit (Final Follow-up Visit)</title>
        <description>The duration of morning stiffness was the amount of time participants experienced stiffness after waking up in the morning (over the last week). This measure was collected at baseline and at the last follow-up visit. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. As this study was a non-interventional research initiative and no assessments or visits were mandated, the change in duration of morning stiffness was only calculated for participants that had measurements at both baseline and final follow-up.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Last Follow up visit (up to 18.7 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>56 participants were in the per protocol follow-up analysis set. Change in Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) – morning stiffness, minutes (past week) was calculated for participants who had both baseline and follow-up data. For this measure, the mean change from baseline is based on 30 participants.</population>
