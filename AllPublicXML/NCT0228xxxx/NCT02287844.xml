  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to establish the prebiotic effect of a new
      xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) and of an inulin-and-XOS mixture (INU-XOS) and to determine their
      effect on endotoxaemia (lipopolysaccharides (LPS)) and immune parameters. In this randomized,
      parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, sixty healthy volunteers were randomly
      assigned to three groups, receiving either 5 g XOS, INU-XOS (3 g inulin +1 g XOS) or an
      equivalent weight of wheat maltodextrins (placebo) during 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study followed a randomized, parallel placebo-controlled double-blind design.

      A semi-quantitative dietary survey was performed at enrollment in order to assess the usual
      dietary fiber intake in order to select the target population consuming 13 to 18 g/day. The
      volunteers were instructed to follow dietary guidelines to maintain their fiber intake during
      a two-week stabilization phase and then throughout the intervention.

      As all volunteers were living on-site and taking all meals at the Institut Polytechnique
      LaSalle Beauvais cafeteria, the content of each meal could be closely controlled during the
      week. A 3-day dietary survey was performed at the end of the stabilization period and
      repeated at the end of the intervention in order to assess the stability of the diet.

      The 60 volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received daily the
      intervention for 4 weeks.
