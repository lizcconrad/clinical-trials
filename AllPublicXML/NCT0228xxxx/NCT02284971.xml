    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the combination of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and
      CDX-1127 in subjects with castration resistant prostate cancer. Subjects will be randomized
      to one of three arms to receive SBRT prior to, after, or in conjunction with the first dose
      of CDX-1127.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be conducted in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer in order to
      define whether inclusion of immune regulation agents such as CDX-1127 augments immune
      responses to SBRT-treated primary tumors or metastases, and whether inclusion of CDX-1127 in
      the treatment regimen results in immune responses in untreated metastases.

    <description>SBRT will be administered to the primary tumor and/or site of metastatic disease over a period of 5 days (Days 1-5) at a constant dose for 1-4 sites of prostate cancer involvement:30 Gy in 5 fractions of 6 Gy each for prostate gland; 25 Gy in 5 fractions for bone and/or soft tissue metastases).
Subjects will receive four doses of CDX-1127(3 mg/kg) (Days 1, 43, 64, 85). The study drug will be administered intravenously over a 90-minute time period and will be followed by a 2-hour observation period. A subject's dose of CDX-1127 will be calculated based on their actual body weight at the time of screening. A subject's dose of CDX-1127 will remain constant at each time point, unless they experience a greater than 10% change in body weight.</description>

        MAIN INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Males, Age ≥ 18 years.

        Participants must have histologically-proven prostrate adenocarcinoma that is
        castrate-resistant. Progressive disease is defined by one or more of the following:

          -  A rise in PSA on two successive determinations at least one week apart and PSA level
             ≥2ng/ml.

          -  Soft-tissue progression defined by RECIST 1.1.

          -  Bone disease progression defined by PCWG2 with two or more new lesions on bone scan.

        Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl [1.74 nmol/l]).

        Patients must have undergone orchiectomy, or have been on LHRH agonists or antagonists, for
        at least 3 months prior to drug initiation. Patients on LHRH agonists/antagonists must

             corticosteroids are acceptable, including steroids with very low solubility
             administered nasally for local effects only (e.g. Nasonex®)

          4. Any growth factors (e.g. GM-CSF, G-CSF, erythropoietin).

          5. Interferon or interleukin therapy

        Other investigational drugs or investigational therapy if the patient is currently taking
        those drugs/therapy, or if they have received the drugs/therapy within 4 weeks prior to the
        start of study treatment.

        Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or
        immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.

        Significant cardiovascular disease.

        Active bleeding disorders or evidence of chronic or acute disseminated intravascular
        coagulation (DIC).
