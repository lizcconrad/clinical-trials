  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucomannan (GNN), a water-soluble dietary fiber derived from the plant Amorphophallus
      konjac, is marketed for weight reduction. The exact mechanisms by which GNN might exert its
      actions are unclear. Nonetheless, it has been shown that GNN slows gastric emptying by
      forming a viscous gel of large volume, which increases the feeling of satiety. Current
      evidence on the effectiveness of GNN for weight reduction is sparse, and well-designed trials
      performed in children are needed to assess the efficacy of this modality. We aim to
      systematically evaluate the efficacy of GNN consumption for the management of overweight and
      obesity in children.

      Methods and analysis

      Children aged 6 to 17 years with overweight and obesity (based on the WHO growth criteria)
      will be randomly assigned to receive GNN or placebo (maltodextrin) (both at a dose of 3
      g/day) for 3 months and will be followed up for 3 months. Prior to the intervention, all
      children will receive dietetic advice, and they will be encouraged to engage in physical
      activity. The primary outcome measure will be the BMI-for-age z-score difference between the
      groups at the end of the intervention.
