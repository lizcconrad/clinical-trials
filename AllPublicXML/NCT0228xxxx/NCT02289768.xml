    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this vehicle-controlled study is to determine the efficacy and safety of
      a solution of Actikerall® (containing 5-fluorouracil 0.5% and salicylic acid 10.0%) in the
      field-directed treatment of grade I-II actinic keratosis, when it is applied to the affected
      area once daily for 12 weeks.

      A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Actikerall® solution on
      subclinical actinic keratosis lesions in a subset of patients.

             study requirements.

          -  Patients with at least 4 but not more than 10 clinically confirmed actinic keratoses
             lesions grade I or II (according to Olsen EA et al. 1991) within a field of
             cancerization of 25 cm² in the face/forehead or bald scalp.

          -  Patients with skin type I to IV (according to Fitzpatrick Skin Types)

          -  Patients free of any significant physical abnormalities (e.g., tattoos, dermatoses) in

             evaluation.

          -  Patients in good health condition or free of medical conditions that may interfere
             with the study results as confirmed by a physical examination, medical history and
             laboratory analysis.

          -  Patients who accept to refrain from sunbathing, intense UV-light exposure and the
             solarium during the study duration.

          -  Subjects that have currently malignant or benign tumors of the skin within the

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the trial drugs (5-fluorouracil,
             salicylic acid), to ingredients of the trial formulation, or to drugs of similar
             chemical classes

          -  Subjects with allergy against dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol, ethyl acetate, pyroxyline,
