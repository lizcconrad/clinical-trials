    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer as one of the most common gastrointestinal cancers, radical resection of
      primary lesions combined with dissection of regional lymph-nodes is acknowledged by surgeons
      all over the world. When compared with the advanced upper third gastric cancer, proximal
      gastrectomy has been acknowledged as the standard therapeutic strategy for the early gastric
      cancer located in the upper third of the stomach. However, due to abandon the anti-reflux
      barrier of the digestive system caused by the dissection of the cardia and the lower
      esophageal sphincter, the belching、hiccup、Acid reflux、heartburn、chest pain symptoms and as
      well as the reflux esophagitis caused by the traditional esophagostomy permanently influence
      the postoperative quality of life for those patients. Nowadays, relationship between the
      digestive track reconstruction for proximal gastrectomy and the postoperative quality of life
      is still with controversies. Previous study reported the gastric tube anastomosis can
      minimize the reflux related symptoms when compared with traditional esophagogastrostomy.
      There still exited some patients need long-term anti-acid drug to control the reflux symptoms
      although underwent the gastric tube anastomosis. The double-track anastomosis for proximal
      gastrectomy may successfully control the reflux symptoms and there existed study found it is
      as safe as the esophagostomy. But there has no randomized control study to compare the
      postoperative quality of life between the gastric tube anastomosis and double-track
      anastomosis for proximal gastrectomy.

      By the reasons above, a randomized controlled trial is conducted with the intention to
      compare the intraoperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity and the postoperative
      quality of life between the esophagogastrostomy and the double-track anastomosis in the
      proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients.

      Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

        1. Preoperative evaluation Patients satisfied with inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
           informed to join in the clinical study and signature the inform consent.

        2. Randomization: Intraoperative evaluation found that R0, proximal gastrectomy can be
           performed, the case will entrance into the Randomization period. Random numbers are
           computer-generated, with the third party applications.

        3. Surgical procedures: The surgical treatments is adopted the proximal gastrectomy
           according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer treatments guidelines, 2010, Version 3. Group A
           take the gastric tube anastomosis and Group B take the double-track anastomosis (the
           reconstruction method is described in the intervention section of study groups). The two
           study will take the similar surgical procedures except for the digestive track
           reconstruction.

        4. Postoperative recovery: Postoperative recovery period need to collect those relevant
           parameters of all the patients. All the relevant parameters had definitely definition in
           the Case Report Form of this study which included the preoperative, intraoperative and
           postoperative clinicopathologic characteristics.

        5. Follow-up: The follow-up of this study divide into two parts, the postoperative quality
           of life and tumor characteristics outcomes. The information of the postoperative quality
           of life is collected by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
           (EORCT) QLQ-C30 and STO-22 questionnaires. At the postoperative 12 moths, the upper
           gastrointestinal scope is needed to examine the reflux esophagitis and the remnant
           gastritis according to Los Angeles Classification of esophagitis. The tumor related
           outcomes included long-term postoperative complications, recurrence type, relapse free
           survival (months) and the overall survival (months).

    <description>In the gastric tube group, the lesser curvature of the gastric remnant approximately 3 cm proximal to the pylorus was removed first by a linear stapling device. An approximately 5-cm-wide tubular stomach was then constructed with preserved right gastric vessels. The length of the tube was consistent with the greater curvature of the residual stomach. The reconstructed gastric tube was lastly anastomosed with the proximal esophageal end.
