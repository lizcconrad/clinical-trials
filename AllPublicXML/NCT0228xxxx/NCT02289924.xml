    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this non-interventional cohort field study are to evaluate
      effectiveness of Eylea and to describe follow-up as well as treatment patterns in patients
      with wAMD (wet age-related macular degeneration) in routine clinical practice in Italy for a
      study population of &quot;naïve&quot; patients
