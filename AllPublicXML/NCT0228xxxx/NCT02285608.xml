    <textblock>
      Investigators are doing this study to examine if a new personalized education program for
      patients with mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorders) will help them take their
      medications as prescribed by doctors. Investigators will teach patients about how, when and
      why it is important for them to take their medications as prescribed. Also, investigators
      will ask patients why they do not take medications as prescribed. Furthermore, investigators
      will examine whether our education program might save money if it prevents problems related
      to not taking medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of anti-depressants or lithium reported in clinical trials differs from clinical
      experience. Various factors such as non-adherence to treatment and poor tolerability to
      medications have been related to treatment non-response or treatment failure in mood
      disorders (major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder). Premature discontinuation of
      treatment for mood disorders is common. The long treatments, the patients' beliefs about
      medications, the lack of knowledge about the medication/treatment purpose, benefits, dosage,
      and side effects and the relationship between patient and healthcare providers affect
      treatment continuation.

      Investigators are proposing a sequential explanatory mixed methods study to investigate a
      novel program for medication training in persons with mood disorders. The ultimate purpose of
      the program is to improve medication adherence in these persons. The primary component of the
      present study will be quantitative, i.e., a randomized controlled trial with 12 months of
      follow-up to examine the effect of one-on-one medication training, including the use of a
      checklist system, on medication adherence in patients with mood disorders. The training
      program will include education to improve patients' knowledge regarding their medication's
      purpose, dosage, benefits, and side effects. The program will also include tools like a
      checklist or alarm clock to remind patients of when and how to take their medication.
      Furthermore, the program will contain an interactive listening period where healthcare
      professionals involved in medication dispensing will listen to patients' concerns, questions
      and thoughts regarding their medications. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, no
      research has comprehensively examined whether one-on-one medication training, as described
      above, may improve medication adherence in patients with mood disorders.

    <description>Investigators will adopt a healthcare system perspective and compare the costs of first re-hospitalization between each study group. When a participant is re-hospitalized for the first time at any point during the 12-month follow-up period, investigators will conduct a chart review of the entire re-hospitalization to identify all of the direct and indirect medical resources consumed during this re-hospitalization. The chart review will cover the entire length of the re-hospitalization, even if this length exceeds the 12-month follow-up period for the participant in question.</description>

    <description>Partnership in Medication Management (PIMM): The nurse and the attending physician will meet with the patient and ask how s/he administers medication at home (i.e., blister pack). Initial education session: the nurse will teach the patient about his/her medications, dosage, purpose, when and how to take them. Nurse and patient will establish reminders to take his/her medication. Following the education session, patients will be required to notify the nurse when it is time to take their medications, where their medications are, dosage, purpose and side effects. Self-Administered Medication (SAM): Patients will transition to SAM once the clinical team feels that no further medication changes are required. SAM is also the model that the participants will follow after discharge.</description>
