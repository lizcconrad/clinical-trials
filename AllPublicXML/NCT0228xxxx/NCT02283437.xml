    <textblock>
      This proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of a problem-solving
      based bibliotherapy program (PSBBP) for Chinese family caregivers in schizophrenia spectrum
      disorders. A repeated-measures, three-group design will be used to evaluate and compare the
      effects between two treatment groups(PSBBP and psycho-education group) and routine outpatient
      service and family support(control group) for 129 randomly selected family caregivers of
      outpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders over a 12-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family caregivers of people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders are confronted by a various
      physical, psychosocial and financial hardships. This can adversely affect family members'
      caregiving experiences, psychological distress, general well-being, and family relationships
      or emotional involvement, which in turn may contribute to a greater risk of patient relapse
      and non-recovery. While family psycho-education and mutual support groups are effective in
      reducing caregivers' burden of care, these approaches usually require regular meetings and
      encounter difficulties in extensive training of group leaders/facilitators and engaging
      participants to actively share their caregiving experiences due to time inconvenience and
      fear/inability of expression of feelings. By virtue of the above, an alternate model of
      self-help program in book form named bibliotherapy, which is a guided reading and
      self-practice program with problem-solving training facilitated by a psychiatric nurse, has
      recently demonstrated evidences in clinical trials for families of depressive and psychotic
      patients by the research team, and other researchers.

      This proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of a problem-solving
      based bibliotherapy program (PSBBP) for Chinese family caregivers in schizophrenia spectrum
      disorders. A repeated-measures, three-group design will be used to evaluate and compare the
      effects between two treatment groups(PSBBP and psycho-education group) and routine outpatient
      service and family support(control group) for 129 randomly selected family caregivers of
      outpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders over a 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomes
      include caregivers' burden of care, caregiving experiences and coping and social
      problem-solving skills using validated instruments. Secondary outcomes are patients' mental
      state, functioning, perceived expressed emotion, and re-hospitalization rate. They will be
      measured at recruitment, one week, and 6 and 12 months following the interventions.
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be used to analyze the relative risks of
      re-hospitalizations amongst the treatment and control groups over 12-month follow-up. It is
      hypothesized that the PSBBP participants will produce significantly better improvements in
      caregivers' perceived burden, caregiving experience and coping and problem-solving skills
      than those in psycho-education and control groups over 12-month follow-up.

      Focus group interviews will be conducted after the first post-test with 20 caregivers (10
      participants per group) in both treatment groups. Their data will be content analyzed to
      identify their perceived benefits, limitations and difficulties encountered and therapeutic
      ingredients of the two programs. With significant positive outcomes found in the PSBBP, this
      program will be adopted by community mental healthcare services in Hong Kong, and replicated
      in other Asian countries, to improve family-based care in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

      Study Objectives:

      This controlled trial tests the effects of the PSBBP on family caregivers' and patients'
      outcomes over a 12-month follow-up, when compared with those in a psycho-education group or
      routine family services for outpatients. Primary outcomes include caregivers' burden of care,
      coping and problem-solving skills. It will test two hypotheses that, comparing with those in
      psycho-education/routine care, the PSBBP will indicate significantly:

        -  greater reduction of caregivers' perceived burden and improvements in coping and social
           problem-solving skills and caregiving experiences at 1-week, 6-month and/or 12-month
           follow-ups; and

        -  greater improvements in patients' mental state, psychosocial functioning, perceived
           expressed emotion, and re-hospitalization rate at the three follow-ups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Burden of Care</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers' perceived burden of care will be measured by a Chinese version of the 25-item Family Burden Interview Schedule. It assesses the caring burden perceived by family members in taking care of the patient at home. It is comprised of six categories (2-6 items per category), including familial finance, routine, leisure activities, interactions, and physical and mental health. Total scores range from 0-50; a higher score will indicate a greater caring burden. The Chinese version of the scale indicated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.87) and high inter-rater reliability (Pearson's r= 0.75-0.99) in families of schizophrenia sufferers in Hong Kong.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Coping Style</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A Chinese version of Coping style of the caregivers style will be assessed using the 42-item Revised Ways of Coping Checklist. It composes of a problem-focused coping(15 items) and three emotion-focused coping scales, including 'self-blame' (3 items), 'wishful thinking'(8 items) and 'avoidance'(10 items), and a subscale 'seeking social support'(6 items). Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, from '0-never' to '4-all the time', higher scores indicating greater uses of those coping strategies. It has demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.62-0.85) in students.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Problem-Solving Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of Revised (Short) Social Problem-Solving Inventory. It contains 25 items, assessing 2 domains of social problem-solving, including problem-solving style(3 subscales- rational problem solving, impulsive/careless style and avoidance style), and problem-solving orientation (2 subscales- positive and negative problem orientation). It has demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.68-0.81) and concurrent validity with a few coping scales in Hong Kong adolescents.[</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Experience of Caregiving</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of Experience of Caregiving Inventory is a 66-item self-reporting scale that measures experiences of caregiving to a family member with mental illness based on the Transactional model of stress-appraisal-coping. It consists of 10 subscales measuring negative (e.g., difficult behaviors, stigma and problems with services) and positive aspects (positive personal experience and aspects of relationship) of caregiving, being rated on a 5-point Likert scale ('0-never' to '4-nearly always'). It indicates satisfactory content validity and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.60-0.85); higher scores on negative/positive (reverse-coded) subscale indicate a more negative appraisals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental State</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' mental state will be evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, a 30-item inventory assessing the absence/severity of psychotic symptoms across positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psycho-pathology symptoms. Each item is scored on a scale, ranging from '1- absent' to '7- extreme', and the scale has demonstrated good inter-rater reliability (Intra-class correlation= 0.88) and good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.87-0.93), and concurrent and predictive validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The 43-item Specific Level of Functioning Scale will be used to assess 3 functional domains for patients with schizophrenia, including physical functioning/personal care (12 items), social functioning (14 items) and community living skills (17 items) on a 5-point Likert scale. The Chinese version was validated among patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, indicating satisfactory content validity, test-retest reliability (Pearson's r=0.76) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.88-0.96).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Expressed Emotion</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived expressed emotion by patients will be measured by Level of Expressed Emotion scale. The scale comprises 4 domains: intrusiveness, attitude toward illness, tolerance/expectancy, and emotional responses; each consists of 15 items on a 4-point Likert scale ('1-Not true' to '4-True'). The Chinese version has indicated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.80-0.90) and test-retest reliability (r= 0.87-0.93)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate &amp; Length of Rehospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The data of patients' frequency and lengths (days) of psychiatric hospitalizations over the intervention period, and 12-month follow-ups, will be recorded by the research assistant by reviewing the electronic patient record (ePR) at outpatient clinics.</description>
