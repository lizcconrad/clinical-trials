    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation for colonoscopy is crucial, since the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure
      depends on an adequate visualization of the mucosa of the colon.There is strong evidence that
      the quality of bowel preparation is inversely correlated with the interval between the end of
      the assumption of the purgative and the start of colonoscopy (shorter intervals are
      associated with higher levels of preparation).Recent studies have shown that split dose prep
      significantly improves the quality of bowel cleansing. In light of these data, both the
      American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal
      Endoscopy (ESGE) recommend now split dose prep in order to improve the quality of bowel
      cleansing. Despite these recommendations, the uptake of schemes in divided doses appears
      clearly underused in actual clinical practice. In particular, in Italy only a few centers
      routinely adopt the regime split as their first choice for the preparation for
      colonoscopy.The reasons why the &quot;split dose&quot; is under-utilized in clinical practice are not
      entirely clear, but probably in part reflecting gastroenterologists' concerns about potential
      elements that theoretically could make it less acceptable to the patient (get up early in the
      morning, potential problems during the journey from home to the hospital) The hypothesis of
      the study is that many patients would still be willing to accept these potential drawbacks if
      they were adequately informed about the positive impact of the scheme in divided doses on the
      effectiveness of bowel preparation, which results in higher reliability of the examination,
      shorter duration of the procedure, and less risk of rescheduling the exam in the near future
