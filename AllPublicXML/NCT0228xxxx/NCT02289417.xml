  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      apremilast (30 mg twice daily [BID] and 40 mg BID), compared with placebo, in subjects with
      active Ulcerative Colitis (UC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group,study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of apremilast in subjects
      with active UC (defined as a total Mayo score [TMS] of ≥ 6 to ≤ 11, with an endoscopic
      subscore ≥ 2). Treatment assignment will be stratified based on concomitant use of oral
      corticosteroids and previous exposure to immunosuppressants (eg, 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP],
      azathioprine [AZA], or methotrexate [MTX]).The number of subjects with previous exposure to
      immunosuppressants is targeted to comprise no more than 50% of the subjects enrolled, and no
      less than 30%.

      Approximately 165 subjects (55 subjects per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive oral apremilast (30 mg BID or 40 mg BID), or identically appearing placebo BID for up
      to 12 weeks (Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase), followed by 40 weeks of blinded active
      treatment with apremilast, either 30 mg BID or 40 mg BID (Blinded Active-treatment Phase).

      At the end of 52 weeks in the study, subjects who have a Mayo endoscopy score ≤ 1 will have
      the opportunity to participate in the Extension Phase and will continue to receive blinded,
      active treatment with apremilast for an additional 52 weeks.

      All subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study for any reason will spend 4 weeks in
      the Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase, the 4-week period after following the last
      dose of investigational product (study treatment).

    <description>Clinical remission is defined as TMS ≤ 2 points, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point. The TMS is a widely accepted standard for the evaluation of patients with UC and is commonly used as an endpoint in clinical trials. It consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease:
Stool Frequency Subscore (SFS)
Rectal Bleeding Subscore (RBS)
Endoscopy Subscore
