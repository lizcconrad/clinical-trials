  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is characterized by a six- to eight-fold
      raise in plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations and atherosclerotic coronary artery
      disease usually occur before the age of 20 if untreated. Lipid apheresis (LA) has been proved
      to be a reliable method to decrease LDL-C concentrations and therefore decrease
      cardiovascular disease risk in HoFH. The objective of this crossover study was to compare
      efficacy of LA performed with heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation to dextran
      sulfate adsorption on the reduction of lipids, inflammatory markers, adhesion molecules and
      LDL particles size in a cohort of HoFH subjects.
