  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the effect of a therapeutic education program in addition
      of a hydrotherapeutic cure on obese patients.

      The therapeutic education program at the thermal baths of Brides-les-Bains is composed of a
      dietary follow-up, a physical activities program, working group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants are people that come to the thermal baths in order to follow an
      hydrotherapeutic cure (of about 3 weeks). For the Action group, they also follow a course of
      therapeutic education where they are given advices on how they should eat and have a regular
      physical activity.

      This therapeutic education in addition of the hydrotherapeutic cure should help them lose
      weight and not gain in again.

      The participants are followed for 18 months (17 months after leaving the thermal baths).
