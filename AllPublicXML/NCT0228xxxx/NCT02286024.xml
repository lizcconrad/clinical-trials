    <textblock>
      Depression is a debilitating illness with a risk of developing a treatment resistant form.
      Currently, diagnosis is purely clinical with little features available to identify
      potentially adverse developments. Clinical features such as early onset age, prolonged
      episodes, anxiety, somatic symptoms and apathy are all arguments raising fears the onset of
      resistance to conventional treatments. According to neuroimaging knowledge about the
      pathophysiological mechanisms, involving front-limbic functional networks supporting the
      functions of emotional regulation and reward system, recent work has focused on the
      identification of neuroimaging biomarkers predicting therapeutic response. Among the regions
      of interest identified, the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and regions
      participating in the Default Mode Network Training (Medial prefrontal cortex, posterior
      cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobe) are most frequently areas associated with the
      prediction of therapeutic response. Limitations most reported in these studies are the
      heterogeneity of experimental paradigms (resting state, cognitive or emotional functional
      tasks), imaging (PET scan, MRI) the heterogeneity of clinical resistance criteria forms
      studied, different techniques (as that we consider remission (threshold score) or response
      (50% decrease from baseline score), and the sample size. Knowing that MRI into daily clinical
      practice in the SHU of Adult Psychiatry, as the balance sheet of the disease, monitoring its
      evolution, as in assumption rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) (pretreatment
      assessment and neuro), the identification of neuroimaging biomarkers in a population of
      patients with clinical criteria of Mood Depressive Episode, with an acquisition of identical
      and reproducible image daily routine methodology appears to be a reliable way to correct the
      heterogeneity of conventionally published studies on the topic. This study aim to identify,
      in routine care, predictive clinical and neuroimaging markers of poor outcome in major
      depressive disorder.

      The main objective is to assess neuroimaging biomarkers like cortical thickness predictive of
      poor outcome in major depressive disorder.

      Secondary objectives are :

        -  Identifying neuroimaging biomarker like Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) predictive of poor
           outcome in major depressive disorder;

        -  Identifying morphological biomarker like volumetric abnormalities (Voxel Based
           Morphometry - VBM), other than the cortical thickness, predictive of poor outcome in
           major depressive disorder;

        -  Identifying clinical features (sociodemographic, clinical dimensions such as apathy or
           anxiety) predictive of poor outcome of depression.

      This study expect to assess on a large population of patients:

        -  Clinical and neuroimaging markers (morphological and perfusion) predictive of poor
           outcome in major depressive disorder, allowing early identification of patients at risk
           of poor therapeutic response. These markers should allow a better stratification of
           patients;

        -  A better characterization of pathophysiological processes involved in major depressive
           disorder at different stages of the illness;

        -  Development of innovative technologies such as treatment with repetitive transcranial
           magnetic stimulation, or neurofeedback using real time fMRI, on both aspects of
           evaluation of the effectiveness and optimization of procedures.

      Such a study would open up on thinking in terms of therapeutic management. Indeed, recurrent
      and potentially resistant forms and screened using such predictive neuroimaging biomarkers
      could serve more specific therapeutic approaches in a preventive approach.
