      Objective: To conduct a comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness study of an
      evidence-based fall prevention program—Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance (TJQMBB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two evidence-based exercise
      programs (Multimodal Exercise,TJQMBB) relative to stretching, a proxy for a minimum practice
      standard, in reducing falls among older adults at risk of falling.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the number of falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a daily diary &quot;fall calendar,&quot; falls reported by participants across the 24-week surveillance period will be collected, starting from the date of first intervention class and continuing until participants withdrew, had died or were lost to follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Reach</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>assessing the maximal distance (in inch) participants one can reach forward, beyond arm's length, while maintaining a fixed based of support in the standing position. Differences between baseline and 6 months scores will be calculated to assess change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instrumented Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>assessing the time to complete a series of functional tasks (sit-to-stand, 180 degree turn, turn-to-sit.) while walking through a 7-meter walkway (7 meters towards a line, turn, and 7 meters towards the chair). The measure is assessed in second. Differences between baseline and 6 months scores will be calculated to assess change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The physical performance measure consists of 4-meter walk at usual pace, a timed repeated chair stand, and 3 increasingly difficult standing balance tests. Each measure is assigned a categorical score ranging from 0 (inability to complete the test) to 4 (best performance). A summary score ranging from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performances) will be calculated by summing the 3 components scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (in points). Differences between baseline and 6 months scores will be calculated to assess change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost per fall prevented</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>determined by calculating total intervention cost estimates divided by number of falls observed during the 6 month intervention.</description>
