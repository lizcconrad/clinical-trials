    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment During the Induction Period Due to Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of the first dose of IP until 28 days after the last dose of IP during induction and SAEs made known to the investigator any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP; maximum treatment duration during induction was 3.9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) that occurred or worsened on or after the day of the first dose of the investigational product through 28 days after the last dose of IP. In addition, any SAE with an onset date more than 28 day after the last dose of IP that was assessed by the investigator as related to IP was considered a TEAE. A participant met the primary endpoint if: an AE was the reason for discontinuation as recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and the participant had no doses administered beyond Cycle 4. 95% confidence interval for the percentage was calculated using the Clopper Pearson method.</description>

          <description>During the induction period, participants received 4 cycles of nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle and carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) = 5 mg*min/mL IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles. In the absence of clinical or radiological disease progression, participants received monotherapy with nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 by intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

          <title>Stage of Disease at Enrollment</title>
          <description>Disease stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. Disease stages range from 0 (not spread) to IV (spread throughout the body). Stage 0 - the cancer has not spread beyond the inner lining of the lung Stage I - the cancer is small and hasn't spread to the lymph nodes Stage II - the cancer has spread to some lymph nodes near the original tumor Stage III - the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or spread to far away lymph nodes Stage IV - the cancer has spread to other organs of the body such as the other lung, brain, or liver.</description>

        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) that occurred or worsened on or after the day of the first dose of the investigational product through 28 days after the last dose of IP. In addition, any SAE with an onset date more than 28 day after the last dose of IP that was assessed by the investigator as related to IP was considered a TEAE. A participant met the primary endpoint if: an AE was the reason for discontinuation as recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and the participant had no doses administered beyond Cycle 4. 95% confidence interval for the percentage was calculated using the Clopper Pearson method.</description>
        <time_frame>From date of the first dose of IP until 28 days after the last dose of IP during induction and SAEs made known to the investigator any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP; maximum treatment duration during induction was 3.9 months</time_frame>

        <title>Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time in months from day 1 of treatment to the date of disease progression based on the investigatorâs assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria (documented by radiological assessment) or death (any cause) on or prior to the clinical cut-off date, which ever occurred earlier. RECIST V1.1 criteria includes: - Complete Response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; - Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline; - Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease (PD); - Progressive Disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir</description>
        <time_frame>From Day 1 of study drug treatment to the date of disease progression; up to the clinical cut-off date of 24 February 2017; maximum treatment duration on study was 14.1 months</time_frame>

        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse event or serious adverse event that occurred or worsened on or after the day of the first dose of the IP through 28 days after the last dose of IP. In addition, any SAE with an onset date more than 28 day after the last dose of IP that was assessed by the investigator as related to IP was considered a TEAE.

      <restrictive_agreement>Results from a center cannot be submitted for publication before results of multicenter study are published unless it is more than one year since study completion. Then, Investigator can publish if manuscript is submitted to Celgene sixty days prior to submission. If Celgene decides publication would hinder drug development, Investigator must delay submission for up to ninety day and must delete confidential information before submission or defer publication to permit patent applications.</restrictive_agreement>
