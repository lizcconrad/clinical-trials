      Purpose :Research into the impact of Qiliqiangxin capsule on IFN-γ，IL-4，NT-proBNP in dilated
      cardiomyopathy patients with heart failure.

      Methods :Data were collected from the patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (
      cardiac function NYHA Ⅱ-Ⅳ) in the first affiliated hospital of Harbin Medical University from
      May 2012 to April 2014. These 30 cases were treated under the recommendations of normal
      diagnosis and treatment in cardiomyopathy. This experiment was randomized double-blinded，the
      experimental interferences were avoided and patients were divided into the experimental group
      and the placebo group. The patients in experimental group received the relevant tests and
      inspections before the beginning of experiment，signed the informed consent. Then the
      investigators get the venous blood centrifugalization and cryopreservation. The patients take
      the medicine qiliqiangxin three times per day，four tablets at a time. Afrer a month，the
      investigators evaluated the symptoms，the function of heart，blood pressure，heart rate and keep
      blood specimens. Three and six month later，electrocardiogram and echocardiography were taken
      and the determination of the NT - proBNP was done. The placebo group was followed up in the
      same way.
