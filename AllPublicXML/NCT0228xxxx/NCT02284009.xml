    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multicentre
      study of 52 weeks treatment duration. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy(on
      endogenous insulin secretion), safety and tolerability of weekly albiglutide (a glucagon-like
      peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist) versus placebo when added to insulin therapy in subjects
      with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (NOT1DM) and residual insulin production..
      Approximately 68 eligible subjects will be randomised in a 3:1 ratio such that 51 subjects
      receive albiglutide 30 milligram (mg) once weekly (with increase to 50 mg once weekly at Week
      6 if the 30-mg weekly dose is tolerated) added-on to insulin therapy and 17 subjects receive
      placebo once weekly added-on to insulin therapy. The total duration of a subject's
      participation will be approximately 72 weeks (up to 8 weeks of Screening, 52 weeks of
      treatment and 12 weeks of Post-treatment Follow-up)

             Documentation of the diagnosis of T1DM (and not just insulin deficiency), including
             the date of diagnosis, must be obtained from the diagnosing physician.

          -  Currently requires insulin for T1DM treatment, or has required insulin therapy for
             T1DM (for &gt;=7 days) between the date of diagnosis and the first dose of study drug.

             will not be eligible.

          -  Positive for at least one of the following autoantibodies typically associated with
             T1DM: antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibody to protein tyrosine
             phosphatase-like protein (anti-IA-2) or an insulin autoantibody (IAA). Please note: A
             subject who is positive for IAA and negative for the other autoantibodies will not be
             eligible if the subject has been using insulin for a total of &gt;=7days.

             criteria defined below) from at least 14 days prior to the first dose of randomised
             study medication until the 12-week post-treatment Follow-up visit : Abstinence from

             hyperadrenalism, coeliac disease etc) that in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             pose additional risk in administering study medication or trial participation

          -  Female subject is pregnant (confirmed by laboratory testing) or lactating

          -  Known allergy to any GLP-1 analogue, insulin, or excipients of albiglutide

             However, short courses of oral steroids (single dose or multiple doses for up to 7
             days) may be permitted provided these cases are discussed with the medical monitor.

             are allowed

          -  Receipt of any investigational drug within the 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
