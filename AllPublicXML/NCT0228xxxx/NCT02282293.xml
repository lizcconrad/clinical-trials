    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of 200 HIV-infected pregnant women
      living in Tororo, Uganda, an area of high malaria transmission. HIV-infected pregnant women
      between 12 and 28 weeks gestation will be randomized to receive enhanced malaria
      chemoprevention with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) versus monthly DP placebo.
      Their HIV-exposed children will receive the same prevention regimen from 2 to 24 months of
      age to which the mothers were randomized. All women will receive daily
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) throughout the study per Uganda Ministry of Health
      guidelines. Children will also receive daily TS from 6 weeks to 24 months of age. TS will be
      considered a study drug only in infants and children beginning 6 weeks after cessation of
      breastfeeding and upon exclusion of HIV infection. Women and their children will be followed
      for 36 months after delivery. In a subset of the study population, the investigators will
      conduct an intensive pharmacokinetic study that will evaluate pharmacokinetic exposure of DP
      and EFV. The investigators will also measure HIV-related outcomes among the women enrolled in
      the study. The investigators will test the hypothesis that for HIV-infected mothers and
      HIV-exposed infants, that enhanced versus standard malaria chemoprevention in HIV-infected
      pregnant women and their children will reduce the incidence of malaria among children from 0
      to 24 months of age and improve the development of naturally acquired antimalarial immunity.

      Pregnant women will be scheduled to be seen in the study clinic every 4 weeks during their
      pregnancy. Women will be seen at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 3 months postpartum and every 3 months
      thereafter. In addition, pregnant women will be instructed to come to the study clinic for
      all their medical care and avoid the use of any outside medications. Women will be provided
      all routine HIV care at the clinic according to Uganda MOH guidelines. All women will have
      ARVs and TS dispensed at the study clinic. Counseling on breastfeeding and infant feeding
      will be provided per Uganda MOH guidelines. HIV care and breastfeeding and infant feeding
      recommendations may be changed to reflect the most recent standard of care per MOH
      guidelines. Children will be scheduled to be seen in the clinic every 4 weeks and parents
      /guardians of children will be instructed to bring their child to the study clinic for all
      medical care and avoid the use of any outside medications. The study clinic will remain open
      7 days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

      Each time a study participant is seen in the clinic a standardized history and physical exam
      will be performed. Patients who are febrile (tympanic temperature &gt; 3 8.0ËšC) or report
      history of fever in the past 24 hours will have blood obtained by finger prick for a thick
      blood smear. If the thick blood smear is positive, the patient will be diagnosed with
      malaria. If the thick blood smear is negative, the patient will be managed by study
      physicians for a non-malarial febrile illness. If the patient is afebrile and does not report
      a recent fever, a thick blood smear will not be obtained, except when following routine
      testing schedules.

      Routine assessments will be done in the clinic every 4 weeks for both pregnant women and
      children. Pregnant women and children will receive standards of care as designated in the
      Uganda MOH guidelines. Children will have care for HIV-exposed children according to MOH
      guidelines, with the exception that TS will be continued until 2 years of life. Routine care
      in children will use Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. During
      routine assessments subjects will be asked about visits to outside health facilities and the
      use of any medications outside the study protocol. Standardized assessment of adherence will
      also be done for study drugs administered at home and Insecticide Treated Net use. A routine
      history and physical exam will be performed using a standardized clinical assessment form.
      Blood will be collected by finger prick for thick smear, collection of plasma for PK studies,
      and filter paper samples. Phlebotomy for routine laboratory tests (CBC and ALT) to monitor
      for potential adverse events from study medications and for immunology studies will be
      performed every 8 weeks in pregnant women and every 16 weeks in children. Non malaria
      screening will also include stool ova and parasite examination, circulating filarial antigens
      (by ICT card for Wucheria), and blood smear for microfilaremia (including Mansonella
      perstans) using Knott's technique. For pregnant women and children 2-24 months of age, study
      drugs will be administered at the time of each routine visit.
