  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During LA in retinal surgery there is some problem as regard the lack of anaesthesia duration
      and unexpected globe movement .so many adjuvant was added to LA to overcome this
      disadvantages of LA such as clonidine and fentanyl .

      The investigators hypothesis is adding dexmedetomidine to pribulbal blocking LA will prolong
      anaesthesia duration and improve globe akinesia and decrease intraoperative supplementation
      of LA.There are Many studies had described the effects of dexmedetomidine on peripheral nerve
      blocks, spinal but up to date no knowledge is available on the impact of dexmedetomidine
      adjuvant to local anaesthetic in ophthalmic surgery

    <description>A block was considered satisfactory when complete akinesia occurred. In the absence of complete akinesia in any direction after 10 min, supplementary anesthesia given by a further injection of 2-4 ml of the test solution in the same manner as given before. Calculate the number of patients needed supplemental block were. The surgeon assessed the duration of surgery anesthesia and akinesia. Intraocular pressure measured before block, immediately after block and before surgical procedures</description>

â€¢ The haemodynamic parameters (MAP and HR) will be continuously measured, and will be recorded at before induction (baseline), one minute after block . after 5 minutes then at the surgical incision, 15-min intervals intraoperatively, the end of surgery and10 and 20 minutes postoperatively.
