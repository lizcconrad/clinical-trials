      ABSTRACT:

      Background: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a second-generation platelet concentrate which
      releases various growth factors that promote tissue regeneration. Metformin (MF), a member of
      biguanide group has been shown to facilitate osteoblast differentiation and thus may exhibit
      a favourable effect on alveolar bone . Current study was designed to evaluate the combined
      efficacy of PRF and 1% MF gel with open flap debridement (OFD) in treatment of intrabony
      defects in chronic periodontitis (CP) subjects.

      Methods: One hundred and twenty subjects with single defects were categorized into four
      treatment groups: OFD alone, OFD with PRF, OFD with 1% MF and OFD + PRF+1% MF. Clinical
      parameters like site specific plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI),
      probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL) and gingival marginal level (GML) were
      recorded at baseline before surgery and 9 months post-operatively. Percentage radiographic
      intra-bony defect depth reduction was evaluated using computer-aided software at baseline and
      9 months.
