    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise produces increases in cardiorespiratory fitness (CF), which constitute a
      protective factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Therefore, aerobic
      exercise is a key strategy to promoting cardiovascular. There is some evidence that aerobic
      high intensity interval training may lead to greater increases in CF compared with continuous
      moderate-intensity training.

      The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of an aerobic high intensity
      training program versus a continuous moderate intensity training program on CF in men 18 to
      44 years.

      Forty-four individuals will be randomly assigned to one of two aerobic training programs on a
      treadmill. Both groups will performed three times a week for eight-weeks (on alternate days).
      Half will run 40 minutes of continuous exercise at an intensity between 65-75% of maximum
      heart rate, and the remaining 22 will complete 21.5 minutes of interval exercise at an
      intensity between 90-95% of maximum heart rate, with recoveries between 50-55 % of maximum
      heart rate. After each session both groups will complete eight strength exercises mainly
      including large muscle groups for two sets and 8-12 repetitions at an intensity equivalent to
      60-70% of one repetition maximum (controlled by perceived effort). Rest between sets will be
      kept between 60 and 90 seconds.

      All participants will be evaluated at the start and completion of the intervention for their
      maximal oxygen consumption, blood pressure, waist circumference, BMI, body composition, and
      steps per week.
