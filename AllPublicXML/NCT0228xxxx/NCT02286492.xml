    <textblock>
      The objective of the program is to provide access to TAS-102 to patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer who are refractory to or failing standard chemotherapy, are new to therapy
      with TAS-102 and in whom therapy with TAS-102 is clinically indicated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to provide expanded access to TAS-102 prior to its commercial
      availability for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated
      with, or are not candidates for fluoropyrimidine-, irinotecan-, and oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, and an
      anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.

      Serious adverse event information (whether or not related to TAS-102) as well as reports of
      pregnancy, overdose, or medication error will reported. In addition, all grades of adverse
      drug reactions (ADRs, adverse events related to study medication) and any adverse event that
      results in treatment discontinuation will be recorded as study data on CRFs.
