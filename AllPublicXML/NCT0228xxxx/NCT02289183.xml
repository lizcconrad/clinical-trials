    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized comparison of the modified delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in
      totally laparoscopic surgery and Billroth-I anastomosis in laparoscopy-assisted surgery for
      distal gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide
      theoretical basis and clinical experience for the extensive application of the modified
      technique. The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life
      quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
