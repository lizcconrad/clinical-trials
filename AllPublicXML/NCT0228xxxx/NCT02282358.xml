  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if the study drug mocetinostat can slow the progression
      of cancer in people who have a mutation in CREBBP or EP300 in the genetic makeup of their
      cancer. The potential side effects of mocetinostat will also be studied.
