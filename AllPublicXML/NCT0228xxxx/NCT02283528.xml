  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who sustain a fracture of the lower jaw are typically treated by wiring the teeth
      together or using small titanium plates and screws to fix the fracture. With either technique
      the upper and lower teeth are held together to ensure that the fracture is held in the
      correct position during healing (for closed reduction) or while the plate and screws are
      applied (for open reduction).

      The teeth can be held together using Erich arch bars which are a type of braces that are
      temporarily wired to the existing teeth. These stay in place for 6 weeks until the fracture
      has healed even though the patient is able to open his mouth immediately after the surgery is
      complete. The alternative to the traditional Erich arch bars is a relatively new type of arch
      bar (Stryker Hybrid) that is screwed to the jaw bone rather than wired to the teeth. The
      purpose of this study is to compare the two types of arch bars in terms of the speed with
      which they can be applied as well as any difference in fracture healing
