  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare changes in follicular ovarian reserve in women before and six months after
      laparoscopic operation: endometrioma stripping surgery. Also, to compare follicular ovarian
      reserve in women with endometrioma(s) with follicular ovarian reserve of healthy infertile
      women of the same age group.

      In order to investigate the impact of laparoscopic stripping surgery on follicular ovarian
      reserve, blood samples will be obtained before the operation, from 2nd to 5th day of the
      menstrual cycle, to determine levels of endocrine markers of ovarian reserve (FSH, E2, AMH
      and Inhibin B). Cancer antigen 125 (CA -125) and IL-6 will be measured also. US markers
      (antral follicular count- AFC) will be obtained at the same time as endocrine markers. All
      laparoscopic stripping surgery will be performed during the early or middle follicular phases
      of menstrual cycle, under general anesthesia, by the same team of gynecological endoscopist.
      The cyst wall will be completely stripped off from the normal ovarian tissue by traction and
      opposite traction with two grasping forceps. Hemostasis will be achieved using bipolar
      forceps electrocoagulation. All endometrioma specimens that will be obtained from operation
      will be submitted for pathology examination. One and six months after the laparoscopic
      cystectomy, from 2nd to 5th day of menstrual cycle, we will determine endocrine markers of
      ovarian reserve and levels of CA 125 and IL-6.

      The control group will be consisted of healthy women with infertility problem. From the
      second to the fifth day of the menstrual cycle we will take blood samples to determinate
      endocrine markers of follicular ovarian reserve: AMH, FSH, E2, Inhibin B.
