      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of GINST on human semen. The study is a
      pilot study, designed as open-label, prospective randomized clinical trial using GINST either
      500mg/capsule (panax ginseng 0.96g/day) or 1000mg/capsule (panax ginseng 1.92g/day), two
      capsules at once, three times a day for 12 weeks. GINST(Ilhwa, Republic of Korea) is a
      dietary supplement capsule, which is made with 6 year-old Korean red ginseng (Panax ginseng).
      Expected participants are to be male partners of female patients who visit infertility clinic
      at Severance hospital, whose total motile sperm count is more than 0.5x106 by semen analysis
      using computer aided sperm analyzer (CASA). Semen analysis, blood test, questionaires are
      planned to be performed 2 times, on the initial visit and after 12weeks of GINST treatment.
      Semen analysis will reveal ejaculated volume, sperm count, motility, morphology, total
      leukocyte count, total motile sperm count, further analysis including sperm chromatin
      assessment to examine the quality of sperm and malondialdehyde (MDA) analysis of seminal
      fluid to assess oxidative stress will be performed. Blood test will be done including serum
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), total and free testosterone.
      Quality of life, sexual performance before and after taking GINST will be evaluated using
      questionaires.
