    <textblock>
      Confocal endomicroscopy is an emerging technique that allows in vivo imaging of cells and
      tissue structures of the gastrointestinal mucosa, with a magnification of about 1000 times,
      guiding optical biopsies in real time. Confocal endomicroscopy represents technique that
      combines conventional white light image with the confocal microscope probe, thereby allowing
      examination of the surface epithelium in vivo and histological diagnosis during endoscopy.
      Among the applications already established for its use, stand out diagnosis of Barrett's
      esophagus, gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, celiac disease, differentiation of
      hyperplastic adenomatous polyps of the colon, microscopic colitis and follow-up of patients
      with inflammatory disease, reducing the need for endoscopic biopsies. The CLE can still
      detect molecular changes effectively improving the endoscopic diagnosis. This pilot project
      consists of 07 subprojects which the technology of confocal endomicroscopia will be evaluated
      and compared with the histological results of biopsy or surgical specimens:

      1. confocal endomicroscopy for the diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia and superficial
      esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus 2 Diagnosis of superficial
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in patients with head and neck cancer by confocal
      endomicroscopy 3 Detect the presence of premalignant lesions in the gastric stump in patients
      with reflux alkaline gastritis after partial gastrectomy 4. detect lesions in the gastric
      mucosa of patients with familial history of gastric cancer 5 Biliary Strictures: differential
      diagnosis by confocal endomicroscopia 6 confocal Endomicroscopy of cystic neoplasms of the
      pancreas 7 Contribution of confocal endomicroscopy for the differential diagnosis of
      colorectal polyps The project aims to deploy the structure of the Confocal endomicroscopy
      Endoscopy ICESP, for performing in vivo histological examinations of the digestive tract,
      biliary tract and pancreas. All research groups involved in the early detection of tumors of
      the esophagus, stomach, biliary tract, pancreas, colon and rectum may benefit from the
      implementation of this methodology.

      Confocal Endomicroscopy procedure: eligible patients which consent to participate in the
      study will be submitted to endoscopic procedures under conscious or deep sedation. The
      patients will receive an intravenous injection of 2.5-5 mL of 10% sodium fluorescein at the
      beginning of the endoscopic procedure. The endoscope will target the area of interest and the
      confocal probe will be passed through the endoscope biopsy channel. The probe will gently and
      perpendicularly touch the mucosal surface of the area of the interest. The images will be
      recorded and a presumptive diagnosis will be made. The area of interest will be biopsied and
      the histology results will be considered the diagnostic gold standard method. We will
      calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the presumptive diagnosis provided by the confocal
      endomicroscopy examination.
