    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase 1 study in adolescents with ADHD and genetic disruptions impacting
      genes in the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) network. The objectives of the study are
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics following single-dose, oral
      administration of NFC-1 and to evaluate safety and tolerability and to obtain evidence for
      the effect of NFC-1 on ADHD severity and global functioning during and following four weeks
      of continuous treatment. Exploratory analyses will be performed to assess effect size of
      specific mGluR-network genes on ADHD based on responsiveness of patients to NFC-1. This study
      will be conducted at a single clinical site, the Jefferson University Hospital PKU
      (Philadelphia, PA).

          3. Patient has been genotyped (CAP/CLIA certified) to determine whether there are
             disruptive mutations in genes within the mGluR-network

          4. Patient has been a non-smoker and/or has not used nicotine or nicotine-containing
             products for at least approximately 6 months

          5. Patient is judged to be in good health, other than having ADHD, based on medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs measurements, and laboratory safety tests
