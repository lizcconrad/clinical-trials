    <textblock>
      The Positive Family Support Project seeks to understand some of the factors that increase
      success for children in early elementary school, such as positive family support at home.
      This study will inform us on ways to help children learn and succeed in school.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transition to elementary school is a critical time for the development of key skills that
      are necessary for school success, including sustained attention, self-regulation, initiating
      and sustaining successful peer relationships, and academic competence. Parent support at
      home, such as positive parenting and support for learning, is associated with school
      readiness indicators that predict successful adaptation to the school context. For many
      children at risk for poor developmental outcomes this transition can be difficult and may
      lead to early academic problems, which in turn may define a trajectory that culminates in
      more severe forms of problem behavior and learning difficulties. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy of implementing the Family Check-Up (FCU), a school-based,
      ecological approach to family intervention, during the transition into elementary school.

    <description>Prior to the feedback session, trained clinicians will observe family interactions by reviewing the video-taped observations and questionnaires filled out by parents. Therapists then use this data to inform the intervention process and provide feedback to parents based on norms for this age period. Feedback sessions will include a discussion of goal attainment and plans to achieve goals, with specific attention to the parent's role in supporting positive behavior. Options for obtaining goals are based on the literature about empirically supported interventions for this age group and include (a) periodic follow-up and support, (b) brief support for change on a specific topic, and (c) community referral (e.g., substance abuse referral; domestic violence referral; referral for individual therapy for depression; referral for family therapy and support for families in conflict).</description>

    <description>Parents fill out questionnaires about their child and families and then participate in a videotaped interaction with their child. Clinicians then observe the video and analyze the questionnaires to establish family needs based on supports, stress, parenting, values, and strengths. Therapists then use this information to inform the intervention process and provide feedback to families with the use of motivational interviewing. parents identify goals for parenting and/or child behavior and to connect them with resources when needed. Feedback includes a discussion of goal attainment and plans to achieve goals. Goal achievement includes options such as (a) periodic follow-up and support, (b) brief support for change on a specific topic, and (c) community referral (e.g., substance abuse referral; domestic violence referral; referral for individual therapy for depression; referral for family therapy and support for families in conflict).</description>
