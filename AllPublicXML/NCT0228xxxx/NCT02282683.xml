  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced (ACCF/AHA stage D) heart failure and hyperuricemia have high one-year
      mortality. Currently, there was no evidence-based therapy such as mechanically assisted
      circulatory support available in China. The investigators found glucocorticoid treatment such
      as prednisone could improve cardiac performance, potentiate renal responsiveness to diuretics
      in such patients. Therefore, it could be used as bridge therapy to help ACE inhibitors or
      beta blocker titration. With its help, most of the patients with stage D heart failure could
      be titrated to higher dose of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers during hospitalization.
      However, the efficacy of long-term, low-dose of prednisone use in such patients with limited
      life expectancy remain unclear. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to observe
      whether putting low-dose of prednisone on the patients with stage D heart failure for long
      term could further improve their survival. All patients will receive prednisone treatment
      during hospitalization and receive maximum tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy
      (GDMT). After discharge from hospital, the patients will be randomized to receive long-term,
      low-dose prednisone treatment or standard GDMT.
