      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Moderato System by
      implanting the Moderato pacemaker in patients who require a dual chamber pacemaker, and who
      also have hypertension, in order to reduce their blood pressure.

    <description>This is an unblinded, treatment only study in which each patient serves as his or her own control.
All patients who meet entry criteria will undergo implantation of the Moderato System. During the first month the pacemaker Performance will be evaluated and an additional 3 month period of treatment for studying the Moderato-HTN therapy effect.</description>

    <intervention_name>The Moderato System</intervention_name>
    <description>The BackBeat Moderato System incorporates traditional pacing modes and algorithms to provide pacing support to patients with all conditions currently indicated for dual chamber pacing. In addition, a special pacing algorithm was developed to reduce blood pressure.</description>
