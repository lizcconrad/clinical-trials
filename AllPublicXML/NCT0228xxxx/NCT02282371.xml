             participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical
             study procedures, e.g. infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,
             social/psychological complications

             consent

          -  Pregnant nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL)

          -  Women Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and
             through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:

             a. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and
             for 16 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in
             this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A condom
             is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the
             drug via seminal fluid b. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women
             physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception
             during the study and through at least 16 weeks after the final dose of study
             treatment. Highly effective contraception is defined as either: i. Total abstinence:
             When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].

        ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case
        of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate
        post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study
        subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient] iv.
        Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

          1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

          2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

          3. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not
             allowed as BYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.
