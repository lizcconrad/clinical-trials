      This is a longitudinal, observational, prospective, multicentre study conducted in
      metropolitan France, among a representative sample of office-based or mixed practice
      rheumatology doctors.

      The aim of this study is to describe in real life, the therapy strategy when faced with a
      patient treated with methotrexate as a monotherapy consulting for rheumatoid arthritis and
      the impact on the progression of the disease at 6 months.
