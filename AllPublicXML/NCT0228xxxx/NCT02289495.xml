  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study, 200207 is a double blind, placebo controlled, single and repeat dose
      escalation study to investigate the safety, tolerability and PK of GSK2838232 alone and when
      co-administered with RTV 100 milligram (mg) Once daily (QD). This study will enable future
      clinical development of GSK2838232 in healthy subjects and in a Phase IIa proof of concept
      study in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients. This study is a single and
      repeat dose escalation study and will be conducted as two Parts. Part A will evaluate
      GSK2838232 20 mg and 50 mg administered QD for 8 days and Part B will evaluate GSK2838232 10
      mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg, co-administered with RTV 100 mg, QD for 11 days. The extended period of
      dosing is to account for the longer terminal phase half-life of GSK2838232 when given with
      RTV. Dose cohorts will be enrolled sequentially; enrollment into a cohort will commence
      following review of interim PK and safety data from at least 4 subjects in the preceding
      cohort. Subjects in both parts will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to first dose
      and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose. Maximum duration of study participation
      will be approximately 7 weeks. Approximately 40 healthy subjects will be enrolled, 8
      subjects/cohort. Subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive GSK2838232 or placebo.
