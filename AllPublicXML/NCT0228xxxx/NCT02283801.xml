             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine or any related products (including excipients of the
             formulations) as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to any
             drugs

          -  Presence of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any other
             conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or predispose to undesired effects

          -  History of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or surgery that may
             affect drug bioavailability, including but not limited to cholecystectomy

          -  Presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic,
             psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic or dermatologic disease

          -  Presence of significant heart disease or disorder according to ECG

          -  Presence or history of significant central nervous system disorder like convulsion or
             depression

          -  Presence or history of significant ocular disease

          -  Maintenance therapy with any drug, or significant history of drug dependency or
             alcohol abuse (&gt; 3 units of alcohol per day, intake of excessive alcohol, acute or
             chronic).
