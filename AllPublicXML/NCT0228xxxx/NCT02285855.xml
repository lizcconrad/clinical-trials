  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving metformin in combination with
      radiation therapy is more effective than radiation therapy alone. In this study, participants
      will receive either metformin or a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study
      drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with
      a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the roll of dice) to receive either metformin or a placebo. This is done because no one
      knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. For every 7
      participants enrolled in this study, 6 will receive metformin and 1 will receive a placebo.

      Only the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo.

      Study Drug/Placebo Administration:

      You will begin taking metformin/placebo 3 weeks before you begin radiation therapy. You will
      take it each week during radiation therapy. You will take the drug/placebo 3 times a day (in
      the morning, at noon, and in the evening).

      To decrease the GI side effects you will start metformin at 1000 mg daily in a divided dose
      (in the morning and in the evening) for 1 week.

      You will keep a log for each time that you take metformin/placebo. You should bring the log
      with you to each study visit.

      You will also receive Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and prednisone to help prevent side effects.

      There will be no change to your radiation therapy. You will receive a separate consent form
      that describes the radiation therapy and its risks.

      Study Visits:

      Every week while you are taking the study drug/placebo, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be
      drawn for routine tests.

      You will have a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan before
      starting metformin/placebo to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug/placebo for up to a total of 2 weeks during radiation
      treatment. You will no longer be able to take the study drug/placebo if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-Up:

      Your medical records will be checked for up to 6 months after your radiation therapy.

      This is an investigational study. Metformin is FDA approved for the treatment of diabetes.
      Its use in this study to be given with radiation therapy to treat lung cancer is
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 70 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Tumor Response Between Metformin and Placebo Cohorts</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Primary objectives to compare tumor response with RECIST versus PERCIST criteria between Metformin and placebo cohorts. Participants undergo a FDG-PET/CT scan at baseline, following 3 weeks of Metformin (for those patients randomized to the Metformin arm) and at 6 months post-SBRT. Response determined at 6 months post-treatment via relative change from pre-treatment tumor SUV of [18F]-FDG-PET after 3 weeks induction Metformin or placebo to the tumor SUV at 6 months post-treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genotype Comparisons of Kras, STK11, and TP53 Mutations</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Mann-Whitney tests used to test for genotype effects within each of three candidate genes and between study arms (control versus metformin treated). Among cohort of patients that present disruptive TP53 mutations, test attains at least 80-96% power to detect a difference in magnitude of at least 1.5 standard deviations between cohorts of patients with activated and inactivated Kras mutations and at least 80-94% power to detect difference in magnitude of at least 1.7 standard deviations between cohorts of patients with functional and inactivated STK11 mutations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control (DC)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks after Metformin Induction</time_frame>
    <description>Objective considers predictive power of pre-treatment glucose utilization with mutation status for resultant metformin disease control (DC) using RECIST and PERCIST criteria. DC for RECIST requires complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or SD after 3 weeks induction metformin. DC for PERCIST requires reduction in tumor SUV of [18F]-FDG-PET after 3 weeks induction metformin. Accuracy of pre-treatment SUV of [18F]-FDG-PET in predicting DC evaluated using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) for each tumor genotype independently and combined. Inference with multivariate logistic regression used to assess effect of pre-treatment SUV of [18F]-FDG-PET in presence of genotype status. Confounders of post-radiation chemotherapy and steroid use adjusted for using linear mixed regression modeling.</description>
