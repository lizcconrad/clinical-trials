  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease with evidence of CTLA-4 involvement. We are
      performing a pilot study for the treatment of new onset or actively progressing vitiligo with
      abatacept to determine if weekly self-injections of medication lead to clinical improvement
      in vitiligo lesions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abatacept has been shown to decrease T cell activity and reduce symptoms associated with
      rheumatoid arthritis. Similar pathways have been shown to be involved in vitiligo. Therefore,
      we are recruiting 10 adult patients with active vitiligo who meet specific inclusion and
      exclusion criteria to receive self-administered injections of abatacept weekly starting at
      week 0 and continuing until week 24. A 32 week follow-up visit will be performed to evaluate
      secondary endpoints as well. We will be monitoring patients to see if skin lesions of
      vitiligo stop spreading and start to repigment with continued treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

             skin lesions of clinically diagnosed vitiligo covering at 5% or great body surface
             area (defined as development of new lesions or worsening of existing lesions within
             the past 6 months) not receiving immune suppressive treatment. Both subjects who have
             received at least one therapy in the past and subjects currently receiving treatment
             at the time of screening will be eligible providing they undergo a wash out period
             prior to starting the study (2 weeks for topical agents and systemic agents with short
             half lives, 1 month for phototherapy)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an acceptable method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 10 weeks after the
             last dose of study drug in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized

          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test result (minimum sensitivity
             25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 0 to 48 hours before the first dose of
             study drug

          -  Women must not be breast-feeding
