      This is a multi-centre, open-label, randomized, parallel trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety profile of saxagliptin and glimepiride treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes
      inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

      Screening will be made to select eligible participants before intervention. The trial will
      include 1-week run-in period of stable doses of metformin (1500mg) and 48-week treatment
      period. After the run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups for
      antihyperglycaemic therapies for a total of 48-weeks: saxagliptin and glimepiride. The
      treatment of saxagliptin will be initiated and maintained at 5mg every morning until the
      completion of the study. Glimepiride will be initially treated with 1 mg every morning, and
      further titrated up at 4-week intervals until to reach the target fasting blood glucose
      (FPG).As to Glimepiride groups, if the fasting blood glucose dose not achieved the target
      after the maximal doses, maintain the maximal doses(6mg per day) until the completion of the
      study.Meanwhile, participants in both groups should take metformin 1500mg per day throughout
      the whole 48 weeks. At the end of the study, data will be collected and analyzed.
