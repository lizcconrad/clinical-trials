  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      fulranumab as Monotherapy compared with placebo in participants with signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis of the hip or knee that are not adequately controlled by current pain therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled (an inactive
      substance is given to one group of participants while active drug is given to another group
      of participants to see if there is a difference in response), parallel-group (study drugs
      given to participants in all treatment groups during the same time period) to evaluate the
      efficacy (capacity of the investigational drug to produce an effect), safety, and
      tolerability of fulranumab administered as monotherapy (alone; not in combination with other
      drug therapy) to participants with chronic moderate to severe pain and functional impairment
      from knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) that is not adequately controlled by current pain
      therapy. The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be up
      to 67 weeks (includes a screening period of 3 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 16
      weeks, and a post-treatment follow-up period of up to 48 weeks).). All participants will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatments (placebo, fulranumab 1mg, fulranumab
      3mg) and given a single injection subcutaneously (under the skin) once every 4 weeks for up
      to 16 weeks. Blood samples will be collected from each participant at time points during the
      study. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, physical examinations,
      laboratory tests and vital signs which will be monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC 3.1 is a multi-dimensional, osteoarthritis (OA) specific self-administered questionnaire using 24 questions with a 48-hour recall that are grouped into 3 subscales (pain, stiffness, and physical function) associated with hip or knee OA. Pain, stiffness, and physical function is rated on a scale of 0-10 (0 = less severe up to 10 = more severe).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is part of a comprehensive assessment of the impact of treatment for osteoarthritis that also includes pain and physical function. The PGA included in the present study indicates the perception of osteoarthritis in the study joint at the current time. Ratings are provided on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 (&quot;Very Good&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Very Bad&quot;).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical rating scale (NRS) uses an 11-point scale to assess OA pain ranging from 0 to 10 with high scores representing greater symptom severity (0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep subscale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS Sleep Scale (acute version) contains 12 items that address aspects of sleep. Six subscale scores may be calculated including: daytime somnolence, sleep disturbances, snoring, shortness of breath or headache upon awaking, adequacy of sleep and amount of sleep plus a summary index of sleep disturbances. A higher score indicates worse sleep in most domains, but the amount of sleep and adequacy of sleep are scored in the opposite direction.The primary subscale of interest in this study is daytime somnolence.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of Week 16 in Short-Form--36 (SF-36) subscale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a self-administered, generic, 36-item questionnaire designed to cover 8 domains of functional health status and well-being, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health.Scoring yields 8 subscales based on the 8 domains covered in the questionnaire. These scales are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a self-administered, standardized measure of health status designed to provide a generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal that includes the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D 5 level (5L) version will be used in this study. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and unable or extreme problems. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions.</description>
