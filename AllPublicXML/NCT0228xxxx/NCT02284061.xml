      Context: Sport and physical activity during and after cancer treatment can improve fitness
      and social inclusion in adults. In children, although early studies show interesting results,
      conclusive data are lacking. A preliminary evaluation conducted in a dozen children following
      a physical training program showed a significant improvement in endurance, muscle tone,
      overall self-esteem, sports skills and self-perceived strength. The investigators then want
      to evaluate the health of a group of children during treat cancer that physical activities
      adapted compared to children who did not practice.

      Objective: Measuring the impact of physical activity program on health of children and
      adolescents with cancer with improved physical, psychological health, social reintegration
      and reduced time hospitalization.

      Method and Design: The study plans to include 90 children from the pediatric hematology -
      oncology department of the La Timone CHU, aged 5-19 years with cancer, over a period of 18
      months.

      This is a randomized controlled open trial open with a stratified distribution. Children will
      be randomized between two arms - Arm A (Experimental - Immediate Program): the child follows
      the physical activity program for a period of 18 months, as soon as his medical condition
      permits. - Arm B (Control - Delayed Program): the child does not participate to the program
      during the first 6 months, and he joins the delayed program late after 6 months. Each child
      integrates the physical program for a period of one year.

      Regardless of the randomization arm, the child performs the initial tests, the intermediate
      tests at 6 and 12 months and final tests at 18 months. Follow-up physical testing will be
      performed at 3 and 9 months.

      The physical activity program includes a minimum of 30 days of activities per 6 months
      (4days/month and a long stay). The child practice between 2 to 4 hours of activity per day.

      The investigators aim at demonstrating a difference of 50 meters on the total walked distance
      during the endurance test in the experimental group as compared to the control group after 6
      months of program.
