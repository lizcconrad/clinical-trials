  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the finger tip images captured by the
      EPIC ClearView device, when analyzed via the ClearView software, produce a Response Scale
      that characterizes trends consistent with Metabolic Syndrome identified by medical doctors.

    <description>The EPIC ClearView software produces a Response Scale report that summarizes the electrophysiological measurements associated with organ systems. The autonomic numbers indicate how the person's stress response is affecting different body systems and the physical numbers reflect physiological function.These measurements will then be compared to metabolic diagnosis.</description>
