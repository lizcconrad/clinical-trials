    <textblock>
      This was a non-interventional, prospective, multi-center study with no control group designed
      to assess the effectiveness of palivizumab in a population of infants at high-risk of serious
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) illness (infants born ≤ 35 weeks of gestation and infants
      ≤24 months with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) or Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)).
      Participants received immunoprophylaxis during the RSV season, defined as October 2014
      through April 2015, in routine clinical settings throughout the Russian Federation.

      Participants received intramuscular injections of palivizumab according to physicians'
      prescription and the local label. The local label recommended 1 month injection intervals
      between 5 sequential injections at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Participants could have received from
      3 to 5 monthly injections of palivizumab during the 2014 - 2015 RSV season and the duration
      of this study.
