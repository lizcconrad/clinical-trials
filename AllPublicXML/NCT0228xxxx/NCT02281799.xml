  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Azathioprine (AZA) and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) were developed over 50 years
      ago by Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings and were initially used clinically in the
      management of childhood leukemia and organ transplantation.

      The first case report of 6-MP use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was from 1962 , and
      since then the use of thiopurines has been well established in the management of moderate to
      severe IBD.

      Thiopurines offer an inexpensive and effective treatment option for maintenance of remission
      of IBD in comparison to biological agents which may be 30 times more expensive .

      Although 50-60% of IBD patients respond to thiopurines, a significant proportion of patients
      will not tolerate them due to various adverse effects . The adverse effects of thiopurines
      may be dose related, patient related or idiosyncratic.

      The immunosuppressive effects of thiopurines also increase the rates of opportunistic
      infections.

      Thiopurines are also associated with a higher rate of malignancies, particularly a malignant
      Burkitt-like lymphoma, related to Epstein-Barr virus infection . Other adverse effects of
      thiopurine relate to allergic phenomenon.

      An idiosyncratic adverse effect of thiopurine use is acute pancreatitis (AP).

      Acute inflammation of the pancreas defined by INSPPIRE criteria:

      requiring 2 of:

        1. Abdominal pain compatible with AP

        2. Serum amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal

        3. Imaging findings of AP

      Drug induced AP is the assumed diagnosis when no other cause of AP can be found, the patient
      is taking a drug known to be associated with AP, and symptoms resolve after drug
      discontinuation. If pancreatitis re-occurs on re-exposure, the drug is definitely considered
      the cause.

      While drugs are considered a rare cause of AP and most cases are mild and self limited ,
      there is an 8 fold higher risk of AP in IBD patients treated with AZA . Thiopurine induced AP
      is usually detected within 4 weeks of starting treatment.

      However in the case of thiopurine induced AP, there has been no clear understanding of the
      mechanism.

      Thiopurine induced AP is generally considered an indication to cease thiopurine therapy, due
      to the assumed risk of recurrence of AP on reintroduction.

      There exists several case reports and anecdotal evidence that reintroducing thiopurines
      following an assumed thiopurine associated AP can be well tolerated.

      The investigators hypothesize that AZA and/or 6-MP can be safely reintroduced in the
      management of IBD patients following thiopurine-induced pancreatitis.

      If in the past the patients were treated with AZA, they will now be commenced on 6-MP, and if
      in the past they were treated with 6-MP, they will be commenced on AZA.

      The research protocol extends for up to 3.5 months, during which the participant will attend
      5 clinic visits at Shaare Zedek Medical Centre: screening visit, week 0, week 4, week 8 and
      week 12.

      During the screening visit, all patients identified who meet the exclusion and inclusion
      criteria and who agree to participate in the study, will have their medical records reviewed
      for previous clinical or biochemical evidence of pancreatitis, both related, and unrelated to
      thiopurine use.

      Patients will undergo a physical examination, baseline blood tests including measurement of
      lipase and/or amylase, liver biochemistry and fasting lipid profile. If not already tested,
      the patients TPMT activity will be tested. Participants will also have a baseline abdominal
      ultrasound to confirm normal anatomy and absence of cholelithiasis At week 0, if there are no
      clinical, biochemicals or ultrasound suggestions of pancreatitis, the participant will be
      commenced on an alternative thiopurine from what was used in the past. That is, if in the
      past they were treated with AZA, they will now be commenced on 6-MP, and if in the past they
      were treated with 6MP, they will be commenced on AZA. The medications will be commenced at
      standard dose (ie AZA 2.5mg/kg/day, 6MP 1.5mg/kg/day). Depending on the specific situation,
      and assuming all relevant information is available, the screening visit may be merged with
      the week 0 visit.

      In weeks 1, 2, 3 and 6 will have blood tests (full blood count and liver biochemistry)
      performed at a local clinic, and the investigator will be in telephone contact with the
      participant to discuss the results and to discuss if there are any adverse effects of the
      medication.

      In weeks 4, 8 and 12 the participant will attend clinic with the investigator for a medical
      history, clinical examination and review of blood tests (blood count and liver enzymes).

      In the event of any new onset upper abdominal pain or emesis, patients will be instructed to
      present to their nearest medical facility for blood tests (including serum amylase and/or
      lipase) and an ultrasound, if clinically indicated, to contact the investigator and to
      consider cessation of the thiopurine.

      At the end of the 3 month period, if patients show no sign of pancreatitis, they will revert
      to regular monitoring of thiopurine therapy as per their treating gastroenterologist.
