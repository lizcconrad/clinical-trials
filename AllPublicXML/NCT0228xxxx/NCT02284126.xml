      This study is a collaboration between NYP-Columbia and NYP-Cornell that seeks to evaluate the
      use of topical vancomycin and its reduction on surgical site infection (SSI) in neurosurgical
      procedures. Adult patients undergoing neurosurgery at either institution will be eligible for
      participation in this randomized control trial. Patients randomized to the treatment group
      will receive 2g of vancomycin applied as a powder or paste to the wound site and/or bone
      flap. Subjects in the control group will receive the current standard of care without topical
      vancomycin. All subjects will undergo swabbing of the anterior nares and the surgical site
      prior to surgery, once 10-14 days following the operation and 90 days following the
      operation. The primary outcome measure will be surgical site infection, assessed daily
      throughout the hospital stay, at the first follow-up visit, and by telephone at 30 days.
      Secondary outcomes will include length of hospital stay, length of intensive care stay, rate
      of reoperation and patient mortality. In addition, systemic vancomycin levels will be
      assessed at 6 hours and 24 hours postoperatively in each patient. Patients who have an
      external ventricular drain in place will have vancomycin levels assessed daily. In patients
      who have cranial drains placed, vancomycin concentrations will be analyzed from daily in
      wound drainage. Skin and nasal flora will be analyzed to assess the impact of topical
      vancomycin on the patient microbiome. Although there has been a decrease in the incidence of
      infections following craniotomy secondary to prophylactic intravenous antibiotics, proper
      sterile techniques, and other interventions, SSIs continue to significantly impact morbidity,
      mortality, and cost burden. Although never studied in neurosurgical procedures other than
      instrumented spine, the application of topical vancomycin to the surgical site prior to wound
      closure has demonstrated a reduction in SSIs in spine, cardiac and ophthalmologic procedures.
      The benefits of using prophylactic vancomycin topically, as opposed to intravenously, include
      reduced systemic levels of the drug, and therefore, a decreased probability of adverse events
      related to the drug, such as inducing resistance among native flora. The investigators
      propose a randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of topical vancomycin in
      reducing SSIs rates following neurosurgical procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical-site infections (SSIs) occur in up to 500,000 patients per year in the United
      States. Patients with SSIs require significantly longer hospital stays and higher healthcare
      expenditures. In fact, it is estimated that SSIs are responsible for almost 4 million excess
      hospital days and billions of dollars in added hospital charges every year. Additionally,
      SSIs are a significant source of morbidity and mortality for surgical patients (5,8). Thus,
      prompt and definitive measures are necessary in order to redress this significant public
      health concern. Over the past few decades, the implementation of a number of preventative
      measures—including improved techniques in preoperative skin antisepsis and antibiotic
      prophylaxis —have led to significant reductions in the rate of SSIs. Studies have
      demonstrated that approximately half of all SSIs are preventable with the proper use of
      prophylactic antibiotics. Despite these dramatic improvements, SSIs remain a tremendous
      burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, routine use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis
      is not without risks, as it may lead to rapid development of antibiotic resistance, and also
      exposes patients to undesirable systemic drug effects. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the ability of topical vancomycin to reduce surgical site infections after
      neurosurgical operations.
