    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common causes of shoulder pain. Evidence-based
      guidance on optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for rotator cuff tears is lacking.
      Our proposed study aims to fill these gaps by identifying the prognostic factors which will
      predict better outcomes of rotator cuff tears, based on both operative and non-operative
      treatment. The investigators will also compare outcomes of operative and non-operative
      treatment of rotator cuff tears and report on the best way to diagnose rotator cuff tears.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears account for over one quarter million surgeries annually. They are a
      leading cause of shoulder pain and disability. Patients with rotator cuff tears present with
      shoulder pain and/or limitation in range of motion. Fourteen special physical exam tests have
      been described for diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. Prior literature describing sensitivity
      and specificity of these tests in diagnosing cuff tears is limited by retrospective design,
      small sample sizes, samples restricted to patients undergoing surgery, and failure to
      differentiate between partial and full thickness tears. As a result, there is little evidence
      to help clinicians interpret the diagnostic value of the clinical exam. Consequently,
      clinicians rely heavily on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing cuff tears, adding
      considerable expense in the diagnostic process.

      The treatment options for rotator cuff tears are operative and non-operative. There is
      currently little consensus on indications and timing of rotator cuff surgery or non-operative
      treatment. Furthermore, there is lack of evidence-based guidance on factors associated with
      outcomes of operative versus non-operative treatment for cuff tears.

      We are enrolling patients in a prospective cohort study to assess comparative-effectiveness
      of operative versus non-operative treatment of rotator cuff tears and understand prognostic
      factors for better outcomes after surgery and non-operative treatments.
