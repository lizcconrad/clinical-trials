  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite surgical success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), reports of dissatisfaction and
      poor outcomes including increased pain, reduced function for daily activities, and
      compromised psychological health are common. Interventions to improve TKA outcomes are
      primarily education-focused, however there is little support for efficacy. Evidence suggests
      that mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is effective for improving both physical and
      mental health, which are factors implicated in negative post-operative TKA outcomes. The
      efficacy of this empirically supported intervention on TKA outcomes has not been assessed.
      The proposed pilot study will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      feasibility and efficacy of pre-surgical MBSR on post-surgical outcomes. Post-operative pain
      (severity and catastrophizing), functioning (interference and illness impact), quality of
      life, emotional distress (anxiety and depression) and sleep will be assessed in pre-surgical
      MBSR and compared to treatment as usual. This pilot will provide an opportunity for TKA
      patients to receive an intervention that may improve outcomes. Further, it will provide
      insight into the relationship between pre-surgical MBSR and post-operative TKA outcomes,
      which will assist in the development of MBSR adaptations to less time intensive, and
      potentially more accessible, future offerings.

      Forty-five participants on the waitlist for a TKA will be recruited from Concordia Hospital
      Hip and Knee Institute - a facility that performs 800 TKA's per year. Participants will be
      divided into two groups: the pre-operative MBSR group (30 participants, divided into two MBSR
      groups), and the treatment-as-usual (TAU;15 participants). The individuals in the
      pre-operative MBSR group will receive a pre-operative 8-week community-based MBSR course
      taught by a certified instructor, which includes group classes lasting 2.5 hours a week,
      45-minutes of home practice 6 days per week, a 1-hour orientation session at the beginning,
      and a full-day silent retreat at the end. During the orientation, participants will complete
      the study measures for this study. Two weeks prior to the surgery at the pre-anesthesia
      clinic, all patients will receive another set of short self-reported questionnaires. All
      patients will subsequently receive post-operative questionnaires at the following regularly
      scheduled post-operative appointments: 6-8 weeks after surgery, and at 6 month and 1 year
      follow-ups. Clinic personnel, who are blinded to assignment, will administer these measures
      with all other regularly distributed clinical measures. Clinic personnel will also review the
      chart to inform researchers as to what physical condition contributed to the need for a TKA.
      The TAU group will have the opportunity to enroll in an MBSR course following the completion
      of the study (after approximately 1 year), at no cost.

    <description>A MBSR program typically consists of 8 weekly 2.5 hour sessions, home practice (typically 45 minutes per day, 6 days per week), and one day retreat. During the program, participants engage in a number of mindfulness practices (e.g., body scan, mindful movement, meditation) and discussions of their experiences, with the aim enhancing awareness to moment-to-moment experiences in a non-judging and accepting manner.</description>
