      We aimed to assess the target organs damage of hypertention and the occurrence of
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events by a long-term regular follow-up, and discuss the

    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA) is caused by adrenocortical lesions characterized with autonomous
      secretion of aldosterone. It is a common cause of secondary hypertension and its reported
      prevalence ranges from 5% to 20% in hypertensive patients. Several studies have provided
      evidence that patients with PA are especially prone to cardiovascular and renal
      complications, stroke and fibrosis of arteries in PA in comparison with essential
      hypertension. Unilateral PA is generally treated by adrenalectomy and idiopathic bilateral
      adrenal hyperplasia is treated with the mineralocorticoid antagonist. However, aldosterone
      excess may be typically long-standing, and the proinflammatory effects of aldosterone may
      have led to irreversible damage to the vascular wall, the myocardium, and the kidney,
      increasing long-term mortality despite initiation of specific treatment. A study demonstrated
      that either treatment reduced excess renal and cardiovascular morbidity to a level similar to
      that of matched essential hypertensives. However, no prospective study has so far
      investigated the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and long-term mortality in
      Chinese PA patients. In this study, we aimed to assess the target organs damage of
      hypertention and the occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events by a long-term
      regular follow-up, and discuss the influences of the risk factors.
