  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an evidence gap on whether meditation may improve behaviorally measured attention
      after stroke, but preliminary research is promising. This study is the first-ever
      investigation of whether mantra meditation may improve chronic, severe impairment in
      attention after stroke.

      The study is non-concurrent, multiple-baseline, across-subjects, single-case research design
      (SCRD). The central hypothesis is that mantra meditation (independent variable) will be
      associated with improvement on 1 or more tests of behaviorally measured sustained attention
      (dependent variable). The mantra in this study is the syllable &quot;um&quot; and is not assigned any
      spiritual, religious, or affective meaning. The mantra is repeated aloud together by the
      subject and the PI for a duration of 30 minutes in each session. This procedure constitutes
      meditation for the purposes of this study. There are 9 session of meditation (3 times per
      week for 3 weeks). Attention is measured in each of these sessions as well as in 3 separate
      testing sessions that precede the intervention period.

    <description>SARTfixed is in the class of attention tests called continuous performance tests, a class which has a long history of use to measure sustained attention (Shaleva, Ben-Simon, Mevorachc, Cohen, &amp; Tsald, 2011). SARTfixed is a 5-minute computerized test based on the standard version of the SART, which was developed to measure sustained attention in subjects with right-hemisphere acquired brain lesions (Robertson, Manly, Andrade, Baddeley, &amp; Yiend,1997b). Manly and colleagues (2003) demonstrated that in subjects with neurological impairment, SARTfixed was a more pure measurement of sustained attention than standard SART. SARTfixed also had comparatively more likelihood than standard SART for accurately discriminating between healthy volunteers and individuals with neurological impairment.</description>

    <description>• TMT is a 5-minute pencil-and-paper test that has been extensively used as a measure of executive function as well as a measure of attention in a study of meditation to improve attention after stroke (Johansson, Bjuhr, &amp; Rönnbäck, 2012).</description>

    <description>• CFQ is a 25-item pencil-and-paper questionnaire that uses a self-report scale 1-5 on which subjects identify difficulty in everyday cognitive functioning. CFQ measures 4 cognitive constructs (Distractibility, Memory, Blunders and Naming) and has been used in research, as well as clinically, to measure sustained attention after stroke (Shalev, Humphreys, &amp; Demeyere, 2016).</description>

    <description>Each session of mantra meditation lasts for 30 minutes. The participants in each session comprise 1 subject and the PI. In each session, the subject and the PI co-participate in repetitive intonation of a pre-specified mantra. Intervention is comprised of 9 sessions, each of which occurs on a separate weekday at approximately equal intervals over a total intervention period of 3 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria.

          1. Adults between the ages of 18 and 70

          2. Chronic, non-lacunar, right-hemisphere stroke (i.e., sustained at &gt;12 months prior to
             date of clinical screen)

          3. Severely impaired attention defined as 5 or more errors of commission on the SARTfixed

          4. Intact consent capacity with no evidence of dementia, defined as a score of 100%
             correct answer rate on University of California, San Diego Brief Assessment of
             Capacity to Consent (UBACC).

          5. Right-handed dominance as well as sufficient movement and vision function for testing
             (use of computer mouse, keyboard, and monitor)

             sclerosis; traumatic brain injury)

             functional impairment which would significantly deter comprehension and/or execution
