    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if measuring resting metabolic rate (the number of calories the body
      burns at rest) before surgery can help predict successful weight loss after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study enrolling patients from the Baylor Weight Loss Surgery Center who
      have met all of the requirements to proceed with primary bariatric surgery. Patients will
      undergo pre-operative and post-operative metabolic testing (6 months, and 1 year after
      surgery) using a portable calorimeter with eventual follow up of medical record at 5 years.
      Data from up to 50 patients will be collected. The main objectives are to examine if the
      pre-operative resting metabolic rate can accurately predict successful weight loss after
      bariatric surgery and if it can be used to guide the selection of the type of bariatric
      surgery that would be most successful for the patient.

    <description>The ReeVue Indirect Calorimeter will be used in this study to measure the resting metabolic rate. The test takes approximately ten minutes to complete. The subject should prepare for the test by avoiding stimulants and exercise on the day of the test, as well as eating meals four hours before the test. The subject will be seated during the test. They will be given a nose clip that looks like a clothes pin to be placed on their nose. A plastic mouth piece that allows all of the air they breathe to come in through the top of the mouth piece and the air they breathe out to go into the ReeVue Calorimeter will also be provided. The subject will remain in this position for ten minutes until the testing is complete.</description>
