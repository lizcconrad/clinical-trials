      Original (liquid), Herbal Yeast Food Supplement for three weeks. At the beginning and after
      three weeks of the study a stool sample is provided. These samples are analysed with 16S rRNA
      analysis down to species level.The results are interpreted with the PICRUSt classification
      and Alpha Diversity Analysis and compared to internationally accepted data bases.

      the measures taken to minimize/avoid bias, including: Randomization, Blinding.

      Homogenous sample selection. 5.2.1 Randomisation Not applicable

      5.2.2 Blinding procedures Not applicable

      5.2.3 Other methods of minimising bias The investigators are going to do a semi-quantitative
      screening to determine a participant's nutritional habits.

      Questions about their nutritional habits asked in the screening (via questionnaire);

        1. Does the participant have a particular or alternative lifestyle (e.g. vegan, vegetarian,
           only eating raw fruits and vegetables, etc.)?

        3. Does the participant consciously eat food to strengthen your immune system or do you
           take additional supplements to influence your intestinal bacteria (e.g. pro- and/or
           prebiotic food like Actimel, Activia, etc.)?

           - if daily or weekly → excluded

        4. Does the participant exercise regularly? If yes, how often? - if 3h/week or more →

           - if less then twice and more than five times peer week → excluded

        6. On how many days per week does the participant eat fish?

           - if less or more than twice per week / 5 times per month → excluded

           (not counting potatoes)?

           - if less than 5 days per week → excluded

        8. On how many days per week does the participant eat fruits or drink fruit juices
