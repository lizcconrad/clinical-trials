      Background:

      Macular degeneration can cause permanent loss of central vision. This vision is important for
      seeing details. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in
      people over 55 in the United States. Researchers want to follow people with AMD to study the
      early to middle stages of the disease.

      Objective:

      To follow for another 5 years participants who completed NIH study 11-EI-0147.

      Eligibility:

      Participant was enrolled in and completed study 11-EI-0147.

      Design:

      Participants will have at least 6 study visits over 5 years. Each visit takes about 5 hours.

      At visit 1, participants will be asked about their medical and eye disease history. They will
      have an eye exam. The exam will test vision, eye pressure, and eye movements. The pupil will
      be dilated with eye drops.

      Participants will have baseline exams. These include a health history and questions about
      problems that affect their eyes under different lighting. They will answer these questions
      each year.

      At each visit, participants will have some or all of these tests:

      Eye exam

      Dark adaptation protocol. This measures how fast the eyes recover when exposed to decreasing
      levels of light. The pupil will be dilated with eye drops. Participants will sit in front of
      a metal box with a camera inside. They will push a button when they see a light in the
      machine.

      View a bright background light for 5 minutes. After the light is turned off participants will
      push a button when a blue or red light is seen.

      Sit in the dark for about 30 minutes. Participants will push a button when they see a blue or
      red light.

      Objective: The Dark Adaptation Extension study allows us to continue with the follow-up of
      participants who were enrolled in the clinical trial, 11-EI-0147, Longitudinal Investigation
      of Dark Adaptation in Participants with Age-Related Macular Degeneration, investigating
      long-term changes in dark adaptation in participants with a range of age-related macular
      degeneration severity who have already been characterized and followed under that protocol.

      Study Population: Participants will be recruited from participants already enrolled in
      11-EI-0147. Participants will have varying degrees of severity of AMD (Groups 0, 1, 2, 3 and
      4). Group 0 (N=40) is defined as participants without AMD meaning no large drusen (greater
      than or equal to 125 microns) or advanced AMD in either eye. Group 1 (N=40) is defined as
      participants with large drusen (greater than or equal to 125 microns) in the study eye and no
      large drusen or advanced AMD (choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or geographic atrophy (GA))
      in the fellow eye. Group 2 (N=40) is defined as participants with bilateral large drusen
      (greater than or equal to 125 microns) with or without retinal pigment epithelial
      hypo/hyperpigmentary changes. Group 3 (N=40) is defined as participants with large drusen
      (greater than or equal to 125 microns) in the study eye and advanced AMD (CNV or GA) in the
      fellow eye. Group 4 (N=40) is defined as participants with findings of reticular pseudodrusen
      (RPD) in the study eye, without advanced AMD in the study eye, and any level of AMD in the
      fellow eye. RPD is defined as having (1) the presence of reticular inter-lacing patterns on
      at least one on face imaging method (color photography, autofluorescence or infrared) and (2)
      confirmation of previously described findings of hyper-reflective material located between
      the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the photoreceptor ellipsoid zone on SD OCT in those
      areas. Up to 40 diabetic participants will be recruited.

      Design: This is a single center, exploratory, observational, longitudinal evaluation of dark
      adaptation response in AMD participants who have been followed over five years and will be
      followed over an additional five years to determine long-term evaluation of DA change as a
      predictor for AMD progression and VA loss. For the second 5-year study period, participants
      will have six required study visits (baseline, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60), continuing on an
      annual basis following exit from 11-EI-0147, for a total follow-up period of 11 years across
      both protocols. The windows surrounding each study visit will be plus or minus 6 weeks,
      except for the baseline visit which will be plus or minus 8 weeks.

      Outcome Measures: The primary objective will be to determine mean change, including
      distribution of change in dark adaptation response between baseline and months 12, 24 and 48
      in participants with varying degree of severity of AMD (Groups 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Primary
      outcome data collected at Month 48 will be compared to the initial baseline testing done in
      11-EI-0147 which will be 10-year data across both protocols. Dark adaptation parameters will
      be measured using the AdaptDx technology (including the prototype machine, AdaptRx and the
      commercially available AdaptDx) and also using the Medmont dark adaptation perimeter.
      Reproducibility of the AdaptRx and AdaptDx dark adaptometers as well as the Medmont
      perimeterwill be evaluated in a minimum of 20 participants from Groups 0, 1 and 2 with repeat
      testing performed one week ( 6 days/+ 14 days) following the baseline visit. The secondary
      outcomes include the mean change in dark adaptation and other characteristic parameters of
      the dark adaptation response from baseline at months 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 from each of the
      three methods, and the mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the study eye from
      baseline and months 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60.
