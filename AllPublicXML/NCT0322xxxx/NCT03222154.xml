  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of 60 women who had pain-point pains in the upper fibers of the trapezius
      muscle. They had a medical age of 22.8 years, with a body mass index of 22.8 kg / cm2.They
      underwent an initial assessment, with a visual analogue pain scale, followed by an assessment
      of pain threshold, and manual muscle strength.Then, they were allocated into three groups:
      control group with 20 volunteers without intervention, placebo group with 20 volunteers with
      shock wave simulation and an intervention group with 20 volunteers with shock wave therapy.

      All volunteers were evaluated immediately after the protocol (post evaluation) and 48 hours
      after the intervention protocol (48 hour evaluation). A mixed ANOVA of repeated measurements
      was used for intra and intergroup comparisons, followed by tukey post hoc. Significance was
      set at 5% (p &lt;0.05).

      The objective was to investigate the effects of shock wave therapy on the pain of trigger
      points in the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle.

      A randomized, blinded clinical trial of 60 women (mean age 22.8 years and mean body mass
      index of 22.8 kg / cm2) with presence of trigger points in the upper fibers of the trapezius
      muscle. These were submitted to an initial evaluation (AV1), composed of the visual
      analogical pain scale, followed by an evaluation of the pain threshold, using algometry.

      Then, the evaluation of the electromyographic activity of the upper trapezius muscle was
      performed, as well as of its muscular strength by manual dynamometry. Then allocated randomly
      in 3 groups: Control (n = 20), without intervention; Placebo (n = 20), simulation of the
      application of shock wave therapy; And shock wave therapy (n = 20).

      Shock wave therapy was performed with the Master Plus 200® Storz Medical equipment, radial
      emission 2000 pulses, 15 Hz frequency and pressure of 1 Bar. All volunteers were evaluated
      immediately after the protocol (post evaluation) and 48 hours After the intervention protocol
      (evaluation 48 hours). A mixed ANOVA of repeated measurements was used for intra and
      intergroup comparisons, followed by tukey post hoc. Significance was set at 5% (p &lt;0.05).

    <measure>Pain assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>five minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective pain intensity was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale. Which consists of a horizontal line, 10 centimeters long, marked at one end by a rating of 0 - &quot;No Pain&quot; and the other by the classification &quot;Maximum Pain&quot;. The patient had to make a line perpendicular to the line, at the point that represents the intensity of his pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of trigger points</measure>
    <time_frame>fifteen minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of trigger points was investigated in the upper trapezius muscle on the side that the volunteer reported pain or bilateral.
The evaluation was performed with the volunteers in the ventral decubitus, and bilaterally evaluated the presence of the trigger points in the upper trapezius. The number of trigger points was recorded according to the classification: active PMG, latent PGM and total PGM. The side that presented a larger number of trigger points was the side used to evaluate the experimental procedures. If the number of active trigger points were equal on both sides, the upper limb considered dominant by the volunteer was chosen for the evaluation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the pain threshold, a WAGNER® FDM algometer was used, which is a device consisting of a 1 cm2 rubber disc connected to a pressure gauge, which shows values in N.
The volunteers were previously advised on how the procedure would be performed. And that when when the pressure with the tip of the apparatus began to evoke pain / threshold it was necessary to say loudly the word &quot;Stop&quot;</description>

    <measure>Electromyographic Evaluation (EMG) Electromyographic Evaluation (EMG)</measure>
    <time_frame>twenty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Electromyographic signal processing was performed with a TeleMyo DTS Desk Receiver® electromyography channel (Noraxon USA Inc., Scottsdale, USA) with a 20-500 Hz bandpass filter, gain of 1500 times, and a rejection rate of Common mode greater than 100 dB. The electromyographic evaluation was performed using the bipolar technique, with simple double wireless electrodes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The muscle strength test was performed with a manual dynamometer (Lafayette® - model 01165), for the force in the shoulder lift movement. For this evaluation the volunteers were seated, with the shoulder in extension position, and consequently the upper limb on the side of the body. The dynamometer was placed in a fixed bulkhead and the shoulder was elevated, resisting the movement and performing an isometric contraction.</description>

    <measure>Assessment by the Change Perception Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale questionnaire was applied in its Portuguese version, Scale of Perception of Change, being an instrument of easy understanding and application. It becomes a useful tool to quantify the perception of change in health status and satisfaction of a treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain.</description>
