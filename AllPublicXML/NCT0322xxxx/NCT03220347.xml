      Study CC-90010-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1a, dose escalation and expansion,
      First-in-human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90010 in subjects with advanced or unresectable
      solid tumors and relapsed and/or refractory advanced Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The dose
      escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral doses of CC-90010 to
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90010. The expansion part (Part B) will
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90010 administered at or below the MTD in
      selected expansion cohorts of approximately 20 evaluable subjects each in order to further
      define the recommended Phase 2 (RP2D) dose of CC-90010.

      Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up.

      Screening Period:

      The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90010. The informed
      consent document (ICD) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff
      prior to the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be
      completed within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90010.

      Treatment Period:

      During the Treatment Period, CC-90010 will initially be administered orally once daily for 3
      consecutive days followed by 4 consecutive days off in each 28-day cycle. Alternative dosing
      schedules (eg, 2-days- on/5-days- off each week, 3-days-on/4-days-off every other week,
      2-weeks-on/2-weeks-off, 4-days on/24 days off, 5-days on/23-days- off, etc.) may be evaluated
      one dosing schedule at a time or ≥ 2 dosing schedules given in parallel, based on the review
      of available safety, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy data by the SRC.

      Follow-up Period:

      In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose
      of CC-90010 for safety.

      After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (±
      2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or
      the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.
