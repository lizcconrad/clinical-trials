    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is the end stage of various kinds of cardiovascular diseases with
      high mortality. After a long period of medical treatment or surgical treatment, patients
      suffered great pain physically and mentally. How to improve the quality of life and prognosis
      in patients with CHF, which is a hot topic in the field of cardiac rehabilitation now.
      Baduanjin, as one of the traditional Chinese qigong exercises, has the features of generous
      stretch, soft consistency, dynamic but static, which is an appropriate movement pattern for
      CHF patients.

      To investigate the efficacy and safety of Baduanjin exercise for patients with coronary heart
      disease complicated with chronic heart failure (CHF). A randomized, controlled and
      prospective clinical trial was designed.

During the period of rehabilitation, physicians provides a wide range of medical, nutrition and mental health counseling, as well as rational drug-treatment. Baduanjin exercise protocol according to the &quot;Health Qigong Baduanjin Standard&quot; enacted by the General Administration of Sports in 2003. Due to the low-activity tolerance of CHF patients, we performed with a refined version of Baduanjin. Each Baduanjin exercise session lasts 45 minutes and continues twice per week for 12 weeks.</description>
