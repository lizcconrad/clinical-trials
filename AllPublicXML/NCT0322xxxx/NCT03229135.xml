      This was a retrospective study that all teicoplanin-treated adult patients with Gram-positive
      infections admitted to Zhengzhou Central Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University from
      February 2015 to August 2016.

      1. Patients and protocol This was a retrospective study that all teicoplanin-treated adult
           patients with Gram-positive infections admitted to Zhengzhou Central Hospital affiliated
           to Zhengzhou University from February 2015 to August 2016. Patients were included who
           met the following criteria: (1) age≥18 years, (2) duration of teicoplanin therapy≥5
           days, (3) written informed consent was obtained from each patients. Patients were
           excluded who fulfilled any of the following criteria: (1) Patients who were allergy to
           teicoplanin, (2) pregnant women, (3) patients with hematopoietic function, (4) patients
           unable to evaluate efficacy and safety. This study was approved by the research ethics
           committee of the Zhengzhou Central Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University.

        2. Treatment regimen and groups According to CLcr and teicoplanin loading dose regimen, all
           patients were divided into four groups. Group A (CLcr≥60mL/min) : Teicoplanin was
           intravenously administered 3 times for moderate infections (skin, soft tissue and
           respiratory infections) or 6 times for severe infections(endocarditis caused by MRSA or
           severe pneumonia) at the loading dose of 400 mg at 12h intervals, followed by
           maintenance dosing 400 mg/d. Group B (40 mL/min≤CLcr&lt;60mL/min) : Teicoplanin was
           intravenously administered 3 times at the loading dose of 400 mg at 12h intervals,
           followed by maintenance dosing 400 mg/d. Group C (CLcr&lt;40mL/min) : Teicoplanin was
           intravenously administered 2 times at the loading dose of 400 mg at 12h intervals,
           followed by maintenance dosing 200 mg/d. Group D (standard regimen) : Teicoplanin was
           intravenously administered 1-3 times at the loading dose of 400 mg at 12h intervals,
           followed by maintenance dosing 200 mg/d. The maintenance dosing was adjusted by Cmin and
           CLcr in all groups. The target Cmin was set to 15~30 mg/L. If Cmin&lt;15 mg/L or &gt;30 mg/L,
           the maintenance dosage was increased or decreased appropriately up to target Cmin range.
           CLcr values for male and female were calculated based on the following equations,
           respectively.

    <description>Teicoplanin trough samples were taken immediately 30 minutes before teicoplanin administration on the fourth day. Blood samples for 2-3 mL were collected in blood-collection tubes without any additives and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10min. Serum teicoplanin trough concentrations (Cmin) were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography method as previously described. The detections were completed in Translational Medicine Center of Zhengzhou Central Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University.</description>
