  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are prospectively validating a prognostic clinical tool that uses a
      patient's modified Bauer grade, ambulatory status, and pre-operative serum albumin to predict
      survival, post-treatment morbidity, and functional outcomes in patients with metastatic
      disease involving the spine.

    <textblock>
      Recently, the investigators proposed a clinical prediction score that used a patient's
      modified Bauer grade, ambulatory status, and pre-operative serum albumin as a means to
      predict long-term survival following spine surgery for metastatic disease. This prognostic
      utility was developed using one-year mortality as the sole outcome measure. While the scoring
      system demonstrated many of the necessary attributes of a useful prediction tool, including
      simplicity, ease of use and clinical utility, it has yet to be validated prospectively and
      its capacity to predict other peri-operative outcomes, including physical and mental function
      following intervention, pain relief and the risk of complications, remain incompletely
      explored. To further evaluate the utility of this prognostic score, the investigators propose
      a series of three integrated experiments that will prospectively determine its capacity to
      accurately inform clinical decision making and recommendations for surgery for patients with
      metastatic spinal disease.
