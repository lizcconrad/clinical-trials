    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess efficacy and safety of Sculptra in the treatment of skin flaccidity
      in selected areas - arms, anteromedial region, and gluteal regions. To assess the efficacy of
      Sculptra®, via adapted Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale -GAIS- score determined by blind
      evaluator, in the treatment of skin flaccidity on the anteromedial region of arm and gluteal
      region, 4 months after initiating the treatment, based on the assessment of the corporal side
      randomized to be the first to receive treatment . Considering as an alternative hypothesis of
      interest a 70% value of the subjects the treated side would have higher GAIS than the
      untreated side.

    <intervention_model_description>The study sample will be stratified to include 50% of subjects, who will receive Sculptra treatment on the antero-medial side of the arms and approximately 50% of subjects, who will receive Sculptra treatment in the gluteal area, in order to exploratory analyzes by subgroup.
During the study, the subjects should come to the research site up to nine times: one for the screening/inclusion visit (SV), three treatment visits (TVs) for Side 1 (from 1 to 14 days after SV, and from 1 to 2 months after first session), three TVs for Side 2 (4, 5 and 6 months after the first S1 treatment session), one follow-up visit (FUV), 6 months after the first S2 treatment session) and a final visit (FV) (12 months after the first S1 session). After 4 months of the first treatment we will compare the results between the first treated side and non-treated side.</intervention_model_description>
