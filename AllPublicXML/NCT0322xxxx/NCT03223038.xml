  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site study of how nutrition is delivered to critically ill patients in
      pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) around the world. Each site will include mechanically
      ventilated children in their respective PICUs and record the details of what type and amount
      of nutrition was received. These details will be compared to goals designated by the
      clinicians caring for each patient. Data will be entered in a secure online remote data
      capture tool and managed by the lead researchers in Pediatric Critical Care Nutrition at
      Boston Children's Hospital, Nilesh Mehta, MD and Lori Bechard, PhD, RD. Data will be analyzed
      to better understand how different types and amounts of nutrition impact important PICU
      outcomes such as length of stay, ventilator time, incidence of infections, and mortality.
