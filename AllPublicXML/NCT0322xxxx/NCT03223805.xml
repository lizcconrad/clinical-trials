      This study aims to determine the effects of adding the Respiratory Distress Symptom
      Intervention (RDSI) to usual care for the self management of the Respiratory Distress Symptom
      Cluster (breathlessness-cough-fatigue) for patients with lung cancer including mesothelioma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is responsible for 33,000 deaths each year in the UK and as disease cure is
      rarely possible, patient management is often aimed at symptom control. Breathlessness, cough
      and fatigue are common and distressing symptoms occurring in up to 90%, 47-86% and 50-90% of
      patients respectively. To date, research in relation to this group of symptoms has focussed
      on breathlessness, cough or fatigue as single symptoms. However, it is likely that ifa
      patient suffers from one symptom, they also suffer from one or both of the others.
      Collectively these symptoms are referred to as the Respiratory Distress Symptom Cluster.

      Our group has developed a multi-modal Respiratory Distress Symptom Intervention (RDSI) for
      the self management of breathlessness, cough and fatigue. This study aims to determine the
      effects of adding the RDSI to usual care for the self-management of the Respiratory Distress
      Symptom Cluster for patients with lung cancer.

      Patients who take part will be assigned to one of two groupsÍ¾ usual care or usual care plus
      the RDSI.

Scores on each sub-scale thus range between 0 (no symptoms) and 21 (numerous and severe symptoms). Higher scores are indicative of more anxiety and depression, scores below 8 are considered to be in the normal range, 8-10 are borderline, and scores above 11 indicates a disorder of relevant mood</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys. The EuroQoL 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L) will be assessed to provide a preference based measure of health-related quality-of-life which will enable us to calculate a quality adjusted life-year for use in the cost-effectiveness analysis.</description>

    <description>The RDSI comprises of four components
Controlled breathing techniques - consists of diaphragmatic breathing exercises and calming techniques practised twice a day and used as needed for episodes of intense breathlessness and/or anxiety
Cough suppression techniques - includes education (capacity for voluntary cough easing, identifying warning signs for cough and replace with modified swallow technique or relaxed throat breath
Acupressure: a small number of acupressure points are taught: L7, L9, LI4 (located on the hand and wrist areas), CV21 and 22 (sternum), and ST36 (knee). Patients can select any of these points in any combination to apply pressure for one-minute at least twice a day for symptom relief
Exercise: Individually-tailored exercise plan, for example, walking incrementally increasing distances in their local environment, incorporating breathing techniques as required</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of lung cancer - primary tumour, secondary tumour or mesothelioma

          2. Suffering from refractory breathlessness or cough or fatigue (presence of a minimum of
             two of the three symptoms), and which is bothersome to the patient (see below)*

          3. In the presence of COPD, in stable condition

          4. WHO Performance Status 0-2

          5. Expected prognosis of at least 3 months

          6. 18+ years

          7. able to give informed consent

               -  Patients will be asked as part of the symptom screening process:

        Are you affected in your day to day life by breathlessness? Are you affected in your day to
        day life by cough? Are you affected in your day to day life by fatigue?

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are experiencing breathlessness, cough and/or fatigue but do not find
             these symptoms bothersome are not eligible (see below)*

          2. Acute exacerbation** of COPD, or chest infection, within the past 3 weeks,
             necessitating a change in medication

          3. Rapidly worsening breathlessness requiring urgent medical intervention

          4. Post chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to the chest &gt; 2 weeks

          5. Surgical treatment for lung cancer &gt; 4 weeks

               -  Patients will be asked as part of the symptom screening process:

        Are you affected in your day to day life by breathlessness? Are you affected in your day to
        day life by cough? Are you affected in your day to day life by fatigue?

        ** An exacerbation is defined as a sustained worsening of the patient's symptoms from their
        usual stable state which is beyond normal day-to-day variations, and is acute in onset.
        Commonly reported symptoms are worsening breathlessness, cough, increased sputum production
        and change in sputum colour. The change in these symptoms often necessitates a change in
        medication. NICE guidelines 201025. In this trial, patients will only be excluded if a
        change in medications were required - i.e. steroids or antibiotics.
