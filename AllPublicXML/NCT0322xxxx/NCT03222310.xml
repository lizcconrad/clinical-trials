  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, open-label, 2-period, fixed-sequence, Phase 1 drug-drug
      interaction study in healthy subjects. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effect of itraconazole on the PK of ipatasertib and its primary metabolite (G-037720).

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive one 100 milligram (mg) ipatasertib tablet orally on Day 1 of treatment in treatment period 1 followed by two 100 mg itraconazole capsules orally on Days 15 to 23 along with one 100 mg of ipatasertib on Day 19 in treatment period 2. Both the treatment period will be separated by a washout period of 14 days.</description>
