  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In its report dated april 2014, World Health Organization confirms antibiotic resistance
      dissemination in all parts of the world, in hospitals and in community and worries about a
      possible comeback to a pre-antibiotic era during the 21st century. For the last 15 years,
      third-generation cephalosporins resistant enterobacteriaceae (3GCREB) prevalence is
      continuously increasing. Community 3GCREB prevalence has not been studied whereas several
      observations made in Reunion Island hospital suggest a diffusion in community. In this
      situation of world-wide and regional extension of bacterial resistance, the investigator
      offers to study bacterial resistance to antibiotic in Reunion Island community.

      The investigator is focused on E. coli species exhibiting BLSE or metallo-betalactamases
      production that could be encountered du to the increasing level of migratory flow in Reunion
      Island.

      Fecal sample collection will be used for further investigations on bacterial typology.
