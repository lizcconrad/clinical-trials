  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand how dairy products enriched in minerals and proteins
      are broken down in the mouth. More specifically, investigators wish to evaluate the link
      between oral physiology (salivation and mastication) and formation of the food bolus during
      the consumption of enriched cheese, that is to say the way in which the food is broken down
      to be swallowed.

      The study will take place at the INRA in Dijon during 2 one-hour sessions spread over 4
      months. These two sessions will allow investigators to characterise the chewing behaviour of
      the subjects and their salivation, and the structure of the food bolus formed when eating the
      four products of the project.

      For each of the four foods in each session:

        -  Two samples of saliva will be taken

        -  A video will be made of subjects eating one of the study products

        -  Subjects will chew the study foods and spit them out.
