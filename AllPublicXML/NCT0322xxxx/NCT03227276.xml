               -  &gt;2x upper limit of normal, unless the deviation is justified by a previously
                  known not clinically relevant condition (e.g. Gilbert's syndrome)

          7. Any electronic medical implant

          8. Regular medication and/or supplementation and/or treatment within the last 3 months
