  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single centre non-randomised pilot cohort study we wish to quantify the effect of a
      twice weekly, 8 week, structured responsive exercise training programme on exercise
      tolerance, symptoms and health related quality of life in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF). We also wish to assess the effect of exercise training on fibrotic processes
      causing IPF through measurement of blood biomarkers of disease activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease characterised by
      progressive exercise intolerance and breathlessness. In 2012 there were 32 500 people living
      in the United Kingdom (UK) with IPF. Average life expectancy from time of diagnosis is 2-3
      years (Ley et al. 2011). Despite recent advances in drug therapy, therapeutic options are
      limited and no medication has been found to halt progression of the disease. Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation (PR) is a structured exercise and education intervention that is well
      established as a core treatment intervention for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD). Current limited evidence shows that PR is safe in patients with IPF and can
      lead to short-term improvements in exercise tolerance, symptoms and quality of life (Dowman
      et al. 2014). However the optimal exercise protocol, the longer-term benefits and which group
      or patients (those with milder or more severe disease) benefit most is unclear. Further it is
      unknown what mechanisms underlie any improvement and whether exercise training influences the
      fibrotic process causing IPF.
