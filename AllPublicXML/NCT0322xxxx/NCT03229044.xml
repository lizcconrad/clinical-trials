  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue is strongly correlated to obesity and diabetes which are two major problems in
      the worldwide. Adipose tissue is involved in modulating glucose and energy metabolism locally
      and systemically by secreting factors, called adipocytokines. Tetranectin (TN), a novel
      adipocytokine, is secreted by adipose tissues. TN may regulate the glucose/energy homeostasis
      to affect lipid accumulation.The role of TN in adipocytes with or without TN on regulation of
      adipose tissue growth and lipid metabolism is valuable to be studied.

      Materials and methods: Secreted proteins from human adipocyte culture medium were deciphered
      using 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined by LC/MS with MALDI-TOF analysis
      of proteins. Adipose tissues were obtained from the breast of 15 women undergoing mastectomy.
      Serum samples from 200 normal healthy people and 54 breast cancer patients were assigned to
      either a lean or obese group according to the body mass index. The TN protein concentration
      was measured in the culture medium of stromal-vascular fraction (SVF)-derived adipocytes from
      healthy humans, breast cancer patients, pigs and also from 3T3-L1 cells. Associations between
      plasma TN and other biomarkers were assessed with Pearson's correlations and multivariable
      linear regression.

      Adipose tissues were obtained from the breast of breast cancer patients with 0 to 1
      progression stage. All participants gave permission and the study was approved by the Ethics
      Committee of National Taiwan University Hospital as no. 9461701203.

      From 2012 to 2013 in National Taiwan University Hospital, a cross-sectional sampling of 21 to
      78 -year old people included women and men who were living in Taiwan. Blood samples were
      collected after an overnight fasting. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at -80
      ℃ until analysis. Plasma triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density
      lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, glucose and insulin were measured. Fasting serum samples were
      obtained from 193 randomly selected persons having health check-ups. To investigate the
      relationship among TN and breast cancer, fasting serum samples also obtained from 54 randomly
      selected breast cancer patients who were 25 to 59 years old with elected surgery for breast
      cancer stage 0 and 1.
