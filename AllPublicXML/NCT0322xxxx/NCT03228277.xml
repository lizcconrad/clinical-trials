  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of
      Olmutinib(Olita®) administered to patients with T790M-positive NSCLC confirmed using DNA
      extracted from extracellular vesicles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as measured by
      objective response rate (ORR).
