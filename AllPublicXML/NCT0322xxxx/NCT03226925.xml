  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation can be used to impose a completely regular pattern of breathing
      frequency and inflation volume on the patient for as long as required. This would
      considerably improve the reproducibility of the internal motion parameters, and thus
      facilitate the implementation of respiratory-synchronized techniques such as gating, tracking
      and four-digital optimization.

      This will be a three-phase analysis :

      First, different ventilation modes will be tested and compared on healthy volunteers. This
      phase will be analysed with a ventilator and with dynamic MRI in order to measure the
      movement of anatomical structures in each ventilation mode (intra-fraction analysis).
      Further, we will repeat these exams in order to compare them with the first ones, in order to
      analyse the reproducibility and baseline shifts (inter-fraction analysis).

      Here are the different ventilation modes

        -  spontaneous breathing

        -  physiologic ventilation mode :

        -  shallow ventilation mode

        -  slow ventilation mode

        -  Jet Ventilation mode

      Second phase will be done with patients that are intended to have a radiation treatment for
      thoracic or upper abdominal tumors. All the previous ventilation modes will be analysed
      during repeated MRI, again in order to perform intra- and inter-fraction analysis of the
      tumor motion.

      Third phase also concerned patients intended to have a radiation treatment. It will be an
      in-silico-planning analysis in order to quantify dosimetric outcomes of these ventilation
      modes.

    <description>This analysis will be based on dynamic MRI analysis made with healthy volunteers and also patients on non-invasive mechanically assisted ventilation. A well defined anatomical structure will be selected for the healthy volunteers while the tumor will be tracked in patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerance assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>within 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>During all these acquisitions, the tolerance to the non-invasive mechanically assisted ventilation will be assessed by all the participants through a 5-steps scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Internal motion reproducibility with non-invasive mechanically assisted ventilation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This analysis will be done by comparing the motion of the internal structures/tumors at two different time points (MRI acquisition at two different time points). All these acquisitions will obviously be done in the same conditions on non-invasive mechanically assisted ventilation. Motion reproducibility will be analysed by comparing the baseline positions of anatomical structures/tumors on MRI images and the measures in millimeters of motion of the same anatomical structures/tumors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dosimetric comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>within 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This dosimetric comparison will be done in order to assess the impact of non-invasive mechanically-assisted ventilation on dose planning and delivery. Difference in dose (in Gy) to organ at risks will specially be compared through the DVH (dose-volume histogram) analysis.</description>
