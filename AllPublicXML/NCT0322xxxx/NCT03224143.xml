  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized single-blind controlled trial with parallel arms.The present study
      is based on that previously published by Pezzati and collegues (2014) and it is part of a
      larger project focusing on Doll Therapy dissemination in Canton Ticino through team training
      and supervision and guidelines definition that led to the establishment of the Ticino Doll
      Therapy Group with support of the Canton Office for elderly and home care.

      The first hypothesis regards the 30 days-effectiveness efficacy of the Doll Therapy
      intervention in reducing symptoms of behavioral disorders (BPSD) that appear in stressful
      situations (as in the case of a separation from a professional caregiver) and in reducing
      stress as perceived by the treating physician. Another issue to be investigated is whether
      the typical way in which a person manifested attachment behaviors during own life (classified
      in three types of mental states: secure, insecure and unresolved) is associated, once this
      person is in an advanced stage of dementia, with caregiving behaviors of the PWD during the
      doll presentation (i.e. caressing the object, talking to it and smiling).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary goals The primary goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of Doll
      Therapy Intervention (DTI) versus a Sham Intervention (SI), on behavioral and psychiatric
      symptoms of PWD living in a nursing home. Outomes will be measured with the Italian version
      of Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home. It is expected an improvement in terms of a
      decrease in NPI-NH total score.

      We will also assess the efficacy of DTI versus SI, on professional caregivers distress
      ratings related to behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of PWD. It will be measured with the
      Italian version of NPI-NH. It is expected an improvement in terms of a decrease in NPI-NH
      distress total score.

      It will also assess the efficacy of DTI versus SI, on cognitive and physiological status of
      PWD. The first will be recorded as the presence or absence of exploratory and caregiving
      behaviors on an observational grid expressly conceived for this purpose (Grid 2, Appendix).
      It is expected an improvement in terms of an increase of the number and duration of
      exploratory and caregiving behaviors. The efficacy of DTI versus SI on physiological status
      of PWD will be measured by assessing blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, and
      salivary cortisol that are biomarkers of acute stress. It is expected an improvement in terms
      of a decrease in these parameters.

      All evaluations will be performed at baseline (T0) and thirty days later (T1). Secondary goal
      The secondary goal is to evaluate the stability of attachment behaviors of the PWD through
      the adminstration of the Adult Attachment Interview to the patients' offspring after
      conclusion of interventions. It is expected to find an association between the attachment
      style of the PWD and caregiving behaviors during the doll presentation (i.e. caressing the
      object, talking to it and smiling). Such behaviors are recorded in an observational grid
      expressely conceived for this purpose.

      These observations will allow the investigators to test wether a relationship between present
      and past attachment style of PWD and between attachment styles and participant response to
      doll therapy exist. Investigators expect that PWD with a previous secure attachment style
      will accept the doll and will show caregiving behaviors, while the PWD with insecure
      attachment style will show, especially during the first contacts, rejection, avoidance of the
      doll or excessive caregiving reactions towords the doll. Investigators also expect that PWD
      with unresolved attachment style will show inconsistent responses to the presentation of the
      doll, with approaching and rejecting behaviors.

    <intervention_model_description>Each participant will undergo daily sessions of DTI or SI, lasting an hour at most, led by a trained professional caregiver. The DTI involves the presentation of a doll produced by a Swedish brand conceived for Doll Therapy use. The SI group will attend similar daily sessions, but in place of the doll, it will be presented with a non-anthropomorphic object, i.e., a soft foam rubber cube covered with a coloured and velvety textile. The 1st and 30th session of all participants will be videotaped by a trained psychologist as described below. The experimental protocol is described in detail in Pezzati et al. (2014) and it is structured with the goal of recreating a situation of (1) separation from a known figure and (2) interaction with the environment in order to partially recreate the prototypical phases of the &quot;Strange situation&quot; (Ainsworth et al., 1978).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A decrease of the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of patient measured as the net change in the total scores of the Nursing Home version of NPI (NPI-NH total score) from baseline to post-intervention.

The NPI-NH will be administered to the team of the nursing home by a trained blinded psychologist.

    <description>The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) is a semi-structured interview administered to children of the patients in the DTI group in order to identify mental states related to attachment style. Since a correspondence of 75% between the individual's attachment and that of the own children has been reported, the AAI is a useful instrument to recognize the pre-morbid attachment style of patient. It is video-recorded, and the labeling of the answers is carried out by an external trained and authorized psychologist. it is expected a significant association between the pre-morbid attachment style of patient and the response to DTI.</description>

    <description>The DTI involves the presentation of a doll produced by a Swedish brand and conceived for Doll Therapy use. It is designed to recreate the sensation of touching, looking and holding a child in the arms. The doll presentation involves five standard steps:
A nurse (whom the patient knows) accompanies the patient in the room and invites her to sit on the chair.
The nurse presents the object (doll or cube) to the patient.
The nurse leaves the patient alone with the object.
Interaction with the object: it lasts 3 minutes starting from the moment when the nurse leaves the room. This phase is interrupted if the patient drops the object before the time limit.
The nurse returns into the room and takes back the object.</description>

The N will put the doll in front of the P and will say &quot;Good morning Mr./Mrs....look&quot;, with a quiet voice. If the P will not take it at the first attempt, the N will sit down in front of her holding the doll in the arms and will wait for 2 minutes. The N will invite the PWD again. If the P will not take the doll after the second request, the N will not insist and she will leave. If the doll will be taken, the N will leave the P and say &quot;I have to go, goodbye Mr./Mrs. . . ..&quot;. The gaze will always be upon the P.</description>
