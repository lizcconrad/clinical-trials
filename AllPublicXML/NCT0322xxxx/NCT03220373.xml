  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to gain a more specific understanding of how different cognitive
      profiles predict residential treatment drop-out, treatment retention and post-treatment
      outcome in a population with Substance Use Disorder.

      This project collects the neuropsychological profile of residential SUD patients, in addition
      to treatment length, exit reason, hospital journal data and post-treatment clinical outcome
      data. The project aims to identify clinically relevant neurocognitive domains that predict
      treatment dropout and post-treatment clinical outcome. This will make it possible for future
      clinicians to focus their effort on neurocognitive functions most relevant for this
      particular patient group.

      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

        1. What neurocognitive domain (and sub-domain) are the strongest predictor of treatment
           drop-out and retention?

        2. What neurocognitive domain (and sub-domain) are the strongest predictor of
           post-treatment clinical outcome variables such as drug use, health and social
           integration.

        3. Will data on treatment length, age, gender, substance abuse history or psychiatric
           co-morbidity predict outcome independently, or in interaction with, the
           neuropsychological profile?

      This longitudinal prospective cohort study aims for a continuous collection of
      neuropsychological data baseline and post-treatment follow-up data until 2030.
