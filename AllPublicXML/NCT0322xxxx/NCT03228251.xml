  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute stroke care is highly time critical for thrombolysis as well as thrombectomy. In both
      scenarios, each minute lost reduces the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, an optimal
      implementation of these effective therapies into daily clinical practice is of utmost
      importance for the translation of the evidence from clinical trials into good clinical
      outcomes in routine care. In acute stroke therapy, the patient is cared for by an
      interdisciplinary team and often has to undergo several handovers between different
      caregivers with possible interface problems.

      To facilitate a smooth workflow, the investigator developed an interdisciplinary stroke team
      algorithm and implemented regular simulation-based team trainings at the investigators
      institution. This multimodal intervention markedly improved the &quot;door-to-needle&quot; time for
      thrombolysis (time from the patient's arrival in the emergency department to the start of the
      tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion) which is the most relevant benchmark parameter
      for acute stroke care. The investigators monthly stroke team training had a positive effect
      on the perceived degree of safety and staff satisfaction among the employees of the
      investigators departments.

      The investigator plans to investigate the benefits of the multimodal intervention of a stroke
      team algorithm with regular stroke team simulation training in a controlled prospective
      pretest-posttest trial design at seven leading stroke centers in Germany. The investigator
      hypothesize that the implementation of a stroke team algorithm (defined team, defined tasks)
      and regular stroke team training with a focus on efficient team work and communication will
      improve process times, patient safety and staff satisfaction.

      In the pretest period, the participating seven centers (tertiary care university hospitals
      with thrombectomy capacity 24/7/365) record the data of all consecutive patients receiving
      thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy during a three month period. Afterwards 3-4 leading
      employees of different professional backgrounds (e.g. senior neurologist of the stroke unit,
      neurointerventionalist, head nurse of emergency department) will be invited to a joint
      &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; seminar at the sponsors institution where the participating centers
      present their algorithm to the participants of all seven stroke centers for discussion to
      invite suggestions for streamlining and improvement and a train-the-trainer course of stroke
      simulation. After the seminar, the principal investigator and stroke team trainer will visit
      all centers for one in situ stroke team simulation training and provide teaching materials.
      Afterwards, each center will be invited to schedule two additional stroke team trainings a
      with stroke team trainer that will be led by e.g. the senior neurologist from the respective
      stroke unit with the aim of permanently starting up regular stroke team simulation. In the
      posttest period, the participating seven centers again record the data of all consecutive
      patients receiving thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy during a three month time period.

    <description>The participating centers identify 3-4 senior staff of different professional backgrounds (e.g. senior neurologist, neurointerventionalist, head nurse) who will design a stroke team algorithm tailored to the local circumstances of the stroke center. The centers will be invited to a joint &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; seminar at the sponsor's institution where they present their algorithm to the participants of all seven stroke centers for discussion to invite suggestions for streamlining and improvement. The teams will be introduced to the concept of simulation-based stroke team training. After the seminar, the principal investigator and the stroke team trainer will visit all centers for one on-site stroke team training and provide teaching materials. Afterwards, each center will be invited to schedule two additional stroke team trainings with the stroke team trainer that will be led by e.g. the senior neurologist from the stroke unit with use of a simulation manikin.</description>
