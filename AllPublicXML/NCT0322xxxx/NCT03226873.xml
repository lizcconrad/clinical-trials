  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a peer outreach and
      navigation intervention designed to increase access and promote HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis
      (PrEP) uptake among street-based cisgender and transgender women involved in transactional
      sex.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who are involved in transactional sex (i.e., sex in exchange for money, drugs, or other
      services) remain are at substantial risk for HIV infection. Due to a confluence of social and
      structural factors, transactional sex is relatively prevalent among women from socially and
      economically marginalized groups, such as women who are transgender, unstably housed/homeless
      and/or those who use and/or inject drugs. The overarching goal of this research is to
      decrease new HIV infections among women who engage in transactional sex. Daily oral HIV
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an innovative method of HIV prevention that women,
      themselves, can control; as such, PrEP has the potential to reduce the risk of HIV
      acquisition among women who engage in transactional sex. Therefore, the investigators
      developed a theory-guided behavioral intervention (PrEP-UP) which utilizes street-based peer
      outreach and navigation to increase access to PrEP and promote PrEP uptake among women
      involved in transactional sex. Specifically, PrEP-UP involves a Peer delivering PrEP
      education and counseling during street-based outreach followed by offer of a PrEP care
      appointment along with peer navigation (e.g., appointment accompaniment and reminders, etc.)
      for the first several PrEP care visits. The objective of this study is to assess the
      feasibility and acceptability of PrEP-UP. To implement PrEP-UP, the investigators will
      collaborate with an established community-based organization (CBO) in East Harlem, NY, which
      uses street-based peer outreach and navigation to connect individuals to needed health and
      social services. Medical and pharmacy records will be reviewed to assess PrEP initiation. The
      investigators will conduct self-report surveys at baseline and at 12-week follow-up that will
      collect data about sexual and drug use risk behaviors, perceived HIV risk, and PrEP-related
      knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy to assess for temporal changes in these variables.
      Additionally, individual interviews will be conducted post-intervention with a subset of the
      women as well as the CBO staff and leadership to access acceptability of the intervention.
      Following the study, the findings will be utilized to refine the PrEP-UP intervention for
      testing in a pilot randomized controlled trial.
