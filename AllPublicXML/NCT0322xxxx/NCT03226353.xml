  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine if habitual or adapted contact lens wearers of
      Omafilcon A can be confidently refit into Somofilcon A lenses and be successful after one
      week of daily wear.

      The primary outcome variables for this study are:

        -  Investigator responses to refit questions;

        -  Lens fit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-site, dispensing, bilateral wear, open label, daily wear switch
      study, with the test lens (Somofilcon A) being worn for 7 (+5) days.
