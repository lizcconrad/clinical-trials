        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment in
        the study:

          1. Healthy female subjects of non childbearing potential and/or male subjects who, at the
             time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR)
             measurement, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests.

             Female subjects of non childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following
             criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses
                  for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
                  physiological cause; status will be confirmed by having a serum follicle
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming the post menopausal state;

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including
                  females with tubal ligations) are considered to be of childbearing potential.

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following characteristics/conditions will not be included in the
        study:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, achlorhydria,
             peptic ulcer disease).

          3. A positive urine drug screen.

          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever
             is longer).

          6. Screening supine BP &gt;= 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at
             least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is &gt;= 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the three BP
             values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          7. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec. If
             QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3
             QTc values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
                  or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)
                  above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;= 1.5x ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may
                  have a direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided
                  the direct bilirubin is not greater than 0.5 mg/dL.

          9. Pregnant or breastfeeding female subjects; female subjects of childbearing potential;
             male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children
             who are unwilling or unable to use two highly effective methods of contraception as
             outlined in Section 4.4 of this protocol for the duration of the study and for 90 days
             after the last dose of investigational product (IP).

         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of IP. As an exception,
             acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of &lt;= 1 g/day. Limited use of non
             prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the overall
             results of the study may be permitted on a case by case basis following approval by
             the sponsor.

             Herbal supplements, drugs that increase gastric pH (eg, PPI, H2-receptor antagonist,
             local antacids), and hormonal contraceptives (including oral and transdermal
             contraceptives, injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants,
             progesterone-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs), and postcoital contraceptive
             methods) and hormone replacement therapy must have been discontinued at least 28 days
             prior to the first dose of palbociclib.

             Depo Provera must have been discontinued at least 6 months prior to the first dose of
             palbociclib.

         11. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 60 days prior to dosing.

         12. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

         13. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive
             testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody
             (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb).

         14. Use of tobacco or nicotine containing products within 3 months of screening or a
             positive urine cotinine test (ie, active smokers and those who currently use nicotine
             containing products are excluded from participation in this study).

         15. Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.

         16. Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of
             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.

         17. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or IP administration or may
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

         18. History of known sensitivity to rabeprazole.

         19. History of known sensitivity to palbociclib or any of its ingredients.
