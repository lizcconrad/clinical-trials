  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past, several studies have compared the effects between nasal intermittent positive
      pressure ventilation(NIPPV) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure(NCPAP) on the
      incidence of intubation in preterm infants, and the results were inconsistent.The purpose of
      the present study was to compare NIPPV with NCPAP on the need for endotracheal ventilation
      and subsequent complications

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To this day, early use of noninvasive respiratory support strategies has been suggested to be
      the most effective pathway to reduce those risks. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure
      (NCPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are two widely used ways
      of noninvasive ventilation strategies in preterm infant. As compared with invasive
      ventilation, NCPAP reduces the risks abnormal neurodevelopment. However, there is only 60%
      success rate of avoiding intubation in the preterm neonate supported with NCPAP. Supplying
      with an intermittent peak pressure on NCPAP, NIPPV is considered as a strengthened version of
      NCPAP with increased flow delivery in the upper airway, increased minute volume and
      functional residual capacity and recruitment of collapsed alveoli, improved stability of the
      chest wall and reduced asynchrony of thoraco-abdominal movement,which have been proven to be
      crucial to decrease the incidences of invasive ventilation and death. However, studies have
      compared the effects between nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation(NIPPV) and
      nasal continuous positive airway pressure(NCPAP) on the incidence of intubation in preterm
      infants, and the results were inconsistent.
