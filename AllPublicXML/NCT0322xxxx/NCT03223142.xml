      This study will document for the safety and efficacy of image guided multi-mode precision
      ablation system (the combination of cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation) for the
      treatment of liver malignant, as well as provide the indicator of antitumor immune response
      for liver malignant in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Either Cryoablation or Radiofrequency Ablation has been well accepted and widely used in
      clinical practice for solid tumor treatments with various commercial systems. Previous
      studies have established that locally exerting great thermal and mechanical stress through
      alternating freezing and heating abruptly broke the tumor cells and micro-vasculature in
      situ, enabling complete damage of primary tumor. Large amount of biological stimuli was
      released during this process to enhance body anti-tumor immunological response. This method
      thus may inhibit distal metastases and increase the survival rate. The investigators
      hypothesized that multi-mode thermal method (the combination of cryoablation, radiofrequency
      ablation) might trigger a whole body anti-tumor immune response for malignant tumor basing on
      multi-scale bio-thermal responses at molecular, cellular, tumor angiogenesis and tissue
      levels. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the safety and feasibility
      of multi-mode precision ablation system for the treatment of liver malignant.
