  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common syndrome resulting from a dysregulated response to infection. The timing
      of antibiotic initiation is an important determinant of outcomes for patients presenting to
      the emergency department with sepsis. The potential effect of care reorganization on very
      early care for sepsis is unknown. This study will investigate whether multidisciplinary
      coordination of the initial patient evaluation in the emergency department influences
      door-to-antibiotic time for septic patients.

      This is a retrospective cohort study of emergency department sepsis care before versus after
      implementation of a &quot;swarming&quot; model for simultaneous patient evaluation by multidisciplinary
      care providers. The analysis will use data from similar hospitals that did not change sepsis
      care organization during the study period to control for changes in sepsis care not resulting
      from the &quot;swarming&quot; intervention.
