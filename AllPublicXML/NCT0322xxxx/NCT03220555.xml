  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vaccination centers, venipunctures and vaccinations are sources of pain and anxiety in
      pediatric patients. Prior painful experiences can reduce the acceptance of later health care,
      hence making it more difficult for both patients and nurses.

      The topical anesthetic cream (lidocaine, prilocaine) and the non-pharmacological (distraction
      and relaxation) interventions which are usually used for prevention of procedural pain impose
      certain constraints on families and on vaccination centers.

      A distraction and local anesthesia (cold and vibration) based medical device (Buzzy®) could
      overcome these constraints and could be an interesting alternative for healthcare management
      in vaccination centers and, in a broader perspective, in other medical services.

      Research on this device has been scarce to date. Three of them have shown an efficacy of
      Buzzy® in comparison to the absence of prevention of vaccination and venipuncture induced
      pain. An ongoing study will assess the Buzzy® device in comparison to a topical anesthetic
      cream, but will be set in an emergency department context. To date, no study has compared
      Buzzy® to topical anesthetic cream on healthy children in a vaccination center.

      The research team has formulated the following hypothesis: the Buzzy® device will allow to
      get a not lower or an equivalent level of pain compared to the level of pain obtained with
      the usual topical anesthetic cream. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      device Buzzy® on vaccination and venipuncture induced pain in a vaccination center.

    <description>Differential cost of the two strategies compared to the differential pain, self-reported by children with the FPS-r. Cost assessment of the two strategies will be made by a micro-costing analysis. The parameters analyzed will be : the strategy used (Buzzy® device or EMLAPATCH), the nurses' time and the time spent by child in the vaccination center. This parameters will be aggregated and will be presented in the form of a cost-effectiveness differential ratio and acceptability curves.</description>
