  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-lateral thoracotomies and assisted thoracic surgery (CTVA) are the main surgical
      approaches for pulmonary resections. One of the counterpoints of these surgical approaches is
      postoperative pain, which in addition to causing ventilatory changes and reduction of lung
      capacities, contributes to bed rest and consequent decrease in patients' functionality. These
      complications increase hospitalization time and hospital costs, being determinant factors for
      perioperative morbidity and mortality. In order to prevent these outcomes of reduce the
      functional capacity of patients, new physiotherapeutic approaches have been adopted, such as
      the use of the cycloergometer. Recent studies show that the early use of this device brings
      benefits such as: improved blood circulation and venous return, increased muscle strength,
      improved functional capacity and reduced symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. This study aims to
      compare the effect of interval training with continuous cycle ergometer training on
      performance in the six-minute walk test. Randomized and controlled clinical trial performed
      with patients submitted to elective thoracic surgery, hospitalized at the intensive care unit
      (ICU) and in the hospitalization unit of the Hospital Pavilhão Pereira Filho of the Santa
      Casa de Misericórdia Brotherhood of Porto Alegre. Participants will be randomized into three
      groups: control group (CG), interval exercise group (GHG) and continuous exercise group
      (GEC). Functional capacity assessments will be performed through the six-minute walk test
      (6MWT) and the chair sit and lift (TSL) test in 30 seconds, and evaluation of the clinical
      state of fatigue through the revised Piper-Fatigue Scale. The evaluations will be performed
      preoperatively and at hospital discharge.

      Will include patients between 30 and 80 years of age, of both sexes, submitted to thoracic
      surgery with incision by posterolateral thoracotomy, as well as those submitted to
      video-assisted thoracic surgery for pulmonary resection (bulectomy, segmentectomy, lobectomy,
      pneumectomy).

      The cycloergometer rehabilitation program will be performed twice a day for 20 minutes.

      The expectation of comparing two different types of muscle overload (interval training versus
      continuous training) is that the training of shorter duration and greater load also has a
      greater demand on the cardiopulmonary system of these patients and, therefore, a better
      response to the functional capacity rehabilitation program of these individuals.
