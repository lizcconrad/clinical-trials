  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexible LMA (Laryngeal mask airway) is very useful for variable situation but it is hard to
      insert in correct position because of it's flexible structure. Especially in classical way of
      manual LMA insertion, when the index finger could not guide the flexible LMA to the optimal
      position, we could not guarantee the correct position of the LMA. Therefore several studies
      have been investigated to improve this.

      The light wand is a kind of stylet which have a light on the tip. Recently some studies
      demonstrated the usefulness of the light wand which could be used for indicating correct
      position of the LMA. We hypothesised there will be two advantages if the light wand is used
      as a stylet of the flexible LMA. First the stylet could support the mildness of the flexible
      LMA, and second the lightness could confirm the correct position of the flexible LMA.
