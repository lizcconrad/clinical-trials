  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radiolucent periapical jaw lesions of 34 patients, which were surgically enucleated, were
      investigated by two radiologists using MRI, based on the same six criteria, to categorize the
      lesions as granulomas or radicular cysts. After apicoectomies, two oral pathologists (blinded
      to the radiologist's diagnoses) analyzed all specimens by referring to seven specific
      parameters and diagnosed the specimens as granulomas or radicular cysts. The inter-rater
      agreements between the radiologists and pathologists in terms of MRI and histological
      diagnoses, respectively, along with the discriminant power of the adopted criteria and the
      accuracy of the MRI assessments compared with the histopathologic results, were calculated.

      A strong inter-rater reliability was observed between the two radiologists (k-statistic =
      0.86, p = 0.0001) and the two pathologists (k-statistic = 0.88, p = 0.0001). Reliability was
      higher for the radiological (Guttmann's lambda lower bound &gt; 0.6) than histopathological
      criteria. The accuracy (true positives plus true negatives) of the radiologists was higher
      than that of the pathologists based on receiver operator characteristic analysis (area under
      the curve = 0.87 and 0.91, respectively). MRI reliability and accuracy were high and
      comparable to histopathological reliability, highlighting the usefulness of this non-invasive
      exam as a pre-treatment diagnostic method for periapical endodontic lesions.

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the radiologists compared with the pathologists (considered the gold standard), receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed assuming that the diagnostic test is dichotomous. This method for computing the area under curve (AUC) and its error is in agreement with fitting procedures used for diagnostic tests.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To examine inter-rater agreement between the two radiologists and two pathologists, we calculated Cohen's kappa.
The sensitivity and specificity were determined to assess the ability of MRI to differentially diagnose cysts and granulomas. Sensitivity was calculated as the proportion of true-positive test results (cyst diagnosed consistently by both MRI and biopsy) among the patients with the &quot;disease&quot; (cyst diagnosed by biopsy). Specificity was calculated as the proportion of true-negative results (granuloma diagnosed consistently by both MRI and biopsy) among the &quot;disease-free&quot; subjects (granuloma diagnosed by biopsy) .
Guttman's lambda coefficient was computed to account for the reliability of the used criteria.</description>

        34 patients (17 males and 17 females; mean age 41.9 (range 21-76) years) with periapical
        endodontic lesions diagnosed by clinical and radiological examination using 2D standard
        x-rays (periapical and panoramic x-rays) or multislice CT/CBCT in the Oral and
        Maxillofacial Unit of the University of Bologna between January 2011 and December 2015, and
        treated with enucleation of the lesion and apicoectomy after a pre-operative MRI exam were
        retrospectively enrolled in this study. The chart of these patients, that underwent a
        traditional and standard therapeutic protocol, the radiological imaging and the
        histopathological data, were analysed after the treatment by a team of two radiologists and
        two pathologists.
