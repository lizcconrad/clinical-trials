  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty completely edentulous patients were selected and randomly distributed into two groups
      20 patients each.Group I received complete dentures constructed from elastomeric impression
      with wax spacer,group II received complete dentures constructed from elastomeric impression
      with no wax spacer.then on time of denture insertion pressure areas were detected using
      pressure indicating paste and the denture retention was detected.The results showed less
      pressure areas in group I and more denture retention values than group II.

      This study was conducted to evaluate the significance of using wax spacer in the impression
      technique regarding the pressure areas and retention of the complete dentures constructed.
      Forty patients with edentulous maxillary arches were selected from the outpatient clinic of
      removable prosthodontics department, faculty of oral and dental medicine, Cairo university
      .The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group I received dentures constructed
      from impression technique with wax spacer while group II received dentures constructed from
      impression technique with no spacer. On the day of denture insertion pressure areas were
      detected using pressure indicating paste and denture retention was measured using force
      gauge. The data was collected and analyzed using student's t-test.
