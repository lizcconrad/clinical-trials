  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced drug use is a clinically meaningful target for treatment development, but few studies
      have evaluated the positive impacts produced by this behavioral change, preventing adoption
      of this endpoint in clinical trials. The proposed research will fill that critical knowledge
      gap by demonstrating the biopsychosocial benefits of reduced cocaine use. These data will be
      used to change current accepted cocaine treatment endpoints and accelerate identification of
      therapies for cocaine use disorder.

    <ipd_description>A formal plan for sharing final research data is not required for investigator-initiated applications with direct costs of less than $500,000. However, we felt it important to verify that the results (i.e., summary statistics and graphical/tabular representation of the data) from this study will be presented at local, regional, national and/or international conferences. In addition, a manuscript or manuscripts describing the results will be prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal or journals, and the final, accepted version(s) of the manuscript(s) will be submitted to PubMed Central. As requested, the final research data will be made available to oversight or regulatory committees. The rights and privacy of individuals who participated will be protected at all times, and at no time will identifiers be included that would permit linkages to the individual subjects and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the identity of subjects.</ipd_description>
