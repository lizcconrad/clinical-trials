  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm double-blind prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate
      clinical impact of pharmacogenomic testing on the treatment of major depressive disorder.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: pharmacogenomic-guided therapy group
      (guided group) and treatment as usual group (TAU group). The primary hypothesis is the
      pharmacogenomic-guided treatment group will demonstrate significantly higher percent
      improvement in depression score compared to treatment-as-usual group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To a large extent, variability in antidepressant efficacy can be explained by genetic
      variations that affect medication-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and medication
      targets. Recent reviews demonstrated significant potential of pharmacogenomic testing in
      improving treatment of major depressive disorder. One of the major barriers towards
      successful implementation of pharmacogenomic testing for patients with major depressive
      disorder is lack of systematic evaluation of impact of this approach in routine clinical care
      settings. The major goal of this study is to systematically evaluate impact of comprehensive
      pharmacogenomic testing on the treatment of major depressive disorder in ambulatory setting.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is rated by a clinician among 17 dimensions with a score on a 3 or 5 point scale. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal. Scores of 20 or higher indicate moderate, severe, or very severe depression, and are usually required for entry into a clinical trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Subject-Rated 16-item Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology Scales (QIDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology is a short screening tool based on the larger Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS). Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 3 points. Total scores range from 0 (no depression) to 27 (severe depression).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Higher PHQ-9 scores are associated with decreased functional status and increased symptom-related difficulties, sick days and healthcare utilization.</description>

    <description>In this group, results of pharmacogenomic testing will be provided to the treating physician within 2-5 working days. Thus, the patient's treatment provider will be able begin antidepressant adjustments based on pharmacogenomic testing report within a week of the baseline visit.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to this group, medication treatment decisions by the treating clinicians will be made without the availability of the pharmacogenomic report; however, the test results will be provided after the study completion to the patient treating physician.</description>
