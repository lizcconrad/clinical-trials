      Objectives

      The primary objective is to screen patients who are referred with a diagnosis of
      frontotemporal dementia, motor neuron disorder, or related adult-onset neurodegenerative
      disorder to assess patient eligibility for ongoing protocols. The secondary objective is to
      develop and maintain a registry of characterized patients who may be eligible for future
      trials. An exploratory objective is to obtain biospecimens from clinically characterized
      patients to carry out laboratory-based studies aimed at understanding the molecular pathways
      and genetic overlap between these neurodegenerative disorders.

      Study population

      Adults referred with clinical diagnoses of frontotemporal dementia, motor neuron disorder, or
      related adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder.

      Design

      Participants will all undergo diagnostic screening tests, a standard battery of tests to
      measure cognitive and motor function, and blood for clinical testing and research. Additional
      diagnostic and research testing, including magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography,
      neuropsychological testing, lumbar puncture, and skin biopsy will be obtained in selected
      patients.

      Outcome measures

      Patients will be screened for eligibility for current research protocol or entered into a
      registry future research protocols

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be included if they

          -  Are age 18 or older

          -  Have been given a diagnosis by a neurologist of frontotemporal dementia,
             frontotemporal lobar degeneration, primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia,
             motor neuron disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary lateral sclerosis,
             progressive bulbar palsy, corticobasal syndrome, Huntington disease or other related
             adult-onset neurodegenerative Disorder

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded if they

          -  have other major neurological or medical diseases that may cause progressive weakness
             or cognitive dysfunction, such as structural brain or spinal cord disease, metabolic
             diseases, paraneoplastic syndromes, infectious diseases, peripheral neuropathy or
             radiculopathy or other significant neurological abnormalities.

          -  Have an unstable medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, makes
             participation unsafe
