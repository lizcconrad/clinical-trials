  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultraviolet light exposure was shown to be able to release nitric oxide from the skin into
      the blood stream and lead to an acute decrease in blood pressure and increase in vascular
      function. Additionally, preliminary work indicates that UV free blue light also releases
      nitric oxide in the skin mediating similar effects as seen with ultraviolet light A(UVA). It
      is the goal of the present experimental study to investigate the hemodynamic effects of whole
      body blue light exposure including blood pressure, endothelial function and vascular
      stiffness. Therefore, healthy volunteers will be exposed to 30 minutes whole body blue light
      (453 nm wavelength) and the change in blood pressure and endothelial function (Flow mediated
      dilation (FMD)), heart rate, forearm-blood flow, forearm vascular resistance central blood
      pressure and vascular stiffness ( pulse wave analysis by sphygmocor) will be measured.

      In this randomized controlled cross-over study, 20 healthy subjects aged 30 to 60 years will
      participate.
