  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare tracheal ultrasound with direct visualization of tracheal
      rings for the confirmation of endotracheal tube placement in intubated patients. We
      hypothesize that this method is more reliable, cheap, and readily available for all emergency
      physicians.

    <textblock>
      Confirmation of the ETT placement has utmost importance in the management of airway in
      emergency medicine (EM). Visual examination of the tube (fogging), auscultation, chest x-ray,
      capnography, capnometry and fiberoptic bronchoscopy are the main tools used for confirmation
      with increasing diagnostic utilities. Recently, tracheal ultrasonography (US) was introduced
      as a reliable, cheap and readily available method of confirmation of ETT placement.

        Patients eligible for the inclusion were consecutive adults (&gt;=18 years) intubated in the
        ED during the shifts of the researchers (TM, OFC). We excluded patients if they have
        anatomical, traumatic or tumoral defect(s) at the site of sonographic imaging.
