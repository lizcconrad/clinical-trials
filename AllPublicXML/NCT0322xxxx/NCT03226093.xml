  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) can be isolated from fat (adipose) tissue in an outpatient
      in-clinic procedure. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) can be isolated from peripheral blood. The
      SVF includes a variety of different cells and growth factors where the adipocyte (fat cell)
      population has been removed. The use of SVF in the clinic for a variety of indications is
      analyzed for incidences of safety and tolerability.
