  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in the last years, dentistry is going to the concept of conservatism to preserve the most
      amount of tooth structure, so the evolution of new ceramic materials with invasive designs
      like (inlay- shaped and proximal box shaped) inlay retained bridge, the investigators can
      restore single missing posterior teeth with less invasive techniques and less rate of
      restoration fracture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that a great amount of tooth structure is lost during the prosthetic
      preparations of abutments for full-coverage FDPs with tooth substance removal of 63% of 73%,
      this aggressive loss of tooth structure usually accompanied with pain and postoperative
      sensitivity. In comparison With the inlay-retained bridge, there is less amount of tooth
      substance loss. this clinical study will provide benefits for practitioners and clinicians by
      guiding them to choose a more conservative treatment plan with the better marginal fit,
      clinical performance and satisfaction for the patients on the long term. rather than other
      benefits like less chair time, less risk for pulp injury, less time and cost
