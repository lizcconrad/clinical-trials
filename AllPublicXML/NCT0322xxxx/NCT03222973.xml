    <measure>Overall Response Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 12 weeks from Baseline to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response Score is a multicomponent score based on 4 components: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg Test in the dominant hand (9HPT-D), and 9HPT in the nondominant hand (9HPT-ND). It assesses overall changes in disability over time. Overall Score ranges from +4 to -4. At each visit, each component is given a score relative to baseline: -1 if threshold is met for worsening, 0 if no changes meet threshold criteria, or +1 if threshold is met for improvement. The thresholds for T25FW and 9HPT are defined by a 15% change from baseline (≥15% decrease from baseline for improvement and ≥15% increase from baseline for worsening). For EDSS, improvement is defined as a ≥1.0-point decrease in EDSS from a baseline score of ≤6.0, and worsening is defined as a ≥1-point increase from a baseline score of ≤5.5 or a ≥0.5-point increase from a baseline score equal to 6.0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with 12-week Confirmed Improvement in at least 1 of the Following Assessments: EDSS, T25FW, 9HPT-D, or 9HPT-ND</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 12 weeks from Baseline to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed walk over 25 feet. The score for the T25FW is averaged between two completed trials. The 9HPT is a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed every 12 weeks from Baseline to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed walk over 25 feet. The score for the T25FW is averaged between two completed trials. The 9HPT is a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs.
The PASAT assesses auditory information processing speed. A random series of numbers from 1 to 9, inclusive, are presented and the participant is instructed to consecutively add pairs of numbers so that each number is added to the one that immediately preceded it. In the 3- second PASAT, numbers are presented at a rate of 1 every 3 seconds.</description>

    <description>Participants with RMS will receive placebo IV as an add-on therapy to a background DMT once every 4 weeks over 72 weeks. The placebo looks like BIIB033 but does not contain the active ingredient that is thought to have an effect on MS disease. The placebo used in this study is sterile normal saline (water with a small amount of sodium chloride [salt]).</description>

             devices (excluding dental braces), an allergy to gadolinium renal impairment, or
             claustrophobia that cannot be medically managed.

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus or other immunodeficient conditions.

          -  History of malignancy; however, subjects with a history of excised or treated basal
