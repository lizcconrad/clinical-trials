  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is phase II study. Efficacy and safety evaluation of IBI308 in patients with
      relapsed/refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type: a multicenter, single arm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type(ENKTL) accounts for about 6% of all lymphomas in
      china. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection is found in all cases of ENKTL and maybe plays an
      important pathogenetic role.

      Conventional anthrocycline-based regimens are not preferred to be used in ENKTL because of
      high p-glycoprotein expression. ORR of L-asparaginase based regimens is about 80% and no
      salvage regimens are recommended in ENKTL so far after failure of L-asparaginase based
      regimen.

      Recently, a phase II clinical trial result demonstrated high ORR of anti-PD-1 antibody
      treatment in ENKTL.IBI308, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directly against PD-1, is
      investigated in this phase II Chinese ENKTL clinical trial.

      Additionally the correlation between PD-L1 expression and the response to IBI308 treatment in
      Chinese ENKTL subjects will also be assessed.
