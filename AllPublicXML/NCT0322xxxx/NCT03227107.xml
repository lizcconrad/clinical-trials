      1. enrollment criteria and clinical data collection: follow the principles of medical
           ethics, the development of inclusion and exclusion criteria, select 90 cases of ARDS
           patients, in the active treatment at the same time, according to the Berlin standard
           severity of the disease divided into mild group, moderate Group and severe group,
           according to the prognosis during hospitalization is divided into survival group and
           death group. BALF specimens were collected on the day of admission to detect the levels
           of NETs and alveolar macrophages. The acute and chronic health status scoring system Ⅱ
           (APACHEⅡ) and Murray acute lung injury score, blood routine, creatinine, urea nitrogen,
           fasting blood glucose, Item, mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gas analysis,
           oxygenation index; record the patient's mechanical ventilation time and other data;

        2. Pearson linear correlation analysis of BALF in the content of NETs, alveolar macrophage
           coke death level was a positive correlation between the Spearman rank correlation
           analysis BALF in the NETs content and alveolar macrophage coke death level, APACHE Ⅱ,
           Murray score, creatinine, Urea nitrogen, fasting blood glucose and other indicators and
           ARDS severity was positively correlated;

        3. To analyze the prognostic factors of different prognostic factors, to evaluate the
           content of NETs in BALF, the level of alveolar macrophage coke, APACHEⅡ and Murray
           scores were analyzed by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) Short - term
           survival outcome prognostic value.
