  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta is a potentially life-threatening obstetric condition that requires a
      multidisciplinary approach to management.Diagnosis of placenta accreta before delivery
      minimizes potential maternal or neonatal morbidity and mortality. In this study the
      researchers will evaluate the role and cost effectiveness of biochemical marker as creatine
      kinase in comparison with 3D Doppler ultrasound in antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta
      and its variants in patients with placenta previa totalis.

    <textblock>
      Abnormal placentation poses a diagnostic and treatment challenge for all providers caring for
      pregnant women. As one of the leading causes of postpartum hemorrhage, abnormal placentation
      involves the attachment of placental villi directly to the myometrium with potentially deeper
      invasion into the uterine wall or surrounding organs. Surgical procedures that disrupt the
      integrity of uterus, including cesarean section, dilatation and curettage, and myomectomy,
      have been implicated as key risk factors for placenta accreta(Megier et al., 2000).Prenatal
      diagnoses of placenta accreta through the use of gray-scale ultrasonography, color Doppler
      imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging have been reported previously (Chou et al., 1997).

      Placenta increta and percreta have rarely been diagnosed antepartum, and ultrasonographic
      findings may provide the only objective evidence of placenta accreta.A biochemical marker for
      this condition would therefore be useful (Ophir et al., 1999).It is critical to make the
      diagnosis before delivery because preoperative planning can significantly decrease blood loss
      and avoid substantial morbidity associated with placenta accreta (Shih et al., 2009).

        pregnant women with persistent placenta previa (after 28 weeks' gestation) were
        prospectively enrolled into this study.complete imaging using all diagnostic techniques
        (gray-scale, color Doppler and 3D power Doppler), and full availability of delivery
        information. Ultrasound examination was performed using a 3D ultrasound system equipped
        with a 4-8-MHz transabdominal transducer .â€¢ Serum Creatine kinase assessement (reference
        range is 25-160 U/L).(Ophir et al 1999)
