  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The significance of this study is that it will be the first prospective trial to compare MBI,
      a relatively low-cost functional breast imaging technique, to DBT, the new standard anatomic
      breast cancer screening technique in women with dense breasts. This study is also the first
      to evaluate two consecutive annual MBI scans to assess change in advanced cancer presentation
      after introduction of a functional imaging technique. These data will inform individualized
      decisions on supplemental screening and determine if a functional technique that is
      relatively low in cost and complexity of interpretation can eliminate the reservoir of
      clinically important breast cancers that remain occult on anatomic techniques. This study
      will also provide exploratory data about the optimal frequency of repeat MBI.

    <description>Subjects will have had heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts on most recent prior mammographic examination (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) c or d) and be asymptomatic for breast disease.
Subjects will receive Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) at Year 0 screening within a 24-hour period. All patients who did not receive a diagnosis of breast cancer during the Year 0 screening will undergo DBT and MBI at approximately one year (Year 1 screening), again within a 24-hour period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is a consenting female age 40-75 years scheduled for routine screening DBT.

          2. Patient is asymptomatic for breast disease.

          3. Patient had heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts on most recent prior
             mammographic examination (BI-RADS c or d).

          4. Patient is able to participate fully in all aspects of the study (completing study
             visits and study data collection).

          5. Patient understands and signs the study informed consent.

          6. Patient anticipates being able to return one year after study enrollment to complete
             the second round of screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior MBI.

          2. Prior whole breast ultrasound (WBUS), with either a hand-held ultrasound probe or
             automated system. A prior diagnostic breast ultrasound is not an exclusion criteria.

          3. Prior contrast-enhanced breast MRI.

          4. Prior contrast-enhanced mammogram (CESM or CEDM).

          5. Concurrent participation in any other breast imaging research studies that involve
             undergoing additional imaging tests beyond routine screening with mammography,
             including but not limited to contrast-enhanced mammography, WBUS, MBI, or
             contrast-enhanced breast MRI.

          6. Patient is pregnant or lactating.

          7. Patient had a breast biopsy within 3 months prior to study enrollment.

          8. Patient had breast surgery within 12 months prior to study enrollment.

          9. Patient is using endocrine therapy for breast cancer treatment or prevention.

         10. Patient has a known history of any condition or factor judged by the investigator to
             preclude participation in the study or which might hinder study adherence.
