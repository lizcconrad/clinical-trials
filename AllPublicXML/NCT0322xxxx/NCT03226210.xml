      To compare the effect of the rapid-acting insulin analogues (RAIAs) NovoRapid (aspart) and
      Prandilin (lispro) on glycemic variations by Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) in
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with metformin intensive therapy in newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

      The study was designed as a single blind randomized control trial. A total of 110 newly type
      2 diabetic diagnosed patients with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c%) above 9% were hospitalized, and
      were randomly divided into two groups: NovoRapid group (group Asp) and Prandilin group (group
      Lis) in CSII, combined with metformin therapy. Treatments were maintained for 2-3 weeks after
      the glycaemic target was reached. To complete the assessment of general information, fasting
      C-peptide (C-P0), 2-h postprandial C-peptide (C-P2h), fasting insulin (Ins0), 2-h
      postprandial insulin (Ins2h), HbA1c% and fructosamine on the baseline and endpoint. 4 days
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed on after three days stable glucose.

    <description>After completing OGTTS, enrolled subjects (new diagnosed T2DM) were randomly assigned into two groups: NovoRapid group (group Asp, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and Prandilin group (group Lis, Gan &amp; Lee pharmaceuticals, Beijing, China) in CSII, combined with metformin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA) therapy. During insulin intensive therapy, every patient general use 1.5g metformin per day. If the patient is unable to tolerate the side effects of metformin, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, allergies, etc., the daily dose of metformin is reduced to 1.0g. If the patients are still unable to tolerate the daily 1.0g of metformin, exit from this study.</description>
