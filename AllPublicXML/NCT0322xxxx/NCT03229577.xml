  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Yale College Emotional Intelligence project aims to highlight the beneficial impact of
      wellness programs for Yale students. The investigators will examine the benefits of 3
      empirically-validated programs (Emotional Intelligence, KORU Mindfulness &amp; YESplus Yoga
      Breathing) for Yale students on measures of general well-being (e.g. perceived stress,
      gratitude etc). The study will also include a no-treatment control group as a comparative
      measure to the well-being programs. The goal of the study is to show how each program
      benefits student well-being over time (immediately after the workshop and 1 month out from
      the workshop). The hypothesis is that all 3 workshops will decrease stress and improve
      well-being and that the manner in which each workshop will do so may be different (e.g. KORU
      will benefit student well-being by increasing mindfulness and self-compassion whereas
      Emotional Intelligence may benefit student well-being by improving cognitive emotion
      regulation). In addition to the self-report measures, the study will measure physiological
      outcomes of stress, heart rate variability, and sleep using a wearable device (Firstbeat).
      Given the current state of mental health challenges and stress on college campuses, the goal
      of this randomized-control trial is to strengthen the literature on wellness programs for
      students and to show that student well-being can significantly increase through effective
      interventions.
