  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders usually start in childhood and adolescence and are associated with social
      and occupational difficulties in adulthood. Children who have a parent with an anxiety
      disorder and who find new situations distressing and avoid them are at an increased risk for
      developing an anxiety disorder. Research suggests that anti-anxiety parenting can help
      children grow up courageous and calm. It is, however, difficult to parent in an anti-anxiety
      way when the parent has an anxiety disorder himself or herself.

      This research study will test the efficacy of a new program designed to prevent the onset or
      persistence of anxiety disorders in children at risk for anxiety disorders. The investigators
      will first help parents learn skills to cope with their own anxiety and then coach them to
      share these skills with their children and parent in an anti-anxiety way. The goal is to
      intervene early enough in the children's lives so that they can be free of anxiety disorders
      and lead happy, healthy and productive lives in adulthood.

    <description>The intervention will be delivered in two stages: First, the parent with an anxiety disorder will attend between six and sixteen weekly sessions of cognitive behavioural skills training focusing on their own anxiety. They will work on developing behaviours that will help them become less anxious in the long-run and on learning to evaluate danger in a realistic way. Next, the parent will take part in four to eight weekly sessions of anti-anxiety parenting skills training aiming to help them transfer the skills that they learned into parenting their children. In the parenting intervention, the parents will be guided to gradually expose their children to new situations, build communication skills and confidence, in addition to general parenting skills and principles.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Parents:

        Inclusion criteria:

        Parents will be included if they have a current diagnosis of at least one anxiety disorder,
        one or more children between the ages two and eight years in their own care, capacity to
        provide informed consent, and ability to speak English well enough to benefit from the
        intervention.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for parents are receipt of an adequate course (6 or more sessions) of
        structured psychological therapy in the past 12 months, or plans to move out of Nova Scotia
        within the next three years. We will include parents with co-morbid mood disorders.
        However, those whose mood disorder is the primary complaint will be referred for treatment
        for their mood before being re-assessed. We will exclude parents with disorders that would
        interfere with the standard treatment protocol delivery; these include lifetime
        schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and current drug and alcohol use disorder.

        Offspring:

        Inclusion criteria:

        Children are eligible if they are aged two to eight and if they have a score of inhibited
        temperament (negative emotionality) one standard deviation or more above the mean of an
        age-matched normative sample on the Laboratory Assessment of Temperament.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Those with lifetime schizophrenia, autism, general intellectual disability, and current
        drug and alcohol addiction will be excluded, as these conditions would impact on the
        standard delivery of the parenting intervention. We will exclude children currently
        receiving treatment for anxiety.
