      The major goal is to determine if Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enhances visual
      plasticity in schizophrenia. TMS sessions (sham/placebo and real TMS) will be conducted
      before two MRI scans with two weeks in-between to assess whether TMS stimulation to the
      visual cortex will enhance visual plasticity in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum
      disorders. This project may provide a better understanding of the underlying neurobiological
      mechanisms responsible for learning and memory deficits in schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Learning and memory impairments are commonly observed in schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
      Alterations in &quot;long-term potentiation&quot; (LTP), a basic mechanism underlying learning and
      memory, may explain this impairment. This project will assess fMRI visual plasticity, thought
      to reflect LTP, in participants with and without schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Previous
      studies have shown that visual plasticity is impaired in schizophrenia. The major goal is to
      determine if Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enhances visual plasticity in
      schizophrenia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means for
      altering brain electrical neural activity. TMS sessions (sham/placebo and real TMS) will be
      conducted before two MRI scans with two weeks in-between to assess whether TMS stimulation to
      the visual cortex will enhance visual plasticity in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum
      disorders. This project may provide a better understanding of the underlying neurobiological
      mechanisms responsible for learning and memory deficits in schizophrenia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age: 18-65,

          2. no neurological illness, head trauma, or major medical illness,

          3. not pregnant or nursing,

          4. no contraindication for TMS or MRI scanning,

          5. no current substance abuse/dependence.

        Healthy controls will have no DSM-5 diagnosis and no first-degree relatives with a
        psychotic disorder.

        Inclusion criteria for patients includes:

          1. DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophreniform, schizophrenia or schizoaffective and competent to
             sign an informed consent,

          2. not currently taking other medications that affects brain structure (e.g. steroids),

          3. less than 12 months antipsychotic exposure and on the same psychotropic medications
             for 4 weeks prior to study,

          4. not be taking clozapine (due to its effects on NMDA receptors and increase of seizure
             threshold),

          5. clinically stable (i.e. no change in psychotic symptoms for at least 4 weeks).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. age outside of 18-65,

          2. neurological illness, head trauma, or major medical illness,

          3. pregnant or nursing,

          4. contraindication for TMS or MRI scanning,

          5. current substance abuse/dependence,

          6. currently taking medications that affects brain structure (e.g. steroids).

        Healthy controls with a DSM-5 diagnosis and/or a first-degree relative with a psychotic
        disorder. Participants with schizophrenia that are not competent to sign an informed
        consent, have more than 12 months antipsychotic exposure, not on the same psychotropic
        medications for 4 weeks prior to study, taking clozapine, and not clinically stable (i.e.a
        change in psychotic symptoms for at least 4 weeks).
