  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, cross over study aims to find out the benefits of delivering triple therapy
      using a single ELLIPTA® DPI (fixed-dose combination triple therapy) versus delivering triple
      therapy using two different types of inhalers (open triple therapy) including DISKUS® with
      HandiHaler® to subjects with COPD. Correct inhaler use, critical errors and performance
      attributes will also be assessed. Approximately 240 subjects with COPD will be randomized in
      the study. The study will be conducted in 3 visits and will be completed in approximately 56
      days. At Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 28) subjects will be randomized to receive a
      placebo ELLIPTA inhaler once daily (QD) or a placebo DISKUS twice daily (BID) with placebo
      HandiHaler QD inhaler in 1:1 ratio in a cross-over manner for the study period (28 days for
      each period). At Visit 3 (Day 56), subjects will be asked to complete preference
      questionnaire 1 or 2. There will be no active treatment and subjects will continue to take
      their own prescribed COPD maintenance and rescue medication during the entire study period.

             progressing or unstable cardiovascular, neurological, renal, hepatic, immunological,
             endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological
             abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the participant at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the analysis if the disease/condition
             exacerbated during the study will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with history of psychiatric disease, intellectual impairment, poor motivation

          -  Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or medical device/inhaler
             within 30 days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within five drug
