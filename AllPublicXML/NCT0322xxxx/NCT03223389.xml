      To investigate the effects of different fat metabolites on gut hormone secretion in gastric
      bypass operated subjects and BMI-matched controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary triglycerides are hydrolyzed during digestion to two fatty acids and one 2-monoacyl
      glycerol. The study will investigate the effects of these different fat components on gut
      hormone secretion in gastric bypass operated patients and non-operated BMI-matched controls.
