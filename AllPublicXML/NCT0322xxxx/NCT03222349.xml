    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that DBSF will be safe and tolerable in pediatric patients
      during the Interictal state (Period A) and the ictal/peri-ictal state (Period B) of Epilepsy,
      and pharmacokinetics will be the same during and in-between experiencing seizures.

      This is a Multicenter , Open Label Crossover study to assess the Pharmacokinetics and Safety
      of Diazepam Buccal Soluble Film (DBSF) in Pediatric patients with Epilepsy.

      The Primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of DBSF in pediatric
      patients with epilepsy in interictal State (Period A) and ictal/peri-ictal state (Period B).

      Subjects are considered to be in interictal state if an interval of at least 3 hours has
      elapsed since any clinical observable postictal signs or symptoms (from the last observed
      seizure) and the subject has been seizure free over this period.

      For the purposes of this study, the ictal state is defined as an ongoing clinically
      observable seizure or seizure activity as verified via EEG. The peri-ictal state is defined
      clinically as the subjects's immediate postictal state following a generalized tonic-clinic
      (GTC) seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness , and within 5 minutes following the
      last clonic jerk.

      The secondary objectives include a) Evaluate the safety/tolerability of DBSF in pediatric
      subjects with epilepsy. b) Evaluate the usability of DBSF.

      The minimum study duration will be approximately 35 day, with a maximum of approximately 58
      days , consisting of 1) screening period 2)Treatment Period A 3)Treatment Period B and 4)
      Follow up visit.

      Blood samples will be drawn during the entire study for assessing the pharmacokinetics of the
      DBSF.

             as not clinically significant by the Investigator or designee and confirmed by Sponsor
             via written communication prior to subject enrollment. Abnormal laboratory results

             enzyme-modifying AEDs that are medically needed are permitted.) 18. Use of any
             monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine ),
             phenothiazines (chlorpromazine) within 30 days prior to first study drug
             administration. 19. Employee or immediate relative of an employee of MonoSol Rx LLC,
