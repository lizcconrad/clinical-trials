  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer will experience one or more
      episodes of fever or infection during their course of therapy. The most common
      microbiologically documented infection is bloodstream infection (BSI), which can be
      associated with severe sepsis or death. Current methods of diagnosis require a significant
      load of live bacteria in the blood making early detection difficult. Delayed diagnosis and
      delayed optimal therapy of BSIs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

      This study seeks to identify whether next generation sequencing (NGS) of pathogens can
      identify patients with impending bloodstream infection. This would enable preemptive targeted
      therapy to replace antibacterial prophylaxis which often leads ot high-density broad-spectrum
      antibiotic exposure and contributes to subsequent development of antibiotic resistance.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of next generation pathogen sequencing for
           prediction of bloodstream infection in children with cancer at high risk of infection.

      Plasma samples collected but not required for clinical care (discarded samples) will be
      collected and stored. Results of NGS will be compared between patients who develop BSI
      immediately (within 72 hours) after sample collection, those who develop other infectious
      syndromes, and those who remain well. Clinical data describing baseline information about the
      patient and malignancy, antibiotic and chemotherapy exposure, microbiology testing,
      hematology results, and infection-related events will be collected prospectively from the
      electronic medical record.

      An initial exploratory phase will examine approximately 50 participants to determine whether
      the effectiveness of predicting infections. The study may then enroll up to 200 participants
      to collection additional data for analysis.
