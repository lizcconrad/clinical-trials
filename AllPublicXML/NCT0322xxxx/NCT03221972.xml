      The aim of this study was to assess the vitamin D status and analyze risk factors for vitamin
      D inadequacy of Chinese children and adolescents aged 6-17y.

      In this study, we analyzed the vitamin D status of Chinese children and adolescents aged
      6-17y, and related risk factors (such as gender, region strata, ambient UVB level at area of
      residence, season, and outdoor time, etc.). Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured
      with a radioimmunoassay kit in 15 000 children and adolescent participants in Chinese
      national nutrition and health survey (CNNHS) 2010-2012. Age, gender, region type, ethnicity,
      outdoor time, vitamin D supplementation were recorded in unified design questionnaires.
      Season was recorded by the date of blood taken; location was divided into north and south by
      China's Qinling mountains and Huaihe river; and ambient ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation level
      was classified according to the corresponding dose of each participant living area from
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration data.

      2 mL of fasting venous blood was collected and centrifuged at 1500×g for 15 minutes within 30
      minutes after blood taken. The upper serum was aliquoted and stored in brown vessel at -20℃
      in the laboratory where the investigation point was located. All the serum specimens from all
      the 150 investigation points were transported to our laboratory by cold chain. All the
      samples were preserved at -70℃ refrigerator before determination.
