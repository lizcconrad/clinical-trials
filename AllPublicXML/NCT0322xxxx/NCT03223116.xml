    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency energy procedure for
      Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) based on changes of symptoms, medication esophagitis
      grade, esophageal acid exposure and lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Symptom assessment
      was performed at baseline and 3, 6, 12 months after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic disease characterized by symptoms of
      heartburn and acid regurgitation. Uncontrolled GERD can significantly impact quality of life.
      The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) remains the mainstay therapy. However, the efficacy
      of this intervention is often hampered by adherence, costs, and the risks of long-term PPI
      use. Anti-reflux surgery is an option for patients with refractory symptoms or in those in
      whom medical therapy is contraindicated or not desirable, but the incidence of dysphagia,
      abdominal distension associated wth the surgery is high. Radiofrequency ablation, minimally
      invasive, less complications, has become alternative treatments options. But the current
      research on radiofrequency treatment of the data is limited in China. Therefore, the
      investigators conduct this multi-center clinical trial.
