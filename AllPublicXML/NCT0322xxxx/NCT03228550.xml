      The study will provide insight into how lifestyle-related interventions, specifically
      nutrition and exercise can impact the health of older women. The study uses a unique
      combination of interventions and encapsulates overall health outcomes by measuring both
      mobility and cognitive function.

      The study examines the effects of a combined omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and
      multi-nutrient supplement on measures of mobility and cognition in women aged 60 years and
      above. Volunteers for the study will be randomly assigned to one of four groups which are as
      follows:

        -  Omega-3 PUFA multi-nutrient supplement and aerobic exercise

        -  Omega-3 PUFA multi-nutrient supplement and no exercise

        -  Placebo supplement and aerobic exercise

        -  Placebo supplement and no exercise

      Volunteers undertake the dietary supplementation for a period of 24 weeks. The active dietary
      supplement contains a daily dosage of 1 g docosahexaenoic acid, 160 mg eicosapentaenoic acid,
      240 mg Ginkgo biloba, 60 mg phosphatidylserine, 20 mg d-α tocopherol, 1 mg folic acid, and 20
      µg vitamin B12. The placebo supplement contains an iso-calorific oil blend that is typical of
      the current UK diet. The aerobic exercise consists of two classes per week the final 12 weeks
      of the study on stationary spinning exercise bikes.

      Volunteers attend testing at the beginning and after 24 weeks. Verbal memory, spatial working
      memory, executive function and processing speed are assessed via a battery of cognitive
      tests. Mobility testing comprises three walking tests, some under single and dual task
      paradigms, as well as the five times sit to stand test, a measure of dynamic balance and
      functional mobility. Volunteers also provide two blood samples, one for fatty acids analysis
      and the other serum homocysteine levels. Participants also complete health-related quality of
      life questionnaire, the short form 36 (SF36) questionnaire, food diary and food frequency
      questionnaire.

      Design and Setting:

      The study is a randomized semi-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in females aged 60 years and
      over. The study examines the effects of a high docosahexaenoic acid omega-3 PUFA
      multi-nutrient dietary supplement and aerobic exercise, both on their own and in combination,
      on outcomes related to mobility and cognition. All measurements and data collection, as well
      as the aerobic exercise, take place at the same study site (Bournemouth University, United
      Kingdom), with participants instructed to consume the dietary supplement at home.

      Blinding Randomization and Allocation:

      The dietary supplements are packed in identical containers and coded by the Principal
      Investigator, who has no involvement in the data collection. Omega-3 PUFA capsules have a
      distinct odor, therefore a small amount of fish oil is added to the placebo capsules to help
      maintain blinding. A stratified block randomization design is followed with stratification
      based on frailty classification of non-frail or pre-frail, followed by permuted block
      randomization. Randomization is achieved by creating a computer-generated list of numbers
      consisting of four blocks for each stratum referred to without specification of the
      intervention group (e.g., A, B, C, and D). The list is generated and stored by the Principal
      Investigator. Due to the nature of the exercise intervention participants are only be blinded
      to the dietary intervention; however, the experimenters are blinded to the exercise group
      allocations.

      Participants:

      Participants are recruited through local newspaper advertisements and public engagements in
      Bournemouth, U.K. The public advertisements include a brief study description as well as the
      contact details for the research team. Those who are interested receive a participant
      information document including the design, procedure, benefits, and risks of the study.
      Before any data is collected, all participants provide signed written informed consent forms.

      All participants are screened to assess frailty status, according to the Fried et al. (2001)
      criteria. The criteria include low muscle strength, self-reported exhaustion, slowed gait
      speed, low levels of physical activity, and unintentional weight loss. A score of zero out of
      the five indicates non-frail, one or two pre-frail, and three or above frail.

      The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is performed to exclude participants with cognitive
      impairment, as this has the potential to go undiagnosed. The test is performed according to
      British Psychology Society guidelines, and is not used for diagnostic purposes and individual
      results are not be disclosed to any participant. Participants who score ≤24 are excluded from
      the study.

      Demographic Information:

      Information on the age, height, weight, verbal intelligence and medication use is collected
      from each participant. Information on medications is self-reported, with both type and number
      of medications recorded. The national adult reading test (NART) is used to assess verbal
      intelligence. The test requires participants to read aloud 50 pre-prepared words, with scores
      being calculated based on the number of correct pronunciations. Minor variations from the
      pronunciations are not penalized as the aim of the test is to assess familiarity with the
      words rather than exact pronunciation.

      Sample Size:

      Sample size was determined based on the primary outcome of habitual gait speed. The sample
      size calculation was based on a difference of 0.08 m/sec with a power of 0.8 and α of 0.05
      (two-tailed), based on previous research (Strike et al. 2016). A minimum sample size of 25
      participants per group is required to detect an effect size d of 0.8 between experimental
      groups and the control. An overall recruitment target of 120 participants, 30 per group has
      been set to allow for drop-outs.

      Analysis will be carried out on the basis of groups as randomly assigned. This
      intention-to-treat analysis will include participants who decide to discontinue treatment,
      but take part in assessment at 24 weeks. Data analysis will be performed at the conclusion of
      the intervention and include data collected at baseline and 24 weeks. Data will be tested for
      normal distribution using Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q-plots. Associations between baseline
      levels of serum homocysteine, whole-blood DHA levels and cognitive and mobility outcomes will
      be made, as well as changes in DHA and measures of mobility and cognition at the end of the
      intervention. The treatment effects of the two interventions over time (from pre- and
      post-measurements) will be analyzed by 2 X 2 ANOVA, with demographic and health information,
      such as age and NART score, and changes in serum homocysteine and changes in blood fatty
      acids examined as covariates. This analysis will be performed on all primary and secondary
      outcomes. Effect size will also be calculated. In all analyses P&lt;0.05 will be considered
      significant.

    <measure>Change in verbal memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Rey's auditory verbal learning test will be used to assess verbal memory. Participants will be read a list of fifteen common words five times. Immediately after each reading, they will recall as many words as possible. Next an interference list will be read containing fifteen different words, after which participants will be asked to recall the original list. In the last trial participants will be asked to recall the original list after a twenty minute delay.</description>

    <measure>Change in processing speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A variation on the Stroop Test performed on a laptop using Open Sesame software will be used to assess processing speed. During this task a fixation point appears on screen for 500 milliseconds followed by the presentation of the names of one of four colors blue, red, green or white. These words will be presented in four different colors again this could be either blue, red, green or white. Participants will be instructed to identify, as quickly as possible, the color of the text rather than the word displayed on screen and press a designated key on the keyboard for each of the colors. The test is comprised of 144 trials with half of trials having the text and color match and half being a non-match. Processing speed is automatically calculated by the software and is defined as the difference between the mean time taken to respond to the match and non-math trials.</description>
