    <textblock>
      More American children die by accidental gun use than children in other developed countries.
      One factor that can influence children's interest in guns is exposure to media containing
      guns. The objective of this study is to test whether children who see a movie containing guns
      will handle a real gun longer and will pull the trigger more times than children who see the
      same movie without guns.

      A recent analysis of top selling films found that the depiction of guns in violent scenes in
      PG-13 films that target youth has increased from the level of G and PG files in 1985 when the
      rating was introduced, to the level of R films by 2005, to exceed the level of R films since
      2012. By definition, a PG-13 movie is supposed to have less violence than an R-rated movie.
      The Motion Picture Association of America says on its website that the violence in a PG-13
      movie &quot;does not reach the restricted R category.&quot; Our study shows that it does. By including
      guns in violent scenes, film producers may be inadvertently increasing aggression in youth
      via a weapons effect. This experiment directly tests this hypothesis.
