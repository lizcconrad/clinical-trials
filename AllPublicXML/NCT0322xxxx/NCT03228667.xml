  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, single-arm, open-label study of ALT-803 in combination with
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      who have progressed following an initial response to treatment with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor
      therapy. All patients will receive four cycles of treatment. Each cycle is six weeks in
      duration. All patients will receive ALT-803. Patients will also receive either pembrolizumab
      or nivolumab. Radiologic evaluation will occur at the end of each treatment cycle. Following
      four cycles of combination treatment, patients will no longer receive ALT-803 but will be
      eligible to continue their respective pembrolizumab or nivolumab therapy through 24 months,
      at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients will be followed for disease
      progression, post-therapies, and survival through 24 months.
