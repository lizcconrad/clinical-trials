      To observe the effects of hypogastric artery ligation on serum antimullerian hormone levels.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To measure and compare serum antimullerian hormone levels in patients who underwent
      hypogastric artery ligation/ hypogastric artery ligation+ hysterectomy and postpartum
      control. The procedures performed as an emergency life saving method during delivery. The
      reasons for hypogastric artery ligation/ hypogastric artery ligation+ hysterectomy were
      obstetric hemorrhage mainly uterine atony.

      The serum levels of antimullerian hormone were measured 6 months after the operations and
      compared with matching postpartum controls. Serum levels of FSH, LH, PRL and TSH were also
      measured 6 months after the operation. Further, antral follicle count measured along with the
      aforementioned blood tests.
