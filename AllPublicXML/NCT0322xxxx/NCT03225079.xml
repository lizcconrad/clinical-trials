  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the Pentaglobin® registry of adult critically ill patients with severe infections is
      primarily to assess the effects of IVIgAM on the aforementioned outcome parameters and its
      side effects under real-life conditions based on a prospective, high-quality data
      documentation

        -  Age ≥ 18 years

        -  Diagnosis of severe bacterial infection

        -  Pentaglobin® use

        -  signed informed consent for data collection

      Exclusion criteria None

      Primary endpoints

        -  Comparison APACHE II and SAPS II predicted mortality vs. observed hospital mortality and

        -  Difference in SOFA scores, baseline vs. posttreatment (24 h after last application)
           assessment

      Secondary endpoints

        -  In-hospital mortality total and in subgroups according to baseline IgM serum levels (&lt;
           80 mg/dL vs. ≥ 80 mg/dL) and baseline CRP (&lt; 70 mg/L vs. ≥ 70 mg/L)

        -  Change in MOF score from the day before treatment start till 24 h after last application
           of Pentaglobin

        -  Course of laboratory markers (concentration-difference): CRP, procalcitonin, IL-6, IgM,
           IgA, IgG before treatment start till 24 h after last application as far as available in
           the centers

        -  Duration of ICU stay (days)

        -  Duration of hospital stay (days)

        -  Time from onset of severe bacterial infection to start of treatment
