      Study Objectives:

      To compare the safety and acceptability of PrePex Day 7 Foreskin Removal Procedure (FRP)
      (herein: PrePex) versus PrePex Day0 FRP

      Planned Subjects Population:

      One hundred and fifty (150) subjects scheduled for voluntary medical male circumcision. The
      subjects will be randomly divided into two unbalanced study arms (2:1), Day0 FRP arm which
      will include hundred (100) subjects and PrePex arm which will include fifty (50) subjects.

      Study duration per subject will be up to 7 weeks and will include a total of 9 visits.
