      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of anakinra for the treatment
      of acute pericarditis when initiated within 6 hours of diagnosis and continued for 3 or 7
      days.

        1. to determine the efficacy of anakinra with respect to chest pain resolution

        2. to determine the safety of anakinra with respect to adverse drug events

    <textblock>
      Acute pericarditis is a clinical syndrome characterized by a profound inflammation of the
      membrane tissue that surrounds, supports and protects the heart. Acute pericarditis can be
      caused by a variety of infectious and non-infectious agents, but it most commonly either
      follows a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract or has no apparent cause.

      Acute pericarditis occurs rather abruptly in previously healthy individuals, generally a
      child or young adult. Most cases of acute pericarditis resolve within a few days with
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, patients experience severe chest pain and are
      at high risk for life-threatening complications involving the pericardium, such as
      pericardial tamponade. Acute pericarditis is diagnosed in 1 in 20 (5%) ED visits for chest
      pain.

      Anakinra (Kineret) has been shown to treat and cure refractory and recurrent pericarditis.
      This study is aimed at determining whether anakinra is also effective as first line treatment
      in acute pericarditis.
