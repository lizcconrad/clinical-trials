      The purpose was to compare root coverage outcomes between autogenous connective tissue graft
      (CTG) and decellularized human dermis (OrACELL™) in areas of facial gingival recession.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four non-smoking, healthy patients, with 2mm or greater facial gingival recession at a
      minimum of one site that classified as a Miller Class I, II, or III recession defect were
      included. Patients were randomly assigned to either control (CTG) or OrACELL™ (test) groups,
      which were treated with identical surgical techniques. All root coverage clinical parameters
      were evaluated at baseline, 3-, and 6-months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be between 18 and 80 years old, with recession present in one quadrant
             as either single or multiple buccal vertical recession sites

          2. The defect must be at least 2mm in length, (measured from the CEJ to the midfacial
             gingival margin) and classified as either Miller Class I, II or III

          3. Study is limited to vital and nonvital incisors, canines, and premolars

          4. If teeth adjacent to the site to be treated had recession as well, they were included
             in the grafting procedure but not included in measurement

          5. Plaque control defined as modified O'Leary Index of 85% was established before
             surgical intervention

          6. Only sites with probing depths of 3mm or less and no bleeding on probing were accepted
             for surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who smoke more than ten cigarettes per day or use nicotine replacement
             therapy

          2. History of previous history of surgery performed at surgical sites included in study

          3. Subjects who have uncontrolled or poorly controlled systemic conditions that could
             compromise or contraindicate periodontal surgery

          4. Non-English speakers

          5. Pregnant or lactating females

          6. Immunosuppressant medications
