  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar puncture (LP) is a frequent exam that can cause pain and anxiety. In a pilot
      single-center study, it has been shown that nitrous oxide use during the procedure was able
      to reduce both pain and anxiety (Moisset et al., Eur J Neurol 2017). The goal of this
      multi-center trial is to confirm these results in a larger and more heterogeneous group of
      patients having a LP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide (N2O) has analgesic and anxiolytic properties that are known for more than a
      century. Nonetheless, it's use during lumbar puncture in adults has only been investigated in
      a single-centre study.

      Thus, this study is designed to evaluate the analgesic effect of N2O on the pain induced
      during lumbar puncture.

      Patients with scheduled lumbar puncture realized for diagnosis purposes will be randomized in
      2 groups. One group will inhale N2O for the 5 minutes before the puncture and during the rest
      of the procedure. The second group will inhale compressed air during the same period of time.
      Neither the investigator realizing the lumbar puncture, nor the patient will know which type
      of gaz they are inhaling (double-blinding).

      The maximal pain level that occurred during the procedure will be evaluated on a Numerical
      Rating Scale (NRS). NRS will also be used to evaluate the maximal anxiety induced by the
      procedure.
