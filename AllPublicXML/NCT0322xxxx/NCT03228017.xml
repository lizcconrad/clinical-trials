  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how chronic inflammation seen in psoriatic disease translates into
      the increased atherosclerotic and thrombotic risk and how treatment reduces this CVD risk.
      The Aim of this study is to 1) Evaluate the association between moderate to severe psoriatic
      disease and measures of vascular function. 2) Evaluate the association between moderate to
      severe psoriatic disease and measures of thrombotic risk. 3) Understand how traditional
      medications used in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention such as aspirin and statins
      affect vascular function and thrombotic risk in those with moderate to severe psoriatic
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the US. Five modifiable
      risk factors: smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension and obesity, account for 50% of
      CVD mortality between the ages of 45 - 79.1 These traditional cardiac risk factors dictate
      who to treat with primary prevention measures but do not take into account patient-specific
      disease states such as psoriatic disease including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which
      predispose to chronic inflammation. Patients with psoriatic disease have an increased risk of
      atherosclerotic heart disease and myocardial infarctions compared to matched controls.
