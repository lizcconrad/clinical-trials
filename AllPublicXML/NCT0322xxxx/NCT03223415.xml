  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: There is an urgent need to develop new strategies to prevent Clostridium
      difficile infections (CDI). A recent study suggests that a novel infection control bundle (IC
      bundle) can lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of CDI in acute-care hospitals.
      This IC bundle consists in screening patients for C. difficile carriage upon their admission
      combined with implementation of isolation precautions for carriers. Further investigations
      are required to confirm these findings.

      Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of implementing a multicenter interventional study to
      further to investigate the efficacy of this IC bundle.

      Methods: Prospective, cluster randomized feasibility trial of 2 infection control strategies
      (a &quot;standard&quot; and an &quot;experimental&quot; strategy) to reduce transmission of C. difficile among
      patients in 20 medical wards in 5 acute-care facilities in Quebec. Wards will be randomized
      (1:1) to one of the 2 interventions. Each intervention will be applied to all patients
      present on selected wards. The study will be divided into (1) a 3-month baseline period; (2)
      a 2-week randomization and implementation period; and (3) an 8-week intervention period.

      Intervention: The &quot;experimental strategy&quot; includes the components of the above-mentioned IC
      bundle. The &quot;standard strategy&quot; will not implement the IC bundle.

      Outcomes: As a feasibility study, process evaluation will form the primary and secondary
      outcomes. These outcomes will allow to determine whether a future main trial is possible and
      desirable.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the intervention will be implementable across the study
      wards.

      Significance: This study is essential to plan a subsequent definitive trial to determine
      whether the IC bundle can prevent CDI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      C. difficile is a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that causes C. difficile infection (CDI),
      a disease involving the colon and causing symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to fulminant
      colitis. C. difficile can spread from patients to patients in acute-care hospitals.
      Transmission is believed to occur mainly from patients with active disease, but patients who
      carry the bacteria without any symptom (called C. difficile carriers) can also transmit the
      bacteria to other patients.

      Preliminary evidence that suggest that detecting C. difficile carriers to place them under
      isolation precautions can lead to a decrease in the incidence of CDI. In order to investigate
      this question, large-scale clinical trials will be ultimately required. In order to plan such
      large-scale study, there is a need to perform a preliminary feasibility trial. The current
      study will assess the feasibility, acceptability and logistical considerations of
      implementing a multicenter intervention consisting of the detection and isolation of C.
      difficile carriers on hospital admission, in order to guide the design of a definitive trial.
      This objective is essential considering the paucity of published data on this topic.

    <description>Screening for C. difficile carriage will be conducted by performing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay detecting the toxin B gene (tcdB) on a rectal swab. Screening will occur within 24 h of admission to the ward. To ensure compliance with the policy, automatic orders will be developed. The patient care nurse will perform the screenings. The results will be reported according to the standard institutional policy.
Isolation precautions for C. difficile carriers: healthcare workers will also follow a set of isolation precaution rules during the care of C. difficile carriers. C. difficile carriers will remain under isolation precaution as long as they remain carriers and on the intervention ward. Precautions would be discontinued upon discharge from the ward.</description>

        each ward will be assigned to the intervention.

        Inclusion criteria:

        Clusters (i.e. wards) are eligible to take part in the study if they meet the following
        criteria:

          -  Adult medical or surgical wards;

          -  Patient volume: ≥5 admissions/month and ≥600 patient days/month in 2015;

          -  Incidence rate of CDI of ≥5/10 000 patient-days based during in 2014-2015;

          -  Capacity to screen patients by PCR with a turnaround time of &lt;24 h;

          -  Participation in the Quebec CDI surveillance program (SPIN-CD);

          -  No existing protocol to detect and isolate CD carriers (isolation of CDI patients with
             resolved diarrhea allowed);

          -  Stable use of infection-prevention initiatives and products during the baseline
             period;

          -  Agreement to refrain from adopting new initiatives that would conflict with the trial.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Wards planning to enroll subjects in other studies that aim to eradicate or prevent
