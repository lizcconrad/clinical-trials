  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For newly-diagnosed patients with brain metastasis, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
      probably remains a common palliative management even for those with oligometastatic brain
      disease. However, WBRT-related late sequelae, particularly a decline in neurocognitive
      functions (NCFs), are a major concern. More importantly, in patients with limited brain
      metastases and a fair/good performance status, sparing the radiosensitive and vulnerable
      structures which are responsible for essential NCFs during the WBRT course is one of the
      reasonable strategies to postpone and prevent the development of WBRT-induced neurocognitive
      impairments. Actually, radiation-related neurocognitive dysfunction is usually characterized
      as a decline involving learning and memory, in which the extremely radiosensitive hippocampus
      indeed plays a critical role. In addition to the neurocognitive preservation by virtue of
      sparing the radiosensitive structures like the hippocampus, durable intracranial tumor
      control critically depends on an escalated radiotherapeutic dose level which is adequate
      enough to eradicate gross metastatic brain lesions. Therefore, in order to achieve both
      hippocampal sparing and simultaneous integrated boost(s) to gross metastatic foci, a
      specialized WBRT technique, hippocampal avoidance during WBRT plus simultaneous integrated
      boost (SIB) will be adopted in this prospective study. Moreover, the dose-effect relationship
      would be analyzed in order to explore the correlation between the equivalent uniform dose
      (EUD) irradiating the hippocampus and the neurocognitive change/decline after the above WBRT
      course measured by objective neurocognitive test tools. Newly-diagnosed cancer patients
      harboring 1-3 gross metastatic lesions but still in fair/good performance statuses are
      potentially eligible. All recruited patients should receive baseline functional brain MRI
      examination and baseline neurobehavioral assessment. Treatment planning will be designed via
      the technique of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to achieve both hippocampal
      avoidance and simultaneous integrated boost(s) to gross metastatic lesions. Except for the
      above regions for which conformal avoidance or SIB is attempted, the prescribed dose to the
      remaining brain parenchyma will be consistently 3000 cGy in 12 fractions. Accordingly, a
      battery of neuropsychological measures, which includes 7 standardized neuropsychological
      tests (e.g., executive functions, verbal and non-verbal memory, working memory, and
      psychomotor speed), is used to evaluate neurobehavioral functions for our registered
      patients. The primary outcome measure is delayed recall, as determined by the change/decline
      in verbal memory or non-verbal memory, from the baseline assessment to 4 months after the
      start of the WBRT course. This prospective cohort study aims to examine thoroughly the impact
      of a specialized WBRT technique, integrating both simultaneous integrated boost(s) delivered
      to gross metastatic foci and conformal hippocampal avoidance, on the status of NCF
      change/decline in patients with oligometastatic brain disease. It is anticipated that
      intracranial local control will be more sustainable and durable resulting from the escalated
      focal dose of SIBs. Ultimately, we also expect the dose-effect relationship will be clearly
      demonstrated after investigating the correlation between the hippocampal dosimetry and the
      status of NCF change/decline after receiving HA-WBRT plus SIB.
