  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recognized manifestations of HHT are all due to abnormalities of vascular structure.
      Epistaxis and digestive arteriovenous malformations may be responsible for severe hemorrhages
      in 5% of HHT patients, requiring repeated blood transfusions and are associated with high
      morbidity. There is currently no standard and efficient management of this severe symptom. It
      is also well known that HHT-associated hemorrhages have the greatest negative impact on
      quality of life among HHT patients, and is responsible for anemia, blood transfusions,
      hospitalizations, depressive syndrome and a high psycho-social impact.

      Since 2006, it has been suggested by animal models and then by clinical reports that
      anti-VEGF therapy may be useful to treat HHT. 4 case reports have been published on efficacy
      of intravenous bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody in HHT on severe hemorrhages.

      Intravenous bevacizumab has been used in a previous clinical trial to measure efficacy and
      tolerance of this drug in HHT patients with severe liver involvement. Furthermore, a
      reduction was observed in the duration of the nosebleeds after treatment and was encouraging
      to treat bleeding. We completed this study by a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model
      in order to assess the individual concentration-effect relationship of bevacizumab.

      However, no randomized prospective study has been performed and published to evaluate the
      efficacy in this indication. A total of 24 patients will be randomized versus placebo in a
      multicenter phase III trial. The Avastin or placebo will be infused at 5mg/kg every 14 days
      with a total of 6 cures with a 3 months following period.
