  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess impact of behavioral economic principles of precommitment, implementation
      intentions, and social contracting on smoking cessation for patients undergoing surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose &amp; Objective: Behavioral interventions in surgical patients are an opportunity to
      improve outcomes through decreased complications, with measurable economic impact. Smoking
      cessation is one of the most desirable long-term health behaviors for adults with potential
      substantial impact on postoperative complications

      Study Activity &amp; Population Group: The investigators propose a precommitment contractual
      agreement implementing behavioral economic principles at the preoperative appointment for
      active tobacco users undergoing an operation and assessing for ability to quit smoking with
      testing on the day of surgery, and the durability of cessation over the postoperative course
      as measured with urine nicotine testing at follow up appointments. The population of interest
      is adults who currently smoke tobacco or vaporized nicotine who are scheduled to undergo a
      major operation. The control group is standard of care; prescriptive advice to quit smoking.
      The intervention is contract agreement for preoperative cessation.

      Data Analysis &amp; Risk Issues: Following informed consent patients will be randomized to
      control or intervention groups, baseline urine nicotine tests will be performed in clinic.
      Urine nicotine testing will be performed on the day of enrollment, the day of their
      operation, and at their one-month follow up appointments. Thirty-day outcomes will be
      evaluated by retrospective chart review.
