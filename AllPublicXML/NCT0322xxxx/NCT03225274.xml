      The study evaluates the effectiveness of Breathing Exercises as Therapeutic Play on
      respiratory Status among children with Lower respiratory Tract Disorders. patient were
      allocated into two groups- Experimental group and Comparison group. Experimental Group
      received Breathing Exercises as Therapeutic Play after administration of Nebulization therapy
      and comparison Group received no Breathing Exercises.

      The subjects were selected by Purposive sampling technique and allocated into 2 groups i.e
      experimental and comparison group. the total sample size for the study was 60 children i.e 30
      in Experiment Group and 30 in Comparison group.

      Experimental Group- Pre-assessment of respiratory status among children was assessed. Then
      after 5 minutes of administration of Nebulization, breathing exercises as therapeutic play
      (balloon inflation, candle blowing, blow air into water with a straw was administered for 15
      minutes once in a day for 3 days consecutively and then post-assessment was taken daily 5
      minutes after the administration of breathing exercises as therapeutic play.

      Comparison Group- Pre-assessment of respiratory status among children was assessed. Then only
      nebulization therapy was administered and then post-assessment was taken daily after 25
      minutes of administered.

    <description>On day 1, pre- intervention assessment of respiratory status was done before administration of breathing exercises as therapeutic play and after 5 minutes of administration of Nebulization therapy, breathing exercises was administered among children for 15 minutes once in a day and then after 5 minutes 1st post-intervention assessment was done on same day.
On 2nd day again after 5 minutes of administration of Nebulization therapy, breathing exercises was administered among children for 15 minutes once in a day and after 5 minutes again post-intervention assessment was done on same day.
On 3rd day again after 5 minutes of administration of Nebulization therapy, breathing exercises was administered among children for 15 minutes once in a day and after 5 minutes again post-intervention assessment was done on same day.</description>
