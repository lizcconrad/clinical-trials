  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A headache is a more common disorder and one that prevails over a lifetime of much of the
      population. Among the causes are in the stress and spasms of the pericranial musculature,
      presence of painful sensitivity in the region, decrease of pain threshold, and a presence of
      trigger points (PGs) that can also cause as headaches. The solutions for health and health,
      in addition to Percutaneous Microelectrolysis (MEP®), which is used in the application of low
      intensity galvanic current through the acupuncture needle. Although it is a very common
      pathology, it is still little studied and a lack of information is a question of solutions
      such as crisis of care. This work justifies the negative bones of CTT in university students,
      as this has repercussions on the quality of life, besides proposing a therapeutic approach to
      reduce the symptomatology. The present study aims to investigate the effects of myofascial
      release techniques, MEP® and an association of therapies, observing the impact on quality of
      life and repercussions on academic performance. This is a controlled clinical trial of a
      convenience-based approach, consisting of universities between the 1st and 10th Physical
      Therapy course of Estácio Ponta Negra, over 18 years of age, who are not present in the
      application of the questionnaires, It is necessary to use the medicine of the analgesic type.
      The volunteers are evaluated through the HIT-6 and SF-36 questionnaires, after a selection of
      pain evaluation, PGs and algometry. The randomization will consist of 4 groups, after a
      consultation and an immediate re-evaluation and a second time and a new intervention and
      re-evaluation. A descriptive and inferential statistics will be performed through the SPSS
      20.0 program. The normality of the data is observed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. For
      a comparison between groups whose parametric data are applied or anova test with post hoc
      tukey comingue of significance of 5% (p &lt;0.05). It is believed that the use of the
      association of myofascial release techniques and Percutaneous Microelectronics promotes
      greater benefits in tension headache.

    <intervention_model_description>After the initial evaluation, the investigator 2 will conduct the experimental procedures in the different groups, which will be submitted to the following protocols: G1 (n = 15) called LMF will be submitted to the myofascial release technique consisting of: , Deep sliding, pumping-kneading, thumb and four-finger rubbing, and sliding) applied to the musculature of the most painful region for 15 minutes. G2 (n = 15) will be applied to the MEP® technique, in which needles will be introduced on three occasions during each session, at different points of the musculature of the most painful region, for a total of 3 minutes. The G3 (n = 15) will be performed the two techniques above, being applied first Miofascial Release and later to MEP®. G4 (n = 15) will be the control group, not performing any of the interventions. The reevaluations will occur immediately and after 48 hours of the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is composed of six questions, with scores ranging from six to 13 points, which can total between 36-78 points; So the higher this score, the greater the impact of headache on the daily activities of the individual.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life assessment (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Validated and adapted to the Brazilian culture. This allows to compare the quality of life of healthy individuals and patients of different pathologies. It consists of 36 questions, which encompass 8 components: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health, vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects and mental health. The final score can vary from 0 (worst general health condition) to 100 (better health).</description>

    <measure>Pain assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>five minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To grade the pain before the intervention will be applied the visual analogue scale. It is a subjective test in which the volunteer will self-evaluate. It will be performed with a horizontal line in which the beginning will represent absence of pain and at the end of the line will represent the maximum pain, and will be oriented to mark in the line the perception of the pain at that moment.</description>

    <time_frame>twenty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of trigger points in the upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, suboccipital and splenius muscles of the neck will be investigated. Localization along the tense muscle band to the presence of palpable nodules, local pain to the digital compression (estimated time of 6 s) of a palpable nodule located in a tight band; Recognition of pain referred by the patient as familiar by pressing the sensitive nodule (to identify active PG)</description>

    <measure>Assessment of pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>twenty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the pain threshold, a WAGNER FDX algometer will be used, which is a device consisting of a rubber disk measuring 1 cm2 connected to a pressure gauge, which has values in kgf / cm2. The upper trapezius muscle will be evaluated at the mean distance between the C7 and the acromion of the scapula along its fibers. If the algometry evaluation point coincides with the trigger point, the analysis with the algometer will be performed 2 cm apart in the medial to the point direction.</description>
