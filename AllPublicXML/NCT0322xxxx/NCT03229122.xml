      The multi-centered, cross-sectional investigations shall be conducted in this study with the
      objective of identifying the ownership ratio of gBRCAm on the newly diagnosed patients with
      epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer in Japan.

    <textblock>
      This multi-centered, cooperative and epidemiological observation study is so designed to
      investigate the ownership ratio of gBRCAm in the newly diagnosed patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer because such a ratio has
      not yet been adequately clarified in Japan.

      The newly diagnosed eligible patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal
      cancer or fallopian tube cancer shall be asked to participate in this study in order of
      diagnosis. After obtaining their consents by the written informed consent following
      appropriate explanation, investigations about the demographic information including the
      cancer family history shall be performed. Subsequently, blood is collected for investigation
      about gBRCAm. In addition, histological classification shall be conducted based on the
      resected tumor tissues.

      From all the eligible subjects who have already attached the signature to the written
      informed consent, blood samples shall be collected. By using an assigned 10-mL EDTA-added
      blood collecting glass tube, 7 mL of the blood is sampled. The blood samples are to be
      recovered together with the specified test request form by Myriad and presence or absence of
      gBRCAm shall be centrally determined by US Myriad Genetics. Treatments of the samples,
      handling procedures and recovery methods are precisely described on the testing manual.

      The physician responsible for institutional study has the responsibility to notify the gBRCAm
      results to all the patients who underwent the tests. However, this responsibility needs not
      to be observed if the patients themselves refuse such a notification about gBRCAm test
      results. This responsibility shall be assumed by the physician responsible for institutional
      study in each participating institute.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For registration to this study, all of the following criteria should be satisfied:

          1. The subject can attach the signature to the Informed Consent Form (ICF), besides
             having his/her intention to put the signature.

          2. Female Japanese at more than 20 years of age

          3. The newly diagnosed patients whose epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal
             cancer or fallopian tube cancer is histologically confirmed as FIGO from the subject
             to obtain their utmost understandings. Limited to histopathological diagnosis based on
             resected tumor specimens (except the cytodiagnosis by ascites paracentesis).

          4. The histopathological specimens can be submitted to the central pathological judgment.

          5. Within 60 days after diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer
             or fallopian tube cancer, the patient's written consent has been obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subjects who coincide any of the following exclusion criteria are designated to be
             ineligible:

               1. In case of the subjects who are diagnosed to have acute or chronic physical or
                  severe mental diseases except cancer, and about whom the attending responsible
                  physician makes judgement to say that participation of these subjects would
                  possibly increase the risks or would probably disturb the interpretation of the
                  study results.

               2. In case of the subjects whose registration for the study is judged by the
                  attending responsible physician as inappropriate.
