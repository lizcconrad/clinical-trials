  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel-coated
      balloon in treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions. This is a feasible study to demonstrate
      the noninferiority of paclitaxel Drug-coated balloon(DCB) only strategy for bifurcation
      lesions when compared with traditional single drug eluting stent(DES) strategy, so as to
      simplify the procedure for treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions and extending the
      clinical indications of paclitaxel DCB in China.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel DCB is designed to release anti-proliferative agents to the whole lesion rapidly
      and homogenously to inhibit excessive neointima proliferation and is associated with rapid
      healing of endothelium. As a result, DCB therapy reduces the risk of coronary thrombosis.
      Since only 1 to 3 months duration of dual anti-platelet therapy is required, the bleeding
      risk associated with prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) is reduced by DCB.
      Furthermore, there is no permanent residue of foreign bodies in the blood vessels after DCB
      procedure and this advantage completely eliminates adverse events associated with allergic
      reactions to metal, polymer and stent fracture. For side branch(SB) with a relatively small
      lumen in bifurcation lesions, DCB may neglect the lumen loss due to stent scaffolds and cause
      much less late lumen loss (LLL) than stent therapy does. For main branch(MB), no jailed SBs
      by the stent and the rate of SB stenosis or even occlusion will be greatly reduced.
