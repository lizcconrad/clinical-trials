  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this project are: (1) to refine an existing cognitive rehabilitation intervention
      and tailor it for persons with T2DM by using current literature and interview data from 10
      participants with T2DM and (2) to conduct a feasibility study of the adapted intervention
      with 20 participants with T2DM. The intervention consists of 8 weekly group educational
      sessions to teach compensatory cognitive strategies. Participants will also use a web-based,
      game-like program to build on the didactic information and practice activities to improve
      cognitive health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk for cognitive impairment and doubles the
      rate of cognitive decline after diabetes is diagnosed. In turn, the presence of cognitive
      dysfunction can make diabetes self-management more difficult. Few interventions have
      attempted to focus on cognitive function in the context of diabetes and none, to date have
      tested an intervention to improve cognition in order to improve diabetes self-management.
      Therefore the aims of this project are: (1) to refine an existing cognitive rehabilitation
      intervention and tailor it for persons with T2DM by using current literature and interview
      data from 10 participants with T2DM and (2) to conduct a feasibility study of the adapted
      intervention with 20 participants with T2DM. The intervention consists of 8 weekly group
      educational sessions to teach compensatory cognitive strategies. Additionally, participants
      will use a web-based, game-like program to build on the didactic information and practice
      activities to improve cognitive health. The project will provide baseline data for further
      research on diabetes self-management in the context of cognitive dysfunction.

    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>10 items; confidence in ability to influence outcomes. Responses are made on a 4-point scale (1 = not true at all, 2= hardly true, 3 = moderately true, 4= exactly true) to items such as &quot;I can always manage to solve difficult problems If I try hard enough.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>57 items; assesses contentment with one's memory, subjective memory capability, and use of memory aids. Participants rate their level of agreement with each item on a 5-point scale (strongly agree = 1, agree = 2, undecided = 3, disagree = 4, strongly disagree = 5) for the Contentment subscale; The Ability subscale asks participants to indicate the frequency with which each memory failure has occurred in the past 2 weeks on a 5-point scale (all the time = 1, often =2, sometimes = 3, rarely =4, never =5); The third subscale, Strategy, asks participants to rate the frequency of use of certain memory strategies on a 5-point scale (never =1, rarely =2, sometimes =3, often =4, all the time =5).</description>

    <description>Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale - Short Form Scale; 20 items assessing the frequency at which participants have exhibited certain behaviors in specific executive functioning areas over the past 6 months. The areas include: self-management to time, self-organization/problem-solving, self-restraint, self-motivation, and self-regulation of emotion. Items are measured using a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from never or rarely (1) to very often (4).</description>

    <description>20 items; measurement of depressive symptoms. Participants indicate responses on a 4-point item scale from rarely/none of the time to most/all of the time in 8 health dimensions: role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, physical functioning, bodily pain, general mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perceptions.</description>

    <description>The intervention includes 4 every other week, 2-hour educational sessions to teach compensatory strategies along with skill development and training. Educational sessions will include content on common cognitive problems experienced by people with T2DM and discussion of compensatory strategies to improve cognitive skills as well as content on behaviors and lifestyle strategies to maintain cognitive functioning. Each participant will use the online training program (BrainHQ/Posit Science) for a minimum of 45 minutes 3 times a week and to record practice times and dates. Tasks in the computer training are arranged so that as the user moves forward, the tasks become more challenging. Each task is in a game-like format.</description>

    <description>Classes will include: (1) information on diabetes self-management including glucose self-monitoring and medication management; (2) assessment of cognitive problems; (3) resources and barriers to self-management; and (4) lifestyle changes to maximize cognitive health. Participants will also practice those skills with online computer games.</description>
