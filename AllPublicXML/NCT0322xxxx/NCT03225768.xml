      Abstract

      Participation is an ultimate rehabilitation goal that is important to patients, providers,
      and insurance payers. Since the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and
      Health (ICF) published, a growing body of literature has emerged to investigate participation
      among people with functional limitations in diverse service settings. However, no research to
      date has developed an effective intervention that show promise to successfully enhance
      participation among individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke and traumatic brain
      injury (TBI).

      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of applying an intervention strategy
      that has shown promise to increase functional independence of rehabilitation patients with
      cognitive impairments, the guided training, to enhance participation performance among
      individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke and TBI in the outpatient rehabilitation
      settings in Taiwan.

      A mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) design, including a repeated measures design,
      will be used in this feasibility study. Adults (n=45-60) who had a first-time stroke or TBI
      within the past six months and have cognitive impairments will be recruited from the great
      Taipei area. These participants will receive 2 to 3 intervention sessions per week for 10 to
      15 sessions. Standardized assessments, including the Participation Measure--3 Domains, 4
      Dimensions (PM-3D4D), the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC), and the Wisconsin
      Card Sorting Task (WCST), will be used to assess participation and other functional outcomes
      at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month and 6-month follow-up. The feasibility
      indicators, such as recruitment rates and intervention attendance and adherence, will be
      evaluated by questionnaires, field notes, and qualitative interviews after the interventions
      are completed.

      Quantitative data will be analyzed descriptively; while data obtained from the outcome
      measures will be examined using Wilcoxon signed rank test and effect size (r) to compare the
      differences between the pre- and post-intervention scores. Qualitative data will be analyzed
      using thematic analysis method.

    <description>Guided training is an intervention strategy designed to help individuals identify barriers in their daily life and guide them to generate their own strategies to address these barriers. This intervention strategy is different from traditional direct skill training, in which rehabilitation practitioners are responsible for identifying their patients' challenges to perform activities and teaching them task-specific problem-solving strategies. Guided training has been applied in a variety of clinical populations, including individuals with stroke and TBI, and has demonstrated significant effect on improving independence with daily activities among persons with acute stroke-related cognitive impairments enrolled in inpatient rehabilitation.</description>
