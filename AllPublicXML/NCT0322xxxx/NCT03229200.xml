      Multicenter, open-label, prospective treatment protocol that provides continued access to
      ibrutinib to subjects who have completed parent ibrutinib studies, are still benefitting from
      treatment with ibrutinib, and have no access to commercial ibrutinib for their underlying

      Multicenter, open-label, prospective treatment protocol that provides continued access to
      ibrutinib to subjects who have completed parent ibrutinib studies, are still benefitting from
      treatment with ibrutinib, and have no access to commercial ibrutinib for their underlying
      disease within their region.

      Subjects enrolled in this treatment protocol will receive oral continuous dosing with
      ibrutinib at the same dose and schedule they were receiving at the end of the respective
      parent study. Treatment may be continued as long as the subjects continue to derive benefit
      from treatment with ibrutinib until such time that ibrutinib becomes commercially available
      for the indication of the parent study.

      Clinical evaluations (including safety assessments) will be performed per local standard of
      care for each disease that was studied in the parent protocol. At each visit, all ongoing and
      new onset non-serious AEs leading to dose reduction or discontinuation, serious adverse
      events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESI), pregnancy events, other
      malignancies, and special reporting situations will be recorded.
