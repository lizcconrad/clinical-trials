      To determine the rate and mechanisms of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in
      cirrhotic patients by using multiple tracers and single muscle biopsies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify the molecular regulatory mechanisms that result in loss
      of skeletal muscle in cirrhotic patients. Current strategies involve prolonged tracer
      infusion and multiple muscle biopsies. We will use an innovative approach to determine the
      rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown using multiple tracers administered
      at short intervals followed by a single muscle biopsy. These studies are likely to provide a
      conceptual advance in determining the cellular and molecular responses of the skeletal muscle
      in cirrhosis.

        Study population: Adults with the diagnosis of cirrhosis will be recruited from the
        hepatology inpatient service, outpatient clinics and liver transplant clinics at the
