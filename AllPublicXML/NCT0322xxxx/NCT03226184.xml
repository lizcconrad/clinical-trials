      Background:

      Even today, postoperative infection is the commonest complications after surgery although all
      aseptic precautions are taken and causes significant postoperative morbidity, mortality,
      prolongs hospital stay, and increases costs. Infections that are related to orthopaedic
      procedures are considered particularly severe when implantation materials are used which
      further increases the risk of infection and holds the risk of biofilm formation. This is of
      particular concern since biofilm-mediated infections are difficult to diagnose and effective
      treatments are lacking. Therefore, new strategies for implant infection are currently being
      researched worldwide. In this study the relatively new approach for infection control by
      using an Er:YAG laser was adapted to an orthopaedic and traumatologic setting. This laser
      vaporizes all water containing cells in a very effective, precise and predictable manner and
      shows only a minimal thermal damage.

      Methods:

      For preliminary testing 42 steel pins and 42 plates were cultivated with cocultures for 2
      weeks. The minimally necessary laser energy for biofilm removal was determined. We
      subsequently compared the effectiveness of biofilm removal with the Er:YAG laser and a
      cleansing of the metal implants with Octenidine soaked gauze. The temperature rise within the
      metal during the laser procedure was also measured.

      In order to achieve an approximation to a clinical setting we want to compared the same
      effectiveness of biofilm removal similarly on steel pins directly after explantation from
      patients treated with external fixators for at least 2 weeks. Sonication and SEM will be used
      for analysis.

      Preliminary Results Laser fluences exceeding 2.8J/cm2 caused a complete extinction of all
      living cells by a single laser impulse. Temperature rise within the implant is dependent on
      repetition frequency but overall negligible.

      The effectiveness of biofilm removal after cleansing with Octenidine soaked gauze and
      irradiation with the Er:YAG laser will be evaluated on cultivated and extracted pins.

      Conclusions We want to compare the effectiveness of the Er:YAG laser and Octenidine in the
      removal of biofilms from half-pins. We hypothesize that thee Er:YAG laser offers a secure,
      complete and non toxic removal of all kinds of pathogens from steel implants without damaging
      the implant or possible development of resistances. The precise non-contact removal of
      adjacent tissue could be an advantage over other disinfectants.

      Level of Evidence (II-a)

      Clinical Relevance:

      Having one more arrow in the quiver for disinfection of percutaneous implants or for septic
      revision surgery when osteosynthesis equipment or arthroplasties are meant to be left in
      place would be extremely desirable.
