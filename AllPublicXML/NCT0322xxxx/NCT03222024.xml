  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, prospective cohort study. The aim of this study is to investigate
      causes, risk factors, clinical course, management and outcomes of severe ischaemic stroke in
      a real-world setting in tertiary hospitals in China. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke
      from nine tertiary hospitals in western China will be recruited. Participants will be visited
      within 24 hours after admission, on day 3, day 7 and at discharge, to collect their clinical
      data, blood biomarkers, and brain imaging. A structured telephone interview will be conducted
      for each participant at 3 months and 1 year after stroke onset, respectively, to collect
      their functional outcomes. In-hospital outcomes include haemorrhagic transformation, brain
      oedema and death, 3-month and 1-year outcomes include survival status (death or survival) and
      functional outcome (scores of modified Rankin scale, mRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nine tertiary hospitals in Western China are participating in the study. In each
      participating hospital, stroke patients admitted to the Department of Neurology will be
      screened by their responsible doctors for eligibility. For patients who are potentially
      eligible, the doctor will introduce this study in detail with written information to the
      patient or their legal proxies. After participants (or their proxies) sign the consent form,
      investigators will collect their baseline data within 24 hours after admission (visit 1).
      Subsequent visits will be conducted on day 3 of admission or if the patient experiences
      neurological deterioration between visit 1 and day 3 (visit 2), on day 7 of admission or if
      neurological deterioration occurs between visit 2 and day 7 (visit 3), and on the day before
      discharge or on day 30 of admission, whichever is earlier (visit 4). At visit 1 investigators
      will record demographics, medical history, characteristics of current stroke, and results of
      the blood tests, brain imaging and other examinations, if applicable. At visit 4,
      investigators will record interventions and rehabilitation used during hospitalisation. At
      day 90 and 1 year of stroke onset, a trained investigator (neurologist) blind to all medical
      information will contact the participant to deliver a structured telephone interview and
      collect their functional outcomes.

      Objectives of this study are: a) to explore causes of clinical worsening in acute ischaemic
      stroke, and for each type of clinical worsening to dynamically evaluate its clinical course
      and explore its risk factors; b) to explore the application of conventional stroke therapies
      in patients with severe ischaemic stroke in China; c) to investigate factors precipitating
      and predisposing malignant brain oedema following acute ischaemic stroke; and d) to better
      select patients with malignant brain oedema for individualised treatment strategies.
