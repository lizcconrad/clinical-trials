      This is a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib Hydrochloride Cream
      in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Icotinib Hydrochloride is an oral, small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for treating advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) in China. Over-expressions of EGFR and its downstream signaling proteins are
      implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and TKIs have been considered as potential
      antipsoriatic agents. Icotinib hydrochloride is being developed as a cream for the treatment
      of mild to moderate psoriasis. This is a multicenter , randomized, doubleblind, four-arm
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      icotinib hydrochloride cream (1.0%, 2.0%, 4.0%) in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis.
      Approximately 260 subjects will be enrolled.

    <description>PASI: Combined assessment of lesion area and severity affected into single score. The body was divided into four sections [head (10% of a person's total skin); arms (20%); trunk (30%); legs (40%)]. For each section, the area of skin involved was scored from 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and the severity of skin involved was estimated by clinical signs (erythema, induration, and desquamation) to score from 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = Sum of severity score for each section * area score * weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4). PASI 50 represents the percentage (or number) of patients who have achieved a 50% or more reduction in their PASI score from baseline.</description>
