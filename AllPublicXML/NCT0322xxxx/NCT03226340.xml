      Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of S-amlodipine+Chlorthalidone Combination Therapy and

      The aim of this study is to verify the difference at week 12 from the baseline value in the
      average variation of diastolic blood pressure (sitDBP) of the study group in which
      S-amlodipine / Chlorthalidone combination therapy is to be used in patients with essential
      hypertension who did not adequately respond to monotherapy of amlodipine or S-amlodipine,
      compared to the control group, in which a combination therapy of S-amlodipine / telmisartan
      is to be used.
