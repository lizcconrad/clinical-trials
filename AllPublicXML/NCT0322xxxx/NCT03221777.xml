    <textblock>
      Rationale Atrial fibrillation (AF) often occurs transiently in the setting of an acute
      stressor (e.g.

      medical illness or surgery). Uncertainty exists as to whether AF Occurring Transiently with
      Stress (AFOTS) is secondary to a reversible precipitant and is benign, or is a first
      presentation of paroxysmal AF and associated with a risk of stroke. AFOTS is a common
      occurrence (&gt;40% in some intensive care settings), but there is a lack of evidence to guide
      its management and guidelines have called for further research in this area. Retrospective
      data suggest that many patients with AFOTS (&gt;50%) will experience recurrent AF. These
      estimates were obtained without using sensitive methods for AF detection, which raises the
      possibility that the true rate of recurrent AF is much higher. As the rate of recurrent AF
      increases, it becomes increasingly likely that AFOTS is just the first detection of typical
      &quot;clinical&quot; AF.

      Objective To use a sensitive strategy to determine the rate of recurrent AF among patients
      who experienced AFOTS following i) non-cardiac surgery OR ii) medical illness, compared to
      matched controls.

      Methods Two multi-centre, 138-patient, observational cohorts. AFOTS patients will have new
      AF, documented by 12-Lead ECG or surface monitoring, during hospitalization for non- cardiac
      surgery (Cohort 1) or medical illness (Cohort 2).

      Controls will be patients without a history of AF who are matched for age (within 5 years),
      sex and exposure to stressor. Participants will wear a 14-day ECG monitor at 1 and 6 months
      after discharge. The endpoint is detection of AF.

      Impact

      If the incidence of AF after AFOTS is &gt;80%, clinicians could be advised to treat AFOTS like
      &quot;clinical&quot; AF and initiate anticoagulation according to guidelines. Otherwise, a strategy of
      surveillance for AF would be advised.

      Hypothesis

        1. Patients who experience AFOTS will have a higher future incidence of AF and of stroke
           compared to patients exposed to a similar stressor but who did not develop AF.

        2. The risk of recurrent AF after AFOTS will be sufficiently high (&gt; 80%) to warrant
           routine initiation of long-term OAC in all cases.

    <intervention_name>14 Day ECG Patch (Zio XT Patch, iRhythm Technologies)</intervention_name>
    <description>The ZIO XT Patch (http://www.irhythmtech.com/zio-solution/zio-patch/) is an ultra-portable wearable adhesive patch monitor that provides continuous single-lead ECG recording for up to 14 days. It has been cleared by the FDA for arrhythmia detection and is in current clinical use in the U.S.[87]. It will be used in this study under an investigational testing authorization by Health Canada. The ZIO XT Patch is a single-use device worn over the left pectoral region with a skin adhesive (Figure 4). Its small, lightweight, water-resistant, patch-based design has advantages for patients compared with traditional ECG screening methods (e.g. Holter, event loop recorders, mobile outpatient telemetry systems), which are all more cumbersome and require detachable wired leads, two or more removable skin contact electrodes, plus separate recording units (+/- smartphone attachment).</description>
