             90 mmHg after 5 minutes of rest. Minor excursions in blood pressure outside of this

             physician or medical monitor.

          6. Have resting pulse rate (sitting) within normal range of 60-100 bpm. Minor excursions
             in resting pulse outside of this range may be acceptable if determined not to be
             clinically significant by the study physician or the medical monitor.

          7. Females must be either postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile
             (bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, tubal occlusion, hysterectomy), or using
             adequate contraception from screening until 90 days after completion of study
             participation. Adequate contraception is defined as true abstinence, a vasectomized
             partner, or one of the following in combination with a diaphragm, cervical cap, or a
             condom:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (oral, implant, patch, injection)

               -  Intrauterine device

             Males must use adequate contraception and must not donate sperm from first admission
             to the clinical research center until 90 days after completion of study participation.
             Adequate contraception is defined as true abstinence, vasectomy, a partner who is
             surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, tubal occlusion,
             hysterectomy), or one of the following in combination with a diaphragm, cervical cap,
             or a condom:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (oral, implant, patch, injection)

               -  Intrauterine device

          8. Have a body weight above 50 kg and below 90 kg (inclusive).

          9. Be able to communicate effectively with the study personnel and understand and comply

          2. Current use or has used tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (e.g., cigarettes,
             cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, etc.) 30 days prior to investigational product
             administration. A cotinine test (with a cut-off of 200 mg) will be performed at
             screening and admission to the study center.

          3. Recent history (i.e. within 2 years) of alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, or
             significant mental illness.

          4. Positive screen for substances of abuse.

          5. A positive screening result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, Hepatitis
             B surface antigen (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV).

          6. Any disease or condition (medical or surgical) that might compromise a major body
             system (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, etc.) or conditions that may interfere with
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study medication.

          7. Any bleeding disorders or use of anticoagulants.

          8. Any conditions (e.g. diabetes, edema, scleroderma) or receiving medications (e.g.
             steroids, antibiotics) that alter skin integrity and/or healing. Any known condition
             or receiving medications causing hypo/hyperpigmentation or photosensitivity.

          9. Presence or history of hypertension or other cardiovascular abnormalities such as, but
             not limited to, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, or
             peripheral vascular disease or any other cardiovascular disease that requires the
             subject to wear a pacemaker.

         10. Use of a drug therapy known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism within 30
             days prior to the Treatment visit for dosing.

         11. Patient has received a live attenuated vaccine within the 4 weeks prior to treatment
             or plans to receive one during the study.

             dye product.

         15. Subjects who have used ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like
             dihydrogergotamine or methysergide) within the past week. The Imitrex® label specifies
             that these medication are contraindicated within 24 hours of use.

             interactions with sumatriptan: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
             serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and
             monomine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
             Subjects receiving these medications may enroll in the study if these medications have
             been discontinued for 5 or more half-lives prior to the first Treatment visit.

         19. Participation in the treatment phase of a clinical study or receipt of an
             investigational drug or medical device within 30 days prior to the Treatment visit for

             for dosing.

         22. Subjects who have skin conditions or tattoos extensive enough to cover areas where the
             device is to be applied.

         23. Any history of skin contact sensitivity to metals, plastics or adhesives.

         24. Has a condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may increase the risk to the
