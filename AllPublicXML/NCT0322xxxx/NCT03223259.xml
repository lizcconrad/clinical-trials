  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A group of dance educators will attend two dance injury prevention workshops hosted by the
      Harkness Center for Dance Injuries (HCDI), NYU Langone Medical Center, during which
      participants will learn strategies to help them train their students in safe ways and impart
      injury prevention information through their dance classes to their students. The educators
      will take pre- and post-workshop tests to assess knowledge and perceptions of dance medicine.
      Several weeks later, participants will take a follow-up survey to assess knowledge
      implementation and workshop effectiveness.
