  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that anodal tDCS applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) improved episodic memory performance, indicating a possible use as an intervention
      for patients suffering from memory impairments. At the same time, only scant evidence
      (provided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRS)) exists regarding the underlying mechanisms, thus hindering a more targeted
      application.

      The present study aims at establishing a connection between the stimulation-induced change in
      episodic memory performance on the behavioural level and neurophysiological parameters. TDCS
      effects and the underlying mechanisms will be compared between different study conditions,
      receiving either real anodal tDCS or sham stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex during an episodic memory task.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to two possible sequences of stimulation conditions. Group 1 will receive real tDCS stimulation to the left dlPFC during encoding on the first day and sham stimulation on the second day, and group 2 will receive sham stimulation during encoding on the first day and real tDCS on the second day. The participants will be randomized with equal probability to each of the two groups, using block randomization..</intervention_model_description>
