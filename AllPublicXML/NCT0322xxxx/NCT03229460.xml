      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of hign-flow nasal therapy on the adult
      with hypercapnia and hpoxemia respiratory faliure in comparison with standard oxygen therapy
      ang noninvasive ventilation.

    <description>In the high-flow-oxygen group is passed through a heated humidifier and applied continuously through large-bore binasal prongs, with a gas flow rate of 30-60 liters per minute . The fraction of oxygen in the gas flowing in the system was subsequently adjusted to maintain an Spo2 of 92% or more.</description>

    <description>The patient will receive successively in a day NPPV and O2-HFN. The NPPV will be applied with an airway humidification achieved by using a heated humidifier and a facial mask adapted to the morphology of the patient. The settings will be adjusted as follow : an inspiratory pressure between 6 to 14 cmH2O, in order to obtain a tidal volume between 7 to 10 ml/kg of predicted weight, a positive expiratory pressure between 0 to 10 cmH2O in order to obtain a SpO2 &gt;92% with the minimal FiO2.</description>
