      The research study, &quot;Smoker-to-Smoker (S2S) Peer Marketing and Messaging to Disseminate
      Tobacco Interventions&quot; will test two smoker-driven, social marketing innovations to recruit
      and engage smokers in Decide2Quit.org (Decide2Quit), which is an evidence-based, effective
      &quot;Digital Intervention for Smoking Cessation&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S2S has many innovations that are designed to utilize the power of peers and social networks
      for dissemination. These include: Peer recruitment: Tools to facilitate smokers' recruiting
      their peers to increase Decide2Quit access; and a recommender computer tailored health
      communication (recommender CTHC): a Complex machine learning algorithm (recommender systems)
      that uses smokers' feedback (explicit and implicit) in the current and prior studies to adapt
      its selection of messages to smokers.

      Using a 2×2 factorial design, the study will compare individually and collectively the
      enhancements (recruitment, use, and effectiveness) offered by the S2S functions over the
      standard version of Decide2Quit (online recruitment and standard CTHC), an active comparison
      group.

    <measure>Repeated use of Decide2Quit functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study (tracked for 6 months post registration)</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by, an ordinal scale of number of Decide2Quit functions used after the first DISC visit (0: no functions used; 1: use of 1-2 functions, 2: &gt; 2 functions used).</description>

    <measure>Recruitment time</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline Registration</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as: each individual participant's recruitment date minus the date of the first participant's registration. Based on this formula, the first participant will have a recruitment time of 0 days and the last participant could have a maximum recruitment time of 3 years (1095 days).</description>
