  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, 5-visit, partial subject masked, 2x3 bilateral crossover,
      dispensing clinical trial. During the study, each test article will be worn in a daily wear
      modality for at least 6 hours per day and 5 days per week for approximately 2 weeks each. The
      subject will wear either the Test or Control article twice and the other study article once.
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the Test lens works as well, if
      not better compared to the Control lens with respect to CLUE (Contact Lens User Experience)
      comfort, Slit Lamp findings, and Distance Monocular logMAR Visual Acuity. This study will
      also aim to show acceptable lens fit for subjects wearing the Test lens.

    <time_frame>2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp findings (SLF) were graded using a FDA Grade Scale, 0 = None, 1 = Slight, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Significant, 4 = Advanced. Measurements were taken in each subject eye at the initial visit and the two-week follow-up evaluation. The proportion of subject eyes with SLF grade 3 or higher will be reported for each lens.</description>

    <measure>Distance Monocular Contact lens Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Distance monocular contact lens visual acuity (logMAR-Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) will be assessed for each subject eye at the 2-week follow-up evaluation under high illumination high contrast. The average LogMAR will be reported for each lens.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fit Acceptance Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptable lens fit will be assessed at all scheduled visits for each subject eye. Lens fitting is reported as a binary response recorded as Yes-acceptable lens fit and No-unacceptable lens fit. The percentage of eyes with acceptable fit will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort scores are assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response (2016).</description>
