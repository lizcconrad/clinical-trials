  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV clinical trial observing and evaluating the safety of proton therapy in
      children. Protocol therapy is not being done as part of this clinical trial. The radiation
      targeting, planning, prescribed dose, fractionation, schedule, and use of other forms of
      therapy will be done per other therapeutic protocols at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
      (SJCRH) at the discretion of the treating physicians associated with those trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the clinical trial being described in this registration, participants will be observed to
      collect data for baseline assessment of disease and patient characteristics. This will be
      done before proton therapy on other trials followed by serial standard-of-care clinical
      assessments to evaluate acute and late complications, disease control, treatment-related
      mortality, and overall survival.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the incidence of radiation associated grade 3 and grade 4 non-hematologic
           toxicities at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years in a radiated region specific manner after the
           initiation of proton therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the incidence of necrosis, vasculopathy, and symptomatic and permanent
           neurologic deficits at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after the initiation of proton therapy in
           children treated for central nervous system (CNS) tumors in an irradiated region
           directed manner.

        -  To estimate the incidence of treatment-related mortality at 5 and 10 years after the
           initiation of proton therapy.

        -  To estimate the incidence of subsequent malignancies at 5 and 10 years after the
           initiation of proton therapy in an irradiated region directed manner.

        -  To estimate the incidence of fracture and osteonecrosis at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after
           the initiation of proton therapy in children treated for musculoskeletal tumors in an
           irradiated region directed manner.

        All participants will be patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. They must meet
        eligibility criteria to be considered for enrollment. No one group (based on gender, race
        or ethnicity) will be targeted or excluded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is planned for treatment or has been treated with proton therapy at St.
             Jude Children's Research Hospital on or after November 18, 2015.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently pregnant will not be enrolled in the study as radiation has
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. In the rare case that a patient was previously
             pregnant as a young adult, the patient will be considered eligible for enrollment.
