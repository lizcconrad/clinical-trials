  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of subcutaneous (SC) injections of RO7049665 in healthy volunteers. In
      addition, pharmacokinetics (PK) of RO7049665, the effects of single doses of RO7049665 on
      regulatory T-cells as well as the single dose immunogenicity of RO7049665 will be evaluated.
      This trial plans to evaluate approximately seven single dose-levels of RO7049665 or
      matching-placebo during dose-escalation in approximately 40 participants.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
