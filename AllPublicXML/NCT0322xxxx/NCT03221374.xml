  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT), in the forms of various yoga and meditative practices,
      has become increasingly prevalent due to an increase in awareness of the potential health
      benefits, and improvements in concentration that this training can provide to practitioners.
      In the present study, the role of Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT) in the initial learning
      of a sensorimotor (SMR) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is being investigated. The
      hypothesis is that MBAT will improve performance in SMR based BCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the following hypothesis will be tested; namely that MBAT including the
      verified mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) course will improve the ability for
      subjects to concentrate on the control of the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI.
      Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training. The performance
      of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis.
      Procedures involved include a standard 8-week MBSR course, and an EEG brain noninvasive brain
      computer interface study.
