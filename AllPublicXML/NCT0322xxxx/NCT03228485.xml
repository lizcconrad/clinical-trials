    <textblock>
      This study assesses the feasibility, and acceptability of a (mobile) application for men
      presenting at the general practitioner with LUTS/BPH; starting with medical therapy and naïve
      for treatment. Patients will be enrolled in the study by their general practitioner. The
      patients will receive a daily medication reminder including frequent feedback on medication
      adherence. Furthermore standard questionnaires will be filled out via the application. The
      hypothesis of this pilot study is that application is feasible and accepted in this group of
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      One of the next developments in healthcare is digitalization, including (mobile) applications
      that could support healthcare providers. A significant number of aging men suffer from lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), often caused by benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). LUTS/BPH is
      primarily treated by general practitioners (GPs) or urologists. Optimal evaluation of
      patients with LUTS/BPH, treatment selection and follow-up by the physicians and medication
      adherence are essential in the management of LUTS. This pilot project represents a strong
      collaboration between a urological association, urologists and general practitioners in
      supporting healthcare improvement for LUTS/BPH with use of an (mobile) application. The
      hypothesis is that the (mobile) application can support the patient in medication adherence
      and improve the adherence by feedback and that the application can help to collect objective
      disease information with electronic questionnaires.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to assess the feasibility, and acceptability of a (mobile)
      application for men presenting at the general practitioner with LUTS/BPH; starting with
      medical therapy and naïve for treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to identify potential gaps, clarify controversial points of the
      application, to document the communication between patients, GPs and urologists in order to
      optimize (if necessary) the application, to assess medication adherence and to record if
      treatment provided by GPs is in compliance with the guidelines recommendations.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility is assessed by the application use of patients. The patients application will be judged as Definitely Feasible if the study is completed for ≥70% eligible patients, Possibly Feasible (completed for 50-69% eligible patients) or Not Feasible (completed for &lt;50%).</description>

    <measure>Acceptability and satisfaction of a mobile application for LUTS</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess the acceptance and satisfaction of the mobile application including the application subjective quality and perceived impact, a questionnaire will be used. This questionnaire is based on a standardized application rating questionnaire, namely the user Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Outcomes are described and compared between centers.</description>

        The population will be men, age ≥ 40, presenting at their GP with LUTS/BPH symptoms and a
        clear history for LUTS/BPH medication.

        The study will be conducted by three centers in three countries, namely the Department of
        Urology, AMC University Hospital in The Netherlands, the Institute for Monitoring of
        Urogenital Diseases in Larissa, Greece and a third center in Spain. The participating GPs
        will be from these areas and thus so will the participants.
