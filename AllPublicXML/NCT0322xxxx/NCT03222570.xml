  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two adaptive treatment
      strategies (ATSs) for adolescent depression. The ATSs include delivery of an evidence-based
      psychotherapy (interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed adolescents, IPT-A), systematic
      symptom monitoring, and an empirically-derived algorithm that specifies whether, when, and
      how to augment IPT-A. Two hundred depressed adolescents (age 12-18) will be recruited to
      participate in a 16-week sequential multiple assignment randomized trial conducted in
      outpatient community mental health clinics. Adolescents will be randomized to the IPT-A ATS
      condition or the community clinic's usual care (UC). Adolescents in the IPT-A ATS condition
      who are insufficient responders will be randomized a second time to the addition of a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or more intensive IPT-A (delivered twice per
      week). Research assessments will be administered at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and
      36.

    <description>Adolescents begin with an initial treatment plan of 12 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed adolescents (IPT-A). Depressive symptoms will be assessed systematically over the course of therapy. If an adolescent demonstrates an insufficient response to IPT-A at one of these assessments, the dose of IPT-A will be increased by scheduling sessions twice per week for 4 weeks (16 sessions total).</description>

    <description>IPT-A is an evidence-based intervention that aims to decrease depressive symptoms by helping adolescents improve their relationships and interpersonal interactions. It addresses one or more of four interpersonal problem areas: grief, role disputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits. The primary treatment techniques in IPT-A include emotion identification/expression, linking interpersonal events to mood, communication analysis, communication skill building, decision analysis, role playing, and assignment of interpersonal experiments (i.e. homework). In clinical trials, depressed adolescents treated with IPT-A demonstrated fewer depressive symptoms and better psychosocial functioning post-treatment than adolescents in control conditions.</description>
