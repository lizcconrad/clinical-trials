  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implantable pulse generator (IPG) is a device that generates electrical current to
      stimulate the spine, heart, or brain for various chronic conditions. In neurosurgery, the IPG
      is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket under the collarbone. This pocket is highly avascular
      and thus, antibiotics administered intravenously cannot reach a potential surgical site
      infection (SSI). SSIs cause millions of health care dollars to be wasted due to repeat
      surgery and hospital re-admissions. We hope to to determine the effects of &quot;intrawound
      vancomycin-saline and IV antibiotics&quot; compared to &quot;saline and IV antibiotics&quot; on the
      incidence of IPG SSI rates 6-months post-surgery.

      Patients requiring neurosurgical IPG replacements will be recruited into this trial on a
      volunteer basis. The subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either the
      treatment arm (intrawound Vancomycin-saline + IV antibiotics) or control arm (intrawound
      saline + IV antibiotics alone) by site in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size calculation using STplan
      determined that 405 patients per arm is required to reduce overall infection rate from 3.5%
      to 0.5% (80% power, Î±=0.05, two-tailed). Final sample size per arm will be 410 after
      generously accounting for loss to follow-up, non-compliance, and unrelated death.

      The primary outcome will be a binary Yes/No on if IPG explantation due to infection was
      required within 6-months post-surgery.

      This is a superiority trial and we hypothesize intrawound Vancomycin-saline + IV antibiotics
      is superior to intrawound saline + IV antibiotics alone. An intention-to-treat analysis will
      be applied in a blinded manner once all patients have completed the trial and the database is
      locked.

      The results of this trial will not only be applicable to neurosurgery, but also spine and
      cardiology.
