  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of epicondylitis refers to the manifestation of pain ni the area of insertation
      of the epicondile muscles, and that it is accompained by limitation funcional.A tendinopathy
      is characterized as a process of degenaration, with fibroblast proliferation and
      disorganization of the fibers of collagen. This tendon pathology especially affects the
      epicondyle extensors and especially the first and second radial and short extensor carpal.

      Eccentric exercises of the epicondyle muscles were performed in 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
      Participants were asked to perform the exercise program on an individual basis twice every
      day for 4 weeks. The eccentric program consisted of 3 exercises, focusing on the epicondyle
      muscles. Participants were asked to do a normal flexion extension (concentric phase) and a
      slow return to the initial position (eccentric phase) included first the concentric phase,
      and the eccentric phase was slowly conducted. The exercise program was taught by a
      physiotherapist in the first session and monitored in the subsequent sessions.
