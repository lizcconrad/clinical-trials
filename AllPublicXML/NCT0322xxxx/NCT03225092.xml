    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the potential effects of platelet rich plasma for the treatment
      of persistent medial knee pain after total knee arthroplasty. All study participants will
      receive PRP injections and will be followed up to see if any benefit in regards to pain
      and/or function is achieved.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for the
      treatment of persistent medial knee pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The
      investigators hypothesize that PRP injections will provide meaningful pain relief and
      improved functionality for patients suffering from post-TKA residual pain. The incidence of
      residual pain after TKA ranges between 10-34% (Beswick et al). Many of these patients can be
      effectively managed by physical therapy, orthotics, and pes anserine bursa corticosteroid
      injections. However, there remain a number of refractory cases that are frustrating for both
      the patient and physician. With the advent of interventional pain management, advanced
      interventions for this clinical problem have focused on selective nerve blocks and ablations
      targeting the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve (Shi et al). More recently,
      attention has been paid to the role of patient biology and inflammatory mediators in the
      development of post-arthroplasty pain (including IL-6 and CRP) (Preston et al). If individual
      patient biology is the foundation of post-TKA pain, then biologic interventions aimed at
      restoring the balance of these mediators (such as PRP), rather than ablative procedures,
      seems preferable. Furthermore, while intra-operative PRP has been studied for its effects on
      wound healing, blood loss, and post-operative pain control, no study has investigated its
      utility in treating residual medial knee pain after TKA.

      All injections will be performed by the same board-certified sports medicine and
      musculoskeletal ultrasound physician. There will be no activity restrictions following the
      procedure.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to report mean changes in outcome scores. Data will be
      analyzed with a 2-sample t-test.
