  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to evaluate the short and long term effectiveness of a
      tailored assessment and educational intervention on motor control of the pelvic floor muscle
      in menopausal and non-menopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menopausal transition has been related to stress urinary incontinence. The transition from
      the reproductive to the non-reproductive period is induced by a decrease in sex hormone
      production in the ovaries. Climacteric-stage oestrogen deficiency produces genital and
      urinary tract atrophy, which may be related to symptoms such as urinary frequency, urinary
      urgency, nocturia incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infection. Urinary incontinence
      seems to appear due to a combination of factors such as pelvic floor weakness and tearing,
      denervation and fascial tears as well as both loss of motor units and altered activation
      patterns. However, physiotherapy can treat weakness and altered motor control in order to
      compensate for other factors. In fact, physiotherapy is considered the treatment of first
      choice.

      Besides evidence defending physiotherapy as first line conservative therapy in incontinence
      due to influence of strength and motor control in this pathology and its prevalence in
      perimenopause women, little is known about its effects in this population. Hence, the aim of
      this study is to evaluate the short and long term effectiveness of a tailored assessment and
      educational intervention on motor control of the pelvic floor muscle in menopausal and
      peri-menopausal women.

    <measure>Motor Control of Pelvic Floor Muscle by single questionnare</measure>
    <time_frame>inmediate effect post education</time_frame>
    <description>Women will report an outcome regarding tightening capacity after intervention. It consisted of a one item questionnaire about pelvic floor contraction capacity. It is chosen by the expert panel developed by researcher from this project. The item is a question regarding tightening capacity and it had a polychotomous answer:
&quot;How is the tightening capacity of your pelvic floor muscles?
a) very high, b) high, c) good, d) optimal, e) bad, f) low, g) very low&quot;</description>

    <measure>Interview about urinary incontinence</measure>

    <description>Women will also underwent an interview about urinary incontinence with a physiotherapist from the Consulting Unit of Physiotherapy of the Pelvic Floor. The questionnaire consisted of 38 items regarding delivery conditions, faecal and urinary incontinence as well as medical conditions and lifestyle. This interview includes information from descriptive outcomes reported by the clinician, so pelvic floor muscles will be evaluated by both manual muscle testing and a perineometer. Hence, this interview has both qualitative and quantitative reponses.</description>

    <measure>The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ-UI SHORT FORM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, inmediate effect post education and 2,4 and 12 weeks. Long time effect 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ is a simple and short questionnaire to assess the symptoms and impact of UI across the population. It consists of 3 items which indicate frequency, quantity and impact, and 8 questions more related to the symptoms indicative of the type of UI, but not being contemplated when obtaining a global index. The ICIQ-UI short form has a good reliability with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95. It was validated in Spanish by Espuña et al, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.89</description>

    <description>Intervention will consist of 45 minutes of anatomy education, pelvic floor assessment and neuromuscular re-education. Women will be given an explanation of how the pelvis is composed, including the viscera and pelvic floor function and anatomy, through a simple explanatory sheet. They will be also informed of the causes of pelvic floor deterioration as well as its consequences.. Neuromuscular re-education will continued by teaching them how to perform slow contractions, fast contractions and lifting contraction. They will be also shown vaginal cones and advised on possible treatment methods if they were needed. After that, women will be given a tip sheet to improve pelvic floor function. Those recommendations will included: Tips to take into account during habits like urination, doing sport, gymnastics or any efforts, pelvic floor muscles exercises and how to use vaginal cones adequately.</description>
