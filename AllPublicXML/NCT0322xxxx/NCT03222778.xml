  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the perioperative or critical care of hemodynamically unstable patients, appropriate fluid
      resuscitation guided by reliable preload indices is of pivotal importance as only half of
      them are fluid responsive, and that empiric fluid administration actually leads to dismal
      prognosis. In the continuum of being non-invasive, combinations of tissue Doppler-derived
      parameters of early (e') and late (a') diastolic, and peak systolic velocity (s') of the
      mitral annulus provide information regarding the systolic dysfunction and preload (e'/s'),
      and LV stiffness (e'/a'). Hence, combining LVEDAI with these indices would provide
      comprehensive information regarding the LV dimension, preload, and compliance as well as
      systolic function. Yet, its role as a preload index has not been tested before. Moreover,
      these values can be reliably obtained regardless of the heart rhythm, except for a', and do
      not completely rely on heart-lung interaction as opposed to the dynamic indices. Thus, the
      aim of this prospective trial is to investigate the role of LVEDAI combined with e', a' and
      s' as a preload index in predicting fluid responsiveness in patients scheduled for off-pump
      coronary bypass surgery, both in closed- and open-chest conditions.
