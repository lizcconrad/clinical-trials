    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well web-based physical activity intervention
      works in improving long term health in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia that shows a decrease in or disappearance of signs and symptoms.
      Regular physical activity after receiving treatment for cancer may help to maintain a healthy
      weight and improve energy levels and overall health.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on
      fitness among children and adolescents following treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on
      markers of cardiometabolic health among children and adolescents following treatment for ALL.

      II. To evaluate the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on
      physical activity, quality of life, fatigue, and school attendance among children and
      adolescents following treatment for ALL.

      III. To determine if the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on
      markers of cardiometabolic health is mediated by changes in fitness among children and
      adolescents following treatment for ALL.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive educational handouts about physical activity and are encouraged to
      increase physical activity to at least 420 minutes per week. Patients wear Sqord activity
      monitor daily and upload data at least once a week to the Sqord website. Patients also access
      the limited version of Sqord website to get basic information related to their physical
      activity for 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive educational handouts about physical activity and are encouraged to
      increase physical activity to at least 420 minutes per week. Patients wear Sqord activity
      monitor daily and upload data at least once a week to the Sqord website. Patients also access
      the full version of the interactive-reward based Sqord website to see their activity, earn
      activity points, see other Sqord player's activity, and interact with other Sqord members for
      6 months.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 and 48 weeks.

    <description>It will be determined if the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on markers of cardiometabolic health is mediated by changes in fitness among children and adolescents following treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A causal inference approach will be used to evaluate whether or not group assignment results in an improved outcome in the presence of a lower PCI. This requires decomposing the averaged total effect into indirect (mediation effects of fitness) and direct effects of group assignment of on the cardiometabolic outcomes. A principal stratification method that classifies participants into strata based on their performance on the PCI (mediator variable) for each group of the randomized intervention.</description>

    <description>Differences in PCI will be compared between groups at the end of the intervention. Intent to treat analysis of variance (either transforming the data or employing a non-parametric equivalent if the data are not normally distributed) controlling for the stratification factors (sex, age, and treatment related risk group) will be used for comparison. General linear mixed models will be utilized to evaluate the effects of group assignment on changes in PCI over time to account for repeated measures on individual children, and for potential random effects such as original treating institution.</description>
