  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine mediates smoking's addictive effects in the brain. The ratio of 3-hydroxycotinine to
      cotinine, known as the nicotine metabolite ratio, or NMR, is a genetically- informed
      biomarker reflecting hepatic CYP2A6 activity and the rate of nicotine metabolism. In light of
      a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) in humans in Lancet Respiratory Medicine, which
      found that the NMR can be used to individualize treatment for smokers, our pilot study aims
      to determine the feasibility of using NMR to guide selection of pharmacotherapy in clinical
      populations of daily smokers.

      Consenting participants will be assigned to guideline-based care (GBC: incorporating national
      guidelines and more recent evidence from clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for smoking
      cessation) or metabolism-informed care (MIC: identical to GBC but selection of medication
      based on NMR result). All participants received counseling from a nurse level certified
      tobacco counseling. After consent, participants undergo a blood draw for NMR, complete a
      baseline questionnaire, and are randomized to GBC or MIC. At approximately 1, 3, and 6 months
      post-consent, participants will provide follow up information via telephone questionnaire
      regarding symptoms, confidence in quitting, use of medications, and smoking status. At the
      6-month follow-up time point, if a participant self-reports abstinence from smoking, the
      participant will be asked to complete a survey in-person and provide a sample of end-expired
      carbon monoxide for biochemical validation. At the 6 month time point, GBC participants who
      continue to smoke will be offered an additional phone call from the nurse tobacco counselor
      in which the results of the baseline NMR test will be given, along with a second prescription
      for a smoking cessation medication based on the NMR results (i.e., single arm crossover
      design). Two weeks after this additional phone call, the patient will be contacted for a
      final survey regarding use of medication and smoking status.

    <description>Smoking Cessation Pharmacotherapy (varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine patch) recommendations were guided by Nicotine Metabolism as measured by the Nicotine Metabolite Ratio. Ultimately, after being educated about smoking cessation medication efficacy and side-effects, the participant could decide to take any medication for which they were medically cleared, but the recommendation was made based on rate of Nicotine Metabolism.</description>
