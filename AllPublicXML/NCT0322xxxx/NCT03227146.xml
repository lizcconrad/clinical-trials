  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIb trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EHSG-KF (synonym denovoSkin)
      in comparison to meshed STSG in adult patients with partial deep dermal and full thickness
      burns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre phase IIb clinical trial will target adult patients with severe burns to
      elucidate the benefit of a tissue-engineered autologous skin substitute for the patient group
      with the highest mortality rates. Particular emphasis, apart from safety, will be placed on
      efficacy, including the ratio of covered surface area to harvested surface area and scar
      quality, in comparison to meshed STSG.

          -  Deep partial thickness and/or full thickness burns requiring surgical wound coverage

          -  Expected that ≥90cm2 of wound will remain open at 4 weeks post burn despite proceeding
             with treatment in accordance with the standard of care,

          -  &gt;25% TBSA burn

          -  Signed Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients tested positive for HBV, HCV, syphilis or HIV

          -  Patients with known underlying or concomitant medical conditions that may interfere
             with normal wound healing (e.g. systemic skin and connective tissue diseases, any kind
             of congenital defect of metabolism including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
             Cushing syndrome or disease, scurvy, chronic hypothyroidism, congenital or acquired
             immunosuppressive condition, chronic renal failure, or chronic hepatic dysfunction
             (Child-Pugh class B or C), severe malnutrition, or other concomitant illness which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, has the potential to significantly delay wound
             healing)

             Investigator's discretion

          -  Patients allergic to amphotericin B and gentamicin

          -  Previous enrolment of the patient into the current phase II study

             days preceding and during the present study

          -  Patients expected not to comply with the study protocol (including patients with
             severe cognitive dysfunction/impairment and severe psychiatric disorders)

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females
