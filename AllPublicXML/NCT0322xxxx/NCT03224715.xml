  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that ultraviolet (UV) light causes sunburn and DNA damage that can lead to
      skin cancer. Despite preventative measures of sunscreens and other topicals the incidence of
      skin cancers continues to increase every year. Chronic exposure can lead to development of
      both basal and squamous cell carcinoma that also is correlated to the risk of melanoma. When
      epidermal keratinocytes are exposed to UV radiation, they form cyclobutane pyrimidine dimmers
      (CPDs), 6-pyrimidine-4-pyrimidones (6-4-PPs), and oxygen radicals that alter the structure of
      nucleotides. When these lesions are not repaired, DNA replication is altered that leads to
      mutations in p53 and PTCH tumor suppressor gene and ultimately tumor development. It has been
      discovered that intracellular delivery of bacterial DNA incision repair enzyme T4
      endonuclease V DNA repair enzymes can repair sun induced damaged DNA in patients with
      xeroderma pigmentosum4,. Yarosh et al also showed that T4 endonuclease V DNA repair enzymes
      are specific to reducing the amount of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and were found to lower
      the rate of new actinic keratoses compared to placebo lotion by 68% with no adverse effects
      observed. Additionally Yarosh et al also showed that T4N5 liposomes can repair keratinocyte
      DNA in skin cancer patients. This study will examine if pretreating actinic cheilitis with
      DNA repair enzyme cream before standard treatments can decrease the need for additional and
      possibly more aggressive therapies, decrease the surface area of affected areas, and possibly
      improve skin thickening and texture.
