    <textblock>
      Patients who have concussions exhibit an array of symptoms, also known as post-concussive
      symptoms, including headaches, feeling slowed down or foggy and difficulty with
      concentration. This study aims to determine if cranial osteopathy can provide additional or
      expedited symptom relief when accompanying current conventional treatments. The patients will
      be identified through routine clinical contact. If patients are found to be eligible and
      agree to participate, they receive a single session of cranial osteopathy in addition to
      their usual care through the concussion program.

    <description>The hands will be placed on the head using the &quot;vault hold&quot; (bilateral thumbs are off the head, index fingers on the temporal bones, middle fingers on the sphenoid bones, ring fingers on the mastoid and the 5th fingers on the occipital bone). Diagnosis and treatment of restrictions palpated on the scalp will be made using this hand position</description>
