  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the amount of the study drug, LY3074828, that gets
      into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of LY3074828 when given
      together with LY9999QS compared to LY3074828 alone. The tolerability of the different
      formulations will also be evaluated and information about any side effects experienced will
      be collected.

      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study. For each participant
      the total duration of the clinical trial will be approximately 13 weeks, not including
      screening.
