  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention
      delivered over the phone (MBCT-T) for women with prehypertension. MBCT-T is an evidence-based
      program that teaches meditation practices and cognitive strategies to reduce stress and
      negative emotions. It targets psychosocial risk factors that disproportionately affect women,
      including rumination (i.e., negative thinking) and low social support. Investigators plan to
      translate the established MBCT-T program into Spanish, conduct focus groups to inform
      cultural adaptations that may be needed for Latina women, and run a pilot randomized
      controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability and effects of MBCT-T on blood
      pressure and perceived stress in diverse women with prehypertension.

      Chronic stress is associated with the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
      Reducing stress may be a useful prevention strategy for people at elevated risk of
      hypertension, including those with prehypertension. Women report different types of stress
      than men and may need tailored stress management programs.

    <description>The mean of three BP readings taken by a trained RA with an automated and validated BP monitor (Microlife WatchBP Office) will be recorded at each visit. Participants will be seated comfortably for 5 minutes with feet flat on the ground prior to measurements. The device will take three readings at 2-minute intervals.</description>

    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-8 is a validated measure of depressive symptoms during the prior two weeks based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression. The PHQ-8 will be completed at screening; patients with scores ≥10, suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms, will be excluded and provided with treatment referrals.</description>

    <description>This 8-week program combines mindfulness training with cognitive therapy and is delivered to small groups of patients by telephone using a conference line. Each weekly session is 1 hour long and is comprised of a check-in period, teaching on the week's topic, group discussion, a skill-building exercise, and a home-based practice assignment.</description>

    <description>Treatment guidelines recommend counseling patients with prehypertension on the importance of lifestyle modification to reduce BP. Because of variability in counseling across primary care practices, the study team will provide all participants with NHLBI print educational materials to ensure exposure to lifestyle recommendations: &quot;Your Guide to Lowering Blood Pressure&quot;; and &quot;Facts about the DASH Eating Plan&quot;.</description>
