  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if Carevive software, which monitors treatment-related toxicities and then
      generates self-care management plans for these symptoms, will be feasible to implement among
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Additionally for collection of
      preliminary data on treatment-related toxicities, quality of life, distress level, and drug
      adherence.

    <measure>Carevive Survey Usage Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Carevive software will track subject compliance with survey logins and whether they access the generated care plans. The percentage of times logged in out of the number of study recommended logins will be tabulated. Also, the percentage of times a careplan was accessed out of the number of times it was offered will be determined.
To determine the practicality of the intervention, by analyzing the reasons why subjects fail to self-report treatment-related toxicities or utilize software generated care plans after enrollment.
To assess the acceptability of this intervention with validated patient reported usability scores of the software.
To determine potential implementation obstacles of the intervention, by assessing the reasons eligible study candidates decline participation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reasons Participants Do Not Complete Survey or Utilize Care Plans</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After missing a survey, subjects will be asked the reason at their following login. The reason provided will be sorted into pre-specified categories and presented as a percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Usability Score Using the Software Usability Scoring System</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the 48 week time point or at the point of subject withdrawal from study, they will be asked to take the System Usability Scale. The survey provides us with a score of between 0 and 40 which is then multiplied by 2.5 to convert to a scale of 0 to 100. A SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reasons for Declining Study Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>If a subject declines to participation in the study, he/she will be asked to provide a reason for declination. If willing, we will have them sign a separate consent with a space to write in their reason. The reason provided will be sorted into pre-specified categories and presented as a percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Toxicities Using PRO-CTCAE Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported toxicity data will be collected via Carevive surveys weekly for the first 12 weeks and then every other week for another 36 weeks. We will not deliver the PRO-CTCAE in its entirety but will specifically ask about the following common toxicities that are experienced with oral targeted therapy and immunotherapy: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hand/foot syndrome, rash, abdominal pain, anorexia, mouth sores, cough and shortness of breath.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Reported Toxicities Using CTCAE</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will also be formally assessed in-office every 3-4 months using CTCAE scoring. The categories chosen are common toxicities that occur with oral targeted therapy and immunotherapy: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hand/foot syndrome, rash, abdominal pain, appetite, mouth sores, cough and shortness of breath</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Determination Using the FKSI-DRS Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to fill out the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI-DRS) at baseline and approximately every 3 months in-office.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distress Level Using the NCCN Distress Thermometer</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be asked to rate their distress level in-office using the NCCN Distress Thermometer, which is a 1 to 10 numerical scale. This will be delivered during routine office visits approximately every 3 months on a tablet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Adherence Will Be Determined using the Morisky Scale and Medication Possession Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's drug adherence will be determined through two measures. First, they will be asked the modified Morisky Scale survey questions every 4 weeks during their routine Carevive survey. This scale consists of 8 yes/no questions and is scored from 0-8. 8 points is indicative of high adherence, 6-7 points is average adherence and &lt;6 points is poor adherence. As a second measure of medication compliance, the patient's medication refill history will be obtained through their electronic medical record at the end of the study or at time of withdrawal and their Medication Possession Ratio (MPR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>â€¢ Health Care Utilization Assessment By Quantification of Health Care Visits or Hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health care utilization will be self-reported by the subject through CareVive software monthly, in addition at the end of the study or at time of withdrawal, a search of the electronic medical record will be performed to determine the number of calls made to oncology care providers and the number of visits to the oncologist during the study period.</description>

    <description>In this study, Carevive will deliver a link to subjects so that an online survey can be completed. The survey will occur weekly for the first 12 weeks of the study and will be spaced out to every other week thereafter. The questions will mostly focus on side effects from their cancer therapy, as well as a few questions about drug compliance and healthcare utilization. After completion of the survey, the subject will be given a care plan with at home self-management options for drug-related toxicities.</description>
