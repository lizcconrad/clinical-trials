  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the authors aim to evaluate the use of high fidelity simulation as a method
      of evaluation of general skills in fifth year medical students about patient quality and
      safety in a hospital setting.

    <textblock>
      Undergraduate training in patient safety and healthcare quality is often overlooked by
      medical curricula.

      Simulation techniques have been used in different subjects as a support for learning invasive
      techniques in surgical areas, but it has not been used to improve knowledge and performance
      on patient quality domains that would be applied in real life scenarios.

      This project is a randomized trial for medical students undertaking the course in &quot;Quality
      and Patient Safety&quot;. The authors will randomized students at the beginning of each rotation
      into two groups: a) an intervention group (where students will take the simulation and will
      be evaluated by a final written exam); and b) a control group (where students will take only
      the usual teaching in classrooms and will be evaluated with the same written exam).
      Furthermore, students will be asked to fill a questionnaire to obtain their attitudes and
      knowledge about the topics in quality and safety in healthcare.
