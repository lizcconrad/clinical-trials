  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of a 7-day compared with a 10-day course of
      antibiotic treatment for febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children. It is
      formulated a hypothesis that a 7-day course of antibiotic therapy is equally effective as a
      10-day course of therapy and would entail a lower risk of adverse events and better
      compliance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previously published European and global guidelines, there has been no consensus among
      experts regarding the duration of therapy for a febrile UTI. Depending on the recommendation,
      the duration of treatment should be between 7-14 days.

      221 patients aged 3 months to 7 years with febrile UTIs (defined as a combination of fever
      and leukocyturia in urine sediment) will be randomly assigned to receive a 7-day treatment
      arm (7 days of cefuroxime/cefuroxime axetil followed by 3 days of blinded placebo) or a
      10-day treatment arm (7 days of cefuroxime/cefuroxime axetil followed by 3 days of blinded
      cefuroxime axetil).

      The primary outcome measure will be frequencies of recurrence and reinfection of UTI during
      the 6 months after the intervention. The secondary outcome measures will be
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and compliance.

    <description>AAD is defined by the daily production of at least 3 loose or watery stools for at least 48 hours during antibiotic treatment and 7 days after administration of the antibiotic.
Compliance with the study protocol will be assessed by direct interview with the patient and/or caregiver and by measuring the amount of the fluid left in the bottle at the end of the intervention.</description>
