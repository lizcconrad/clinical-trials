  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has become a common and effective treatment for paroxysmal and
      persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), particularly in patients with drug-refractory disease.
      Intense endurance exercise is a known risk factor for atrial fibrillation. In general, these
      athletes poorly tolerate most common antiarrhythmic drugs used for atrial fibrillation
      control and often PVI is recommended for durable management. While the efficacy of PVI in
      athletes is similar to the general AF population, some athletes with lone atrial fibrillation
      report a reduction in subjective exertional capacity following PVI, despite maintenance of
      sinus rhythm and absence of pulmonary vein stenosis on imaging. The investigators hypothesize
      that PVI may alter pulmonary vein function and affect peak exercise performance.

      The investigators propose a small, prospective study of endurance athletes undergoing antral
      PVI for treatment of lone atrial fibrillation. Peak metabolic performance and pulmonary vein
      function will be assessed pre- and post-PVI by metabolic stress testing and cardiac MRI,
      respectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endurance athletes with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation undergoing primary
      pulmonary vein isolation will be prospectively enrolled prior to PVI.

      Patients will undergo metabolic exercise stress testing as well as resting CMR 1-4 weeks
      prior to PVI. Metabolic stress testing and CMR will be repeated at 6 month follow-up. Quality
      of life questionnaires will also be collected at pre- and post-PVI visits. Metabolic
      treadmill stress testing will follow standard protocol and measure hemodynamics with
      escalating metabolic output and characterize peak exercise capacity (METs) and oxygen
      consumption (VO2 max).

      CMR evaluation will include standard anatomic imaging of pulmonary vein and left atrial
      anatomy at rest. Additional cine CMR sequences willbe included for focused evaluation of
      dynamic pulmonary vein cross-sectional area. 3D navigator whole heart imaging and MRA (single
      gadolinium dose) will be obtained to measure pulmonary vein flow. CMR sequences to
      characterize left atrial function, including phasic volumes and emptying fractions (total,
      passive, active) will also be performed.

      Data on heart rate variability will additionally be collected at pre- and post-PVI clinic
      visits, as well as the morning after PVI (hospital day 1).
