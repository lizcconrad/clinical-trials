  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three parallel cohort, open-labeled, non-randomized, multicenter study. All three
      cohorts will enroll independently.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group A will be composed of newly-diagnosed, elderly patients with IDH1R132H-non mutant and
      MGMT promoter-unmethylated anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma who will receive TG02 and
      RT.

      Group B will be composed of newly-diagnosed, elderly patients with IDH1R132H-non mutant and
      MGMT promoter-methylated anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma who will receive TG02 and
      temozolomide.

      For both Groups A and B, there will be a classical 3+3 dose escalation and an expansion phase
      in the study. Up to a total of 24 evaluable patients in Group A and up to a total of 12
      evaluable patients in Group B (up to 36 evaluable patients for Groups A and B).

      Group C patients will be composed of patients initially diagnosed with IDH1R132H-non-mutant
      anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma at first relapse post TMZ/RT--&gt;TMZ therapy who will
      receive TG02.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Specifics for groups A and B

          -  Newly diagnosed glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH1R132H-non-mutant by
             immunohistochemistry locally assessed, with FFPE tissue available for central MGMT
             testing and optional biomarker studies (treatment allocation will be performed based
             on centrally assessed MGMT result)

          -  Tumor debulking surgery, including partial resection

          -  Age &gt; 65 and considered non-eligible for combination therapy (TMZ/RTâ†’TMZ) in
             Investigator's opinion

          -  No prior RT with overlap of radiation fields with the planned RT in this study (Group
             A)

          -  No prior therapy for glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma before surgery

          -  Brain MRI within 14 days before the first dose of TG02

        Specifics for group C

          -  IDH1R132H-non-mutant glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse with
             tissue available from first surgery. [Per 2016 WHO classification, in patients older
             than 55 years of age at diagnosis with a histological diagnosis of glioblastoma,
             without a pre-existing lower grade glioma and with non-midline tumor location,
             immunohistochemical negativity for IDH1R132H suffices for classification as
             glioblastoma. In all other instances of diffuse gliomas, lack of IDH1R132H
             immunopositivity should be followed by IDH1 and IDH2 sequencing to detect or exclude
             other less common IDH mutations.]
