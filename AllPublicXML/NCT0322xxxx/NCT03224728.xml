      Purpose: To compare the effect of spherical aberration on optical quality in eyes with two
      different aspherical intraocular lenses Methods: In this prospective, randomized clinical
      trial 120 eyes of 60 patients underwent phacoemulsification. In patient's eyes an
      aberration-free aspherical IOL (Aspira-aA; Human Optics) or an aberration-correcting
      aspherical IOL (Tecnis ZCB00; Abott Medical Optics) were randomly implanted. Three months
      after surgery visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, wavefront measurements with iTrace as well
      as tilt and decentration measurements with Visante anterior segment OCT were performed.
