  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most common medical problem among US Veterans. Treatment is available and
      effective, but control rates remain under 75%. While blood pressure control has traditionally
      been achieved through sequential visits and medication changes initiated by providers during
      office-based care, self-monitoring and self-management of blood pressure medication is an
      important strategy that would empower Veterans to achieve better control of blood pressure.
      The health impacts of better systems for treatment of hypertension are significant, including
      decreased rates of cardiovascular and kidney disease.

      This two-site clinical trial will randomize 400 Veterans to either usual blood pressure care
      or a self-management strategy in which patient-driven self-management of blood pressure
      medications will be taught and used over the course of 1 year.

      Project background: Recent literature from the UK (TASMIN2 and TASMIN-SR trials) have
      suggested that patient-driven self-management of blood pressure medications can be effective
      in achieving hypertension control, but questions remain as to how to apply these findings to
      a US population. The VA Healthcare System is an ideal system in which to test and customize
      this strategy for blood pressure treatment.

      Project question:

      Is patient-initiated self-management of blood pressure medication using a pre-specified,
      generalizable dose escalation scheme clinically effective, safe, and acceptable to patients
      and clinicians, compared to usual care in controlling blood pressure in hypertensive
      Veterans? Project methods: The investigators propose a 12-month randomized, controlled,
      non-blinded, single-center study of patient-initiated self-management of blood pressure
      medication vs. usual care with planned post study cohort follow-up via medical records.
      Participants in the intervention arm will be provided with home blood pressure monitoring
      tools and a self-management algorithm for changing their blood pressure medications as
      needed. Participants in the usual care arm will receive home monitoring tools and typical
      hypertension care from the primary care provider. The primary blood pressure outcome measure
      for the study will be between-group change in in-clinic blood pressure. Acceptability,
      safety, patient-centered outcomes and adherence will be key secondary outcomes
