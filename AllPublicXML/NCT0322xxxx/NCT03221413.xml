  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for non-invasive, non-pharmacological and cost-effective therapeutic options has
      revived the use of transcranial current stimulation, either direct (tDCS) or alternating
      (tACS), in a wide range of pathologies and cognitive disturbances. Results, although often
      promising, are not unequivocal, possibly due to different stimulation parameters and sites,
      or non-homogenous patient selection. tDCS has been widely applied but few studies have
      focused on tACS which has the advantage of potentially entraining brain oscillations at the
      same frequency of stimulation. This overcomes the basic mechanism of tDCS which deploys
      anodal or cathodal currents to broadly excite or inhibit supposedly dysfunctional underlying
      cortex.

      Whether a stimulation paradigm based on sound neurophysiological markers could provide a
      better and longer-lasting clinical outcome has not yet been ascertained.

      The investigators aim to establish, with a trans-disease approach, categories characterized
      by defective EEG oscillatory activity and related dysfunctional networks. This
      classification, expected as the result of the first stage of this project, will guide the
      stimulation paradigm: categories with a pathologically low-band EEG prevalence will be
      treated with high-frequency tACS, and vice-versa, while the stimulation site will correspond
      to the defective sites of pathological EEG band maps. Parkinson's disease (PD), the EEG
      marker of which is a shift towards fast frequencies, and neuropathic pain (NP), with an EEG
      prevalence of slow bands, will be considered.

      In order to categorize pathologies on the basis of their EEG frequencies, EEG power spectrums
      will be derived from resting EEG, and cortical oscillatory reactivity will be assessed by
      EEG-TMS (electroencephalographic-Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) co-registration. This
      method appears to elicit state-dependent brain oscillatory response and is expected to
      support power spectrum data. The identified prevailing EEG band will be used subsequently to
      reconstruct scalp EEG band distribution. tACS paradigms will be tailored according to these
      findings: the anode will be placed over the scalp area corresponding to the dysfunctional
      rhythm and frequency will be set in order to correct the prevailing EEG band (slow
      stimulation if fast frequencies prevail, and vice-versa).

      The translational element of this research proposal will consist of its clinical application
      in day-to-day practice for the benefit of people with the target conditions. The
      patient-groups, after undergoing the neurophysiology studies, will be tested with
      disease-specific scales and a neuropsychological battery. A 2-weeks tACS, either real or
      active sham, protocol will then be performed (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week), associated with
      an ad hoc rehabilitation protocol (60 minutes/day 5 days/week). During the last day of
      stimulation, patients will be tested again with the disease specific scales,
      neuropsychological battery and standard EEG to detect EEG frequencies modifications. At
      4-weeks follow up, the same tests and EEG recording will be carried out, to assess the
      persistence of after-effects.

      The expected result is a valid, non-invasive and cost-effective stimulation paradigm based on
      sound neurophysiologic markers which transcend traditional disease classifications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tDCS has been applied to a spectrum of diseases, including depression, Parkinson's disease
      (PD), dementia and others, on the basis of the concept of dysfunctional brain areas:
      modulating the hypo-or hyper-function of the indicated brain regions via anodal or cathodal
      tDCS has shown evidence of clinical symptom improvement, although generally short lasting and
      often with discordant results among studies. Conversely, tACS has only rarely been applied to
      people with disease, with discordant results. Its application to healthy individuals to boost
      sleep and sleep-related memory formation and working memory has, however, been shown to be
      effective. If consensus on stimulation patterns (continuous vs. alternating) is, however,
      lacking, the same holds true for frequencies, although evidence from computational and animal
      studies demonstrates that tACS is very effective at entraining the network at the frequency
      of the applied stimulation, with theta noticeably efficacious at improving cognitive
      performances in memory tasks.

      Whether a different paradigm, tailored to specific neurophysiological signatures, and not to
      the phenotype of the underlying dysfunction (i.e. applying inhibitory tDCS on the
      hyperfunctioning cortical area of a given disease or vice-versa), could lead to better and
      long-lasting clinical results is not yet defined.

      Therefore, this proposed study has two fundamental questions: 1) is a re-categorization of
      pathologies based on their oscillatory activities and related scalp distribution. Indeed, the
      answer the investigators are seeking is whether the investigators could identify clear
      neurophysiological markers that could lead to a new diagnostic classification. From a
      translational perspective the question is: 2) could these markers eventually guide
      therapeutic options? If these points are proved, the investigators expect to expand the
      results to other oscillopathies (i.e. schizophrenia or insomnia).

      The objective of this project is thus two-staged: a first stage will define neurophysiologic
      markers of diverse diseases, overcoming the traditional symptom-based classification of
      pathologies. In the second stage, these features will be translated into a tailored
      non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) protocol. Indeed, focusing on oscillatory rhythms
      dysfunctions, tACS, that entrains specific EEG frequencies, instead of tDCS, that
      hypo-hyperpolarizes indiscriminately vast brain regions, will be applied.

      In the first stage, selected pathologies among the broader spectrum of
      thalamo-cortical-dysrhythmias (TCDs) will be categorized on the basis of their prevalent EEG
      rhythm; in addition, oscillatory brain response to external perturbation (frequency bands
      synchronization or desynchronization in response to TMS stimulation as defined by EEG-TMS
      co-registration) will be obtained. The identified EEG frequency will subsequently be
      extracted from EEG to visualize scalp defective areas. The investigators will identify:

        -  the prevailing EEG rhythm in a resting, standard EEG by means of power spectral
           analysis, based on Fourier transform;

        -  a more detailed insight into brain reactivity and its oscillatory response as a reaction
           to random, non-entraining TMS stimulation with EEG co-registration, a method that
           appears to elicit state-dependent brain oscillatory response; Pathologies presenting
           with analogous neurophysiological signatures will be grouped together in order to define
           an appropriate, common stimulation paradigm, independently of symptom phenotype.

      In the second stage the investigators will attempt to tailor tACS on the basis of the
      previously defined categories. The scalp area of the dysfunctional rhythm will aid in the
      selection of the stimulation site, whereas the stimulation paradigm will be established on
      the basis of the prevailing EEG bands at rest and after perturbation - i.e. transcranial
      stimulation will be low frequency (4 Hz) alternating (tACS) for diseases characterized by a
      pathological increase of fast rhythms, and vice-versa (30 Hz), in order to entrain the
      defective EEG band. A clear-cut, long-lasting improvement of clinical symptoms is expected.

      Our expected result is to be able to set up appropriate and effective tACS stimulation
      paradigms based on disease neurophysiological markers rather than on clinical symptoms. Given
      the large number of pathologies encompassed in the TCD spectrum, this therapeutic option
      could become a promising non-invasive, cost-effective therapeutic option with a wide field of
      applications.

      Pathologies to be included are:

        -  PD: altered thalamo-cortical loop that reflects, through the thalamus, the beta
           prevalence in the deep nuclei loop and reverberates to the cortex.

        -  Neuropathic pain (NP): evidence of increased high theta band power (7-8Hz), especially
           over frontal and somatosensory cortex. The generation of low-frequency activity by the
           thalamocortical circuit results in a long-term pathological equilibrium in the cortical
           pain matrix.

      2.3. Signal analysis T0, T1 and T2 resting EEG analysis. EEG will be acquired using an TMS
      compatible EEG amplifier (BrainAmp 32MRplus, BrainProducts GmbH, Munich, Germany) and a cap
      providing 30 Ag/AgCl electrodes positioned according to a 10/20 system. Data will be
      processed in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using scripts based on EEGLAB
      (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), as well as a dedicated home-made code created for this
      study. Visible artifacts in the EEG will be removed using an independent component analysis
      procedure and EEG will be band-pass filtered from 1 to 30 Hz. EEG data will be divided into
      epochs of 2 s and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) will be applied to non-overlapping epochs,
      and averaged across epochs. Based on power spectra density, relative powers (%) in delta (1-4
      Hz), theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency ranges will be evaluated.

      A one sample z-test will be applied to compare the map of the patient to the grand average of
      the controls (a group of 20 healthy subjects). Thus, the statistical map defines the sensors
      in which relative power from an individual patient differs statistically from that of a
      reference population (control group).

      Pre-stimulation (T0) EEG-TMS co-registration TMS will be performed using a Dymeg in biphasic
      pulse configuration (DuoMag, EMS, Italy) which generates a maximum magnetic field of 1.5 T.
      TMS will be delivered through a figure-of-eight focal coil over the dominant primary motor
      area (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be recorded from the left/right thenar
      eminence muscle with Ag/AgCl surface electrodes fixed to the skin with a belly-tendon
      montage. Stimulus intensity will be set at 110% of motor threshold intensity. 100 TMS
      single-pulse stimuli will be delivered at random, with inter-trial interval between 8-15 s.

      EEG will be acquired using the same magnetic resonance compatible EEG system previously
      described. EEG data will be analysed using a time-frequency procedure to characterize
      TMS-induced oscillations. Time-frequency analysis will be performed with continuous Morlet
      wavelet transform, which provides a time course after magnetic stimulation of the relative
      power in the main frequency bands, as described above. Profiles for each subject will be
      averaged from the post-stimulus trials and normalized to the baseline value.

      2.4. TADCS stimulation paradigm Stimulation will be applied by a battery driven external
      stimulator (BrainStim, EMS, Bologna, Italy) via two sponge electrodes (5x7cm). The anodal
      electrode will be placed over the scalp area corresponding to the defective network node as
      derived by EEG source analysis. The cathodal electrode will be placed over the ipsilateral
      mastoid. A sinusoidal current, ranging from 1 to 2mA will be delivered; stimulation frequency
      will be derived from the defective EEG band - i.e. if low frequency oscillations prevail,
      stimulation will be at 30 Hz; if high frequency oscillations prevail, stimulation will be at
      4 Hz. Sham stimulation, according to consensus statement, will be delivered as random noise
      stimulation (RNS) with electrodes located at the same sites as active stimulation and Sham
      Sessions will last 30 minutes, and repeated for two weeks on 5 consecutive days per week
      separated by a 2 days interval. A random Noise Stimulation (RNS) with an amplitude 1 to 2 mA
      will be applied.

      2.5. Ethical Committee Approval The study involves stimulation of human subjects and as such
      will require Ethical approval. The investigators obtained Ethical Approval from the Ethics
      Committee of the University Hospital, Padova (3507/15).

      2.6. Statistical analysis and study power Data will be summarized using descriptive
      statistics. Appropriated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome will be produced.

      2.6.1. First phase The proportion of people with PD displaying EEG beta peak (FFT) and the
      95% binomial CI will be computed. The same analysis will be performed for people with NP
      displaying EEG theta peak (FFT).

      2.6.2. Second phase 2.6.2.1. Primary analyses A repeated measures test (ANCOVA) will be used
      to evaluate differences in UPDRS score and NPQ score between T0 and T1.

      2.6.2.2. Secondary analyses Cross sectional evaluation at pre- and post-treatment between PD
      with beta Peak and PD with other EEG peaks will be run using the independent sample t test.
      Same analysis will be performed to evaluate differences at T0 and T1 between NP subjects with
      theta Peak vs NP with other EEG peaks.

      Further analyses could be performed using analysis of variance (ANOCOVA) to account for these
      predictors: age, sex, disease severity at T0, interaction with other frequency bands, pre-
      and post-stimulation therapy after real and active sham tACS modification, drugs. Repeated
      measures models could be used.

      2.6.3. Signal analysis

      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be applied to the relative power with
      the factor ''time'' (T0, T1 and T2); the sphericity assumption will be assessed using
      Mauchly's test. Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon adjustments for non-sphericity will be applied
      where appropriate. A post hoc paired sample two tailed t-test adjusted for multiple
      comparisons with the Bonferroni method will be used. Statistical significance will be set at
      p &lt; 0.05, corrected. Two-dimensional grand mean t-maps of the relative power will be computed
      from the t-values to check the topographical distribution of the significance.

      2.6.4. Study power To compute the total sample size of the project the investigators will
      first compute the sample size for phase II. Given sample size for phase II, sample size for
      phase I will be computed accounting for potential drop-outs.

      Phase II sample size Two different populations will be investigated (PD, NP) hence no
      correction for multiplicity will be performed.

      People with PD and NP A sample size of 15 achieves 92% power to detect a mean of paired
      differences (UPDRS pre- and post-stimulation score difference) of 4.0 with an estimated
      standard deviation of differences of 4.3 and with significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a
      two-sided paired t-test in people with PD displaying EEG beta (FFT). The same assumption will
      be assumed for NPQ decrease, hence a total of 30 subjects will be required, 15 for each
      category.

      Phase I sample size The investigators expect all people with PD to have a beta frequency
      peak, while those with NP will be in the theta band. A sample size of 15 people with NP
      produces a one sided 97.5 binomial CI of 79.61%-100% given that the expected proportion of
      theta is 100%. A sample size of 15 people with PD produces a one sided 97.5 binomial CI of
      79.61%-100% given that the expected proportion of beta is 100%.

      Total sample size In order to account for potential drop outs the investigators will recruit
      20 people with NP and 20 people with PD, giving a total sample size of 40 patients.
