  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to undertake a phase II study to investigate the efficacy and side
      effects of intravenous ketamine to reduce neuroexcitotoxicity, and thus provide
      neuroprotection in patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining informed consent, patients enrolled in the 'study drug' arm of the trial will
      receive Ketamine (1 mg/ml solution prepared in normal saline) infusion at a rate of 40 mg/h
      for a period of 48 hours. The infusion will start at a rate of 10 mg/h, and then gradually
      tapered up during the first 3 hours by 10 mg an hour. Similarly, the infusion rate will be
      gradually tapered down at a rate of 10 mg/h during the last 3 hours of infusion. The patients
      randomized to the 'placebo arm' of the trial will receive normal saline infusion at the same
      rates. In order to prevent the psychogenic adverse effects associated with Ketamine, the
      patients will be administered Midazolam at a dose of 1 mg IV every 4 hours. Midazolam will
      also be administered at the same rate to the patients randomized to the placebo arm. Blood
      Ketamine levels will be measured before starting the treatment, and daily while the infusion
      is on. While receiving treatment, the patients will be admitted to the telemetry floor in the
      hospital, on a monitored bed.
