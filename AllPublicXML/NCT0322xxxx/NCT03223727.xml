  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry aims to evaluate the efficacy of Rad-223 treatment in a non-study population of
      CRPC patients treated earlier with Docetaxel and patients not treated earlier with Docetaxel
      and efficacy of the first subsequent therapy. The indication for treatment with Radium-223
      will be at the physician's decision. All patients treated with Radium-223 can be included in
      this registry. The registry only dictates the collection of base line characteristics,
      expansion of regular blood tests and patient reported pain scores.

      Serum and blood markers of bone metabolism will be evaluated at Base Line, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and
      6th (or last) Radium- 223 treatment. Every blood draw prior to Radium-223 treatment At
      baseline, tests include (but not restricted to): Testosterone, vitamin D-25-OH (Calciferol),
      C-reactive protein, Rank Ligand, IL6, BSAF, P1NP and CTX. Patients need to be fasting when
      blood is collected. (2x8,5 ml gel tube; Limited to 100 patients in selected centres). Before
      2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th (or last) Radium-223 treatment, tests include (but not restricted to):
      C-reactive protein, Rank, Ligand, IL6, BSAF, P1NP and CTX. Patients need to be fasting when
      blood is collected. (2x8,5 ml gel tube; Limited to 100 patients in selected centers).

      Moreover, levels of osteoclast precursors (CD34+) will be evaluated (10 ml heparinized blood)
      prior to the first Radium-223 treatment, 3rd and last treatment (Limited to 100 patients in
      selected centres).

      All above-mentioned blood collections will be from the same venipuncture as standard clinical
      labs. Experimental assessments will be evaluated for their value as biomarkers of treatment
      outcome.
