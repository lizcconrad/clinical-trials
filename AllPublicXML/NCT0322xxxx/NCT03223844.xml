  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia show enhanced dopamine synthesis capacity and release, an effect
      that can be evoked in healthy subjects by repeated amphetamine administration. Therefore for
      the first time the relationship between dopamine synthesis and release will be studied in
      healthy subjects before and after amphetamine sensitization in order to better understand
      adaptive mechanisms of the dopamine system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have consistently shown increased brain dopamine
      (DA) synthesis and enhanced d-amphetamine-induced DA release in patients with schizophrenia.
      Repeated administration of d-amphetamine leads to an increased subjective and behavioral
      drug-response. This effect, termed &quot;sensitization&quot;, is paralleled by an increase in dopamine
      release to levels akin to those observed in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia thus goes along with
      a state of 'natural sensitization' towards amphetamines. However, while it is known that DA
      synthesis and release are both enhanced in schizophrenia, it is unknown whether sensitization
      changes indices of presynaptic DA synthesis in the striatum of healthy subjects. Thus, for
      the first time, this project will study the effects of repeated d-amphetamine on uptake of
      the DA precursor [18F]FDOPA and on d-amphetamine-induced changes in binding of the D2/3
      receptor agonist radioligand [11C]-(+)PHNO in a within-subject design. Before and after
      amphetamine sensitization by repeated intermittent administration subjects will receive an
      [18F]FDOPA and and a [11C]-(+)PHNO PET scan. For the investigation of the influence of
      functional and structural cortical properties on dopamine synthesis and release, functional
      and structural magnet resonance imaging will be performed before and after sensitization.
