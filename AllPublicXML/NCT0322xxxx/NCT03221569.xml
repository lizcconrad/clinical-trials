      The study investigators are attempting to determine if ketamine can offer rapid, complete and
      sustained headache relief in the acute setting and 48 hrs post-discharge. The goal of this
      study is to enroll 40 patients total (20 per arm). This will be a &quot;double-dummy&quot; study in
      that there will be no placebo only arm. Medications will be administered in a double blind
      randomized fashion. Each patient will receive an intranasal solution via atomizer and a 50 cc
      IV normal saline bag. Arm A would include 1 mg/kg intranasal ketamine and a 50 cc normal
      saline IV bag while Arm B would receive placebo intranasal dose and 10 mg Metroclopramide/25
      mg Diphenahydramine mixed in 50 ccs normal saline. The primary endpoints are: Patient
      perception of pain as described by the use the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at 30 minutes.

      The secondary endpoints are: Frequency and mean dose of rescue/additional doses of therapy at
      30min, incidence of dissociative effects (characterized by hallucination, disorientation,
      confusion, agitation, delirium, dreams) during study period, Incidence of nausea, vomiting,
      or worsening headache, Incidence of bad taste, Incidence of burning sensations in the
      nostrils, Incidence of hypertension, Time to patient discharge from the initiation of study
      medication/placebo, patient satisfaction of pain control based on a Likert Scale.

      This will be a &quot;double-dummy&quot; study in that there will be no placebo only arm. Medications
      will be administered in a double blind randomized fashion. Each patient will receive an
      intranasal solution via atomizer and a 50 cc IV normal saline bag. Once informed consent is
      obtained, patients would be enrolled in Arm A or Arm B depending upon the initial
      randomization. Arm A would include 1 mg/kg intranasal ketamine and a 50 cc normal saline IV
      bag while Arm B would receive placebo intranasal dose and Metoclopramide 10mg/Diphenhydramine
      25mg mixed in 50 ccs normal saline. For intranasal administration, the total volume of the
      dose will be administered in equivalent half volumes in each nare. For example, if the total
      dose equated to 1ml, the patient would receive 0.5ml in the left nare and 0.5ml in the right
      nare. A maximum dose of 1 ml will be given per nare. If the total dose exceeds 1 ml, this
      will be divided into two syringes, the volume above 1ml will be administered 2-3 minutes
      after administration of the initial volume.

      An order would be placed by the medical resident, medical attending, a study investigator who
      is a physician, or a pharmacist under the permission of the attending physician into
      Allscripts for a study intervention. Upon receiving the order in Allscripts, the order would
      be verified by the pharmacy. All medications will be prepared in pharmacy, which will
      maintain a master list of contents of each sealed envelope. Once notified of which envelope
      has been pulled, the pharmacist will prepare either arm. ED personnel will obtain the
      infusion preparation from pharmacy. It will be labeled for the patient, with study number,
      but without other identifying marks. When the study medication is picked up, pharmacy will
      open the sealed envelope to confirm which medication arm was prepared in order to internally
      verify the correct preparation. The nurse assigned to the patient would administer the
      intervention. A research associate or a study investigator would approach the patient to
      assess and record primary outcomes, secondary outcomes at designed time intervals. The data
      will be recorded on the data collection instrument. If additional medication is requested by
      the patient, the orders would be placed by the medical resident or attending who are assigned
      to the patient in the ED. Upon completion of the treatment portion of the study, patients
      will be asked of the participant's satisfaction with therapy. Only the patient who signed the
      consent form will be allowed to answer the questions.

      All data retrieved from the paper data collection sheets will be transcribed into an
      encrypted and password protected electronic database by the research associate. All patient
      identifiers would be de-identified in the database. All participants would be assigned a
      study participant number.
