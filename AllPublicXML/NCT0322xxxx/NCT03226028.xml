  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The capacity of music to relieve pain has been used in many forms of medicines and has been
      proven to reduce anxiety, pain and need for analgesia in perioperative setting. However,
      music listening as an inexpensive and duplicable method has not been studied in the local
      context. The investigators hereby propose a prospective study to recruit women who undergo
      surgery to evaluate the effectiveness of music in pain relief and post-operative recovery in
      KKH; as well as the possibility of implementing music listening in perioperative setting.

      The patients will be offered to listen to one out of several pre-determined lists of music of
      different genres before, and after surgery. Data including pain score, Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale (HADS) score, EuroQol-Five Dimensions questionnaire-using Three Levels
      (EQ-5D-3L), vital signs, analgesia usage and patient satisfaction will be collected in the
      perioperative period. The collected data shall also be assessed if they are affected by the
      presence of music, duration of music listening, and the genre chosen by the patients.

      The investigators believe that this study could help determine the clinical relevance of
      music for pain relief in local setting, which potentially could reduce patient pain and
      anxiety caused by surgery. This in turn could allow music listening to be adopted as a
      non-invasive pain relief intervention in local healthcare settings and further improve
      patient outcome with lower cost and greater convenience as well as safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some tissue injury is unavoidable during surgery, but pain and anxiety are (nearly as often)
      also unavoidable in the perioperative period. Acute post-operative pain and anxiety have been
      managed via pharmacological interventions such as opioid-based analgesia for over a century.
      However, non-pharmacological interventions - such as music - have also been shown to safe and
      cost-effective, to improve the overall patient experience, and improve outcomes across a
      variety of surgical settings. Music has been shown to decrease pain in the perioperative
      period, to reduce plasma, urine, and salivary cortisol levels, modulate the inflammatory
      response (natural killer lymphocytes), blood pressure, and heart rate.Additionally, anxiety
      scores and pain scores (measured using the visual analog scale (VAS)) have shown
      statistically significant reductions in the perioperative period, when music therapy was
      available.

      From 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, there were 31,871 surgeries done in KK Women's and
      Children's Hospital (KKH). While music therapy in the hospital has been offered as a part of
      cognitive rehabilitation services or end of life care, there is little investigation found on
      its effect if used perioperatively in adult patients who undergo surgeries, especially in
      local setting. Based on the above rationale, the investigators shall therefore investigate
      the feasibility and practicability of deploying music listening in pain management in KKH,
      and further determine the nature of the music (duration, genre) by fitting the local context
      in order to improve the patient outcome in perioperative settings.

    <description>The recruiter will give the patient an ipod with earphone, in which the ipod is equipped with saved playlists of different music genres. Patient will choose the desired playlists and listen to the music for about 30 minutes, seated in a quiet environment in pre-operative waiting area before her turn for the scheduled surgery. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and EQ-5D-3L questionnaire will be conducted during this period.
Patient will be sent to the recovery room after the surgery, and will start the music listening again for 30 minutes once she is ready and feel comfortable to start the session. Pain score, HADS and EQ-5D-3L will be collected from the patient, as well as interview on her satisfaction and experience on the music listening.</description>
