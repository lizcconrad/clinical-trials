  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is very little information comparing non-invasive blood pressure (BP) readings obtained
      from upper and lower limbs, as well as comparing invasive and non-invasive blood pressures in
      the children under anesthesia. This study seeks to determine the correlation between the
      non-invasive BP measurements between upper and lower extremities and compare these
      measurements with the invasive BP as the standard for comparison.
