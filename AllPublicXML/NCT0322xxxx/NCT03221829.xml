  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of spinal anesthesia among
      elderly patients The basic methods for diagnosis and management of bladder cancer include
      endoscopic procedures (cystoscopy, trans-urethral resection of bladder tumour TURBT). The age
      of most patients is above 60, which increases the risk of complications during the
      perioperative period. Usually the leading anaesthesia method in TURBT procedures is regional,
      mainly spinal, anaesthesia. Although the prevalence of regional upon general anaesthesia is
      questioned, certain positive aspects of regional anaesthesia are indisputable. Maintaining
      logical communication with a patient during the procedure enables early diagnosis of
      complications (TUR syndrome, bladder perforation). Undeniably, regional anaesthesia ensures
      the best pain management in the early post-operative period. The simplicity of performing an
      efficacious spinal block and its cost-effectiveness are additional factors, which have
      contributed to the acknowledgement of the method as the standard of anaesthesia for
      transurethral procedures.
