      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the new restorative
      F-Composite 2 system for Class I and Class II cavities that need to be restored in permanent
      teeth.

      The materials of the system can be polymerized in short time with a new curing light which is
      part of the system.

      The study will be carried out as a prospective study, with evaluation of the restorations
      after 7-10 days (baseline), at 6 months, at 12 months and at 24 months according to defined
      criteria.

    <description>Procedures will be done using local anesthesia (if the patients wants that). The cavity is prepared according to the principles of the adhesive technique. First the adhesive will be applied and polymerized, afterwards the flowable resin-based restorative material will be applied and polymerized and then the sculptable resin-based restorative material will be applied and polymerized; all materials will be light-cured within short time with an experimental curing light.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Indication for direct filling of Class I or II with permanent premolars or permanent
             molars

          -  replacement of insufficient fillings (e.g., due to edge caries, filling fracture, Lack
             of quality of the surface, lack of aesthetics, undesirable filling material, leaky
             edge, edge gap, etc.)

          -  extensive primary caries

          -  Vital tooth (cold test)

          -  One-, two- or three-surface fillings in the lateral tooth area, with a maximum of 25%
             single-faced (Class I) with antagonists.

          -  The occlusal area of the filling must be at least 1/3 of the total area of the filling
             tooth. This criterion is estimated.

          -  Patient wishes to receive care within the framework of the study (written consent
             after detailed elucidation and study of patient information).

          -  Maximum of 2 restorations per patient.

          -  Preoperative complaints on the tooth to be restored (maximum 3 on visual Analog scale
             (0 = complaint-free, 10 = maximum possible pain) to temperature or bite sensitivity

          -  Sufficient language skills

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unfinished hygiene phase or poor oral hygiene

          -  Sufficient draining of the operating field is not possible

          -  Patients with proven allergy to one of the ingredients of the materials used

          -  Patient has allergies to local anesthetic agents Ultracain DS (active substance:
             articaine; Vasoconstrictor), if anesthesia is desired

          -  Patients with severe systemic diseases

          -  Devital or pulpitic teeth

          -  Periodontal insufficiency

          -  Supplements with cusp attachments

          -  open side bite

          -  missing antagonist

          -  Indication for direct capping

          -  Pregnancy (women of childbearing age receive a free pregnancy test for self
             application, the negative result of which is shown with her confirmed consent).
