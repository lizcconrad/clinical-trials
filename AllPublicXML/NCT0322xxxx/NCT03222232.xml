  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study evaluating a catheter salvage strategy in relation to
      catheter-related bloodstream infections in patients with chronic intestinal failure dependent
      on home parenteral support. The study is confined to the period 2002 to 2016.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In chronic intestinal failure patients receiving home parenteral support (HPS),
      catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) frequently results in replacement of their
      tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) which may lead to future loss of central venous
      access.

      This observational study investigates the consequences of a catheter-salvage-strategy related
      to CRBSIs according to different causative microorganisms, and short- and long-term risk of
      recurrence of the CRBSI. The study is based on the Copenhagen Intestinal failure database,
      which is a web-based database with retrospective data collection performed by reviews of
      medical charts from all adult intestinal failure patients discharged with home parenteral
      support from the Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Rigshospitalet.

    <description>The primary salvage rate was defined by the CVC status at hospital discharge. Because of the database setup and retrospective design of the study, all cases were included regardless of main reason to CVC removal (e.g. septic shock, severe sepsis, concomitant CVC problems and secondary or metastatic complications).</description>

        Patients with intestinal failure, characterised by a reduction in the guts capacity to
        absorb macronutrients and/or fluid and electrolytes below what is necessary to maintain
        health, and therefore parenteral support (nutrition and/or fluids and electrolytes) is
        required to sustain life. Patient initiated on Home parenteral support was entered into the
        Copenhagen Intestinal failure database, and thereby eligible in this cohorte study.
