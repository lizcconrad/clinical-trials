  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
      introduces Internet Gaming disorder (IGD) as a Substance-Related and Addictive Disorder in
      Section 3, Conditions for Further Study. Although research is in the nascent stages, existing
      studies demonstrate that IGD is associated with psychosocial distress including suicidality,
      and adverse vocational and educational outcomes in youth. Internet gaming disorder also
      shares substantial overlap with substance use, and it primarily affects adolescents, who
      rarely seek treatment on their own. Parents more often express concerns about their child's
      game playing behaviors, and data suggest that parents can have strong influences on it. This
      psychotherapy development study will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and effect sizes of
      a behavioral intervention designed to help parents reduce gaming problems in their children.
      Sixty concerned parents and their children will complete parental and self-report inventories
      and structured diagnostic interviews regarding the child's gaming behaviors, substance use
      and psychosocial functioning. Participants will be randomized to either a control condition
      consisting of referral for mental health issues and family support services or to the same
      plus a 6-week family-based behavioral intervention designed to assist with better monitoring
      and regulating the child's game playing behaviors and encouraging and rewarding alternatives
      to game playing. Gaming and other problems will be assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment, at
      the end of treatment, and at a 4-month follow-up. This study is unique in evaluating initial
      psychometric properties of a parental version of a measure that uses the DSM-5 criteria for
      IGD in a clinical sample, and it will also assess associations of IGD with substance use,
      psychological symptoms, and family functioning over time. Most importantly, this study will
      be the first randomized trial of an intervention designed to reduce gambling problems, and
      results are likely to guide future research and treatment efforts related to this condition.
