  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (DM2) is a chronic disease affecting 29 million Americans and a leading cause
      of blindness, kidney failure, and limb loss (Engelgau et al 2004). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      (RYGB) is the only intervention that leads to durable DM2 remission ~ 80% of the time
      (Mingrone et al 2012). Yet, it's broad application is limited by cost, invasiveness, and
      clinical inertia. Medically reproducing RYGB would extend the benefit of disease remission to
      the vast majority of DM2 patients using a cheaper, less invasive and more palatable treatment
      approach. Although all of the mechanisms mediating DM2 remission are not known, it is widely
      accepted that RYGB induces caloric restriction and enhances meal-stimulated release of a
      gut-peptide called glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) both of which improve glycemic control in
      type 2 diabetes (Dar et al 2012; Jackness 2013). Caloric restriction can be achieved using
      OPTIFAST which is a commercially available medical weight loss program that has demonstrated
      the ability to decrease weight and improve glycemic control (Kirschner et al; 1998). Enhanced
      meal-stimulated GLP-1 release can be achieved using Liraglutide an FDA-approved once daily
      GLP-1 analogue that improves glycemic control and induces weight loss.

      The investigators hypothesize that adding OPTIFAST (caloric restriction) in suboptimally
      controlled DM2 patients on Liraglutide (enhanced meal stimulated GLP-1 release), Metformin
      and Lantus insulin will medically reproduce RYGB and lead to DM2 remission, weight loss,
      decreased medication intensity and improved health related quality of life.

      This is a 24 week &quot;proof of concept&quot; study that will examine if adding &quot;caloric restriction&quot;
      (OPTIFAST) to &quot;enhanced GLP-1 release&quot; (Liraglutide) will lead to discontinuation of Lantus
      and Metformin. The primary outcome measure is change in glycemic control measured as
      hemoglobin A1C. Secondary outcome measures are change in weight, medication intensity and
      health related quality of life.
