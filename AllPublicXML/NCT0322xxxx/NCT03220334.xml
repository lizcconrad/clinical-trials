  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Korea, where the prevalence of gastric tumors is high, the use of ESD as a treatment for
      gastric cancer will continue to increase. Considering that there are no special measures to
      prevent side effects (bleeding, perforation, etc.) of this procedure, it is possible to
      reduce the large medical costs through the discovery of substances that can promote gastric
      mucosal healing. Mechanism of PRP-based materials in the regeneration of gastric mucosal
      damage can be used to understand the pathophysiology of ulcers. In the future, it can be
      suggested as a new treatment for gastrointestinal tract damage such as intractable ulcer,
      perforation, mucosal fistula, gastrointestinal bleeding caused by esophagus, small intestine
      and large intestine as well as ulcer treatment by endoscopic procedure.

      Background:In Korea, where the prevalence of gastric tumors is high, the use of ESD as a
      treatment for gastric cancer will continue to increase. Considering that there are no special
      measures to prevent side effects (bleeding, perforation, etc.) of this procedure, it is
      possible to reduce the large medical costs through the discovery of substances that can
      promote gastric mucosal healing. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has demonstrated efficacy in
      preclinical endoscopic resection models.

      Aim: Evaluate the efficacy of PRP on participants submitted to ESD.

      Material and Methods: The investigators have evaluated a prospective clinical study. The
      investigators have included 10 participants submitted to ESD. Patients were informed and
      accepted to participate with a written consent. Prior to endoscopy PRP was obtained from
      autologous blood with a commercial kit. Resection was performed with standard technique.
      Immediately after the procedure, autologous PRP is applied to the artificial gastric ulcer
      using endoscopic spray. Participants were followed-up after the procedure.
