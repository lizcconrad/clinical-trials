    <textblock>
      At present, the evaluation criterion of endometrial receptivity is controversial. The
      development of a molecular diagnostic tool, the endometrial receptivity array (ERA) for
      diagnosis of endometrial receptivity . But use of this test in patients with RIF has shown
      that the window of implantation (WOI) is displaced in only a quarter of these patients and
      use of a personalized embryo transfer (pET) on the day designated by ERA improves
      reproductive performance with higher cost .what is known to the others'population? The
      morphological changes observed on histology for each specific day after ovulation were
      described by Noyes and his colleagues in 1950 . An endometrial biopsy that shows a difference
      of more than 2 days between the histologic dating and actual day after ovulation is
      considered to be ''out of phase''. But such pET studies according to the Noyes criterion are
      lacking . The aim of this study is to explore the transcriptomic profile of endometrial
      receptivity in different histological dating of natural cycle and its clinical application.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria for RIF group were: unexplained repeated implantation failure
             (RIF) is defined as the absence of a gestational sac on ultrasound at 5 or more weeks
             after embryo transfer (ET) after 3 embryo transfers with high quality embryos or after
             the transfer of ≥10 embryos in multiple transfers.

        The inclusion criteria for control group were: (1) age &lt;35 years; (2) regular menstrual
        cycles of 24-35 days; (3) baseline follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) &lt; 9.0 IU/L; (4)
        endometrial thickness ≥8.0 mm on the day of hCG administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) uterine abnormalities (double uterus, bicornuate uterus, unicornuate uterus); (2)
             intrauterine adhesions（moderate - severe）, endometriosis, adenomyosis, untreated
             hydrosalpinx, uterine fibroids (submucosal fibroids, nonmucosal fibroids &gt;4.0 cm
             and/or endometrial pressure) (3) history of adverse pregnancy (including spontaneous
