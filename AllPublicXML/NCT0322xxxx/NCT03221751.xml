  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) from explosions is the &quot;signature injury&quot; of Veterans who
      have deployed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although the immediate effects of a single
      mTBI usually resolve over days or weeks, multiple mTBIs can lead to both persistent symptoms
      and, years later, to two fatal progressive brain diseases, chronic traumatic encephalopathy
      (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is believed that CTE and AD are caused by nerve
      damaging chemicals called tau and beta amyloid produced by the brain but which are not
      removed from the brain in a normal manner in persons with mTBIs. The investigators will
      determine in Veterans who experienced mTBIs whether a clinically available drug called
      prazosin increases removal of tau and beta amyloid from the brain. This will be accomplished
      by seeing if prazosin reduces the amount of tau and beta amyloid in the spinal fluid that
      surrounds the brain. If the investigators find such reductions, prazosin will be evaluated as
      a preventative treatment for CTE and AD in future studies.

             within the 3 month period prior to when the baseline 2 visit would be scheduled (a

          -  Current use of stimulants or nitrates, or of alternative medications or supplements

             Exposure therapy (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Eye Movement
             Desensitization and Reprogramming (EMDR), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia
             (CBTi) or Image Rehearsal and Rescripting therapy for nightmares. These therapies must
             have been completed &gt; 4 weeks before first baseline assessment visit (study visit 2).
