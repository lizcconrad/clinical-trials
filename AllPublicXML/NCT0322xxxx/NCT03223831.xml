  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of a novel partially covered (PC) versus uncovered (UC)
      pyloro-duodenal stents (DS) in unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction. We
      hypothesize that the use of PCDS could reduce the re-intervention rates when compared to
      UCDS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This would be a prospective multi-centred double-blinded randomised controlled study
      including all patients suffering from malignant gastric outlet obstruction due unresectable
      primary gastro-duodenal or pancreatico-biliary malignancies. Five international institutions
      in Hong Kong, Singapore and India would participate in the study.

      The procedure would be performed under conscious sedation or monitored anaesthesia. The
      patients would be randomised PCDS or UCDS after cannulation of the obstruction site is
      achieved with the guide-wire. The patients or assessors would be blinded to the type of stent
      that is inserted.

    <description>The PCDS (Niti-S COMVITM - Flare, Taewoong, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) used in the current study is a partially covered metallic pyloro-duodenal stent. It consists of two portions (Figure 1). The stent is 2cm in diameter and the proximal 2cm of the stent is uncovered and flared. This is designed to provide anchorage of the stent to surrounding tissue and reduce the risk of migration. The remaining of the stent is covered, where a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane is held between two nitinol mesh to prevent the risk of tumour ingrowth into the stent. The stents come in lengths of 6, 8, 10 &amp; 12cm.</description>
