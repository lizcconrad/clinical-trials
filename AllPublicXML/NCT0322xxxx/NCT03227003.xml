  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study used a sub-sample of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) (Milne
      RL et al, Int J Epidemiol, 2017), who had valid data on dietary intakes (121-item food
      frequency questionnaire) and valid measures of DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation
      Infinium 450K Beadchip assay, or using LINE-1, Alu and Sat2 assays.

      The investigators studied the association between nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism
      and DNA methylation in peripheral blood.

        The population is a sub-sample of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), with
        non-random sampling based on selection into of six case-control studies nested within the
        MCCS. The MCCS is a prospective cohort study of 41,513 people (17,044 men and 24,469 women)
        recruited between 1990 and 1994. The age range at recruitment was 27-80 (99.3% being aged
        40-69). Southern European migrants to Australia were over-sampled to extend the range of
        exposures, including dietary patterns.

        Participants in this sub-study had valid dietary intake data and valid measures of DNA
        methylation.
