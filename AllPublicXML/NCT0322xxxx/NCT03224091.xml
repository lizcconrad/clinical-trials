  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROLED study is a prospective, longitudinal and naturalistic study of patients with
      Eating Disorders. Annual interviews and collection of biological samples are done, as well as
      during changes in disease course e.g. during hospitalization. Included are qualitative
      interviews, psychometric tests, questionnaires which are used to collect data on
      psychopathology. There is also collection of blood, urine and faeces.

      The objective is to increase the understanding of the psychopathology and pathophysiology of
      Eating Disorders.

      More specifically, the aim is to identify biomarkers that relate to prognosis, disease course
      and response to treatment as usual of Eating Disorders, and, to improve the understanding of
      the pathophysiology of Eating disorders in order to identify novel molecular targets for
      treatment.

      Rationale The etiology of Eating Disorders (ED's) is unknown. Previous studies have
      identified genes that link Anorexia Nervosa to other psychiatric (e.g. schizophrenia) and
      somatic disorders (e.e. diabetes). Association studies have also suggested genetic causes
      underlying Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorders. The PROLED study aims to improve the
      understanding of both the psychopathology and pathophysiology of Eating Disorders. No
      experimental drug will be used in this study.

      There is a great need for an increased biological understanding of ED's in view of the
      prevalence, the costs, the severity and high mortality rates, and the lack of efficient
      treatments. The PROLED study aims to answer questions related to these unmet medical needs.

      The study design is prospective, longitudinal and naturalistic. Qualitative interviews,
      psychometric tests, questionnaires are used to collect data on psychopathology. There is also
      collection of blood, urine and faeces.
