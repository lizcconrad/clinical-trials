  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine the implementation of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
      self-sampling intervention for unscreened and under-screened transgender men and
      transmasculine individuals living in South Florida. The study will enroll participants to
      receive this cervical cancer screening intervention in community venues. The purpose of this
      study is to pilot the self-sampler for feasibility and acceptability within this underserved
      population.

    <description>This questionnaire, designed with substantial input from community partners, will gauge how acceptable the participants find HPV self-sampling through both closed and open-ended questions regarding ease of use, preference of self-sampler vs. physician-collected Pap smear, as well as open-ended inquiries regarding the self-sampling process.</description>
