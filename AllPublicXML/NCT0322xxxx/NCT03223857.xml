      This study evaluates the visual performance after bilateral implantation of multifocal
      intraocular lenses (IOL). This prospective study is performed at the department of
      Ophthalmology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.

      Patients who received bilateral implantation of a multifocal intraocular lens pre-enrollment
      were included consecutively. Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgeries excluding
      cataract surgery and refractive lens exchange, regular corneal astigmatism of &gt;1.5 diopter,
      and ocular pathologies or corneal abnormalities. At 3 months postoperative examination
      included manifest refraction; monocular and binocular uncorrected (UCVA) and
      distance-corrected (DCVA) visual acuity in at far, intermediate at near distance (logMAR);
      slit-lamp examination. 3 months postoperatively defocus testing, binocular contrast
      sensitivity (CS) under photopic and mesopic conditions, and a questionnaire on subjective
      quality of vision, optical phenomena, and spectacle independence were performed.
