  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical trial to determine whether a 12-week group therapy intervention for
      patients undergoing Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer can relieve disease-related
      anxiety and improve quality of life and delay elective treatment of prostate cancer. The goal
      of the study is to further our understanding of anxiety in men who have been diagnosed with
      prostate cancer and are undergoing Active Surveillance. Men who have elected Active
      Surveillance for their management of prostate cancer are eligible to participate in this
      study. After signing informed consent, all participants will complete two brief
      questionnaires (The Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer [MAX-PC] and the General
      Anxiety and Depression Scale 7 [GAD-7] to measure their anxiety levels. If the participant
      scores above a certain number, they will be asked to participate in the study. Patients will
      be randomly assigned to either a control group, who will receive no treatment, but continue
      to follow up with their urologist to manage their prostate cancer as usual, or the treatment
      group. The treatment group will receive 12 one-hour group therapy sessions that will take
      place once a week for 12 weeks with a licensed psychologist free of charge. They will be
      instructed to follow up with their urologist as previously determined for their prostate
      cancer management. Patients in both groups will be monitored for anxiety completing three
      questionnaires, the MAX-PC and GAD-7 which they previously completed, and the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) during the 4th and 12th weeks of therapy. If
      patients require further therapy beyond the group treatment sessions, the investigators may
      refer them to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further treatment.

    <description>Two groups, the experimental (recipients of group therapy) and the control (literature only) will be compared for anxiety based on their MAX-PC questionnaire scores. Eighteen questions about anxiety related to prostate cancer and prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests are graded from 0-3 (0 = not at all; 3 = often), yielding a total between 0 and 54.</description>

    <description>Two groups, the experimental (recipients of group therapy) and the control (literature only) will be compared for anxiety based on their FACT-P questionnaire scores. Twenty-seven questions about physical, social/family, emotional and functional well-being are graded from 0-4 (0 = not at all; 4 = very much), yielding a total between 0 and 108.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In secondary analysis, a mixed effects model will be used when the outcome vector consists of all three measurements (baseline, 4 and 12 weeks) and via statistical contrasts will examine whether the relationship between PSA anxiety scores and time is linear or if the effect of intervention on anxiety scores is fully observed by week 4. Two-sided p-values ≤ 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</description>
