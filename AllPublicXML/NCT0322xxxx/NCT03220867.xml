  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of Xian Risperdal compared
      with Gurabo Risperdal in Chinese healthy participants under fasting and fed conditions.

    <measure>Area Under Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Quantifiable (AUC [0-last])</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 15, 30, 45 minutes post-dose, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit [non-BQL]) concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 15, 30, 45 minutes post-dose, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C (0-last)/lambda(z)Í¾ wherein AUC (0-last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda (z) is elimination rate constant. AUC (0-infinity) will be assessed.</description>

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>
