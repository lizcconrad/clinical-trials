    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of early intervention program in Department
      of Children and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The
      investigators assume that the frequency of early-intervention and degree of family
      involvement will be associate with the treatment outcome.

      This prospective, non-randomized, open-label study is performed to assess the effects of
      adjunctive SI in the family-based treatment program of children with developmental delay
      (DD). The study subjects are children with DD who attended an early intervention (EI) program
      at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, which is the largest general hospital in the
      Southern Taiwan. Each participating child undergo a joint assessment by a pediatrician, a
      rehabilitation doctor, a child psychiatrist, a speech therapist, a physical therapist, an
      occupational therapist, and a social worker. Once the diagnosis of developmental delay is
      confirmed, the child will be scheduled for prescribed family-based early intervention in the
      same hospital. Children (between 2 to 4 years old) who attend the program will be enrolled in
      this study. Informed consent will be obtained from the children and their primary caregivers
      after they received a complete description of the study. The participants are categorized
      into three different groups based on their intervention method. The choice of intervention
      method will be according to the willingness and expedience of the children's caregivers.

    <description>The daily treatment session had eight children along with their major caregivers. The treatment was conducted by two experienced occupational therapists (OT), and each session lasted for four hours in the week-day morning with a 10-minute break. The goal of the sessions was to enhance children's development through cognitive training, behavioral modification plan and parenting skill training. Said therapists assisted the caregivers in improving their nurturing and parenting skills with their children, as well as their techniques with regards to influencing them.</description>
