      We conduct the clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined

    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor and esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma in China. Treatment of
      recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is usually poor. New treatments
      were needed. Apatinib, which was approved by CFDA (China Food and Drug Administration) for
      the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It
      competes with intracellular VEGFR-2's ATP binding sites highly and selectively, thereby
      blocking downstream signaling to achieve the goal of inhibiting neovascularization in tumor
      tissue. We have observed in clinical practice that some patients with esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma have benefited from the treatment of apatinib. So we conduct a phase II
      clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined with chemotherapy
      (platinum and fluorouracil) in treating recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma after the failure of conventional treatments.
