  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorder (OUD) is prevalent and causes substantial health and social burdens.
      Although evidence have showed the effectiveness of opioid agonist maintenance therapy in OUD,
      high drop-out rate and the requirement of continuing use of opioid agonists are the major
      problems. Therefore, to develop novel treatment for OUD is important.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method of brain
      stimulation used to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent studies showed that
      there may be potential therapeutic effects in rTMS for addictive disorder, including reducing
      craving and substance use severity. The underlying mechanisms of rTMS in treating addictions
      may involve increased dopamine function in corticomesolimbic brain circuits and modulation of
      neural activity in brain circuits that relevant to addiction. However, the treatment results
      of rTMS in OUD were lacked, and the analysis in functional brain imaging study,
      neuropsychological tests and other potential biomarkers under rTMS treatment were limited,
      too.

      Thus, the investigators will conduct the add-on double-blinded, sham-controlled study rTMS
      treatment in 40-60 patients with OUD under methadone maintenance therapy. Patients will be
      allocated to active and sham rTMS in a 1 : 1 ratio, and participants will receive rTMS on the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (15 Hz frequency, 4 seconds per train,
      inter-train interval of 26 seconds, 40 trains per session, total 11 sessions in 4 weeks). The
      treatment response, urine drug tests, craving scales and side effects to evaluate the
      therapeutic effects of rTMS will be examined. Neuropsychological assessments, functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and tests for potential biomarkers of immune parameters
      will also be measured during 12-weeks follow up. The study results will provide the important
      data in whether rTMS add-on methadone maintenance therapy is able to 1) reduce heroin use; 2)
      reduce craving for heroin; 3) be an effective treatment for OUD, and 4) be associated with
      improvement in fMRI, biological markers and psychological tests.
