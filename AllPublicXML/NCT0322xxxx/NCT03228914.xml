  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Oxymetazoline and Epinephrine (which
      are 2 different nasal decongestants both of which are routinely used before sinus surgery) on
      blood loss and the surgeon's view of the surgical field during sinus surgery.

    <description>The secondary endpoint will be to compare the amount of blood loss use after the use of epinephrine or Oxymetazoline. This will be done by subtracting the amount of irrigation used from the volume collected in the suction canisters to estimate blood loss. The Neptune 2 Waste Management System (NWMS, Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan), a closed suction system that digitally measures the amount of fluid suctioned will be used for more accurate measuring of fluid suctioned. Surgery lasts about 2-3 hours, and the suctioning stops immediately following the completion of the case.</description>
