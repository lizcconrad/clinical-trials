  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital Zika virus syndrome (SCZv) has been gaining attention in studies due to changes in
      the central nervous system and in the motor development of children. These changes resulted
      in an unexpected picture and without future predictability, with the appearance of several
      functional impairments and also on orthostatic posture. In this context, the protocol of
      orthostatism proposed here is a 10-week program of the use of a postural adjuster, the
      standing frame, made of its own with alternative material to the commercial models
      (cardboard). The use of low cost materials allows these devices to be made in the desired
      size without cost high, individually adapted, easy to be transported as it is light and can
      still be colored. It is an equipment that offers the opportunity to experience the
      orthostatic posture and mainly benefits children with little economic resources that enable
      the acquisition of traditional devices made of iron or wood and even imported equipment. The
      postural adjuster allows physical and sensorial opportunity, being an auxiliary resource in
      standing positioning, feasible for home use, besides being useful for performing functional
      activities. Thus, the objective will be to analyze the repercussions of the use of the
      standing frame on body alignment, muscle tone, gross motor function and gastrointestinal
      functions of children with SCZv. An uncontrolled intervention study will be conducted with
      children between 12 and 24 months of age, who will undergo an evaluation before use and after
      the use of the adjunct along with the proposed orthostatism protocol. The postural alignment
      will be evaluated through photogrammetry and the evaluation of muscle tone will be performed
      through the modified Tardieu scale. The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) scale will be
      used to assess the gross motor function of the children involved in the study. Questionnaires
      will be applied for the collection of maternal socio-demographic data, the child's data, the
      type and time of therapy that the child already participates, and the gastrointestinal
      functions. Evaluations will occur in four moments: initial / before use, on the first day of
      placement in the adjuster, after the first month after use and after the second month of use.
      For statistical analysis, the Shapiro Wilk Test will be applied to evaluate the normality of
      the data, and the Friedman or ANOVA tests for repeated samples, to analyze intra-group time
      factor for the dependent variables of each individual.
