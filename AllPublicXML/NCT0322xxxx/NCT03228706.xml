  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor medication adherence (MA) among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients had found to be
      gnarly and devastating (Krass et al 2015; Sharma et al 2014). It was estimated that more than
      half of the patients failed to achieve recommended glycaemic goals due to nonadherence
      (García-Pérez 2013; World Health Organization 2003). Furthermore, greater adherence rate was
      significantly associated with better glycemic control, fewer hospital visits and admissions,
      and lower medical costs. On the other hand, lower adherence rate was significantly associated
      with poor medication tolerance, the frequency of medication intake (&gt; 2 times a day), having
      concomitant depression and negative belief about the medications. Consequently, patients who
      poorly adhere to medications would take more medications due to the poor glycemic control and
      development of micro- and macrovascular complications (American Diabetes Association 2013).
      Such condition would further worsen their adherence due to more complex medications and a
      greater chance of experiencing drug-related side effects (García-Pérez 2013). This inevitably
      increases the economic burden and wastage to the healthcare system (Meng et al 2017). Hence
      breaking the vicious cycle is an urgent call to all stakeholders.

      Notably, Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) had initiated several interventions in curbing the
      MA problems at national level. One of those which has been perpetuated and led by pharmacists
      is &quot;Know Your Medicine&quot; (KYM) Campaign since 2007. The national KYM campaign aims to promote
      the quality use of medicines through mass communication and group-based approach. The
      messages conveyed include information on their medication management such as why, how and
      when to take medicines, reporting adverse drug events, awareness on the rational use of
      medicines and medications that need special precautions. In specific, assuring and improving
      medication adherence among patients is one of the important components of the campaign (PSD
      2008).

      In term of improving medication adherence among Malay T2DM patients, a structured group-based
      intervention (SGBI) called &quot;Know Your Medicine - Take It For Health&quot; with abbreviation
      KYM-TIGF, was created by the researchers of this study who work at Sarawak Pharmaceutical
      Services Division in 2016 under the KYM campaign. The KYM-TIGF is a theoretical based,
      patient empowerment, culturally appropriate and a combination of psychosocial, educational
      and behavioral intervention. It is a one-off SGBI that aims to improve the medication
      adherence through the message specially designed with a cross-theoretical framework as
      recommended by Slater (1999). The model to measure the effectiveness of the SGBI is an
      integrated model with Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen 1991) as main theory and
      Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills Model (Fisher et al. 2006) as supporting theory.
      The primary outcome of this study is the medication adherence level. The secondary outcomes
      of this study are the psychosocial variables of the integrated model which include attitude
      to medication adhere, the subjective norm to medication adherence, perceived behavioral
      control towards medication adherence, adherence information, adherence skill and intention to
      adhere.

      A current systematic review by Odgers-Jewell et al (2017) revealed that little had been done
      to investigate the effectiveness of group based education in improving medication adherence
      among T2DM patients. This concur with the comprehensive review on interventions to improve
      medication adherence by Conn &amp; Ruppar (2017), as the researchers conclude that there is an
      urgent need in evaluating the interventions to improve medication adherence that employs
      group-based approach.

      The evidence on the effectiveness of the KYM-TIFH in promoting medication adherence among
      T2DM patients remain lacking. Furthermore, the current measurement on the effectiveness of
      the campaign is the increment of the awareness level of public towards proper use of
      medicines (PSD 2013) without measuring the impact of the campaign on actual behavior change.

      Besides aforementioned, Malay ethnic was found to be the main contributor to the prevalence
      of poor MA (PSD 2013) due to forgetfulness (75.3%) and reluctant to take prescribed
      medications (43.8%). Facing the high prevalence of poor MA among Malay patients, an effective
      and efficient approach which could engage more patients within a shorter period of times to
      improve the medication adherence problems is highly preferred (Odgers-Jewell 2017). Hence,
      all the problem statements addressed above lead to the necessity of conducting this study,
      which aims to investigate the effectiveness of the SGBI &quot;KYM-TIFH&quot; in improving MA among
      Malay patients with T2DM.

      Based on the problems stated above, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the
      SGBI &quot;KYM-TIFH&quot; in improving MA among Malay patients with underlying T2DM in the Sarawak
      State of Malaysia. Based on the two main research questions, three specific objectives of
      this study are:

        1. to measure the effectiveness of the KYM-TIFH in improving medication adherence among
           Malay patients with underlying T2DM.

        2. to test the predictive capacity of the integrated model in explaining the MA among Malay
           patients with underlying T2DM.

        3. to measure the impact of the KYM-TIFH on the psychosocial variables of MA.

      Based on the first specific objective, two hypotheses to be tested are:

      H1a: There is a significant difference of medication adherence level among participants
      before and after the intervention.

      H1b: There is a significant difference of medication adherence level after the intervention
      between participants from intervention group and control group.

      Based on the second specific objective, six hypotheses to be tested are:

      H2a: There is a significant relationship between attitude to adherence and intention to
      adhere.

      H2b: There is a significant relationship between subjective norm to adherence and intention
      to adhere.

      H2c: There is a significant relationship between perceived behavior control to adherence and
      intention to adhere.

      H2d: There is a significant relationship between perceived behavior control to adherence and
      medication adherence.

      H2e: There is a significant relationship between intention to adherence and medication
      adherence.

      H2f: There is a moderating effect by adherence information between intention to adhere and
      medication adherence.

      Based on the third specific objective, five hypotheses to be tested are:

      H3a: There is a significant difference of attitude to adhere after the intervention between
      participants from intervention group and control group.

      H3b: There is a significant difference of subjective norm to adhere after the intervention
      between participants from intervention group and control group.

      H3c: There is a significant difference between perceived behavioral control to adhere after
      the intervention between participants from intervention group and control group.

      H3d: There is a significant difference of intention to adhere after the intervention between
      participants from intervention group and control group.

      H3e: There is a significant difference of adherence information after the intervention
      between participants from intervention group and control group.

      Operational definitions:

        1. Medication adherence: Medication adherence is defined as the level of patients in
           complying with the medications prescribed by healthcare providers. Such level of
           compliance is measured through 8 items Morisky Medication Adherence Scale Malaysian
           specific (Morisky et al., 2008; Chung et al. 2015) which had been validated among T2DM
           patients in Malaysia.

        2. T2DM Malay patients: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Malay patients of this study refers to all
           the patients who are prescribed with oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents (OHA) and obtain
           their medications supply from the pharmacy department of Kota Samarahan Health Clinic
           (KS-HC) and Petra Jaya Health Clinic (PJ-HC) during the study period. Such T2DM patients
           whose identity card show their religion as Islam, will be considered as Malay T2DM
           patients for this study.

        3. Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial refers to the
           study design employed by this study with accordance to the Recommendations for
           Intervention Trials &quot;SPIRIT&quot; (Chan et al. 2013) and will be reported in accordance to
           the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statements with extension to
           cluster randomized trials (Campbell et al. 2012).

        4. Structured group based intervention: The structured group based intervention of this
           study refers to the program &quot;Know Your Medicine - Take it for Health&quot; which was
           formulated and employed by the Pharmaceutical Services Division of Sarawak State Health
           Department in late 2016 under the national campaign &quot;Know Your Medicine&quot; to promote
           medication adherence among T2DM Malay patients. The official name of the intervention is
           &quot;Kenali Ubat Anda - Ambillah untuk Kesihatan&quot; in Malay language or &quot;Know Your Medicine -
           Take it for Health&quot; in English with abbreviation KYM-TIFH.

        5. Effectiveness: The effectiveness of this study refers to the improvement of medication
           adherence level among T2DM Malay patients before and after the SGBI with such
           improvement having a significant difference as compared to the results in control group.
           Furthermore, the effectiveness of the SGBI will be complemented by the qualitative data
           through focus group discussion and a semi-structured interview.

        6. Complications: The complications in this study refers to the diabetes-related
           complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, diabetic foot problems, ischemic heart
           disease and stroke that had been diagnosed by doctors and were documented in patients'
           medical records during the period of study.

    <intervention_model_description>To achieve the objectives, positivist approach with experimental study design will be employed. In specific, it is a double blinded, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) which involve two study sites. Cluster-RCT is a type of RCT that randomize the groups or clusters of individuals rather than individuals themselves. It is the only valid and feasible approach for the assessment of interventions used in health promotion and educational interventions (Puffer et al. 2005). The study design of the cluster-RCT is based on the Recommendations for Intervention Trials &quot;SPIRIT&quot; (Chan et al. 2013) and will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statements with extension to cluster randomized trials (Campbell et al. 2012). Nonetheless, the reporting of the SGBI will be in accordance with the checklist recommended by Borek et al. (2015).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A person who is independent of this study and invited by principal investigator will carry out the randomization based on the list of participants who are eligible and agreed to participate. The list of participants with their group randomization information will be kept by the committee member without informing any of the researchers including principal investigator or respondents to assure the blinding of both parties throughout the study. On the day of the intervention, that person will register the attendance of respondents and inform them about the actual venue of the program without informing the researchers or the facilitators of the KYM-TIFH. Each HCKS and HCKS will have two venues prepared and available during the period of the study with one venue allocated for intervention group and the other one with for control group. None of the respondents were aware of the difference between the with assigned.</masking_description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Know Your Medicine - Take It For Health (KYM-TIFH)</intervention_name>
    <description>The KYM-TIFH employed psychosocial, educational and behavioral approach. It was designed based on the application of multiple behavior change theories and persuasion theory as recommended by Slater (1999). The cross-theoretical framework for the message design of intervention as recommended by Slater (1999) involved theories such as Transtheoretical Model (TTM) (Prochaska &amp; Velicer 1997), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein 1980), Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) (Rogers 1975), Elaboration-Likelihood Model (ELM) (Petty and Cacioppo 1986) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (Bandura 1992) as in Table 2. Nonetheless, the intervention embraces the philosophy of patients' empowerment, which had found to be effective in engaging patients to produce behavioral change among diabetes patients (Anderson 1995; Anderson et al 1995). Hence, the facilitators are trained to employ a non-didactic approach in facilitating the and eliciting the learning among the group members.</description>
