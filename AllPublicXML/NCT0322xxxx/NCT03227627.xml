  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheostomy tubes are known to have a negative impact on swallowing. Dysphagia treatment
      includes using laryngoneuromuscular electrical muscular stimulation (LNMES). Evidence exist
      on the efficacy of LNMES in the treatment of dysphagia in adults, and scarce in pediatrics.
      There is no literature available for the efficacy of LNMES in the treatment of dysphagia on
      patients with tracheostomy tubes. The purpose of this study to determine the outcomes on
      dysphagia on children with tracheostomy tubes when treated using LNMES. Furthermore, the
      investigators aim to determine the relationship between parental stress and a child's
      modified diet.

    <intervention_model_description>One group of children (Group A) will receive 24 sessions of NMES for combined with traditional therapy including oral motor exercises and laryngeal exercises will be performed to the participants. The other group (Group B) will be receiving 24 sessions of traditional dysphagia therapy. After the 24 sessions, participants will have a repeat MBSS and results will be scored using the Pen-Asp scale and FOIS scale. Both the control group and experimental group will answer the PSI-4 after the repeat MBSS.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>One group of children (Group A) will receive 24 sessions of NMES for combined with traditional therapy including oral motor exercises and laryngeal exercises will be performed to the participants. The equipment to be used for NMES is VitalStim®. VitalStim is a product of Empi®. VitalStim® therapy involves the placement of electrodes to the muscles of the throat that is attached to a device that provides electrical stimulation. The intensity will be increased according to the subject's tolerance and when a &quot;therapeutic&quot; level is reached. Signs of reaching therapeutic level include changes in audible quality of swallows, triggers of swallows, and changes in quality of voice. This therapy is to be performed by a VitalStim® certified practitioner.</description>
