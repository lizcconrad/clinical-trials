  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) refers to the clinically cervical visible lesion with
      a diameter of &gt; 4 cm, which has been considered as a high risk of early cervical cancer for a
      long time. Because of local bulk lesion of LACC, the risk of radical hysterectomy is pretty
      high and the radical effect commonly does not meet the satisfactory. Therefore, 1-3 course of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were carried out before operation. However, nearly 20% of
      patients are not sensitive to NACT. Therefore NACT did not bring any benefits to radical
      surgery even to some extent delayed the treatment.

      Traditional radiotherapy is also commonly used in the treatment of LACC, however ovarian
      function would be permanently destroyed especially for young patients, additionally
      radioactive complications to adjacent organs of cervical such as vagina, bladder and rectal
      also commonly happened, moreover sexual dysfunction after radiotherapy significantly affect
      the life quality of young patients.

      Particle radiotherapy developed recently, has the advantages of short course of treatment and
      mild side effects, due to its special working mechanism, Bragg effect. So the amount of
      radiation in the tumor tissue is very extremely high, and in the adjacent tissue is quiet
      low, therefore the organs at risk were protected by avoiding unnecessary damage.

      Based on these, we proposed the application of particle radiotherapy in LACC pre-operation,
      and comprehensively evaluated recent curative effect, complications and long-term follow-up
      between particle radiotherapy and NACT. Furthermore, the clinical significance and long-term
      application prospects about particle therapy were objectively assessed.

    <description>The patients will receive particle radiotherapy before operation,and then radical hysterectomy, removal of pelvic lymph nodes and abdominal aorta lymph nodes would be conducted. Besides ovary reservation would be made according to the individual situation. Concurrent radiation and chemotherapy would be performed according to the clinical situation.</description>
