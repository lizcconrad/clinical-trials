  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that lean mass, in particular muscle mass, is an excellent
      predictive survival factor in many diseases. A better knowledge of the mechanisms responsible
      for muscle atrophy and the identification of atrophic process markers are deeply needed for
      the development of new anti-atrophic therapies. Either as drugs used to treat several medical
      conditions or as endocrine hormones released in response to many stress situations (e.g.,
      sepsis, cancer, insulinopenia…), glucocorticoids (GC) are recognized to play a major role in
      skeletal muscle atrophy. Indeed, the inhibition of GC action by a receptor antagonist (RU486)
      or by muscle-specific invalidation of the GC receptor inhibits the muscle atrophy in these
      stress situations. Therefore, all these data clearly indicate that GC play a major role in
      skeletal muscle atrophy observed in several conditions. Emerging evidence has revealed that
      the skeletal muscle has a secretory function. Human skeletal muscle secretome was first
      estimated at about 300 proteins by computational analysis and proteomic analysis have
      recently confirmed these results. Some of these secreted proteins, conceptualized as
      myokines, can act locally on muscle cells through autocrine/paracrine loops and on
      surrounding tissues such as muscle blood vessels or can be released into the blood stream to
      produce systemic effects. One prominent example is interleukin (IL)-6 which is released into
      circulation by contracting skeletal muscle and can regulate metabolic and inflammatory
      processes. As IL-6, several other potential myokines have been identified including IL-8,
      IL-15, insulin-growth factor I (IGF-I), follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) or fibroblast-growth
      factor (FGF)-21. Moreover, secreted proteins may also reflected metabolic changes which take
      place in muscle cells. Indeed, myoblast differentiation is accompanied by dramatic changes in
      the secreted proteins profile as increased expression of Semaphorins, IGF-I, matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 or Collagens. Thereby, the investigators hypothesized that skeletal
      muscle atrophy induced by GC is associated with specific alterations of the muscle secretome.
      The aim of this project is to identify the GC-induced changes in the secretome of human
      skeletal muscle cells in culture (in vitro approach) and to determine how these changes
      translate into the circulation of subjects exposed to high concentrations of GC (Cushing's
      syndrome) (in vivo approach). Characterization of these changes in human subjects should
      allow to better understand the cellular mechanisms involved in muscle atrophy and might lead
      to identify circulating biomarkers associated with skeletal muscle atrophy, as telopeptides
      are for bone tissue.

        levels generally due to a pitiutary or adrenal adenoma. These patients were compared to
        heathly control patients who are matched for age and sex.
