  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is significant unmet need for effective treatment options for Diffuse Cutaneous
      Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc). The present study will be a dose-escalation safety trial of
      brentuximab vedotin, a drug-antibody conjugate approved for the treatment of lymphoma and
      targeted to the protein CD30 molecule expressed on activated immune cells There is evidence
      for CD30 involvement in SSc. This study represents the first step in determining safety and
      tolerability of brentuximab vedotin in SSc.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter prospective double blind placebo controlled dose escalation safety
      clinical trial with brentuximab vedotin and stable background immunosuppressive therapy in
      adult individuals with Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc). Adult male and female
      participants with dcSSc will be recruited by a collaborative group of clinical sites in the
      United States. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled without regard
      to gender, race, or ethnicity.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to study treatment, either brentuximab
      vedotin or placebo equivalent in a 6:2 ratio favoring brentuximab vedotin. Three dose cohorts
      are planned with 8 participants in each cohort, for a total of 24 participants.

      The doses planned for each ascending dose cohort include 0.6mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, and 1.8 mg/kg
      brentuximab vedotin or placebo equivalent. All cohorts will receive intravenous
      administration of study medication every 3 weeks for 21 weeks, for a total of eight doses.
      Following completion of treatment, participants will undergo follow-up visits at weeks 24,
      28, 36 and 48.

    <time_frame>From Baseline (prior to assigned treatment administration) to week 24 and week 48 post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This is a patient self-administered health assessment questionnaire. The SHAQ-DI assesses five scleroderma-specific visual analogue scale (VAS) items to explore the impact of participant's disease. These items were developed to measure the effect of scleroderma on five elements of disease that could have a great impact on a participant's daily activities. Each VAS item is rated separately (0−100 millimeters [mm]), with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The five items are: 1) intestinal disease, 2) breathing problem, 3) Raynaud syndrome, 4) finger ulcers, and 5) overall disease. The measure produces a discrete value that can change through time and in response to medication.</description>
