    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II trial evaluates LOAd703 in patients with cancer (pancreatic, biliary,
      colorectal or ovarian) together with their standard of care chemotherapy or using gemcitabine
      immune-conditioning. LOAd703 is administered by intratumoral image-guided injections. Maximum
      50 patients can be enrolled.

      LOAd703 is an immunostimulatory gene therapy using an selection replication competent
      adenovirus as a gene vehicle. The virus is derived from serotype 5 adenovirus with the fiber
      from serotype 35. It expresses the transgenes trimerized membrane-bound isoleucine zipper
      (TMZ) TMZ-CD40L and 41BBL under control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.

      The trial is a Phase I/II trial evaluating the effect of LOAd703 in patients with pancreatic
      cancer, biliary cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. LOAd703 is an oncolytic
      adenovirus serotype 5/35 encoding immunostimulatory transgenes: TMZ-CD40L and 41BBL. In Phase
      I, three doses (total viral load - 1x10e11, 5x10e11, 1x10e12 viral particles (VP)) of LOAd703
      will be tested as add-on to standard of care or immune-conditioning gemcitabine chemotherapy.
      8 treatments of LOAd703 will be delivered by image-guided intratumoral injection at the same
      time of chemotherapy. In Phase II stage of the study, patients will be treated at maximum
      tolerated dose/maximum tolerated study dose as defined in the Phase I stage. In both phases:
      tumor biopsies, blood samples and radiological imaging will be performed to evaluate safety,
      effect and mechanisms of action. Further, patients will be subjected to oral and rectal
      swabs, and urine sampling to determine virus shedding. The patients will be monitored for
      time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival.

               1. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) I. A patient with refractory or recurrent metastatic
                  CRC who has either received all conventional therapy; or is entering a &quot;resting&quot;
                  phase between reasonable conventional treatments. II. A patient who is amenable
                  to treatment with LOAd703 plus gemcitabine as a single agent conditioning
                  regimen.

               2. Pancreatic cancer I. A patient with either locally advanced, unresectable or
                  metastatic disease who is eligible to receive any line of conventional treatment
                  consisting of gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel. II. A patient who is amenable to
                  treatment with LOAd703 as an &quot;add-on&quot; to standard-of-care gemcitabine-based or
                  nab-paclitaxel- based regimens or gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel as single agents.

                  metastatic biliary cancer who is either treatment-na√Øve or has received any
                  number of lines of treatment. II. Patient who is amenable to treatment with
                  LOAd703 as an &quot;add-on&quot; to standard-of-care treatment consisting of gemcitabine

             following first-line standard-of care combination chemotherapy. iii) A history of

             associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal),

             illness/social situations that in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise
             compliance of study requirements or put the patient at unacceptable risk.

         10. Other malignancies within the past 2 years (not including basal and squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, localized prostate cancer or in situ cervix carcinoma).
