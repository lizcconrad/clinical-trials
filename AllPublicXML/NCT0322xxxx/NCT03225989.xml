    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II trial evaluates LOAd703 in patients with cancer (pancreatic, biliary,
      colorectal or ovarian) together with their standard of care chemotherapy or using gemcitabine
      immune-conditioning. LOAd703 is administered by intratumoral image-guided injections. Maximum
      50 patients can be enrolled.

      LOAd703 is an immunostimulatory gene therapy using an selection replication competent
      adenovirus as a gene vehicle. The virus is derived from serotype 5 adenovirus with the fiber
      from serotype 35. It expresses the transgenes trimerized membrane-bound isoleucine zipper
      (TMZ) TMZ-CD40L and 41BBL under control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.

      The trial is a Phase I/II trial evaluating the effect of LOAd703 in patients with pancreatic
      cancer, biliary cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. LOAd703 is an oncolytic
      adenovirus serotype 5/35 encoding immunostimulatory transgenes: TMZ-CD40L and 41BBL. In Phase
      I, three doses (total viral load - 1x10e11, 5x10e11, 1x10e12 viral particles (VP)) of LOAd703
      will be tested as add-on to standard of care or immune-conditioning gemcitabine chemotherapy.
      8 treatments of LOAd703 will be delivered by image-guided intratumoral injection at the same
      time of chemotherapy. In Phase II stage of the study, patients will be treated at maximum
      tolerated dose/maximum tolerated study dose as defined in the Phase I stage. In both phases:
      tumor biopsies, blood samples and radiological imaging will be performed to evaluate safety,
      effect and mechanisms of action. Further, patients will be subjected to oral and rectal
      swabs, and urine sampling to determine virus shedding. The patients will be monitored for
      time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival.

          1. Have histologic or cytologic evidence of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), pancreatic
             carcinoma (PC), biliary cancer, or epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC which may
             encompass epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma).

          2. Have advanced disease, defined as cancer that is either metastatic or locally
             advanced, unresectable, and for which radiotherapy or other locoregional therapies are
             not considered treatment of choice but systemic chemotherapy or no therapy is planned.

               1. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) I. A patient with refractory or recurrent metastatic
                  CRC who has either received all conventional therapy; or is entering a &quot;resting&quot;
                  phase between reasonable conventional treatments. II. A patient who is amenable
                  to treatment with LOAd703 plus gemcitabine as a single agent conditioning
                  regimen.

               2. Pancreatic cancer I. A patient with either locally advanced, unresectable or
                  metastatic disease who is eligible to receive any line of conventional treatment
                  consisting of gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel. II. A patient who is amenable to
                  treatment with LOAd703 as an &quot;add-on&quot; to standard-of-care gemcitabine-based or
                  nab-paclitaxel- based regimens or gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel as single agents.
                  c. Biliary cancer I. A patient with either locally advanced unresectable or
                  metastatic biliary cancer who is either treatment-naïve or has received any
                  number of lines of treatment. II. Patient who is amenable to treatment with
                  LOAd703 as an &quot;add-on&quot; to standard-of-care treatment consisting of gemcitabine
                  combined with other agents (e.g. gemcitabine/low-dose cisplatin,
                  gemcitabine/oxaliplatin, etc) in the first line setting or gemcitabine in a
                  combination regimen or as a single agent in latter lines of treatment. d. Ovarian
                  Cancer I. A patient with either epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary

             ii) Platinum-sensitive disease (platinum free interval ≥ 6 months) in early relapse
             following first-line standard-of care combination chemotherapy. iii) A history of
             having received at least 3 lines of standard treatment. These treatments should have

             on a patient-by-patient basis as per principal investigator's discretion. A rough
             guideline for defining low tumor burden is that the sum of the product of the
             bidimensional measurements for all lesions is &lt; 70 cm2.

          5. Have a measurable disease by standard imaging techniques per RECIST criteria.
             Measurable lesions must be outside of any prior radiation field(s), unless disease

          7. Be medically suited to sedation if required during intratumoral injections.

          8. Be at least 18 years-old.

          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2.

         10. Have no remaining acute toxic effects from previous anticancer therapy &gt; grade 1

         12. The patient must understand and be willing to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any concurrent treatment that would compromise the study including but not limited to
             continuous high dose corticosteroids (&gt;0.5mg/kg), lymphodepleting antibodies or
             cytotoxic agents.

          2. Treatment with high dose immune inhibitors including lymphotoxic monoclonal antibodies
             such as alemtuzumab (CampathR), or sirolimus (RapamuneR) and its analogs, biological

             methods are: combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception
             associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal),
             progesterone-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
             (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing
             system, bilateral tubal occlusion and vasectomized partner.

             illness/social situations that in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise
             compliance of study requirements or put the patient at unacceptable risk.

         10. Other malignancies within the past 2 years (not including basal and squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, localized prostate cancer or in situ cervix carcinoma).
