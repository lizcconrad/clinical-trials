             renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,
             neurologic, oncologic, or psychiatric disease or any other condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or the
             validity of the study results.

          -  A clinically significant abnormal finding on the physical exam, medical history,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or clinical laboratory results at screening.

          -  Elevated CK at screening (one repeat test allowed).

          -  History of Gilbert's syndrome.

          -  Pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility,
             hepatic and/or renal function that could interfere with the absorption, metabolism,
             and/or excretion of the study drug.

          -  Abnormal screening ECG: including machine-read QTcF &gt;450 msec (confirmed by manual
             over read), QRS &gt;110 msec, intermittent bundle branch block, frequent premature atrial
             or premature ventricular contractions, or any rhythm other than normal sinus rhythm
             which is interpreted by the Investigator to be clinically significant.

          -  History of sensitivity to a similar study drug (e.g., Karo Bio KB2115 or Metabasis
             MB7811), or a history of important drug or other allergy (except for untreated,
             asymptomatic seasonal allergies at time of dosing) unless deemed not clinically
             significant by the Investigator.

          -  History of sensitivity to thyroid medication.

          -  Has been on a significantly abnormal diet during the 4 weeks preceding the first dose
             of study medication.

          -  Has participated in a standard radiolabeled clinical trial within the last 12 months
             prior to the first dose of study medication or a micro tracer clinical trial within
             the last 3 months prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Has participated in another clinical trial (randomized subjects only) within 30 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Use of any over-the-counter (OTC) medication (including nutritional or dietary
             supplements, herbal preparations, vitamins, or acetaminophen) within 7 days prior to

             approval by the Investigator.

          -  Use of any prescription medication from 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication until the end-of-study visit without evaluation and approval by the
