  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disorder responsible for pulmonary
      failure and multi-systemic complications involving specific and large medical care burden. To
      date, no program has shown its effectiveness in improving therapeutic adherence. A new
      approach to develop a co-constructed program involving patients and professionals may
      contribute to improve therapeutic adherence.

      Objectives The aim of the MUCOBS-Trial project is to create a program to increase therapeutic
      adherence and to evaluate its efficacy in adult patients with cystic fibrosis in 3 CF centers
      in France.
