      The primary objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial in a real life setting is
      to evaluate the cost-utility of limumab monotherapy compared with the combination of
      adalimumab and a maximum of three surgeries after two years of treatment in adult patients
      with moderate to severe HS.

      The primary objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial in a real life setting is
      to evaluate the cost-utility of limumab monotherapy (Group A) with the combination of
      adalimumab and a maximum of three surgeries (Group B) years of treatment in adult patients
      with moderate to severe HS.

      Patients in group A will be treated with adalimumab monotherapy according to normal clinical
      practice and will be given the possibility to crossover into Group B when they do not achieve
      the HiSCR after 6 months of treatment. Additionally patients will be offered treatment with
      infliximab, according to clinical practice, until the last surgery. Patients in group B will
      receive adalimumab combined with a maximum of three adjuvant excisions of active lesions,
      both according to routine clinical practice.

             latent tuberculosis, serious active local and/or chronic infections, heart failure
             NYHA class III/IV, severe liver disease, pre-existing HIV, active viral hepatitis,
             demyelinating disease, or allergy to adalimumab or any other ingredients of HUMIRA®).

          -  Previous or current use of adalimumab or other anti-TNF-α therapy.

          -  Current or recurrent clinically significant skin condition in the HS treatment area
             other than HS.

          -  Presence of other uncontrolled clinically significant major disease.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women.

          -  Malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma), lymphoproliferative disease or a history of
             malignancy.

          -  Current use of oral antibiotics (a washout period of 14 days is required).

          -  Current use of oral corticosteroids (a washout period of 30 days is required).
