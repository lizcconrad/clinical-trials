      There are 2 parts in this study.

      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      trametinib when given with pembrolizumab to patients with refractory (has come back after
      treatment) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The goal of Part 2 of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab given alone
      or in combination with trametinib at the dose that was found in Part 1 of the study can help
      to control NSCLC in patients who previously received chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

      The safety of the study drugs will be studied in both parts.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for treatment of many types of cancers, including NSCLC. Trametinib is FDA approved and
      commercially for the treatment of melanoma. It is considered investigational to use the study
      drug(s) to treat the type of NSCLC you have.

      Up to 217 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 150 will take part
      at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 2 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled
      in Part 1 of the study, and up to 190 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, you will receive trametinib and pembrolizumab. The dose of
      trametinib you receive will depend on when you join this study. Your study doctor will tell
      you more about it.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will be assigned to 1 of 3 study groups based on your
      previous therapy history:

        -  If you have not previously received immunotherapy, you will be randomly assigned (as in
           the flip of a coin) to receive either pembrolizumab alone (Group 1, monotherapy) or
           trametinib and pembrolizumab (Group 2, combination therapy). You will have an equal
           chance (50/50) of being assigned to either group.

        -  If you have previously received immunotherapy, you will receive trametinib and
           pembrolizumab (Group 3, combination therapy).

      The study doctor will tell you what study drug(s) you are receiving.

      All participants will receive the same dose of pembrolizumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 21 days.

      If you are in Part 1 or if you are in Groups 2 or 3 of Part 2, you will take trametinib by
      mouth 1 time each day for 14 days before Cycle 1. This is called the Run-In Period. After
      that, you will take trametinib during Days 1-10 of all cycles. You will not take any study
      drug during Days 11-21.

      Trametinib should be taken with a full glass of water (about 8 ounces) at least 1 hour before
      or 2 hours after a meal. If you vomit after taking trametinib, you should not retake the
      dose. Wait and take the next dose as scheduled.

      If a dose of trametinib is missed, that dose can be taken if it is more than 12 hours until
      the next scheduled dose. Otherwise, wait and take the next dose as scheduled.

      You will receive a study diary that has instructions on how to take the study drug. In this
      diary, you should record what times you take the study drug and if you missed any doses or
      vomited after taking the drug. You should bring the diary to each clinic visit.

      You will also receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and
      beyond. You will not receive pembrolizumab during Cycle 1.

      Length of Study:

      You may take the study drugs for up to 2 years. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after 3 years of follow-up (described below).

      Retreatment:

      If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger, you may
      still be able to receive the study drug(s) if you and your doctor decide it is in your best
      interest. Sometimes the disease appears to get worse but the study drug(s) are actually
      working.

      However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug(s) because the disease may
      actually be getting worse. You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug(s).
      This could also delay starting other treatments. The disease may get worse to the point that
      you are no longer able to receive other treatments.

      If you choose to receive the study drug(s) after the disease gets worse, you will continue to
      have study visits as described below. The study doctor will discuss this option with you.

      Study Visits:

      It is possible that these visits may happen up to 7 days earlier or later than scheduled, if
      needed. At any time while you are on study, these tests/procedures may be repeated to check
      your health.

      Within 72 hours before your first dose of study drug(s), if you can become pregnant, blood
      (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of the 14-day Run-in Period and then on Day 1 of each cycle (all participants):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing (Day 1 of Cycle 1, for
           Group 1 only). Every 3 cycles, this sample will be used to check your thyroid function.

        -  You will have an EKG (Run-in period and Cycle 3 only).

        -  If your doctor thinks you need it, you will have an eye exam.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and then every 3 cycles after that, blood (up to 3 teaspoons) will be
      drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in
      your body may affect the disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this may be performed
      more often.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3, if you are in Part 1 or if you are in Groups 2 or 3 of Part 2, you will
      have a MUGA scan (Cycle 3 only).

      On Day 11 of Cycle 1 (for Part 1 participants and Groups 2 and 3 only):

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you are in Part 1 of the study, you will have a tumor biopsy for PD testing.

      During Cycle 3 and every odd numbered cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, 9, and so on), you will
      have imaging scans to check the status of the disease. If needed, you may have these scans
      performed more or less often.

      At about Day 21 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a tumor biopsy for PD testing. If you are in Part 1 of the study and had a
           biopsy at Day 11 of Cycle 1, you will not have this biopsy.

        -  You will have lung function tests. This testing may be performed more often, if the
           doctor thinks it is needed.

      Research Blood Testing:

      Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing at the below time
      points based on which study drug(s) you are taking. PK testing measures the amount of study
      drug in the body at different time points.

      For trametinib:

        -  On Day 1 of Run-In period, before the study drug dose and then 3 times over the 8 hours
           after the dose.

        -  On Day 11 of Cycle 1, Day 21 of Cycle 2, and Day 1 of Cycle 4, before the dose.

      Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for antibody testing within 24 hours before you
      receive pembrolizumab and at the same time PK blood samples are collected. In addition, blood
      will be drawn on Day 11 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of Cycle 4, and then every 12 cycles after that and
      at progression.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 7 days after your last dose of study drug(s) or at any time you stop taking part in
      this study:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an eye exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Part of this
           blood sample will be used for PD testing.

        -  You will have a chest x-ray, CT scan, and/or MRI.

      Follow-Up and Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug(s), you may have an ECHO or MUGA scan and
      asked how you are doing. If you do not come to the clinic for an ECHO/MUGA scan, you will be
      called by a member of the study staff. This call should take about 5-10 minutes.

      If you stopped taking the study drug(s) for reasons other than the disease getting worse, you
      will have an MRI/CT scan every 9 weeks.

      You will be called every 3 months for up to 3 years and asked about any cancer treatments you
      may be receiving. This phone call should take about 10 minutes.
