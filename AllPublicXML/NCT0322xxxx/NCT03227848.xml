  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The differentiation between innocent and pathologic murmurs through traditional auscultation
      can often be challenging, which in the end makes the diagnosis strongly dependent on the
      clinitians experience and clinical expertise. With the development of technology it is now
      possible to help diagnose heart murmurs using computer aided auscultation systems (CAA).
      eMurmur is an investigational CAA system (not FDA approved) and the investigators hypothesize
      that it can distinguish between AHA class I (pathologic murmurs) and AHA class III heart
      sounds (innocent murmurs and/or no murmurs) with a sensitivity and specificity equal or
      better compared to a similar FDA approved CAA system on market.

    <description>The primary endpoints of the study are sensitivity and specificity. The clinical reference gold standard diagnosis is defined as expert physicians' diagnosis confirmed by independently interpreted echocardiogram diagnosis.
True positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) will be determined via comparison of the heart murmur classification results with the clinical gold standard (echocardiogram) diagnosis.</description>

        Study participants will be chosen based on the heart murmur types required to meet a
        specified target patient population. Pre-selection of AHA class I and AHA class III
        patients will be done to achieve a reasonably similar distribution of murmur types compared
        to a US patient population. All major pathological and innocent murmur types will be
        included and their occurrence depending on age will be considered. Number of participants
        drawn: 120 participants across all ages will be included, 75% pediatric and 25% adult.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All age groups of patients will be included from 1day old

          -  Patients who are being followed for known congenital heart disease and are returning
             for follow up

          -  Patients referred for a suspected heart murmur

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mismatch between the expert physician's diagnosis (auscultation based) and the
             diagnosis resulting from echocardiography (independently read by a cardiologist
             blinded to the auscultation results). Note: both, the expert physician and
             echocardiography results must independently reach the same diagnosis, which is then
             accepted as the gold standard reference diagnosis to which both devices are compared
             to. This is necessary because not every pathology visible on an echocardiogram causes
             an audible murmur, and not every murmur heard by a medical expert might correlate to
             pathology.

          -  Patient whose behaviour does not allow for a standard auscultation by the physician
             (e.g. a screaming fit).
