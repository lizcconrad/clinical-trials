    <description>Chemotherapy 1:
First 2 courses of chemotherapy with the Capacitabine /cisplatin/ combination.Capacitabine1 g/me2 day 1 to 14. Cisplatin will be given at 20 mg/m2 as a one-hour bolus on day1-5.
Chemoradiotherapy:
At the end of the second 21 days of chemotherapy and one week of rest (day 57), a total of 45 Gy(1.8 Gyfx/d) of radiotherapy will be given with concurrent capacitabine 625 mg/m2 and weekly Taxol 45mg/m2 over 3 hours for 5 weeks.
Chemotherapy2:
Four to five weeks after chemoradiotherapy, Restaged and surgical resection, a D2 resection is encouraged. Peritoneal cytology will be obtained. The J-tube will be left in for at least 8 weeks after surgery to supplement patient's nutrition.
2nd courses of chemotherapy with the Capacitabine. Capacitabine1 g/me2 day 1 to 14. Chemotherapy will be repeated beginning on Day 29.</description>
