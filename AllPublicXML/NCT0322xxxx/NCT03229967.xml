  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to advance our knowledge of the factors that contribute to the
      development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung affecting premature infants.
      Specifically, the investigators will determine the complexity of the gut microbiota, the
      genera of the bacteria that naturally live in the gut, and determine if the relative
      diversity of the gut bacteria is a prognostic indicator of BPD. To accomplish this, the
      investigators propose to characterize the microbiota of human premature newborns with BPD,
      then validate this potential mechanism in mice. The investigators will enroll very low
      birthweight premature infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) at Le
      Bonheur Children's Hospital and Regional One Health that are at high risk to develop BPD. A
      cohort of well full term newborns may also be enrolled. Non-invasive stool samples will be
      obtained weekly over the first month of life. Infants that eventually develop BPD will be
      paired with infants that did not develop BPD. Stool samples from these infants will be sent
      for analysis. The investigators expect that reduced complexity of the gut microbiome is
      associated with BPD. The investigators will model the contribution of reduced microbiome
      complexity to the risk to develop BPD or death, as well as the association with disease
      severity. A companion study is also being conducted by the investigators exploring the
      mechanism using mice. The project investigates important factors leading to the development
      of BPD, and has the potential to directly translate to therapy for the most significant
      pulmonary complication of prematurity.
