    <textblock>
      Protocol PEN-866-001 is an open-label, multi-center, first-in-human Phase 1/2a study
      evaluating PEN-866 in patients with advanced solid malignancies whose disease has progressed
      after treatment with previous anticancer therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 will employ an adaptive model guided with overdose control principle to make dose
      recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Phase 2a begins once all patients treated in Phase 1 have been assessed for safety and the
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) has reviewed all safety data and recommends continuing with
      Phase 2a. PEN-866 will be evaluated using the recommended Phase 2 dose identified by the SRC
      at the conclusion of Phase 1 based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamics profile of PEN-866 during Phase 1.

    <time_frame>From the date of first treatment through the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>In Phase 2, for each of the 6 tumor-specific cohorts, ORR will be estimated and presented with 95% confidence intervals based on the exact binomial distribution.
In addition, for each tumor-specific cohort, a Bayesian approach will be used to estimate the ORR and its 95% credible interval based on the posterior distribution. At completion of the study, within each tumor-specific cohort, the prior distribution will be updated with all data available from the evaluable patients at the MTD to obtain the posterior distribution of the true ORR.</description>
