      The objective of this study is to determine whether stapling adversely affects the pulmonary
      parenchyma and the vascularisation of the adjacent segments. The aim of our work is to
      explore by thoracic densitometry with contrast the spared segments after stapling of the
      intersegmental plan following a thoracoscopic segmentectomy, 3 or 6 months post-surgery. the
      investigator will assess venous drainage and the arterial vascularisation of the remaining
      segments, possible modifications of the adjacent parenchyma and whether there is a defect of
      pleuro-pulmonary adhesion (residual pneumothorax).

    <textblock>
      Scheduled anatomical segmentectomies are increasingly popular, due to the development of
      minimally invasive techniques, the increased incidence of early-stage tumours, and the
      possibility of caring for patients with compromised health and/or limited respiratory
      function without compromising the oncological outcome, compared to current alternatives such
      as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (1).

      One of the challenges in the development of the thoracoscopic segmentectomy technique we have
      published (2-5) is the orientation (6-7) and the division of the intersegmental plane, by
      contrast to segmentectomy by thoracotomy where this is helped by palpation and the manual
      traction which can be used on the segment, along the intersegmental vein. The most commonly
      used technique to separate two adjacent segments remains stapling, despite its high cost and
      sometimes giving a less anatomical section, with a risk to encroach on the intersegmental
      vein. Moreover, there can be a partial plicator of the spared segment(s) which could in
      theory make them less functional.

      We have however shown that the postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were much lower
      than that of patients who had a thoracotomy, dropping from 42% for thoracotomies to 16% for
      thoracoscopies, the surgical approach being an independent predictive factor for
      postoperative complications (8).

    <description>The aim of investigators work is to explore by thoracic densitometry with contrast the spared segments after stapling of the intersegmental plan following a thoracoscopic segmentectomy, from 3 to 6 months post-surgery. The investigators will assess venous drainage and the arterial vascularisation of the remaining segments, possible modifications of the adjacent parenchyma and whether there is a defect of pleuro-pulmonary adhesion (residual pneumothorax).
The radiological evaluation criteria will be:
Presence and quantification of a defect in pulmonary expansion (residual pneumothorax)
Abnormal venous and arterial vascularisation of the remaining segments
Defect of the pulmonary parenchyma in contact with the staples line (atelectasis, vascularisation defect)</description>
