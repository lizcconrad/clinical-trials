  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tourniquet is widely used in orthopedic surgery. However, prolonged tourniquet inflation may
      cause a gradual rise in blood pressure, which named as tourniquet-associated hypertension.
      Thus, to effectively prevent the tourniquet related hemodynamic responses is important for
      patients receiving limb surgery.

      Tracleer is an endothelin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of pulmonary
      arterial hypertension. Tracleer can also be used to treat retistant hypertension. At present
      trial, the investigators are going to investigate the effect of Tracleer on
      tourniquet-associated hypertension during total knee arthroplasty.

      At present study, the investigators will use endothelin receptor antagonist, Tracleer
      (Bosentan), to investigate the effect of Tracleer on tourniquet-associated hypertension
      during unilateral total knee arthroplasty, and evaluate its safety and effectivity. The
      purpose of this study is to find a new therapy to prevent and treat tourniquet-associated
      hypertension.
