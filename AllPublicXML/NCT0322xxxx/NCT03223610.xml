  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of white blood cells found in the lymph nodes. It affects the
      system that fights infections and disease. Researchers want to learn how certain drugs work
      together to treat B-cell lymphomas. The drugs are venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone,
      obinutuzumab, and lenalidomide (ViPOR).

      Objective:

      To study the safety of ViPOR for people with B-cell lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with B-cell lymphoma whose cancer has returned or not improved after
      treatment

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests

        -  Tissue sample from previous procedure

        -  Imaging scans

        -  Registration for counseling on the risks of lenalidomide. They must get counseling at
           least every 28 days.

      Participants will have a bone marrow aspiration before treatment.

      Participants may have tumor samples taken.

      Participants will get ViPOR in 21-day cycles. For up to 6 cycles:

        -  Participants will get one drug by IV on days 1 and 2.

        -  Participants will take the other four drugs by mouth on most days. After their first
           dose of venetoclax, they will stay in the clinic for at least 8 hours and return the
           next day for monitoring. They may be admitted for more drugs or monitoring.

      Participants will keep a drug diary.

      Participants will have a physical exam and blood and urine tests at least once per cycle.
      They will have scans 4 times over 6 cycles.

      Participants will have a visit about 1 month after their last dose of study drug. They will
      then have visits every few months for 3 years, and once a year for years 4 and 5. Visits
      include a physical exam, blood tests, and scans.

      Background:

      Combination chemotherapy with Rituximab has been the mainstay of treatment for CD20- positive
      B-cell lymphomas

      Significant advances have been made in curing aggressive B-cell lymphomas with
      chemoimmunotherapy but indolent lymphomas and relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas remain
      mostly incurable with chemotherapy alone

      Targeted therapies aimed at disrupting key survival pathways in lymphoid malignancies are
      emerging and showing significant activity in NHL in both the relapsed and first-line settings

      Mechanistically-based combinations of targeted agents are likely to benefit patients who
      cannot tolerate or who relapse after or are refractory to standard chemoimmunotherapy

      ViPOR targets major survival pathways in B-cell lymphomas including BCL-2 (apoptosis); BTK
      (B-cell receptor signaling and NFKB); Cereblon (NFKB) and CD20.

      Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety and toxicity profile of the
      combination of Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab and Revlimid in
      relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies

      Eligibility:

      Women and men greater than or equal to 18 years of age

      ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2

      Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma,
      excluding MCL and CLL/SLL

      Adequate organ function unless dysfunction secondary to lymphoma effect

      Design:

      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase 1b study

      Standard 3 x 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated venetoclax with
      fixed dose ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and Revlimid with a small expansion cohort at
      the MTD.

      Maximum 6 cycles of combination targeted therapy every 21 days
