  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The incidence of human papilloma virus-driven oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC), a
      type of head and neck cancer, is rapidly increasing within the US. Currently, there are no
      screening methods for early detection. HPV16 E6 antibodies combined with ultrasound imaging
      may be a promising method for early detection of HPV-OPC. However, prior to testing HPV16 E6
      antibodies and ultrasound for HPV-OPC screening, larger studies are needed to further
      validate the utility of these methods in the diagnostic setting among patients with suspected
      and/or symptomatic HPV-OPC.

      Objective/Hypothesis: To investigate two promising screening modalities for the detection of
      HPV-OPC, transcervical ultrasound and HPV16 E6 antibodies. The investigators hypothesize that
      both ultrasound and HPV16 E6 antibodies will be highly sensitive for the detection of
      symptomatic HPV-OPC.

      Specific Aims: (1) Determine the sensitivity of ultrasound to characterize OPC tumors
      compared to current standard imaging modalities among patients with suspected or confirmed
      OPC. (2) To determine the sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 E6 antibodies for HPV-OPC. (3)
      Determine the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect HPV-OPC compared to current standard
      imaging modalities among patients that present with a neck mass and unknown primary tumor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 patients with suspected or confirmed OPC will undergo a transcervical ultrasound during
      their first visit at the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Clinic in addition to other imaging
      modalities (CT, MRI and/or PET) as indicated as part of routine clinical care; patients will
      also be asked to provide a blood specimen. Ultrasound exams will be performed by a clinician
      blinded to details of the case. All patients will have a CT as part of their diagnostic
      work-up. Sensitivity of ultrasound to detect tumors identified by CT will be determined.
      Approximately 40% of patients are expected to test negative on CT requiring MRI and/or PET
      imaging. Among this subset, the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect tumors identified by
      either PET and/or MRI will be determined. Tumor size will be determined by 3 ultrasound
      measurements along the largest diameter of the tumor; agreement between ultrasound and the
      clinical imaging modalities will be calculated. The investigators will recruit an additional
      78 OPC patients with pre-treatment serum banked within the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Cancer
      Biorepository (18 HPV-negative, 60 HPV-OPC) for HPV serologic analyses; total: 128 samples.
      Sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 E6 antibodies for detecting HPV-OPC will be calculated.
      As an exploratory aim, the proportion of tumors undetectable by CT, PET, and MRI, but
      detected by ultrasound will be determined.

    <time_frame>1 day at time of clinic visit</time_frame>
    <description>Ability to detect oropharyngeal tumor via ultrasound will be a primary outcome of the study. Characteristics including ability to detect tumor, tumor size, and tumor location will be recorded at time of ultrasound. The ultrasound findings will then be compared to other imaging modalities used as standard work-up (CT/MRI). This comparison will be used to determine sensitivity of ultrasound for detection of oropharyngeal tumors.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Both serum samples and oral rinse specimens will be shipped to German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg (DKFZ) for blinded analysis of HPV antibodies. The samples will be completely de-identified prior to shipment and thus, there will be no way for the testing laboratory to link the specimens back to the patients. A random sample of blinded duplicates (10%) will be included as part of quality control. Seroreactivity against the HPV16 E6 protein will be determined using multiplex serology, an antibody detection method based on a glutathione S-transferase capture ELISA in combination with fluorescent bead technology.</description>
