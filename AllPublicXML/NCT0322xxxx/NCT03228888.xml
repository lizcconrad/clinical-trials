  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) has been proven useful in the management of
      gait disturbances induced by Parkinson's disease (PD). Typically, the stimuli used to provide
      RAS consist of metronome or music-based sounds, which are not related with the auditory
      experience of walking. Based on previous laboratory research, it is hypothesized that the use
      of ecological sounds deriving from biological motion (i.e., footstep sounds) could have a
      greater impact compared to artificial sounds (i.e., metronome sounds), within a
      rehabilitation program. In a double-blind experiment, it was investigated the effects of 5
      weeks of supervised rehabilitation integrated with RAS. Thirty-two individuals affected by PD
      (age 68.2 ± 10.5, Hoehn and Yahr 1,5-3) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions
      (artificial vs. ecological sounds). Spatio-temporal parameters of gait and clinical variables
      were assessed before the rehabilitation period, at its end, and after a 3-month follow-up.
      The results revealed that the rehabilitation program integrated with RAS had positive effects
      on the majority of objective and subjective measures, independently of the type of sound.
      However, when the two groups were examined separately, the patients assigned to the
      ecological RAS condition were the only who improved both in terms of cadence and gait speed.
      Overall, the hypothesized greater effect of the ecological sounds compared to artificial
      sounds was only partially supported by data.

    <description>Participants were provided headphones and a portable MP3 device which played a metronome tick at specified rhythm calculated as follows: a) if a patient's cadence was below the normality, the BPM of the stimulus was set at a value of 10% higher than one's own cadence; b) if a patient's cadence was below, but close to normality (less than 10% difference), the BPM of the stimulus was set at normality values; c) if a patient's cadence was above the normality, the BPM of the stimulus was set at a value equal to one's own cadence.
Participants performed daily 30 minutes of walking assisted by the rhythmic acoustic stimuli.</description>
