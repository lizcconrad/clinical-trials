  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an observational blinded Validation study in pediatric patients below 3 years
      old with a diagnosis of Fever Without Source (FWS). In this study the investigators aim to
      validate the performance of a proteomic signature aiding the physicians to discriminate
      between viral and bacterial infections in febrile children. The study will also assess the
      prevalence of Human Enteroviruses (HEV), Human Parechoviruses (HPeV), Adenovirus (AdV) and
      Human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) viremia, as well as Kingella Kingae bacteremia in the study
      cohort.
