  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of diaphragm's manual therapy in addition to
      cervical spine manual therapy in terms of pain, cervical spine range of motion, trigger
      points pain pressure threshold, disability and quality of life in patient with chronic
      aspecific neck pain.

    <measure>Change in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 1, 2, 3, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is an 11-point scale from 0-10 (0 = no pain; 10 = the most intense pain imaginable).
Measures the subjective intensity of pain. Patients verbally select a value that is most in line with the intensity of pain that they have experienced in the last 24 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Range of motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 1, 2, 3, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Baseline Bubble Inclinometer (Mayer 1993, Cleland, 2006), placed on the vertex of the head, taken the ROM with the patient sitting straight (flexion, extension and lateral inclinations) and supine (rotations).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain pressure threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 1, 2, 3, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>Using a LIZARD Ahi-o-meter (CE), the change of the pain on the trigger points is measured, with the patient in sitting position, in upper trapezium and sternocleidomastoid muscle bilaterally, by the detection of trigger points from a map.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 3, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a self-report questionnaire used to determine how neck pain affects a patient's daily life and to assess the self-rated disability of patients with neck pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medical outcomes study short form 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 3, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a generic patient-reported outcome measure aimed at quantifying health status, and is often used as a measure of health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, 3, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>Through an interview, potential adverse effects are evaluated during and after the physiotherapy treatment.</description>

    <description>Real Diaphragm manoeuvres The experimental manoeuvres include the Doming The Diaphragm Technique as described by Digiovanna (2004), Chila (2011) and Yao (2014) and the Manual Diaphragm Release Technique as described by Ricard (2009), De Coster (2005) and Roha (2015). Both manoeuvres are performed in two sets of 10 repetitions, within a 1-minute interval.
Multifaced physiotherapy/osteopathic treatment includes: vertebral mobilisations (C0-D1), high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrusts of the cervical spine, soft tissue techniques</description>
