  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is one of the greatest challenges faced by healthcare services worldwide. It is
      associated with serious complications such as heart attacks, stroke, and peripheral artery
      disease as well as kidney disease, eye disease, and nerve dysfunction. Data from weight loss
      with bariatric surgery suggest that with the appropriate intervention, it should be possible
      to reverse diabetes and that the earlier the intervention occurs, the greater the chances of
      placing diabetes into remission. There is now a need to translate this knowledge into the
      medical care of younger patients with early diabetes who are overweight/obese. The aim of
      this study is to see if younger adult patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes
      who are participants in a programme incorporating a low energy diet and physical activity
      (lifestyle) will lower their weight, cardiovascular risk and improve their glycaemic control
      as compared to the usual care.

      The aim of the proposed study is to conduct a pragmatic randomised controlled clinical trial
      randomising young adult patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes to an intervention
      incorporating a low calorie diet and physical activity or usual care. The investigators
      hypothesise that patients in the low calorie intervention arm will have greater weight
      reduction leading to significant improvement in glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk.
      The primary outcome will be weight loss. The low calorie diet intervention arm is designed to
      achieve and maintain significant weight loss through decreased calorie intake, increased
      physical activity, and behaviour change. Usual care will include routine advice about diet
      and physical activity. Secondary outcomes include diabetes control, body composition, and
      quality of life.
