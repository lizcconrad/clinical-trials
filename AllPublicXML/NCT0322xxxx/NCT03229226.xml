  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2007, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has
      required evaluation of practicing attending physicians by management to ensure that
      procedural skills and medical care are meeting the accepted standards of care as assessed by
      each individual institution. This assessment is known as the ongoing professional practice
      evaluation (OPPE). There are several methods by which this can be accomplished, including
      through chart review of clinician practice and by verbally assessing knowledge of the steps
      required to do a particular procedure. However, for infrequently performed or complicated
      procedures, these methods may not allow objective evaluation on a regular basis. Simulation
      using task trainers or manikin models offers an alternative method of objective evaluation in
      a standardized setting.

      The goal of this study is to develop two simulated scenarios to assess physician skill in
      relatively uncommon procedures and compare the data obtained against the verbal assessment
      and chart review model previously used at our institution. Two raters will assess each
      practitioner's verbal and simulated procedures. They will also assess globally their
      confidence that the physician is capable of performing the procedure safely and correctly
      based on the verbal or simulated trial.

      The investigators anticipate that using a simulated experience for assessment will increase
      the ability of raters to assess proficiency for the purposes of an OPPE, specifically by
      increasing the number of critical procedural components that can be objectively evaluated.
      The investigators hypothesize that there will not be a strong relationship between the scores
      obtained on the verbal assessment and the scores obtained on the task trainer assessment. The
      investigators anticipate that there will be a portion of study participants that do not meet
      a minimum passing standard and may require additional deliberate practice and further
      testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physician training has developed over recent years to include simulation-based learning as a
      method of both formative and summative assessment. Simulation based medical education (SBME)
      with deliberate practice has been shown to be superior to traditional clinical education with
      respect to procedural skills in physicians in training (McGaghie,W.C. 2011), and a similar
      concept with Mastery Learning has shown to increase resident skill in lumbar puncture
      placement. In addition, it has been shown that Simulation Based Mastery Learning (SBML) in
      central line placement reduces hospital wide rates of central line associated bacterial
      infections.

      When used in continuing medical education (CME), simulation has been shown to be feasible,
      and to increase clinician confidence in patient management. A recent study of nephrology
      fellows and attendings in practice showed that both groups scored similarly on a pre-test
      examination, and that all fellows who completed mastery learning subsequently passed the
      checklist assessment at the competency level and rated the training session highly.

      In other work, simulation has been used for ongoing professional practice assessments (OPPE),
      for example in psychiatry using online simulated patients and assessments as a way of
      identifying a smaller number of attendings requiring focused assessment in person). Using
      electronically collected clinical data, anesthesia cases were reviewed for deviation from the
      standard of care on several key pieces of documentation common to many anesthesia procedures.
      This method of direct chart assessment for OPPE may be possible in anesthesia, a field where
      many cases have similarities in procedure, but would not work for a field such as Emergency
      Medicine, where the type and acuity of patient encounters varies greatly from day to day.

      The ability of Simulation to present a standardized, specific procedural need offers an
      opportunity to assess Attending Emergency Physicians on a variety of critical procedures in a
      concise way. The investigators' research aims to present one possible approach to this
      assessment.
