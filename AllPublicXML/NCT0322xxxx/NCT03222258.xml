    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the change of quality of life, treatment decision and utilization of
      health care depending on the use of palliative care in advanced cancer patients by a
      prospective cohort study. Participants will be separated into different groups by their
      intentions for using palliative care. Every participant will carry out the questionnaire per
      3 months. This cohort study will be ended a year after each participant enrolls. However, if
      the participant didn't survive during this study, the caregivers will be asked to fill out
      additional questionnaire after 3 months of the death.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cancer report physical, emotional, social and economic problems that
      may be due to the cancer itself or its treatment. Previous studies have shown the benefit of
      early palliative care in oncology. However, many Korean patients tend to start palliative
      care late even in general hospital. Because of the late start of palliative care, the burden
      of medical expenses increases, on the other hand, the quality of life of terminally ill
      patients decrease.

      In this study, the use of palliative care in advanced cancer patients will be evaluated by a
      prospective cohort study. The goals of this study are as follow:

      First, the clinical, psycho-social, and cognitive factors affecting quality of life, decision
      making, and hospital utilization (palliative medical team medical treatment, hospice and
      medical care) of patients with advanced stage cancer will be investigated.

      Second, this study will explore the effects of age-specific characteristics on quality of
      life and care.

      Third, an index, which reflects age-specific characteristics and predicts the time and
      content of terminal care will be developed. Improvements on the quality of life and care of
      patients with advanced stage of cancer or metastatic cancer are expected to establish
      effective terminal care strategies through this study.

      The patients' symptom and quality of life, choice of medical care, advance care planning and
      caregiver's burden of care will be evaluated every 3 months after confirming the willingness
      to use palliative care for cancer patients. 3 months after the death, a caregiver evaluation
      will be conducted and hospice use, medical expenses will be analyzed.
