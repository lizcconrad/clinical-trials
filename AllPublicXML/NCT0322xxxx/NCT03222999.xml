      The Korean Cardiac Arrest Research Consortium (KoCARC) is a collaborative research network
      developed to comprehend various researches conducted in the field of out-of-cardiac arrest
      resuscitation and to strengthen the cooperative effort in conducting studies. It was
      organized in 2014 with recruitment of hospitals willing to participate voluntarily to the
      consortium.

      Not only for emergency medicine, but KoCARC is expanding the research collaboration with
      cardiology, preventive medicine and epidemiology as well. To enhance the professionalism and
      effectiveness in research, seven research committees, which consists of Epidemiology and
      Preventive Research Committee (EPR), Community Resuscitation Research Committee (CRR), EMS
      Resuscitation Research Committee (ERR), Hospital Resuscitation Research Committee (HRR),
      Hypothermia and Post-resuscitation Care Research Committee (HPR), Cardiac Care Resuscitation
      Committee (CCR) and Pediatric Resuscitation Research Committee (PRR). Also Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board Committee (DSMB) is organized to provide annual review and Security and
      Ethics Committee to oversight security and ethical issues in research. Monthly meeting of
      interdisciplinary steering committee, consists of the consortium chair, steering committee
      chair, each research committee chair and secretary committee, is held to approve the proposed
      research agendas and to mediate between multi-center trial participating hospitals.

      KoCARC registry is a data collecting system composed of OHCA risk and prognostic variables
      developed to provide the platform to researches conducted in KoCARC.
