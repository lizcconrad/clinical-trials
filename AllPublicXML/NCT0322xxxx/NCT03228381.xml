      The objective of the BOSS Study is to assess acute anatomical and geometric annular and
      ventricular changes that occur when strategically positioned an external inflatable chambers
      are applied to the outside of the heart.

      Mardil Medical is developing an investigational device for functional mitral regurgitation
      intended to provide ventricular support with adjustable inflatable chambers to reduce annular
      dilation, correct papillary muscle displacement, and restore mitral valve leaflet coaptation.
      In doing so, Mardil Medical is interested in exploring the anatomical and geometric annular
      and ventricular changes that occur when strategically positioned external inflatable chambers
      are applied to the outside of the heart. Favorable benefits of circumferential reduction in
      ventricular wall stress favoring left ventricular (LV) remodeling and acute reshaping of LV
      segments subtending the deformed mitral valve apparatus needs to be better understood. Mardil
      Medical is pursuing this study as an initial phase in the Acute Evaluation of Anatomical and
      Geometric Changes using the Bladder on a Stick System (BOSS).

    <description>Patients who are undergoing open chest cardiac surgery via sternotomy will receive the BOSS device to assess acute anatomical and geometric annular and ventricular changes that occur when strategically positioned an external inflatable chambers are applied to the outside of the heart.</description>

    <description>The BOSS will be comprised of a flexible, medical grade silicone handle and interchangeable inflatable medical grade silicone chambers. The inflatable chambers will vary in geometry and will have silicone tubing attached to them to allow inflation and deflation of the chamber while in the pericardial space. During open chest cardiac surgery, a small incision will be made in the pericardium to allow for insertion of the BOSS device into the pericardial space. Once inserted, the BOSS device will be positioned in different locations around the outside of the heart and anatomical and geometric changes will be observed echocardiographically. Use of the BOSS device is expected to lengthen the procedure by an average of 15 minutes, and in rare instances may be extended beyond 15 minutes as deemed appropriate by the investigator. The BOSS will be removed prior to continuing with the planned surgery.</description>
