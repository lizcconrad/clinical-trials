    <textblock>
      This study will use a randomized controlled design to test whether patients who use medical
      marijuana, compared to a waitlist control group, experience a change in health outcomes
      (relief of symptoms, or adverse health outcomes such as new-onset symptoms of cannabis use
      disorders, neurocognitive impairments) or brain-based changes.

      This trial is a randomized, longitudinal study of medical marijuana (MM) that will: (1)
      characterize the impact of MM on indices of addiction, such as CUD, escalation of use,
      tolerance, and withdrawal among those who stop using, (2) assess, via dosing diaries, the
      effect of MM use patterns on use of other medications, and perception of underlying disease
      symptomatology, (3) characterize the impact of MM on neurocognitive performance, including
      executive function, memory, attention, and decision-making and (4) examine evidence for
      impact of MM on brain structure and function. This study will enroll 200 adults with no prior
      history of CUD or heavy marijuana use, who express interest in using MM to treat pain,
      insomnia, anxiety, and/or depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an
      active MM arm (n = 100), or to a waitlist control arm (WLC) (n = 100). Participants will be
      assessed at baseline, regularly for 3 months, and at a 6-month and 12-month follow-up for MM
      use behaviors, development of CUD, perception of disease symptomatology, and neurocognitive
      performance. Urine collected at each visit will be assessed with quantitative assays. MRI
      scans will be collected to longitudinally investigate possible brain changes associated with
      MM use.

          2. Competent and willing to provide written informed consent;

          3. Desire to use medical marijuana for self-reported pain, sleep, or affective (mood
             and/or anxiety including PTSD) symptoms.

          4. Not in possession of a medical marijuana card, but expressing intent to get one.

             alcohol use is permitted (defined as 16 or less on the AUDIT), and nicotine dependence
             is permitted because of the high co-use of nicotine and marijuana. Participants cannot
             meet current SCID criteria for a use disorder on any illicit substance other than
             nicotine.

          3. Pregnant (verified by a urine test).

          4. In the opinion of the investigator, not able to safely participate in this study
             because of any medical or psychological issues (e.g. psychosis) that might compromise
             their safety.
