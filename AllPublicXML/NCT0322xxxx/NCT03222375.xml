      Locomotor, transport and information functions in human body systems are carried out by
      active media in autowave regimes! Any living organism is a (micro-macro-mega) hierarchy of
      autowave subsystems-an ensemble of loosely coupled subsystems of a simpler structure. From
      the highest levels of the hierarchy, Autowave Codes-Signals arrive, which determine the
      transitions of subsystems from one autowave regime to another Autowave interaction (of
      Complex Coherent Action). Autowave interaction is a process associated with the evolution and
      interaction of spatial and wave structures in the active media of the organism.

      Chaos in organism functioning tells about health. Periodicity - Autowave reverberator may
      presage a disease - Autism Spectrum Disorder; Chaotic nature of oscillations in active media
      of physiological systems is more optimal for their vital functions than periodic one.
      Firstly, systems that function in chaotic regimes, can re-arrange themselves faster and
      easier in case of change of environmental conditions, i.e. the so called adaptive control is
      more easily implemented in them. Secondly, &quot;spreading&quot; of oscillations strength along
      comparatively wide frequency band takes place in chaotic regime.

      When an organism is young and healthy, physiological systems show the elements of chaotic
      behavior, i.e. irregularity and chaotic dynamics are the extremely important characteristics
      of health. Decrease in changeability and appearance of stable periodicity of Autowave
      reverberator are often connected with Autism.

      The main purpose is to study brain plasticity (the changes that occur in the brain through
      Autowave reverberator) in children with autism. Research suggests that during development,
      the brains of children may change in response to their Autowave reverberator differently than
      the brains of typically developing individuals. Investigators want to understand why and how
      this difference may contribute to the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this
      study, the investigators will be examining the effects of non-invasive neuromodulation SQUED™
      series 28.1 home-use for Treatment of Autowave reverberator of Autism.

      engineering, and computer science.

      Autowave Reverberator:

        1. Proved that, a Autowave Reverberator appears a result of a rupture of Autowave front;
           initial conditions - Natal Trauma:

           1.1 Proved that, such a rupture may occur, via collision of the Autowave front with a
           nonexcitable obstacle - brain injury or injury of vertebral;

           1.2 Proved that, such a rupture may occur by loss of excitation in a certain region of
           the Active medium - cerebral anoxia;

           1.3 Locomotor, Transport and Information functions in the physiological systems, and
           Communicative Efforts, Speech, Language and Related Cognitive Functions this is Autowave
           processes in Active media.

        2. An important feature of reverberators is that these Autowave sources have the highest
           frequency. By generating pulses at a maximum frequency such sources force out
           self-pacemakers of any other types from the medium. As a result, the Active medium is
           filled with only Spiral Autowaves:

           2.1 The basic parameters of a reverberator are the frequency of generated waves, the
           critical dimension and characteristics of the structure of the kernel, and the velocity
           of the kernel in space, at Drift of Spiral Autowaves and/or Annihilation of Spiral
           Autowaves, or Multiplication of Spiral Autowaves;

           2.2 Commonly, there are two characteristic regions in a reverberator: a kernel having an
           excitation &quot;tongue&quot; entering it and Spiral Autowaves generated by the kernel - one
           spiral/two spirals/three spirals/four spirals; central filament of the Autowaves-branch
           rotates Left/Right;

           2.3 The kernel can have the form of a circle or a ring, a so-called &quot;anomalous&quot; kernel.
           If the source drifts, the form of the kernel is involved and can hardly be determined
           unambiguously.

        3. Proved that, the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the Active medium:

           3.1 Proved that, due to this property, reverberators can Appear and Disappear in the
           different Endoderm/Mesoderm/Ectoderm of the Active media, and at different locations of
           the Active medium;

           3.2 Proved that, due to this property, reverberators can Appear and Disappear in the
           Ectodermal Active media - Brain/spinal cord/hair/Skin; central filament of the
           endogenous Brain branch/exogenous Skin-branch;

           3.3 Proved that, reverberators can Observe on the skin, Spiral Autowaves generated by
           the kernel - one spiral/two spirals/three spirals/four spirals; central filament of the
           Pileous-branch rotates Left/Right.

        4. Proved, Center of Synergetics/Dr. Synergetic (the name of a new physician - Nonlinear
           Control of Autowaves chaos in Active media), Nonlinear Control of Autowaves
           reverberators:

           4.1 Proved, Nonlinear Control of Autowaves reverberators: Hysteresis of Spiral
           Autowaves, Drift of Spiral Autowaves and Annihilation of Spiral Autowaves.

        5. Treatment of Autowave Reverberator of Autism (this will be administered by Presence of
           Clinical protocol CRF-SQUED™):

      5.1 Diagnostics of Autowave reverberators and Mathematical Modeling of Autowave reverberators
      in Active media + Algorithmic approach;

      5.2 Computational Simulation of Autowave reverberator and Mathematical Modeling of treatment
      code (Trade Secret) + creation Active medium SQUED™ for a patient;

      5.3 Recording for a patient of treatment code (Trade Secret) on the Image Converter/Sound
      Converter/Electromagnetic Converter + Autowave regime: Hysteresis of Spiral Autowaves; Drift
      of Spiral Autowaves; Annihilation of Autowave reverberator;

      5.4 SQUED™ Treatment of Autowave reverberator of Autism (Novel type energy/Non-invasive) +
      Semiconducting Quantum Excitonic Device - artificial active medium, where the processes of
      self-organization lead to creation and converter of Autowaves energy.
