    <textblock>
      This project pursues the validation of an innovative strategy to boost language learning,
      based on the benefits derived from sensorimotor training.

      The common belief of a rigid brain structure in adult life had to be reconsidered during the
      last decade. After training, local increase in cerebral cortex volume and thickness, the part
      of the brain containing neuronal cells and synapses, has been documented. Research has
      established that brain structures active during training expand while learning and return to
      baseline afterwards. The transient structural increase is thought to reflect &quot;work in
      progress&quot; within areas involved in learning, meant to integrate new skills in existing neural
      circuitries, via strengthening and/or selection of local neuronal connections. My main
      hypothesis is that other functions, as long as they rely on the activity of the same brain
      territories, can take advantage of this &quot;work in progress&quot;. To use an allegory, imagine the
      restauration of a building (brain area). It can start after the request of improvements from
      some of the residents (trained function) and then become the occasion for other tenants
      (other functions) to see realized also their own wish for improvements. In the end everybody
      will benefit from the restauration, provided that they all live in the same building and
      everybody has posed their requests during the &quot;work in progress&quot;. Out of the allegory, living
      in the same building means neural overlap of functions in the brain. The case of motor and
      linguistic systems represents, from this perspective, a unique opportunity. State-of-the-art
      research 1) proved the existence, and described the temporal evolution of brain plastic
      changes during sensorimotor learning, and 2) documented neural overlap and functional
      interactions of motor and linguistic systems. This posits solid bases for a crucial step
      forward, gravid of important consequences and applications. This project aims to take this
      step forward by directly testing the innovative hypothesis that brain changes induced by
      sensorimotor learning induce benefits for linguistic functions relying on the same brain
      territories.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be aged between 20 and 40 years old

          -  Give an informed consent by signature

          -  Be part of the national health security system (registered to the Securit√© Sociale)

          -  Be French speaker

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A person presenting an history of neurological, psychiatric or linguistic problems
             cannot be admitted

          -  Assumption of psychotropic drugs

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding woman

          -  A person under legal tutoring

          -  A person under care in other medical structure for reasons different from those of
             this research

          -  A person under administrative or judiciary contention

          -  A person who is not eligible to a MR-exam according to the relative screening
             questionnaire cannot be admitted to the experiments including MR acquisitions in the
             protocol

          -  A person who is not eligible to a tDC Stimulation according to the relative screening
             questionnaire cannot be admitted to the experiment including tDCS in the protocol

          -  A person who is defined as bilingual according to the criteria described above cannot
             be included in this research.

          -  A person who studied a musical instrument for more than 3 years or plays it regularly
             cannot take part to the studies in Objective B1, B2 and B3. This might introduce a
             confound in the rate of motor learning and relative brain plasticity.

          -  A person who has already learned or has been regularly exposed to the language L2
             and/or to the sign language chosen for the studies in Objective A1 and A2 cannot take
             part to those studies.
