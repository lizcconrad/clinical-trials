      Background &amp; Aims The enteropathy in Celiac Disease (CD) is due the adaptive and to the
      innate immune response to gliadin peptides. Gliadin peptide P31-43 activates innate immune
      response and interferes with vesicular trafficking. Type 1 interferons (INFs) and viral
      infections play a role in CD pathogenesis. In this paper investigators investigated the role
      of P31-43 in the activation of the INF-α pathway.

      Methods Small intestinal biopsies of CD patients both with active disease on gluten
      containing diet (GCD) and in remission phase of the disease on a gluten free diet (GFD) and
      controls were analyzed before and after culture with P31-43. The levels of toll like receptor
      7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), myxovirus resistance protein 1
      (MxA) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) proteins and INF-α mRNA was analyzed in intestinal
      biopsies.

      Intestinal biopsies from CD patients and controls were obtained after EGDS performed during
      routine analysis. The biopsies were immediately immersed in culture medium (Dulbecco's
      modified medium, DMEM) in a falcon tube and kept for 16h at 37 C before cultivation. Biopsies
      were cultivated as described in Barone MV1, Caputo I, Ribecco MT, Maglio M, Marzari R,
      Sblattero D, Troncone R, Auricchio S, Esposito C. Humoral immune response to tissue
      transglutaminase is related to epithelial cell proliferation in celiac disease.

        For organ culture studies, biopsy fragments from duodenum were obtained from CD patients
        with villous atrophy on GCD, controls, affected by gastroesophageal reflux, and CD patients
        on GFD. Age range for all subjects was 2-17 years.
