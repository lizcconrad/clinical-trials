      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
      EnvSeq-1 Envs adjuvanted with GLA-SE, administered with or without DNA Mosaic-Tre env, in
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of EnvSeq-1 Envs
      adjuvanted with GLA-SE, administered with or without DNA Mosaic-Tre env, in healthy,
      HIV-uninfected adults. The four individual EnvSeq-1 HIV vaccine Envs used in this study are
      called CH505TF, CH505w53, CH505w78, and CH505w100. DNA Mosaic-Tre env is also an HIV vaccine.

      This study will take place in two parts: Part A and Part B. Participants in Part A will be
      randomly assigned to one of four groups. Participants in each group will receive CH505TF
      (admixed with GLA-SE) or placebo by intramuscular (IM) injection at Months 0, 2, 4, 8, and
      12.

      Study researchers will evaluate participant data from Part A of the study prior to enrolling
      participants into Part B of the study. Researchers will also evaluate data from Part A to
      determine the dosing for Part B.

      Participants in Part B will be randomly assigned to one of five groups. Participants in each
      group will receive IM injections at Months 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Injections for Part B,
      Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, will follow an additive and a sequential approach to EnvSeq-1 vaccine
      administration, both with and without the DNA Mosaic-Tre env vaccine. The sequential approach
      will start with administration of the CH505TF vaccine at Month 0, then CH505w53 at Month 2,
      CH505w78 at Month 4, and CH505w100 at Months 8, 12, and 16. Part B, Group 5 participants will
      receive placebo injections at each time point.

      Additional study visits will occur through Month 18 for participants in Part A and through
      Month 22 for participants in Part B. Visits may include physical examinations and clinical
      assessments; blood, urine, and stool collection; HIV testing; risk reduction counseling; and
      interviews/questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants for follow-up health
      monitoring at Month 24 for participants in Part A and at Month 28 for participants in Part B.

          -  HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For volunteers who have received
             control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 115 PSRT will determine eligibility

             For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the

             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past 3 years. Also exclude if volunteer
