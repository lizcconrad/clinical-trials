      In this study, the investigators will examine the effect of therapy with the Growth Hormone
      Releasing Hormone (GHRH) analog tesamorelin on body composition in patients with HIV
      lipodystrophy and central adiposity. This study is a single arm prospective study of
      tesamorelin therapy of patients with HIV lipodystrophy. Subjects will do body composition
      testing, adipose tissue biopsy, metabolic rate measurements and insulin sensitivity
      assessment before, 6 and 12 months after daily injections of tesamorelin 2 mg by subcutaneous
      injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV lipodystrophy is increasingly recognized as a common and clinically significant long-term
      sequelae of HIV treatment. In the HIV lipodystrophy lipohypertrophy phenotype, visceral
      adipose tissue (VAT) is increased and this is associated with reduced growth hormone (GH)
      secretion. Mounting evidence also links this phenotype with dyslipidemia, insulin resistance,
      subclinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients with HIV disease. The
      etiology of HIV lipodystrophy (HIVLD) with central adiposity is unclear, but this phenotype
      is increasingly common with newer, less lipotoxic combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART)
      use. VAT and hepatic lipid accumulation, are important health concerns for HIVLD patients.
      This body composition pattern may contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk that has
      been demonstrated in patients with HIV lipodystrophy. Patients with HIVLD and central
      adiposity have been shown to have reduced GH secretion. Thus, a medication has been developed
      to augment GH secretion. This medication is tesamorelin. GH supplementation in other clinical
      settings has been shown to reduce visceral adiposity and may reduce hepatic lipid content.
