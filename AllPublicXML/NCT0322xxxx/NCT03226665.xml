  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED) and
      represents 15% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal complaints.

      Plain radiography, although traditionally recommended as the initial diagnostic imaging
      modality of choice, has a sensitivity of only 59% to 77%. When clinical and radiographic
      assessment is indeterminate, computed tomography (CT) becomes the test of choice due to its
      superior resolution and increased ability to identify both obstruction and its aetiology Aim:
      this is a prospective study in a sample of patients presenting to the emergency department
      (ED) with abdominal pain, vomiting, or other symptoms suggestive of a SBO (history of
      previous surgeries, constipation, abnormal bowel sounds, and abdominal distention). Patients
      will be evaluated with US prior to x-ray and CT, with possible diagnostic confirms by
      endoscopy or surgery.

      Primary outcome:

      Our objective was to study the accuracy of emergency medicine bedside ultrasonography and in
      patients with suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO).

      Secondary outcome:

      assess the usefulness of the history and physical examination in the prediction of diagnosis

      US Diagnostic criteria:

        -  Bowel lumen diameter &gt;2.5cm

        -  Wall thickness &gt; 4 mm

        -  Decreased/absent peristalsis

        -  Back/forth stool movements

        -  Free fluid

      Methods The study is based on the assessment of all consecutive patients (19-75 years)
      presenting in the emergency department of Policlinico VE of the University of Catania (or to
      other affiliated Hospitals, such as Cannizzaro and/or Ragusa hospitals), which show clinical
      clues of small bowel obstruction (SBO). The criterion of enrolment is the casual referral to
      few previously identified physicians, skilled in TUS procedures and which accepted to take
      part to this study.

      The most similar study on this topic demonstrates an extremely high accuracy of US in the
      diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, so that no actual power analysis can be done. The
      rationale of the present prospective study is the definition of prevalence of US detected
      obstruction in patients referred to an emergency facilities with symptoms potentially
      suggestive for such diagnosis.

      Moreover, which clue, if any, such as anaemia, CRP, NLR, hypotension, could reinforce the
      need of US intestinal study.

      This information is not yet available elsewhere. Moreover, in this context, sensitivity and
      specificity of ultrasound vs. confirm by CT and other procedures will make more sense and
      will be consequently assessed.

      The secondary reason of this investigation is the attempt to detect which are the prevalence
      and the feature of under-diagnosis or over-diagnosis by US vs. the actual condition.

      IMPLEMENTATION. This is a medium-term pilot study, non-interventional, which can be performed
      better as a single centre investigation, with few skilled and committed emergency physicians,
      than as a multicentre study, which would have the possible bias of relying on a mosaic or on
      scarcely skilled or motivated MDs.

    <description>According to the emergency referral protocols, patients that are assessed at the triage phase as likely to have any abdominal acute disease, including bowel occlusion, are preliminary studied by laboratory concurrently with the record of vital signs (blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oxymetry). These information will be available during the actual visit of the Abdominal ultrasound in emergency may show fluid effusion, hemorrhagic or not, liver and/or gallbladder disease, spleen disease - possible leakage -, vascular disease (such as aneurism), inflammatory disease (Appendicitis, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease), masses and nodes (tumors, parasitic, others) and bowel occlusion . Clues, (anaemia, increased C-Reactive Protein, electrolyte abnormalities, clinical symptoms, hypotension) may reinforce the opportunity of US intestinal study, according also to the concordance with the subsequent confirmatory procedures.</description>
