      The primary purpose of the study is to obtain sample clinical images that are evaluated by
      physicians in support of regulatory submissions. Additionally, the study will provide data
      for current and future product development and it will provide clinical images and data for
      marketing use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. are 18-years old and older;

          2. is able to sign and date the informed consent form; AND

          3. have been prescribed by a physician a nuclear medicine exam that is within the
             intended use of the device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who were referred for dynamic nuclear medicine scan because of the need to be
             injected twice (once for the conventional acquisition and once for the investigational
             device) that would result in an increase dose burden on patient.

          2. Pregnant or lactating women

          3. Who were previously enrolled in this study;

          4. Who have contraindication for the radiopharmaceutical

          5. Who have any conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with
             the evaluation of the results or constitute a health hazard for the subject;
