  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a translational study, which, aims to develop prognostic and predictive biomarkers
      for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for improved understanding of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) biology in order to
      characterise the mechanisms of metastatic progression, drug resistance, develop predictive &amp;
      prognostic biomarkers and to identify novel therapeutic targets for this disease. The TRACERx
      consortium was established to achieve this using large longitudinal clinical studies, in
      collaboration with laboratory, advanced sequencing and informatics expertise to identify the
      relationships between intratumour heterogeneity and clinical outcome.

      Response and Resistance: TRACERx Renal is a prospective longitudinal cohort study. It will
      draw on the methodology already being used within the TRACERx Lung &amp; (planned) Breast studies
      as part of the TRACERx consortium.

      Primary Endpoint

      â€¢ To calculate the proportion of patients who are in possession of a mutation in a gene of
      interest

      The Investigators expect to collect 360 specimens by 2018 at an ongoing rate of approximately
      60 per year.

      The Investigators plan to collect the following biological samples:

        -  Blood sample/s, urine and tumour biopsy tissue taken prior to any neoadjuvant treatment
           that might be administered.

        -  Blood sample/s, urine and tumour biopsy tissue taken prior to any ablative procedure

        -  Blood sample/s, urine and nephrectomy tissue taken at the time of nephrectomy.

        -  Blood sample/s, urine and tumour tissue taken at the time of palliative
           metastasectomy/surgery.

        -  Blood and urine sample/s taken at routine follow up.

        -  Blood sample/s, urine and tumour biopsy taken at time of disease progression.

        -  Blood sample/s and/or archival tissue specimens that are no longer required by the local
           pathologist for diagnostic purposes

        -  Blood sample/s and/or archival tissue specimens that are no longer required by the local
           pathologist for diagnostic purposes from study patient family members

    <description>In London renal cell carcinoma patients undergo nephrectomy at centres for urological oncology, including the Royal Marsden, Guy's and St Thomas', St Georges, Charing Cross and Kings Hospitals. It is not uncommon for the same patients to undergo palliative resection for metastatic sites of disease. The majority of tissue from these resections does not undergo routine histopathological examination. As such, it is ethically feasible to use these specimens for laboratory research in the presence of patient consent. Practically, these specimens are often large, thereby offering considerable scope for a range of molecular analyses.</description>
