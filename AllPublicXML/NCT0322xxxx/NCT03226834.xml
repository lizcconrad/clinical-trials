  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is a psychologic and physiological state that could be characterized by somatic,
      emotional, cognitive and behavioral components. Surgery, as well as waiting for surgery is an
      anxiogenic situation encountered by 60 à 80 % of the patients. High levels of anxiety lead to
      negative physiological signs that slow down healing, lowers imune response and increases
      post-surgery infection. Anxiety also increases pain and post-surgery morbi-mortality.
      Drug-induced sedation is frequently recommended to lower anxiety. The anxiolytic effect of
      alternative treatment such as musicotherapy has been demonstrated in several randomized
      control trials. Nevertheless, most of these studies have investigated the effect of
      musicotherapy in groups with our without musical listening.

      In the present study, investigators assume that a personal musical sequence composed by
      favourite songs of the patients could have beneficial effect on presurgical anxiety than
      selective sequence of the medical device MUSIC CARE.

      In this study, the anxiolytic effect of predefined U musical sequences that alternate slow
      and faster music tracks (medical device MUSIC CARE) are compared to patient's play-list, in
      women with planned gynecological surgery.

      Patients are randomly allocated in two groups:

        -  control group: patients are asked to choose one of the U sequence among the preselected
           music style proposed by the medical device MUSIC CARE

        -  test group: patients are asked to prepare their own play-list containing their favourite
           songs

      Anxiety is assessed before and after a 20 min-musicotherapy session by using the State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for anxiogenic situation.

      Other parameters are measured such as blood pressure, cardiac frequency, level of pain after
      surgery, care stay duration, potent post-surgery complications.
