  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preprocedural, preoperative, and prevascular access anxiety in pediatric patients has been
      previously shown to increase the likelihood of family stressors, postoperative pain,
      agitation, sleep disturbances, and negative behavioral changes. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if a non-invasive distracting devices (Virtual Reality headset, Augmented
      Reality headset, tablet, or bed mounted Video Projection unit (i.e. BERT, Bedside
      EnterRtainment Theater)) is more effective than the standard of care (i.e., no technology
      based distraction) for preventing anxiety before vascular access among hospitalized children
      undergoing vascular access prior to anesthesia, procedures, surgery, blood draws, port
      access, or peripheral IV placement. The anticipated primary outcome will be reduction of
      child's anxiety during and after vascular access.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety among children undergoing vascular access is common. Not only is high anxiety
      traumatic, but research indicates that high anxiety in children before surgery leads to
      adverse outcomes such as increased pain and analgesics requirements, delayed hospital
      discharge, and maladaptive behavioral changes. Treating anxiety may decrease any of these
      undesirable behaviors.

      In this study, investigators hope to determine if technology based distractions (VR headsets,
      AR headset, tablets, or BERT projector) are more effective than standard care for preventing
      high anxiety before vascular access. As a secondary aim of the study, we seek to determine if
      the use of technology based distraction will result in higher parent and patient satisfaction
      as well as evaluate which techniques are most effective. As a tertiary aim we seek to
      understand if passive or active interventions are more effective in decreasing anxiety.
