      Abstract Introduction:- dialysis is one of the technological innovation in medicine in which
      patients are being reported to face psychosocial and physiological problems such as anxiety,
      stress and hypertension etc. To relieve these problems, music therapy has been widely used as
      a non-pharmacological intervention with the aim to assess the effectiveness of music therapy
      on blood pressure and anxiety among haemodialysis patients.

      Methods:- current study using true experimental pre-test post-test design was conducted among
      60 haemodialysis patients which were randomly allocated to experimental (30) and control (30)
      group using simple random sampling. The data was collected through sample characteristics
      performa, blood pressure monitoring data sheet and beck anxiety inventory. Patients in
      experimental group were provided with 30 minutes of music therapy using slow and calm
      relaxing instrumental piano music whereas in control group only usual care was given.
