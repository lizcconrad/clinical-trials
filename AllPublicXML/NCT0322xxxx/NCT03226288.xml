  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While human body receives large external force or motions, minor injuries to the soft tissues
      will be produced and will lead to acute or chronic inflammation reactions. Plantar fasciitis
      is the most common foot diseases in normal population. Plantar fascia is a tight band-like
      soft tissue that crosses between the bony surfaces of the bottom of the foot with thick
      ligament-like structure substantially. Various reasons will induce the happening of plantar
      fasciitis including native bone structure, aging, athletic motions and injuries. Indeed,
      diagnosis of chronic heel pain remains challenging due to the complex structures of the foot.
      Therefore, it is widely accepted that diagnostic imaging such as ultrasound and computed
      tomography offer important orthopedic information for clinical assessments of soft tissues
      and bone. Even though there is no single treatment shows the highest level of evidence for
      plantar fasciitis, wearing of insoles or orthotics are highly suggested for clinical therapy.
      Common custom-made insoles are manufactured with polymeric materials based on standing
      foot-pressure distribution. However, this method strongly depends on experience of doctors or
      physical therapists and usually time-consuming. In addition, modern medical researches tend
      to combine the information of both soft (pressure distribution) and hard (orthopedic) tissues
      for designing of orthotics and other medical assistive devices because of the complicity of
      the limb motion and structures. Therefore, investigators aim at developing integrated 3D
      system that provides a 3D limb data model with high-resolution appearance scanning and
      orthopedic information for designing of medical assistant devices. This model composes of 3D
      surface scanning, 3D bony structure scanning, and soft tissues characteristic mechanical
      properties. By developing this system, the 3D model is also highly applicable to the other
      parts of human assistant devices. It will bring the enormous impact to the associated medical
      field and create excellent economic value.
