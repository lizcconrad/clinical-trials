      Previous work has identified barriers to successful transitions that are most meaningful to
      patients and families. Investigators used these learnings to iteratively adapt an existing
      nurse home visit program to address these barriers, and have been studying the effectiveness
      of the redesigned nurse home visit in a randomized control trial (NCT02081846).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reutilization is measuring the occurrence of unplanned rehospitalization, ED (emergency department)/urgent care revisit, and/or unscheduled follow-up within 30-days post-discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The dependent variable will be a dichotomized indicator of any occurrence of unplanned rehospitalization, ED revisit, and/or unscheduled follow-up within 30-days post-discharge. Differences in this outcome between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using logistic regression with the stratification variables (neighborhood poverty and complex versus noncomplex teams)</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence(s) of 14-day unplanned healthcare utilization. defined by unplanned readmission, ED (emergency department), or urgent care visit within 14 days or parent report of an unplanned visit to one of these places</measure>
    <time_frame>14-23 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Parent report is collected at the 14-23 day follow-up phone call.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Discharge Coping Scale. This measurement is based on the Weiss et. al measurement. The PDCDS uses an 11 point scaling format (0-10). Higher scores represent greater coping difficulty.</measure>
    <time_frame>14-23 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Post-Discharge Difficulty Coping Scale (Weiss, et. al): measured at post-discharge phone call. The distribution of this outcome will be assessed for normality; if appropriate, we may apply a transformation or utilize a suitable link function. Differences between intervention and control groups on this outcome at 14-day post-discharge will be evaluated using a generalized linear model with the stratification variables (census tract poverty and state of residence) and other potential covariates included in the model.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of days until normalcy: measured at post discharge phone call. Parents asked to recall the number of days it took to &quot;return to a 'normal' routine&quot; including the return to work and school (with option of not yet be back to normal).</measure>
    <time_frame>14-23 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of this outcome will be assessed for normality; if appropriate, we may apply a transformation or utilize a suitable link function.

  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of red flags: measured at post-discharge phone call. Parents asked to recall &quot;any red flags or warning signs&quot; to indicate the &quot;child's condition was getting worse.&quot; The number of red flags recalled could range from 0-10.</measure>
    <time_frame>14-23 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The number of red flags recalled could range from 0-10 depending on the template used during the nurse home visit. The template was a home visit guideline for nurses to use that was specific to the child's illness. For example, if the child had bronchiolitis the nurse would use the template &quot;bronchiolitis/croup/pneumonia&quot; to guide them through the visit.</description>

    <description>We will complete a single center, parallel, randomized, standard-of-care-controlled prospective study to determine the efficacy of a one-time nurse phone call, an intervention adapted from those studied in other populations (i.e., adults, high-risk infants), in improving pediatric patient transitions from hospital to home</description>

    <description>Control patients will be randomized to receive standard-of-care at discharge. This care at our institution includes pediatric hospitalist to PCP (primary care physician) verbal and written communication prior to discharge, written documentation for the family regarding prescribed medication regimen, recommended follow-up with outpatient PCP and relevant consultant(s), and delivery of prescribed medications from the hospital pharmacy to the patient's bedside.</description>
