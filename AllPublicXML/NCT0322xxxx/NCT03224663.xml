      a comparative study was done to assess the effectiveness of Module based learning and Mobile
      application based learning regarding Facility based newborn care among nursing students.

      MODULE GROUP

      Day 1: Pre assessment of Knowledge through Structured knowledge questionnaire was done and
      practice through observation checklist by OSCE method .

      Day 2: Module based Teaching administered to nursing students who were present on the data
      collection. Teaching and Hands on sessions were given to students by investigator.
      Introduction regarding Module and topics: Prevention of infection (Hand washing), Kangaroo
      Mother Care, Feeding of normal and low birth weight babies (Attachment during feeding,
      Paladai Feeding), Common Procedures (Oxygen administration, Insertion and Orogastric Tube
      Feeding, Weight Recording of a Newborn)

      Day 15th = Post-test of Knowledge through Structured knowledge questionnaire was done in BSc.
      Nursing 3rd year classroom and practice through observation checklist by OSCE method
      Post-test of knowledge took 45 minutes.

      MOBILE APPLICATION BASED GROUP

      Day 16th = Pre assessment of Knowledge through Structured knowledge questionnaire was done in
      BSc. Nursing 3rd year classroom of M.M Institute of Nursing and practice through observation
      checklist by OSCE method

      Day 17th = Mobile Application based Teaching administered to nursing students who were
      randomly selected. Teaching and videos were given to students by investigator in MM Institute
      of Nursing.

      Introduction regarding Mobile Application and topics: Modules on Normal baby, At Risk baby,
      Sick Newborn, Videos on Attachment during feeding, Paladai Feeding, Oxygen administration,
      Kangaroo Mother Care, Insertion and Orogastric Tube Feeding, Weight Recording of a Newborn,
      Hand washing, Posters on Hand washing, Kangaroo Mother Care

      Day 30th = Post-assessment of Knowledge through Structured knowledge questionnaire was done
      and practice through OSCE method
