      This project aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of human amniotic epithelial
      cells in the treatment of the severe refractory Asherman's syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asherman's syndrome is a gynecological disorder caused by the destruction of the endometrium
      due to repeated or aggressive curettages and/or endometritis. As a result, there is a loss of
      functional endometrium in multiple areas and the uterine cavity is obliterated by
      intrauterine adhesions, which results in amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, infertility and recurrent
      pregnancy loss. Transcervical resection of adhesion (TCRA) is the main treatment for
      Asherman's syndrome, so far the effect is usually poor in moderate to severe refractory
      cases.

      Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are derived from human amniotic epithelium. hAECs
      retain the characteristics approximating to embryonic stem cells. Animal experiments have
      shown that the endometrial thickness and fertility of mice were significantly improved after
      intrauterine therapy with amniotic epithelial cells. To further explore the role of hAECs in
      Asherman's syndrome patients, this project plans to evaluate the safety of hAECs provided by
      Chongqing iCELL Biotechnology Co.,Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Shanghai iCELL Biotechnology
      Co.,Ltd., and find an effective treatment protocol.

    <description>hAECs are provided by Chongqing iCELL Biotechnology Co.,Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Shanghai iCELL Biotechnology Co.,Ltd. The participants are blind to their arms because the surgery is done under anesthesia. After hysteroscopic adhesiolysis, subsequently oral antibiotics will be given for 3 days to prevent infection. Estrogen will be administrated for 3 cycles to stimulate the repair of endometrium after the surgery.</description>
