    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies the effect of comprehensive yoga program (SKY) in
      reducing stress, pain, and fatigue, and improving psychological well-being in patients with
      prostate cancer. SKY is one of the most widely used breathing techniques derived from yoga.
      SKY Yoga may improve quality of life in patients with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine any change in pain, fatigue and psychological well-being as a result of SKY in
      prostate cancer (PCa) patients.

      II. Assess changes in some physiological parameters in response to SKY in the same subjects,
      compare these with those from Part 1, and assess whether these translate into clinical
      effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (Control Group): Patients undergo collection of blood, saliva, and hair samples after
      signing consent (pre-test 1), within 6-8 weeks after pre-test 1 (post-test 1), and within 2-4
      months after post-test 1 (post-test 2). Patients may receive yoga instruction for 1 week
      after post-test 2.

      ARM II (Yoga Group): Patients receive yoga instruction over approximately 3 hours daily for 5
      days of week 1 and over 2 hours once a week of weeks 2-13. Patients also undergo collection
      of blood, saliva, and hair samples within 2 months prior to starting yoga instruction, within
      weeks 2-3, and within weeks 14-15.
