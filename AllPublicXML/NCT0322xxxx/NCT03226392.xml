      A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo- controlled parallel-group study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of QAW039, compared with placebo, when added to
      standard-of-care (SoC) asthma therapy in adult and adolescent (≥ 12 years) patients with
      uncontrolled asthma with respect to change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1
      second (FEV1) at the end of 12 weeks of treatment.
