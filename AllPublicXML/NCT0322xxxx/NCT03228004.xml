    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if training and support, combined with
      reminders to facilitate glucose data sharing with the diabetes care team in between clinic
      visits, can improve glycemic outcomes for patients ages 10-17 with type 1 diabetes who have
      HbA1c levels above target.
