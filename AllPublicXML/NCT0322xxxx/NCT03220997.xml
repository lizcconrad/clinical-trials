  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomised control trial is to assess the impact of pre-operative
      carbohydrate loading on the incidence of urinary ketone bodies when compared to standard care
      in elective caesarean section. Half of the participants will receive pre-operative
      carbohydrates and the other half will receive standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring general anaesthetic for surgical procedures are asked to stop eating and
      drinking for several hours before the procedure. This is due to concerns that such patients
      are at risk of lung damage caused by stomach contents entering their lungs while they are
      asleep (aspiration of gastric contents).

      However, fasting patients for long periods of time can lower their ability to heal well and
      slow their recovery from surgery. Fasting increases anxiety levels and leads to poor patient
      satisfaction with the care received.

      Recent studies have showed that allowing patients to drink clear, easily absorbed sugar rich
      liquids (carbohydrate drinks) until two hours prior to their anaesthetic does not expose them
      to extra risks while preventing the deleterious effects of starvation.

      Carbohydrate drinks with a few other measures aimed at facilitating early recovery after
      surgeries are collectively termed Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). The benefits and
      safety of enhanced recovery have been demonstrated in patients undergoing major bowel surgery
      and have been widely adopted. However, so far, no studies have been conducted to determine if
      these results apply to mothers undergoing planned caesarean sections. We hope to address this
      gap in the knowledge with our proposed study.

      All mothers undergoing a planned caesarean section in the Princess Royal Maternity (PRM) will
      be invited to participate. Mothers will be divided into two groups. One group will receive
      standard care and the other group will receive a carbohydrate drink in addition to standard
      care. Information collected from the groups will be compared to evaluate the expected
      benefits and risks. The study will continue until the target sample size of 100 mothers in
      each of the two study groups is reached.

    <masking_description>Research midwives will attend consent, randomise, collect baseline data and provide the accompanying information and carbohydrate sachets to subjects. The research fellows will be blinded but will collect the data for participants. The research midwives will complete study compliance. To achieve this, participants will bring to ward a completed compliance form ( given at randomisation) in a sealed envelope this will ensure the research investigators remain blinded during their pre op assessments and data collection.</masking_description>
