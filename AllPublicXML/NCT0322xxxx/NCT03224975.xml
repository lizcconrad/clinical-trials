  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is complex phenomenon misunderstood in spite of medical progress and neurosciences.
      That's why the relief of chronic pain is only partial for a lot of infection as arthrosis,
      chronic back pain, headaches or neuropathic pain. Certain situations bring to relive pain
      sensation. Investigators were interested to former burned. They wonder about somatic memory
      and unconscious of acute.

      It is a comparative and monocentric study. There are two groups. On the one hand, there is
      the former burned and, on the other hand, healthy volunteers. While they thought to painful
      memory or not, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be performed. Then,
      investigators compare two functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

      Main objective of this study is link up between brain activity by functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and acute pain memory.
