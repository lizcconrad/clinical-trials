  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daprodustat (GSK1278863), is a small molecule currently in development for the treatment of
      anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Results of the earlier studies shows that liver is
      involved in the clearance of Daprodustat and hence, hepatic impairment can affect Daprodustat
      levels in the body. This single dose study will assess the effect of liver impairment on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of daprodustat. The study will be conducted
      in two parts, Part 1 will include subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and matched
      healthy control subjects whereas Part 2 will include subjects will either mild or severe
      hepatic impairment and matched healthy control subjects. Approximately 8 subjects will be
      included in each of the group and all subjects will receive 6 milligram (mg) of daprodustat
      as a single oral dose in the fasted state. Total duration of participation in the study for a
      subject will be up to 7 weeks.
