    <textblock>
      This is a quality improvement study with the purpose of observing and measuring the effects
      of implementation of a proven standardized lung protective ventilation protocol in the new
      electronic medical record system iCentra across all Intermountain Healthcare hospitals.
      Approximately 14,000 records will be accessed for this study from a database of mechanically
      ventilated patients established for quality improvement purposes.

      The investigators hypothesize that implementation of a standardized computerized lung
      protective ventilation protocol across all Intermountain Healthcare hospitals will be
      feasible, will decrease initial tidal volumes to the target 6 ml/kg PBW, and will improve
      outcomes.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        -  Determine if the implementation of lung protective ventilation (with a 6 ml/kg PBW tidal
           volume ventilation protocol on initiation of mechanical ventilation) improves outcomes
           in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation

        -  Determine if the implementation of lung protective ventilation (with a 6 ml/kg PBW tidal
           volume ventilation protocol on initiation of mechanical ventilation) improves outcomes
           in the sub-group of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

        -  Measure compliance with the implementation of a computerized lung protective ventilation
           protocol at 12 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals

      Study Design:

      This is an observational quality improvement study comparing outcomes before, and after,
      implementation of a proven lung protective ventilation protocol in an electronic medical
      record system, iCentra, that will be implemented in phases across Intermountain Healthcare
      hospitals. A phased implementation with a two-month washout period will be used to evaluate
      the primary outcome of interest, ventilator free days (VFDs) to 28 days. Secondary outcomes
      will include: use of the protocol by clinicians, compliance with protocol instructions,
      hospital discharge disposition, hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality, time to first ICU
      activity, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, heath care utilization, quality of
      life, and costs of care. As the iCentra electronic medical record is implemented at
      Intermountain Healthcare hospitals, clinicians will have the opportunity to use the
      computerized lung protective ventilation protocol, or to order mechanical ventilation
      settings independently. This is an observational study designed to measure how often the
      computerized lung protective ventilation protocol will be ordered, compliance with the
      instructions of the protocol, and clinical outcomes among patients who are managed with the
      protocol. Physicians may choose to use the protocol on intubated patients requiring
      mechanical ventilation or they may choose to order other specific mechanical ventilator
      settings.

        Patient Selection Those to be enrolled must have respiratory failure requiring intubation
        and initiation of mechanical ventilation. Patients will be divided into two different
        groups: those patients who are managed with the computerized lung protective ventilation
        protocol as ordered by the attending physician and those patients managed with physician
        specified mechanical ventilation settings.
