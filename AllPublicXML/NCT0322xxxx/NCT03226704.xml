  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Leukapheresis is a procedure to separate and collect white blood cells. It is the first step
      in a treatment called CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy. CAR-T therapy may be
      offered to people when their cancer comes back. The collected T-cells are used to make a
      special version of T-cells called CARs. Researchers want to collect these cells from people
      who may become eligible for a CAR T-cell study in the future.

      Objective:

      To identify people who have a high likelihood to benefit from CAR T-cell therapy early in
      their disease course and collect and store a T-cell product.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 4-30 with a form of leukemia or lymphoma that has not been cured by standard
      therapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.
      Some will also be screened with:

      X-rays

      Scans

      Spinal fluid samples

      Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy

      On this study, participants will have leukapheresis. A needle will be placed into the arm.
      Blood will be collected and go through a machine. White blood cells will be taken out by the
      machine. The plasma and red cells will be returned to the participant through a second needle
      in the other arm. The procedure will take 4-6 hours. Some participants may have a central
      line (catheter) inserted which is needed to do the leukapheresis procedure, instead of the
      needles in the arms-especially if they are smaller. For a central line placement, a long thin
      tube is inserted through a small incision into the main blood vessel leading into the heart
      that would allow access to the blood to do the leukapheresis procedure.

      Participants cells will be processed and frozen for future use in a CAR T-cell therapy study.

      Background:

        -  Leukapheresis is a necessary step to developing a CAR therapy cellular product. There
           are numerous clinical trials underway in the NCI utilizing CAR therapy.

        -  The purpose of this protocol is to develop a streamlined process whereby patients
           undergo apheresis for development of a CAR cell product on a subsequent therapeutic
           clinical trial, which can be administered when the patient needs investigational
           therapies.

        -  Allowing for collection of the leukapheresis product in a protocol separate from the
           therapeutic protocol would allow for the best optimization of:

             -  Patient care and disease burden

             -  Timing and coordination of cell infusion

             -  Collection in patients with high-risk disease who have no current detectable
                disease, but have a very high likelihood of relapse.

      Objective:

      To obtain the leukapheresis process by which cells will be collected and stored for use in
      CCR CAR therapy clinical trials.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients 4-30 years of age, at least 15 kg, with relapsed/refractory leukemia or lymphoma
      that has recurred after or not responded to one or more standard regimens and/or deemed
      incurable by standard therapy and who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to
      participate.

      Design:

        -  Once a patient is determined to be a potential candidate for one of the NCI CAR clinical
           trials, they will undergo leukapheresis, as estimated by recipient weight and target
           cell harvest dose in the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM).

        -  No treatments, investigational or standard therapy will be administered on this
           protocol.

        -  Up to 24 patients per year may be enrolled on this study. In planning for future CAR
           therapy trials, we expect this study to remain open for up to 5 years for a total of 120
           patients to be enrolled.
