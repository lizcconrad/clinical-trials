             effective contraception (that results in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year) while
             receiving the study medication and for 18 months after its discontinuation,

          -  Men must consent either to using an acceptable contraception method (that results in a
             failure rate of &lt; 1% per year) or continued sexual abstinence while receiving the

             mental diseases that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of
             results,

          -  Active infections (viral, bacterial, fungal),

          -  Coexistence of another neoplasm or a history of neoplastic disease (except for

          -  Active HIV, HBV or HCV infection,

          -  Positive test results for chronic hepatitis B. All patients must be tested for both
             HBsAg and HBcAb at screening, if either of the tests is positive, the patient is not
             eligible for inclusion in the trial. Patients who have protective titers of HBsAb
             after vaccination are eligible provided they are negative for both HBsAg and HBcAb,
