  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open bi-centric prospective non-randomized study in patients with metastatic
      melanoma treated with a first line treatment of Nivolumab +/- Ipilimumab. The aim of the
      study is to characterize the immune cells modulations under anti-PD-1 +/- anti-CTLA4 and
      identify the differences between responder and non-responder patients.
