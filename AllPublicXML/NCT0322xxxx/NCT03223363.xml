  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the value of principal component analysis in the combined method of
      three-dimensional ultrasonography assessing fetal limb volume and circumference and
      conventional two-dimensional ultrasonography for prediction of birth weight in southern
      Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study was performed on single pregnant women in third trimester. Three- and
      two-dimensional ultrasonography for fetal biometric parameters were measured within 7 days of
      delivery. Stepwise linear regression were used to develop a new prediction model based on
      values from limb parameters and traditional measurements in development group. Estimated and
      actual birth weight were compared between the new model and previously published formulas on
      absolute error and percentage error. The accuracy of the model in predicting fetal birth
      weight was reassured by validation group.
