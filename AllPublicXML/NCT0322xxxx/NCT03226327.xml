  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an one arm, self-controlled preliminary trial. Hypertension patients will be
      categorized into three types, not taking antihypertension drugs with normal renal function,
      taking antihypertension drugs with normal renal function, and taking antihypertension drugs
      or not with abnormal renal function. Each category includes 30 hypertension patients. Based
      on renal function, the investigators provide the ManLiKang containing potassium chloride to
      patients with normal renal function, and provide the ManLiKang not containing potassium
      chloride to patients with abnormal renal function. All hypertension patients will use the
      formula salt with limited sodium ManLiKang in six weeks, and will be followed up at 1, 2, 4
      and 6 weeks to assess the safety, the effect of reducing blood pressure and the change of
      24-hour urine sodium.
