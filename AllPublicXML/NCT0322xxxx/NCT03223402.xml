      maintenance Risk Category B (no investigational drugs, non standard Tx) Therapies with 2

      trial. Rescue therapy is well defined within the protocol. Centers (n) St. Gallen only

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of a two drug combination for Long term HIV
      maintenance therapy.

      The study is conducted in order to confirm the feasibility of the combination of Nevirapine
      and lamivudine (3TC) in patients with long term fully suppressive therapy.

      Patients (n=10) with a stable (&gt;6 months) Nevirapine based triple therapy and a full viral
      load suppression for at least 2 years will continue their therapy for 6 months with
      Nevirapine+3TC.

      The primary endpoint is treatment failure defined as an HIV-RNA value &gt;100 cp/ml, confirmed
      by a second measurement.

      Preliminary stopping rules are defined if results indicate futility. Futility is defined as a
      situation, where the investigators would stop their plan to conduct a multicenter comparative
      trial. Futility is reached, when the study documents more than 1 failure in the first 5
      patients over 24 weeks of observation or more than 2 failures in all 10 patients.

      Only 10 patients will be followed in this single center pilot study.

      After an amendement (April 2017) the total number of 20 patients was increased to 20.
      Futility was defined as more than 2 failures in 20 patients.
