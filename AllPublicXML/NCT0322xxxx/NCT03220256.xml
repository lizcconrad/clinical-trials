  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to find a way to lower drug rash occurrence by applying drug
      tolerance induction protocol at the beginning of lamotrigine administration.

      Genotyping of participants with rash and those without rash after taking lamotrigine and
      genetic testing to find common gene mutations in these participants.

    <description>The dose of lamotrigine (0.1mg) started to increase and gradually increased according to the drug tolerance induction protocol, and the efficacy was evaluated by dosing to the commercial capacity (100mg bid) within 2 weeks. In addition, the ratio of regulatory T cells was measured before lamotrigine administration, and the proportion of regulatory T cells was measured by two-week administration of lamotrigine after tolerance induction protocol. Add 6 ml of EDTA tube to each cryovial, and dispense 1 ml each in cryovial. After the appropriate number of patients of the same phenotype were collected, the analysis was performed.</description>
