             metastatic potential, progressive neurological disorders or seizure disorder) which
             could impair reliable participation in the trial or necessitate the use of medication

         13. Subject has history of poor compliance or in the Investigator's opinion any subject
             whose treatment as an outpatient would be clinically contraindicated.

         14. Subject has had previous trial of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES).

         15. Subject requiring prohibited concomitant medication or herbal supplements that could
             not be discontinued or switched to an allowable alternative medication and stabilized
             for at least two weeks preceding (visit 2).
