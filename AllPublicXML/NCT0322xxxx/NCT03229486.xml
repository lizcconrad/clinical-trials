  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of sugammadex vs. a conventional
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine on emergence delirium (ED) during
      sevoflurane-rocuronium anesthesia in pediatric patients Additionally, the efficacy features
      of sugammadex compared to neostigmine will be examined by measuring the time from start of
      administration of reversal agents to recovery of train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.7, 0.8, and
      0.9.

      Although the etiology of ED remains unclear, a sense of suffocation or breathing difficulty
      during emergence from anesthesia has been suggested as a possible cause. Thus, reversal of
      neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex in pediatric patients maintained with
      sevoflurane-rocuronium anesthesia may decrease ED due to its faster reversal of neuromuscular
      blockade and decreased possibility of residual blockade.
