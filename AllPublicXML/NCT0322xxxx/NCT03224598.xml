      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydrogen peroxide,
      A-101 Solution 40% for the treatment of DPN lesions on subjects with a Fitzpatrick Skin Type
      of 5 or 6.

      The secondary objectives of this study include:

        -  Durability of response

        -  Safety

      An exploratory objective of this study will evaluate the subject's assessment of the
      treatment of A-101 to DPN lesions using a Subject Self-Assessment Scale.

          4. Subject chemistry and complete blood count results are within normal limits for the
             central laboratory. If any of the laboratory values are outside normal limits, the
             treating investigator must assess the value/s as not clinically significant and
             document this in the patient's source documents.

          5. Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 14
             days of the first application of study drug and agree to use an active method of birth

          6. Subject is non-pregnant and non-lactating.

          7. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical
             condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair the evaluation of any
             Target DPN Lesions or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study
             participation.

          8. Subject is willing and able to follow all study instructions and to attend all study
             visits.

          3. Subject has a history of keloids

          4. Subject has a history of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation lasting longer than 1
             year.

             assessments:

               -  LASER, light or other energy based therapy (e.g., intense pulsed light [IPL],
                  photo-dynamic therapy [PDT]; 180 days

             interfere with the study conduct or evaluations.

         10. Participation in another therapeutic investigational drug trial in which
             administration of an investigational study medication occurred with 30 days prior to
