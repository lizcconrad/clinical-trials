  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteosarcoma is very rare cancer of the bone. The investigator started the BOOST registry and
      biobank to make sure every patient has the opportunity to participate in research.

      Summary to include:

        1. Samples of saliva, blood and/or other stored material such as slides or leftover
           diagnostic material. If available the investigator may ask you for deciduous (baby)
           teeth.

        2. Questionnaire information, including health history, growth and development, physical
           activity and family medical history information.

        3. If you have been diagnosed with a osteosarcoma or another condition the investigator is
           interested inthe investigator will ask you release medical record information relating
           to diagnosis and treatment of osteosarcoma, other cancers, blood disorders, and similar
           conditions. If this step applies to you then you will be asked to sign a separate form.

        4. You may be asked to contact your biological parents and full biological siblings to ask
           them about participating in the study.

        5. If you agree you may be contacted in the future. You will be able to decline any future
           information or studies at any point.

      you. If the investigator finds out that your sample doesn't have enough cells to be useful,
      the investigator may call you for an additional sample.
