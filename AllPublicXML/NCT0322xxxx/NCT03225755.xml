    <textblock>
      The growth hormone (GH )axis has important influences on adipose tissue. GH may have a novel
      effect to reduce macrophage yet increase adipocyte inflammation in adipose tissue along with
      reducing adipose tissue mass. In order to examine the effect of GH on adipose tissue
      inflammation, this study will examine adipose tissue and serum inflammation in patients with
      GH deficiency before and after GH therapy. The investigators will also obtain serum samples
      before and after treatment for adipokines, inflammatory markers and examine macrophages in
      circulation with regard to their inflammatory state. The investigators will also obtain
      adipose tissue biopsies from healthy subjects matched to the GHD subjects. Adipose tissue
      specimens will be analyzed for adipose tissue morphology, adipocyte size, adipokine gene
      expression, and adipose tissue macrophage number.

      Screening:

      Patients who are interested in the study will first undergo screening. Screening which
      consist of a telephone interview to further explain the study and confirm the subjects'
      interest and eligibility and a review of medical records for the above entry inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. If needed to obtain information on entry criteria not available from the
      medical record, subjects will have a brief screening visit in person to obtain additional
      information.

      Study Visits Overview:

      Enrolled subjects will have 9 visits at weeks -4, 0 (baseline), 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 44 and 48
      of GH therapy. Blood sampling for safety labs and clinical examinations will be performed at
      each visit. At the baseline and 1 year visits subjects will also undergo body composition
      testing by total body magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRI/MRS)
      and adipose tissue biopsy. At baseline, 6 month and 12 month visits subjects will also under
      indirect calorimetry for measurement of resting energy expenditure and oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT.)

      Study Drug:

      Growth Hormone is being used in this study as per its FDA approved indication and dosing for
      treatment of adult GH deficiency. Subjects enrolled are those who are already planning GH
      therapy for their GH deficiency. GH is not being administered just for research purposes. GH
      will be taken daily by patients by subcutaneous self-injection at rotating sites on the
      abdomen. Safety assessments including measurements of fasting blood glucose and liver
      function tests and clinical examinations will be performed at study visits. Drug Dosing
      Regimen: rhGH will be begun at a dose of 0.3 mg/day with titration monthly to insulin like
      growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level between the 50-75th percentile of the age-adjusted normal
      range.

      STUDY PROCEDURES

      Fasting Blood Sampling:

      Blood Samples will be taken from a peripheral vein at each visit. These blood samples will be
      assayed for the measurement of IGF-1, GH, insulin, glucose, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNFalpha),
      Interleukin 6(IL-6), highly sensitive CRH (hsCrp), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1),
      adiponectin (high molecular weight and total) and leptin and one tube of this blood will be
      processed peripheral blood monocyte analysis.

      Adipose Tissue Biopsies:

      Adipose tissue biopsy will be performed before and 1 year after GH therapy. After a 12-hour
      fast subjects will undergo needle aspiration of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue at the
      umbilicus level.

      Body composition testing Anthropometric measurements. Subjects will have measurements of
      waist circumference with a tape measure and height and body weight will be measured.

      Total body MRI: Quantification of total and regional body composition by whole body
      multi-slice MRI, liver fat by Modified DIXON method, and 1H-MRS (magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy) assessment of intra-hepatic lipid (IHL) and intra-myocellular lipid (IMCL) of
      the anterior tibialis muscle will be performed.

      Indirect Calorimetry (TrueOne2400, ParvoMedics) will measure resting energy expenditure (REE)
      after an overnight fast (12hr.) and 30 min. of rest with subjects still, awake and supine in
      a thermoneutral environment. REE will be determined from the last 20 minutes of 30 minutes of
      gas exchange results.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection will be performed from a sample (1 tbsp.) of
      heparinized blood.

      The total amount of blood drawn at baseline, 6 month and 1 year visits will be 3 tablespoons.
      Blood drawn at other visits will be 1 tablespoon.
