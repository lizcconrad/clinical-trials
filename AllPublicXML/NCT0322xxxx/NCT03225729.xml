    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the performance of new technology &quot;CRYOTHERAPY MAINS ET DECOLLETE&quot;
      against a classic cryotherapy &quot;Nitrogen Liquid &quot; to treat solar lentigines.

      The hands and the neckline will be randomised, either left or right side and treated by two
      cryotherapy devices:

        1. CRYOTHERAPY MAINS ET DECOLLETE is the device under evaluation.

        2. Liquid nitrogen is a comparator device.
