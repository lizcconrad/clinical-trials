  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two strengths of
      Lacripep™ ophthalmic solution versus placebo administered three times daily for four weeks in
      subjects with a diagnosis of Dry Eye associated with documented Primary Sjögren's Syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, parallel-group study.
      Subjects will be randomized into three treatment groups: 0.005%, or 0.01% Lacripep™, or
      placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio.
