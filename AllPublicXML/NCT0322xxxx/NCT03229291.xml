    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple
      ascending dose study of SM04755 solution applied topically once daily for 14 days to intact
      skin overlying the inner thigh of healthy subjects at an estimated body surface area (BSA) of
      80 cm^2. Dosing cohorts will consist of 8 subjects who will be randomized 3:1
      (SM04755:placebo).
