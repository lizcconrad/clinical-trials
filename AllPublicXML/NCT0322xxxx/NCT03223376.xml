    <textblock>
      Fruquintinib 4mg once daily in 4 weeks treatment cycle (three weeks on and one week off) in
      combination with Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 （day1, 8, 15 of 4 weeks cycle) was well tolerated and
      demonstrated encouraging preliminary clinical antitumor activity in patients with advanced GC
      in ph1b/2 study. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib in
      combination with Paclitaxel in the treatment of patients with aGC who have progressed after
      first line standard chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III clinical trial
      to compare the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib combined with Paclitaxel versus Paclitaxel
      alone in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed after first-line standard
      chemotherapy. After checking eligbility criteria, subjects will be randomized into
      Fruquintinib combined with Paclitaxel group (treatment group) or placebo combined with
      Paclitaxel group (control group) in a ration of 1:1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall
      Survival (OS). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to
      RECIST Version 1.1), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), . Safety and
      tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by
      severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.03.
