  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      combination with daratumumab in participants with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma
      (rrMM). The primary outcome measure for this study is the assessment of Objective Response
      Rate (ORR) in participants with rrMM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study treatment will continue until the participant has completed 35 infusions (approximately
      2 years) of pembrolizumab treatment. All participants who stop study treatment with stable
      disease (SD) or better may be eligible for up to an additional ~1 year of study treatment if
      they progress after stopping study treatment from the initial treatment phase.

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of at least a PR (≥50% reduction of serum M-protein plus reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to &lt;200 mg per 24 hours) until disease progression or death, per IMWG 2016, based on investigator assessment.</description>
