  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study to
      demonstrate bioequivalence (BE) between the bisoprolol-amlodipine fixed-dose-combination
      (FDC) tablet (investigational product) and bisoprolol and amlodipine tablets administered
      concomitantly (comparators) given as a single oral dose in fasting and fed state.
