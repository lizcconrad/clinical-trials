      The objective of this study is to evaluate the Fingertip Respiratory Rate algorithm
      performance of the Nonin Medical X-100SP pulse oximetry systems with the 8300AA sensors and
      Onyx 3 fingertip oximeter. There is no treatment or interventions being performed.

      1. Start data collection system(s) and allow them to run 15 minutes prior to study start of
           each subject.

        2. Confirm that the subject meets inclusion/exclusion criteria and has signed the current
           IRB- approved Informed Consent Form

        3. Collect Demographic and Anthropometric Data from the subject.

        4. Place Pulse Oximetry Sensors

        5. Place nasal cannula for capnography recordings

        6. A summary of Respiratory rate protocol.

             1. Stage 1: Subject will rest quietly and breathe at a normal comfortable rate for 40
                minutes. The start and stop times will be marked on the data collection system.

             2. Stage 2: Immediately after Stage 1 is complete, the subject will start the 25
                minute paced breathing protocol which will ramp from 5-45 BPM. A computer program
                will be used to guide the subject through the stage 2 paced breathing. The start
                and stop times will be marked on the data collection system.

        A minimum of 30 subjects will be included in this study. The subject selection will be an
        approximately equal mix of males and females with varying skin tones. At a rate of 3-4
        subjects per day, enrollment will take approximately 7-10 days to complete.
