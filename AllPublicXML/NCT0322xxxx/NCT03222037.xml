    <textblock>
      This is a bilateral, non-dispensing, randomized, cross-over, single-masked study. There are a
      total of 3 visits where all study endpoints will be measured in all subjects at baseline with
      habitual lenses and under the two testing treatments sequentially in separate visits based on
      the randomization scheme

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form

          2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
             protocol

          3. Between 18 and 35 (inclusive) years of age at the time of screening

          4. The subject must be habitual contact lens wearers (defined as minimum 6 hours per day,
             5 days a week over the last month)

          5. The subject must meet all of the following three criteria:

               1. The eyes' spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of -1.00
                  to -9.00 D (inclusive)

               2. The eyes' refractive cylinder must be less than or equal to -0.75 DC

               3. Each eye must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better.

          6. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        participating in the study:

          1. Currently pregnant or lactating

          2. Any systemic disease (e.g., Sj√∂gren's Syndrome), allergies, infectious disease (e.g.,
             hepatitis, tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive diseases (e.g., HIV),
             autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or other diseases, by self-report,
             which are known to interfere with contact lens wear and/or participation in the study

          3. Use of systemic medications (e.g., chronic steroid use) that are known to interfere
             with contact lens wear or may impact the functioning of the tear film (e.g.,
             Isotretinoin)

          4. Any ocular allergies, infections or other ocular abnormalities that are known to
             interfere with contact lens wear and/or participation in the study. This may include,
             but not be limited to entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes,
             glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or corneal distortion

          5. Any current use of ocular medication

          6. Any previous, or planned (during the course of the study) ocular surgery (e.g., radial
             keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.)

          7. Any Grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the Efron scale

          8. Any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal inflammatory event
             (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular
             abnormality that would contraindicate contact lens wear

          9. Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to contact lens care products.

         10. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 30 days
             prior to study enrollment

         11. Employee of clinical site (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)

         12. Current wearers of Acuvue Oasys 1-Day brand contact lenses
