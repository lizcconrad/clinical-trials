      Prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized phase III study, comparing two strategies as
      first chemotherapy-based treatment for locally advanced or metastatic luminal breast cancer.

        -  Arm A: concomitant chemotherapy plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI); the AI must continue
           until disease progression or toxicity or patient refusal; chemotherapy may be stopped
           after achievement of maximum response (generally after at least about 3-6 months of
           treatment) or in case of toxicity or patient refusal.

        -  Arm B: chemotherapy followed by an AI at the time of progression to chemotherapy (if an
           endocrine therapy is deemed indicated by the treating physician) or as maintenance
           therapy after achieving maximum response to chemotherapy (generally after at least about
           3-6 months of treatment) or after stopping chemotherapy for toxicity or patient refusal.

    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial of concomitant chemoendocrine therapy versus chemotherapy followed
      by endocrine therapy as first line treatment of luminal B metastatic breast cancer.

      Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and AI versus
      chemotherapy followed by AI in terms of progression free survival (PFS).

      Secondary objectives: To compare between treatment arms:

        -  quality of life (EORTC quality of life questionnaire(QLQ) QLQ -C30 and QLQ-BR23)

        -  toxicity (CTCAE version 4.03)

        -  time to treatment failure

        -  time to progression to the therapeutic strategy

        -  best response rate

        -  duration of response

        -  clinical benefit rate

        -  overall survival (OS)

        -  correlative biomarkers of response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy:

             -  tissue markers (on the primary tumor and / or metastatic tissue)

             -  circulating markers (e.g. CTCs, ctDNA)

      Assuming a median PFS of 6 months for patients undergoing first-line treatment for locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer, in order to detect an increase of PFS of 3 months (from
      6 to 9 months, hazard ratio 0.67) in patients receiving concomitant chemo-endocrine therapy,
      with a two-tail logrank test at 90% power and 5% significance level, 150 patients must be
      enrolled in each arm (300 patients overall, with 256 expected events) in a period of 24
      months, with further 12 months of follow up.

      Comparisons between the two treatment arms will be performed using the stratified log rank
      test and building Cox proportional-hazard models, with or without inclusion of the main know
      prognostic and predictive factors.

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Histological diagnosis of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative
             luminal breast cancer (ER &gt;10% of tumor cells), determined by local laboratory on most

             (herein globally defined as advanced breast cancer, ABC).

          4. Candidate to chemotherapy-based treatment per the investigator best judgment; e.g.
             because of disease aggressiveness, short disease-free interval, elevated Ki67 [if
             available on a metastatic site], low expression of hormone receptors, extended
             visceral involvement, visceral involvement at risk for organ failure, uncontrolled
             symptoms), according to Italian association of medical oncology (AIOM) Guidelines
             (2016 edition).

          5. Postmenopausal women, or premenopausal women undergoing treatment with luteinizing
             hormone releasing hormone (LHRH analog), or men (either receiving treatment with LHRH
             analog or not). Postmenopausal status is defined as:

               1. bilateral, surgical oophorectomy

               2. age ≥60 years

               3. age &lt;60 years, with amenorrhea &gt;12 months and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),

             lesions.

          7. No prior chemotherapy for ABC. Up to two prior lines of endocrine therapy for ABC, as
             well as targeted therapies (such as palbociclib and/or everolimus or investigative
             targeted therapies) administered as part of a prior hormonal regimen for ABC, are
             allowed.

          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) ≤2 .

          9. Adequate organ (renal, hepatic, bone marrow, cardiac) functions.

             of child bearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception during the
             study period and for 4 months thereafter. Effective contraception methods include:
             total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject); tubal ligation; male sterilization; combination of the placement of an
             intrauterine device or intrauterine system and barrier methods of contraception with
             spermicidal suppository.

             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior chemotherapy for ABC

          2. Resistance to both non-steroidal and steroidal aromatase inhibitors, e.g. patients who
             progressed while on or within 12 months after the end of an aromatase inhibitor in the
             adjuvant setting and who progressed while on an aromatase inhibitor (of a different
             class) in the metastatic setting, or patients who progressed to both classes of
             aromatase inhibitors administered as two distinct lines of therapy for metastatic
             disease.

          3. Patients who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to prior therapies to
             grade ≤1 (excluding alopecia).

          4. Active central nervous system metastases.

          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to the chemotherapeutic or endocrine agents used in the study.

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection (patients with history of hepatitis B must undergo prophylactic therapy with
             lamivudine or other agent according to infectious disease consultation), symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          7. Prior history of non‐breast malignancy (except for adequately controlled basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, in situ carcinoma of the
             bladder), unless treated with curative intent and disease free for at least 3 years.
