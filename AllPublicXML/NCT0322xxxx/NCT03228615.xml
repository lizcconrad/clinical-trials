  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to implement a multi-component shared decision making
      intervention for families of children with IBD. The main objective of this research will be
      to assess the acceptability, feasibility and clinical and decision outcomes of a
      multi-component decision support intervention targeted at families of children with IBD who
      are making decisions about treatment with TNFαi agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that when making decisions about treatment with anti-tumor necrosis
      factor-α (TNFαi) agents, parents of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience
      high levels of decisional conflict. This extreme level of conflict is due to the challenge of
      considering an effective treatment that has potentially serious side-effects. Elevated levels
      of decisional conflict have been associated with delays in decision making and failures to
      implement treatment plans. Given that such delays may lead to worse clinical outcomes, there
      is an urgent need to improve the decision-making process around TNFαi therapy. The use of
      structured decision support to help inform and guide parents through this challenging
      decision may improve the decision-making process. Such structure facilitates high-quality
      decision making by providing balanced, accurate information, helping individuals clarify what
      is most important to them, and facilitating conversations between families and healthcare
      providers. Based the investigators' prior research into the TNFαi decision process, the
      investigators developed a multi-component decision support intervention designed to improve
      the TNFαi decision process. This intervention will be tested in a controlled pilot trial
      designed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a multi-component intervention and to
      determine the effect size of the multi-component intervention on both clinical and decision
      outcomes in children and adolescents with IBD and their parents.
