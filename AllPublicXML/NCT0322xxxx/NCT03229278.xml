      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of trigriluzole in combination with
      nivolumab and pembrolizumab in treating patients with solid malignancies or lymphoma that has
      spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Trigriluzole may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Giving trigriluzole in combination with nivolumab and pembrolizumab
      may work better at treating patients with solid malignancies or lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of trigriluzole in
      combination with PD-1 inhibiting antibodies, and to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      trigriluzole in combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the efficacy of the combination therapy. II. To identify markers of
      response to trigriluzole in the tumor microenvironment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trigriluzole.

      Patients receive trigriluzole orally (PO) every other day (QOD), twice daily (BID), every
      morning (QAM) or every bedtime (QHS) on days -14 to -1. Patients then receive nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO QOD,
      BID, QAM or QHS. Once the MTD of trigriluzole with nivolumab is identified, patients receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO.
      Treatment repeats for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 3
      years.

             requiring treatment within the past 30 days

          -  Any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalents) or other systemic immunosuppressive medications within 14 days

             doses &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular,
             intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption)'
             physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &lt; 10
             mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis
             (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted

          -  Second primary malignancy, except those second primary malignancies that are not

             investigator; examples include: in situ carcinoma of the cervix, adequately treated
             non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin, or other malignancy treated at least 5 years

          -  Patients with active, untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases will be
             excluded from this clinical trial; patients who have brain metastases that been
             treated with radiation therapy or surgery will be required to have a washout period of
             at least 3 weeks prior to study entry, must be neurologically asymptomatic, and must
             not require systemic steroids

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the start of treatment, for the duration of treatment, and for 5 months after
