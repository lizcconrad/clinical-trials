  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome in neonates has been defined in 2015. Earlier
      identification and successful intervention into the potential pregnancy associated risk
      factors for the conversion from NRDS to ARDS is one of the most important components of ARDS
      prevention.

      Pregnancy risk factors (PRF), such as intrahepatic cholestasis during pregnancy(ICP),
      hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy(HDCP) and gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM),
      are related to NRDS, ARDS and subsequent death. Meantime, it has also been proven that the
      prevention of PRF reduces the risk of NRDS and ARDS. However, few study reported the
      relations between PRF and the conversion from NRDS to ARDS, and it also remains unknown
      whether treating PRF can reduce the progression from NRDS to ARDS.

      We have found that PRF were related to the increase and deterioration of NRDS in a Chinese
      cohort. The aims of the present study were: 1). to report the effects of PRF on the
      conversion from NRDS to ARDS. 2). to clarify whether PRF treatment could prevention from
      conversion from NRDS to ARDS in a Chinese population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The gestational age was less than 37 weeks;

          2. These neonates were diagnosed with NRDS; The diagnosis of NRDS was based on clinical
             manifestations and chest X-ray findings. The clinical signs and symptoms of NRDS were
             respiratory distress, tachypnea, nasal flaring, groan, and cyanosis after birth. The
             typical X-ray picture of RDS showed a grain shadow, air bronchogram or white lung.
