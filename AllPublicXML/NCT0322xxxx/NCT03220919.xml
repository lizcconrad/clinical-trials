  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use a weight-based regimen consisting of basal-bolus insulin and
      preprandial rapid-acting insulin and to test its efficacy and safety in controlling blood
      glucose in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes are randomly assigned by computer-generated block randomization
      to receive either weight-based or glucose level-based titration regimen. All antidiabetic
      drugs are discontinued on admission.

      Starting dose:

      Total daily insulin is 0.4U/kg. Half is given as glargine and the remainder as aspart which
      is divided into three equal parts used for three pre-meal boluses.

      Titration:

        1. Weight-based insulin titration regimen:

           Glargine titration: 0.1U/kg per day when fasting blood glucose (FBG) is over 8.0 mmol/L.

           Aspart titration: total dose 0.1U/kg per day when next pre-meal blood glucose (BG) is
           over 8.0 mmol/L, which is divided into three equal parts adding to three pre-meal
           boluses.

        2. Glucose level- based titration regimen:

      Glargine titration: 4, 6, or 8 U when FBG is, respectively, within the following ranges:
      8.0-8.9, 9.0-9.9, &gt;10.0 mmol/L.

      Aspart titration: 1, 3, 5, 7 or 8 U when next pre-meal BG is, respectively, within the
      following ranges: 8.0-10.9, 11.0-13.9, 14.0-16.9, 17.0-19.9, &gt; 20 mmol/L.
