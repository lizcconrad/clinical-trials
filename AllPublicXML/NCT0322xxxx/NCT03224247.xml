    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the oldest surgical interventions in the history of medicine.Many
      variations in cesarean section technique have been studied.The investigatory team are aiming
      to decrease blood loss during cesarean section by vertical splitting versus transverse
      cutting of muscle layer in lower segment cesarean sections to avoid uterine vessels injury.

    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the oldest surgical interventions in the history of medicine.Since
      the first documented cesarean delivery in 1020 AD, various modifications have been made in
      the technique. It was a surgery performed as a last resort, mostly peri- or post-portem.

      Many variations in cesarean section technique have been studied.our study aim is to decrease
      blood loss during cesarean section through decreasing incidence of uterine vessels injury.
      The investigator supposed that applying Vertical pull on a small C-shaped incision in the
      lower uterine segment during cesarean section allows the tissues to split along their natural
      arrangement, decreasing the probability of extension of the wound into the uterine vessels,
      thus; decreasing blood loss; operative time and maternal recovery.
