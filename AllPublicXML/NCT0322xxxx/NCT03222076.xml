      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapy with nivolumab alone or nivolumab +
      ipilimumab in resectable HCC in the context of presurgical therapy; to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of therapy with nivolumab + ipilimumab in potentially resectable HCC in the
      context of pre-biopsy therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the efficacy of presurgical nivolumab alone or nivolumab + ipilimumab therapy
           in HCC by estimating the objective response rate (ORR) and time to progression (TTP) per
           RECIST 1.1 progression-free survival (PFS).

        2. To estimate the conversion rate to surgery for arm 3 potentially resectable patients.

      Groups A and B:

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group.

      If you are likely to be eligible for standard-of-care liver surgery, you will be randomly
      assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to either Group A or B.

      Group A participants will receive nivolumab alone.

      Group B participants will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is about 2 weeks.

      You will receive nivolumab by vein over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.

      If you are in Group B, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles
      1, 6, and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 9, 12, and so on).

      You will have standard-of-care liver surgery on Day 1 of Cycle 4, if still eligible. You will
      be asked to sign a separate consent form for the surgery.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 2 years if you are in Group A or B, if the
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If you are in Group C, you may continue taking the
      study drugs until you are eligible to have surgery or up to 2 years, whichever is sooner.

      You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of therapy, in keeping
             with the policies of the institution. Patients with a history of major psychiatric
             illness must be judged able to fully understand the investigational nature of the

          2. Patients with histologically confirmed HCC (Documentation of original biopsy for
             diagnosis is acceptable if tumor tissue is unavailable) or clinical diagnosis by AASLD
             criteria in cirrhotic subjects is required (presence of arterial hypervascularity with
             venous washout). For subjects without cirrhosis, histological confirmation is
             mandatory. The determination of resectability status will ultimately lie in the
             clinical judgment of the surgical oncologist and medical oncologist involved in the
             care of the patient.

          3. Patient must have measurable disease defined as a lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) and measures =/&gt;
             15 mm with conventional techniques or =/&gt; 10 mm with more sensitive techniques such as
             MRI or spiral CT scan.

          4. Patient can have had prior treatment for HCC including prior surgery, radiation
             therapy, local-regional therapy (ablation or arterial directed therapies), and
             systemic therapy including sorafenib or chemotherapy (but not anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4
             therapy).

          5. ECOG performance status =/&lt; 1.

          6. Within 14 days of the first dose of study drug, patients must have adequate organ and
             marrow function as defined below: a) Absolute neutrophil count =/&gt; 1,500/μL; b)
             Platelets =/&gt;100,000/μL; c) Hgb &gt; 9.0 g/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa
             [e.g., Epogen®] to maintain or exceed this level); d) Total bilirubin =/&lt; 1.5 mg/dl;
             e) Serum creatinine =/&lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or estimated CrCL
             &gt;40mL/min.; f) AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) =/&lt; 5 X institutional upper limit of
             normal.

          7. Men and women =/&gt; 18 years of age

          8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to
             the start of study drug.

          9. Women must not be breastfeeding.

         10. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception from the time
             of enrollment for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of
             study drug (s) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 5 months post
             treatment completion.

         11. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s)
             of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives
             of study drug (s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 7 months
             post-treatment completion.

         12. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt
             from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing
             as described in these sections.

             drug; or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the
             study (other than defined by protocol); or fine needle aspirations or core biopsies)
             within 7 days prior to first dose of study drug. NOTE: Patients will be allowed to
             start cycle 1 day 1 therapy after 24 hours from pre-treatment biopsy.

          4. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (including
             crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are excluded from this study as are patients
             with a history of autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive
             sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g.,
             wegener's granulomatosis]).

          5. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          6. Any underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, will make
             the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse
             events, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          7. Patients who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, abdominal fistula,
             gastrointestinal perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, GI obstruction, abdominal
             carcinomatosis which are known risks factors for bowel perforation, should be excluded
             from the study.

          8. Patients who have a primary brain tumor (excluding meningiomas and other benign
             lesions), any brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease, seizure disorders not
             controlled with standard medical therapy, or history of stroke within the past year.

          9. History of serious systemic disease, including myocardial infarction or unstable
             angina within the last 12 months, history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive
             encephalopathy, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure of &gt;140/90 mmHg) at the time
             of enrollment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart
             failure, unstable symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medication (patients with chronic
             atrial arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular
             tachycardia are eligible), significant vascular disease or symptomatic peripheral
             vascular disease.

         10. Patients who have history of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that
             might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at
             high risk from treatment complications.

         11. Patients who are on high dose steroid (e.g. &gt; 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) or
             other more potent immune suppression medications (e.g. infliximab).

         12. Patients who have had influenza, hepatitis, or other vaccines within a month prior to
             initiation of study drugs.

         13. Patients who have clinical history of coagulopathy, bleeding diathesis or thrombosis
             within the past year.

         14. Patients who have serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

         15. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation.

         16. Patients with prior orthotropic liver transplantation.

         17. Patients with cirrhosis and severe synthetic liver dysfunction (Child Pugh B-C).

         18. Patients must not have received prior anticancer therapy with anti-CLTA-4 or anti-PD1
             for HCC. Patients receiving any concomitant systemic therapy for HCC are excluded.

         19. Patients must not be scheduled to receive another experimental drug while on this
             study.

         20. Patients who require ongoing anticoagulation will be excluded. Only aspirin will be
             permitted. Pre and post-surgical prophylactic anti-coagulation treatment is permitted.

         21. Patients must not require total parenteral nutrition with lipids.

         22. Any patient who cannot be compliant with the appointments required in this protocol
             must not be enrolled in this study.
