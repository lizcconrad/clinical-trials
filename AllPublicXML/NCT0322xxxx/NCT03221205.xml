      This study evaluates the effect of the use of nasal CPAP in the cardiac function, measured by
      strain and TEI index, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea and
      obesity. In order to do so, 76 patients will be studied, half will use sham CPAP and half
      will use therapeutic CPAP for three months, with ecocardiogram, laboratory studies,
      ambulatory monitoring of arterial tension and sleep study before and after CPAP use.

      The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disease characterized by repeated episodes
      of partial o total obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. It affects 3.2% of adults in
      Mexico City. These patients have a higher risk of suffering traffic accidents, cardiovascular
      diseases, a lower quality of life and premature death. The association between OSAS and heart
      failure is complex, but it is known that they have a higher risk of myocardial dysfunction
      with OR 2.4 (IC 95% 1.2 - 4.6), with higher mortality against controls. Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (DM2) is a chronic metabolic disease that leads to macro and micro vascular damage,
      and is the first cause of mortality in Mexico (13.8% of all deaths in people older than 20
      years). Its general prevalence in adults is of 7%. There is a strong association between
      OSAS, insulin resistance and DM2, with studies with 86% of patients with DM2 having some
      degree of sleep apnea reported, with 22.6% having severe OSAS. The presence of DM2 doubles
      the risk of cardiovascular disease in men and triples it in women, and coronary cardiac
      disease being the main cause of death. Patients with OSAS have altered myocardial function
      even in asymptomatic state, also patients with DM2 have been shown to have abnormalities in
      myocardial function, myocardial performance and myocardial elongation in comparation with a
      control group. There is no current information about the effect of treatment with CPAP on
      myocardial performance of patients with OSAS, DM2 and obesity.
