  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop and test a family-based preventive intervention for
      suicide risk among 1st and 2nd generation immigrant Latino/a adolescents. The intervention
      will focus on reducing suicide risk by reducing family conflict and intergenerational
      cultural conflict and improving parent-child communication. The investigators will first
      develop the 8-session preventive intervention with quantitative data from analysis of
      existing longitudinal studies and qualitative feedback from Latino youth and their
      caregivers, clinicians, administrators, and research consultants, as well as results from
      initial pilot testing of the intervention. The investigators will then conduct a pilot
      randomized trial with 40 adolescents and their families to test feasibility, acceptability,
      and impact on intervention targets. Successful development of the intervention would improve
      mental health outcomes for a growing and underserved portion of the U.S. population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents, with rates increasing between
      1999 and 2014. Family-based preventive interventions demonstrate promise for reducing suicide
      risk among adolescents, and are particularly relevant for addressing suicide risk factors
      specific to immigrant youth, who comprise one-fourth of the U.S. population under 18. The
      purpose of this project is to develop and test a family-based preventive intervention for
      suicide risk among 1st and 2nd generation immigrant Latino/a adolescents. In the first phase
      of intervention development, quantitative and qualitative data will be used to develop and if
      necessary refine a new family based preventive intervention (Early Intervention for Suicide
      Risk among Immigrant Youth, EISR-I). The investigators will then test the intervention in a
      pilot case series in order to finalize assessment and intervention protocols. In the second
      phase, the investigators will pilot test the preventive intervention, delivered by mental
      health clinicians to 1st and 2nd generation Latino/a early adolescents and their families, in
      order to assess feasibility, acceptability, and impact on the intervention targets (i.e. a
      positive signal of the intervention) on the study population. Twenty families will be
      randomized to receive the 8-session intervention and twenty will receive enhanced usual care
      including a safety planning and feedback session.
