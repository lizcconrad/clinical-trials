      The aim of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of contextually tailored activity
      suggestions and activity planning for increasing physical activity among sedentary adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a key behavioral strategy for prevention of non-communicable diseases
      such as diabetes and heart disease. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown promise
      for supporting physical activity adoption and maintenance in ways that are highly acceptable
      to users, scalable, and cost-efficient. This study examines two intervention
      strategies—contextually tailored activity suggestions and daily planning of the activity for
      the next day—that a mobile health intervention can use to encourage physical activity in
      sedentary adults.

      Study participants use HeartSteps, an mHealth physical intervention developed by the research
      team, in their daily lives for six weeks. Over the course of the study both of the HeartSteps
      intervention components—contextually-tailored activity suggestions and activity planning—are
      micro-randomized for each participant on each of the day of the study, in order the effects
      on physical activity of each component separately and how those effects change over time.

      The primary hypothesis for suggestions is that providing a contextually tailored activity
      suggestion increases participant step count over the subsequent 30 minutes following message
      delivery.

      The first secondary hypothesis for suggestions is that the proximal effect of the
      contextually tailored activity suggestions on the subsequent 30-minute step count will
      decrease with duration in the study.

      The primary hypothesis for planning is that receiving evening planning will increase step
      count on the following day.

      The primary analyses will use the methods developed in Boruvka et al. (2017). The primary
      longitudinal outcome for activity suggestions will be the log of the step count in the 30
      minutes subsequent to decision points. The log of the step count in the 30 minutes prior to
      randomization will be included as a control variable. The primary longitudinal outcome for
      planning will be the square root of the step count on the day following the randomization of
      planning treatment.

      All missing but &quot;available&quot; minute-by-minute step counts from the wrist band will be imputed
      as 0. See &quot;Allocation&quot; section for the definition of availability. Sensitivity analyses using
      step counts from the mobile phone (secondary data source) will be conducted.

    <description>For activity suggestions, at each available decision time, each participant is randomly assigned to either receive an activity suggestion or not. The randomization probability is 0.6 for receiving a message and 0.4 for not receiving a message.
For activity planning, at each decision point, the participant is randomized to either receive evening planning or not at that decision time. The randomization probability for receiving planning is 0.5, and 0.5 for not receiving planning.</description>

    <description>HeartSteps is an Android-based mHealth intervention that contains two main intervention components: contextually-tailored suggestions for activity and planning of the next day's activity. Activity suggestions provide individuals with actionable suggestions for how they can be active in their current context. Delivered suggestions are tailored based on time of day, user's location, day of the week (weekend/weekday), and weather. HeartSteps can deliver a user activity suggestions up to five times a day. Evening planning asks users to create or choose a plan of how they will be active on the following day. Planning can be delivered once a day, in the evening.</description>

    <ipd_description>A de-identified dataset (i.e., containing no raw location/GPS information) will be generated and made available to the research community. The dataset will be stripped of all codes or any other information that could be linked back to the original data or to an individual participant. Prospective users of this dataset must agree to a confidentiality agreement, meaning that they must get permission from the HeartSteps Primary Investigator to share the data with anyone else. All external requests for data will be directed to Dr. Predrag Klasnja. Prospective investigators will submit a written proposal to the HeartSteps Investigator Team outlining the question they will investigate, the specific variables that they need to answer that question, their analytic plan for answering that question, and documentation of sufficient Institutional Review Board oversight (e.g., approval or exemption). Investigators will also need to sign a confidentiality agreement.</ipd_description>
