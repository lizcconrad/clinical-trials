  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well-known that regular physical activity (PA) can improve glycemic control and
      physical fitness in type 2 diabetes patients. However, studies examining the effects of PA in
      patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are limited. Interval walking training
      (IWT) is a careful type of PA consisting of repeatedly cycles of 3 min. fast and slow
      walking. The investigators aimed to examine, if IWT is feasible as PA intervention for GDM
      patients, and to examine the effects of IWT on glycemic control, PA levels and physical
      fitness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance and thus hyperglycemia
      with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, is steadily increasing in prevalence. In
      Denmark, the prevalence of GDM is around 2-3% of all pregnancies. GDM is associated with
      several adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes why early recognition and diagnosis is
      important. Early diagnosis and relevant treatment can prevent adverse outcomes of the baby
      and mother, such as macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, preeclampsia and hypoglycemia.

      The glucose levels will often normalize shortly after birth; however, up to 50% of all women
      in Denmark diagnosed with GDM develop T2D during the first 10 years after the pregnancy, have
      a threefold risk of developing metabolic syndrome2 10, while the recurrence risk of
      developing GDM in subsequent pregnancies varies between 30-84%. Furthermore, long term
      increased risks for children born with macrosomia or by a mother with GDM include
      cardiovascular disease, obesity and T2D.

      Glycemic control is a key factor in combatting the severe effects related to poorly
      controlled GDM. Management of GDM in Denmark consists of regular BG self-monitoring, dietary
      modifications, and in some cases insulin treatment. Additionally, obstetric control visits
      and PA advices are also a part of the standard GDM care program.

      Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women must be more careful in relation to especially
      the type of PA, why supervised exercise is often recommended in order to ensure safe and
      correct guidance. This is a heavy economic burden, why a structured, non-supervised type of
      PA with low a risk of injury, possibly high compliance and continuous monitoring would be
      preferable. Interval walking training (IWT) is a lenient type of structured, non-supervised
      PA. This type of PA is associated with an improved glucose regulation in patients with T2D
      after 4 months of IWT 5 times weekly (60 min./session) (Karstoft et al., 2013). Due to
      similar metabolic dysregulations in patients with T2D and GDM, the investigators are apt to
      believe that IWT, if feasible, can improve glycemic control in GDM patients. Furthermore, it
      is obvious to believe that IWT can be implemented as regular PA in GDM patients, as one study
      has shown that pregnant women mostly prefer walking as a type of PA during pregnancy.

      This open-label randomized controlled trial aims to enroll 20 patients randomized (1:1) to a
      control- (Con) or IWT-group. Both groups will follow the standard GDM care program at Odense
      University Hospital. Additionally, the IWT-group is prescribed three weekly IWT sessions of
      40-50 minutes each for 6 weeks. Each IWT session is guided and controlled by the smartphone
      application 'InterWalk', which individualize the training intensity to current fitness level
      of the patient through an on-board fitness test.

    <intervention_model_description>This open-label randomized controlled trial aims to enroll 20 patients randomized (1:1) to a control- (Con) or IWT-group. Patients in both the IWT- and Con-group follows the standardized GDM care program for GDM patients at OUH through the 6-week intervention period, which consists of instruction of self-monitoring of BG levels, dietary guidance, and in some cases, insulin treatment. Additionally, the program also consists of close obstetric control visits and exercise guidance. All patients are instructed not to start any new type of PA after inclusion and continue their lives without any changes.
Patients randomized to the IWT-group goes through a 6-week non-supervised IWT-program, where they are prescribed to conduct 3 IWT sessions per week of 40-50 minutes each.
Before and after the 6-week intervention, maternal blood glucose (BG) levels is measured by continuous glucose monitoring, PA level measured using accelerometers and physical fitness measured using two walking tests.</intervention_model_description>
