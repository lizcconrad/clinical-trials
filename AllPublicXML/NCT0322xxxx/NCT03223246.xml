  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are two of the most commonly used medication products among
      children &lt;12 years old, and these medications are frequently prescribed for patients leaving
      the emergency department (ED), but previous studies have shown that parents often leave the
      ED unsure of how to safely dose these medications at home. This study will be a randomized
      controlled trial of a brief medication safety intervention, and examining parental knowledge
      and implementation of appropriate weight-based dosing.
