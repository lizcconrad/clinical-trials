      Poor adherence to insulin regimens is reported in up to two-third of patients with diabetes;
      thus it is important to identify patients at risk and to develop strategies and tools to
      increase adherence to prescribed insulin regimens. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      Insulclock® - small electronic device to help track date, time and dosage of the last
      injection, type of insulin used and temperature, with an alarm system to prevent insulin
      omissions and mistiming.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is arguably the most urgent healthcare challenge of the 21st century. Poor adherence
      to insulin regimens is reported in up to two-third of patients with diabetes; thus it is
      important to identify patients at risk and to develop strategies and tools to increase
      adherence to prescribed insulin regimens. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      Insulclock® - small electronic device to help track date, time and dosage of the last
      injection, type of insulin used and temperature, with an alarm system to prevent insulin
      omissions and mistiming. The Insulclock's real time memory and alert system are likely to
      improve treatment adherence, patient's satisfaction, and quality of life measures, which may
      improve glycemic control in insulin treated patients with Type 2 Diabetes.

    <measure>Number of insulin injection irregularities.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 through week 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of insulin injection irregularities (omission, mistiming and dosing) will be registered on the Insulclock device, and data will be retrieved during each clinic visit to monitor treatment adherence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs-status and DTSQc-change) scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 12 and 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Score on the DTSQs as well as score on the DTSQc (Qs 1, 7 and 8) will be used to assess treatment satisfaction.
The DTSQs: contains eight items scored on a seven-point scale (0-6), e.g, 6 = very satisfied to 0 = very dissatisfied. The total satisfaction score when using the DTSQs ranges from 0 to 36; and the total score is obtained from summed scores from questions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
The DTSQc:the amplitude of the score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction while the direction (positive or negative) will provide guidance on the preference of one device over the other. DTSQc contains eight items scored on 7-point scales; scores range from +3 = much more satisfied now to -3 = much less satisfied now, with 0 (midpoint), representing no change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Related Quality of Life (DRQoL) scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 12 and 24.</time_frame>
    <description>DRQoL is a composite score, consisting of a standardized and unweighted Insulin Treatment Experience Questionnaire Score (ITEQ), and Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire score. ITEQ includes 7 domains: leisure activities (4 items), psychological barriers (2 items), handling (5 items), diabetes control (6 items), dependence (5 items), weight control (3 items), sleep (2 items); + 1 additional item assigned to assess overall satisfaction with current insulin therapy regimen. The PAID contains 20 items that describe negative emotions related to diabetes commonly experienced by patients with diabetes. Each question has five possible answers with a value from 0 to 4, with 0 representing &quot;no problem&quot; and 4 &quot;a serious problem&quot;. The scores are added up and multiplied by 1.25, generating a total score between 0 - 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean HbA1c.</measure>
    <time_frame>-1, 12 and 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the three-month average plasma glucose concentration. The test is limited to a three-month average because the lifespan of a red blood cell is four months (120 days). Change in mean HbA1cas will be measure and recorded to monitor glycemic control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of episodes of hypoglycemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 through week 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of episodes of hypoglycemia will be recorded. For this study, symptomatic hypoglycemia is defined as an event with typical symptoms (i.e., sweating, palpitation, and feeling of hunger) with or without confirmation by plasma glucose &lt;54 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of episodes of severe hypoglycemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 through week 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of episodes of severe hypoglycemia will be recorded.Severe hypoglycemia is defined as episodes necessitating assistance and associated with measured plasma glucose &lt; 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/L), or with prompt recovery after administration of carbohydrates, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in daily fasting glucose profile averages.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 through week 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Daily fasting glucose profile averages will be recorded to monitor glycemic control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 7-point Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) profile.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 5 days prior to randomization, up to 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>SMBG refers to home blood glucose testing for people with diabetes. 7-point SMBG profile include fasting, before meals, 2 hours after meals, and bedtime.</description>

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire-Revised (DQLCTQ-R) score</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 12 and 24 weeks.</time_frame>
