  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine has been reported to have a clinically significant effect on the platelet
      count in systemic lupus thrombocytopenia. Its action may be due to its immune modulator
      effect. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is known as an immune-mediated acquired disease
      characterized by transient or persistent decrease of the platelet count. However, refractory
      ITP is lacking of effective treatments and the efficacy of decitabine in ITP remains poorly
      understood. Data from this study may provide some idea of Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment
      of ITP in comparison to other lines of treatment as detected by the standardized definitions.

      This study will include patients with chronic ITP attending the out patients clinic of
      Clinical Hematology Unit of Internal Medicine Department of Assiut university Hospital to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in comparison to other lines of
      treatment as detected by the standardized definitions . Detect the predictors for chronic ITP
      especially anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) role and the effect of the proposed drugs on the
      level of anti-platelet antibodies. Evaluation of the health-related quality of life after
      treatments to answer this question; Is the most effective drug is linked to the best quality
      of life.
