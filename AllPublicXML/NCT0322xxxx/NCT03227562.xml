  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risperidone at low dosage is often used as treatment of acute anxiety symptom. However,
      patients may be either responder or not. Here we hypothesized that the early response to a
      low dose of risperidone is predictive to risperidone efficiency.

      Subjects with acute anxiety symptoms (Hospital anxiety depression scale) and risperidone
      prescription would be proposed to be enrolled in the study. A check-up is made at D0, then
      the subjects begin the treatment (0.5mg risperidone). The same check-up is carried out on the
      following day (D1). The subjects fulfil a last check-up 12 week after the beginning of
      treatment (W12). During the D1-W12, the psychiatrist may changes the treatment.

      Risperidone at low dosage is often used as treatment of acute anxiety symptom. However,
      patients may be either responder or not. Here we hypothesized that the early response to a
      low dose of risperidone is predictive to risperidone efficiency.

      Subjects with acute anxiety symptoms (Hospital anxiety depression scale) and risperidone
      prescription would be proposed to be enrolled in the study. After acceptation, the fulfil
      questionnaires (MINI, PCL-s-V) then they interacts with test on computers (PVT, 2nBack, Iowa
      gambling task) and give saliva and receive an actimetric watch (D0).

      They begin the treatment on the evening (0.5mg risperidone/day). The following day, they come
      back to hospital and they fulfil the same tests, questionnaires and samples (D1).

      12 week after, they come again to hospital to fulfil the same tests, questionnaires and
      samples (W12).

      Between D1 and S12, the psychiatrist may change the treatment, adding other treatment or
      modifying risperidone treatment (increasing dosage up to 2mg/day or removing it).
