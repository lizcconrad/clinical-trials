  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent and/or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) are a common
      clinical situation and although this group of patients has very heterogeneous disease
      characteristics, they share a dismal prognosis with a median survival time around 6-11 months
      and a relatively poor quality of life.

      Immunotherapy approaches have recently demonstrated clinical efficacy in more than twenty
      cancer types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      and SCCHN. Nivolumab demonstrated significant overall survival benefit as treatment for
      recurrent SCCHN in a randomized phase III Study CA209141 conducted on a cohort of 361
      patients (240 in the nivolumab arm and 121 in the standard therapy arm), presenting this
      condition and whose disease had progressed within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy.
      In this study, treatment with nivolumab resulted in significantly longer survival than
      treatment with standard therapy with a median overall survival of 7.5 months vs 5.1 months
      (p=0.01).

      The main objective of the study is to provide additional insight into the frequency of
      high-grade AEs related to nivolumab and their outcome, and thus supplement the growing safety
      database of nivolumab-treated recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck patients.

             and on treatment. Medical management of calcium levels is permitted. Note: Normal
             calcium levels may be based on ionized calcium or adjusted for albumin.

         12. Subjects with an initial magnesium &lt; 0.5 mmol/L (1.2 mg/dL) may receive corrective
             magnesium supplementation but should continue to receive either prophylactic weekly

             toxicity determination or adverse events.

         13. History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding
