  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent and/or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) are a common
      clinical situation and although this group of patients has very heterogeneous disease
      characteristics, they share a dismal prognosis with a median survival time around 6-11 months
      and a relatively poor quality of life.

      Immunotherapy approaches have recently demonstrated clinical efficacy in more than twenty
      cancer types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      and SCCHN. Nivolumab demonstrated significant overall survival benefit as treatment for
      recurrent SCCHN in a randomized phase III Study CA209141 conducted on a cohort of 361
      patients (240 in the nivolumab arm and 121 in the standard therapy arm), presenting this
      condition and whose disease had progressed within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy.
      In this study, treatment with nivolumab resulted in significantly longer survival than
      treatment with standard therapy with a median overall survival of 7.5 months vs 5.1 months
      (p=0.01).

      The main objective of the study is to provide additional insight into the frequency of
      high-grade AEs related to nivolumab and their outcome, and thus supplement the growing safety
      database of nivolumab-treated recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck patients.

             and on treatment. Medical management of calcium levels is permitted. Note: Normal
             calcium levels may be based on ionized calcium or adjusted for albumin.

         12. Subjects with an initial magnesium &lt; 0.5 mmol/L (1.2 mg/dL) may receive corrective
