      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of knee component alignment between
      patients operated with iASSIST Knee (Investigational group) versus patients operated without
      iASSIST Knee (Control group) using the same implant system.

      Objective： To compare the accuracy of knee component alignment between patients operated with
      iASSIST Knee (Investigational group) versus patients operated without iASSIST Knee (Control
      group) using the same implant system.

      Endpoint： Primary： The alignment accuracy of the knee femoral and tibial components at 6
      months for the investigational group compared to the control group.

      Secondary：Health Status after TKA, Operating Room efficiency and Complication rate after TKA
      for the investigational group compared to the control group.

The randomization scheme is based on equal numbers per group. The randomization will occur via a random number generator (computer) using blocked randomization procedure. The PI or his/her team does not have influence on the randomization scheme. Sealed opaque envelopes, which will be prepared based on predetermined randomization assignment, will be provided to each study site before study initiation.</masking_description>
