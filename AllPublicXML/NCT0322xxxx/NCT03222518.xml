    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

      Compare the effect of paracetamol alone against NSAIDs alone against the association of
      paracetamol + NSAIDs in the treatment of traumatic pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol, NSAIDs, or a combination of the two molecules are usually prescribed. Patients
      even use these medications without a prescription. It is not known, however, whether or not
      NSAIDs have an additional value relative to paracetamol for the treatment of pain.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study carried out in the
      emergency department of Monastir - Tunisia.

      Four groups were individualized: Paracetamol + placebo group, NSAID + placebo group and NSAID
      + Paracetamol group.

      All patients will receive omeprazole at a dose of 20mg / d. For each patient included, EVA,
      blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and SaO2 were taken at admission and at the
      second visit after 07 days.

      Otherwise, each patient will have to fill the follow-up sheet containing the measurement of
      EVA 3 times / day during the first 3 days of treatment at rest and during daily activity.

      During the second visit, the patient has to answer the questions of satisfaction and the
      questionnaire EQ5D of the quality of life.

      Criteria for judgment:

      Main criteria:

        -  Treatment success is defined as the percentage of EN ≤ 30 during the 7 days following
           discharge from the emergency department.

        -  The patient's need to add another analgesic medication or non-pharmacological
           intervention.

        -  Patient satisfaction with two questions on a Likert scale in 5 intensity points.

        -  Improvement of the patient's quality of life according to the EQ5D questionnaire

      Secondary Criteria:

      -The appearance of side effects: Drowsiness, Decreased respiratory rate (&lt;14 c / min),
      Cutaneous rash, Vomiting, Nausea, pruritus, Dizziness, digestive hemorrhage.

      Criteria for failure:

      The following criteria were used to define treatment failure:

        -  The reduction of EVA by less than 30% compared to the initial EVA.

        -  The occurrence of adverse effects requiring immediate discontinuation of treatment.

        -  Patient need to add another analgesic medication or non-pharmacological intervention to
           relieve pain.

        -  Non-satisfaction of the patient according to the three questions noted in 5 points on a
           scale of Likert.

        -  The non-improvement of the quality of life of the patient according to the questionnaire
           EQ5D
