  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been recognised as a useful,
      cost-effective and safe alternative to inpatient treatment, but no formal OPAT unit existed
      in Switzerland until recently. In December 2013 an OPAT unit was established at Lausanne
      University Hospital. The investigators plan to investigate the efficacy, safety and
      economicity of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy administered at the new OPAT unit
      of the Lausanne University Hospital starting in January 2014 until December 2020.

    <textblock>
      Some patients require parenteral antibiotic therapy, but are well enough to return home.
      Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) was first developed in the USA in the
      1970s for patients with cystic fibrosis, before being adopted by other countries. It has been
      recognised as a useful, cost-effective and safe alternative to inpatient treatment. It is now
      a standard care in several countries and different national guidelines have been established.
      There are various models of care for OPAT and most OPAT centres provide hospital-centred
      nursing programmes or services based on nurses visiting the patient's home. A few centres
      have also shown that self-administration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is an effective
      and safe option for selected patients. Furthermore, use of continuous infusion of antibiotics
      increases the number of feasible treatments. Continuous infusion by pumps of antibiotics with
      a time-dependent killing mechanism is a practical option which has been described. In Europe,
      even if many infectious disease specialists feel that OPAT is required, it is still
      underdeveloped because of lack of funding, lack of leadership and lack of coordination
      between hospitals and community care.

      In the last decades, programs to enhance care delivery on an outpatient basis in order to
      contain health costs have been developed in Switzerland. However administration of outpatient
      intravenous antibiotic therapy for patients who require parenteral therapy, but are otherwise
      fit enough to go home, hasn't been used widely until recently. In December 2013, an
      outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment (OPAT) unit was initiated at Lausanne University
      Hospital with the goal of offering an alternative treatment programme that is equally
      effective and as safe as inpatient treatment.

      The purpose of this study will be to investigate the efficacy, safety and economicity of
      treatments administered at the new OPAT unit of the University Hospital of Lausanne in the
      context of the Swiss Health System.

    <description>Efficacy of OPAT will be evaluated by recording the treatment outcome. Patients will be categorized 3 months after end of treatment as cured, as treatment failure or as a relapse according to the following definitions:
cured: absence of fever and no clinical sign of the site of infection.
treatment failure: patient readmitted to hospital because of infection related complications
relapse: patients considered as cured at the end of OPAT, but who had again signs of infection at the same site within 3 months after end of OPAT.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>2014-2020</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the safety of OPAT will be done by measuring the rate of adverse events and their severity during OPAT. All adverse events will be recorded and classified according to their severity according the grade classification (grade 1 to 5) as recommended by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).
