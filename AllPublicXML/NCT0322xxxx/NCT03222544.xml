    <textblock>
      The investigators designed this prospective, randomized control study to confirm the efficacy
      and safety of indocyanine green - mediated photodynamic therapy for diabetic lower limb ulcer
      and to explore its mechanism.

      OBJECTIVE— Infection is associated with poor healing of diabetic lower limb ulcer. Diabetic
      lower limb ulcer are often lower extremity vascular stenosis or occlusion, poor blood supply,
      making local ulcer local antibacterial drugs difficult to effectively reach and distribution,
      resulting in systemic antibacterial efficacy is limited, and easy to induce bacterial
      resistance at the same time . In recent years, the incidence of clinical multidrug-resistant
      bacteria increased, increasing the difficulty and cost of treatment.

      The current study attempts to identify whether the photodynamic therapy (PDT) would kill the
      surface of ulcer bacteria and promote ulcer healing, and explore the mechanism of indocyanine
      green-mediated photodynamic therapy for diabetic lower limb ulcer RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS—This study evaluated five clinical indicators： diabetic foot ulcer area reduction
      rate, inflammation control rate, the amount of inflammatory mediators, the dose and use time
      of antibiotics, adverse reaction rate. The efficacy and safety of PDT could be confirmed if
      the clinical indicators of PDT group is better than the control group. In this study, three
      methods were used to investigate the mechanism of indocyanine green-mediated photodynamic
      therapy for diabetic lower limb ulcer: a comparison of the bacterial load of the ulcer
      immediately pre-treatment and immediately post-treatment; changes in the pathogen of
      antimicrobial susceptibility; determination of reactive oxygen species in pathogens.

      EXPECTED RESULTS—The investigators will expect that indocyanine green-mediated photodynamic
      therapy could kill bacteria on the surface of diabetic lower limb ulcer and accelerate wound
      healing.
