      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:

        -  The primary endpoint is to evaluate the procedural success ie successful implantation of
           the device in the opinion of the surgeon

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:

      The secondary endpoints are to evaluate:

        -  KSS Knee scores and KSS Function scores at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment
           compared to pre-treatment

        -  Subject reported outcomes (SF-36, Oxford Knee Score and WOMAC) at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24
           months post-treatment compared to pre-treatment

        -  Stability of the device through radiographic analysis to assess alignment and component
           position at immediate post-treatment, 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment

        -  Safety in terms of adverse events and device deficiencies throughout the clinical
           investigation including any additional knee treatments and/or surgery

        -  Survivorship analysis of the device at 12 and 24 months and annually thereafter
