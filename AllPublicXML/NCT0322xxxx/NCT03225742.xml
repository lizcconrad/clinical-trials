  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After incontinence surgery, the patients randomly will be divided two groups. In group A
      postoperative urinary catheterization time will be applied one day, In group B
      catheterization will be applied two days. After removal of urinary catheter, residual volume
      will be measured and voiding function will be controlled. In postoperative period; third,
      sixth month and one year after surgery stress test will be applied to control success of
      surgery
