    <description>The HIV treatment satisfaction questionnaire (HIVTSQ) is a 10-item self-reported scale that measures overall satisfaction with treatment and by specific domains e.g. convenience, flexibility. The HIVTSQ items are summed up to produce a treatment satisfaction score (0 to 60) and an individual satisfaction rating for each item (0 to 6) and two subscales: general satisfaction/clinical and lifestyle/ease subscales. The higher the score, the greater the improvement in treatment satisfaction as compared to the past few weeks. A smaller score represents a decline in treatment satisfaction compared to the past few weeks.</description>
