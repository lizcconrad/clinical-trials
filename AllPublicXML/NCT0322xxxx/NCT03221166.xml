  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a life-long inflammatory bowel disease disease with an unknown
      pathogenesis. The ultimate goal of therapy is to modify the natural history of CD thus
      reducing complications. Thalidomide is a small molecule with immunomodulatory and
      anti-angiogenetic properties. It is currently approved for the treatment of erythema nodosum
      leprosum, an immunological complication of leprosy and multiple myeloma. It has also been
      used in several other inflammatory diseases of the skin and of the mucosal membranes, such as
      Behcet disease, oropharyngeal ulcers in AIDS, cutaneous lupus, and graft versus host disease.
      Many case series and one pediatric randomized controlled trial proved the efficacy of
      thalidomide in the treatment of children with CD refractory to standard treatments. In these
      patients, clinical remission was achieved in about 50% of the cases and was maintained for a
      mean time superior of 3 years. Mucosal healing after 52 weeks of treatment was observed in
      40% of the patients in clinical remission. Moreover, thalidomide was found to have a
      steroid-sparing effect and to decrease the need for surgical interventions. The clinical and
      endoscopic efficacy of thalidomide was also observed in children with failure to respond or
      intolerance to anti-TNF biological drugs.

      The aim of this multicentric prospective randomized controlled is to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of thalidomide vs infliximab in changing the natural history of CD in patients
      with poor prognostic outcome. Moreover, the study will evaluate the immunological and
      genetical mechanisms of CD, the mechanisms of action thalidomide in CD and will the
      pharmacokinetics, metabolomics and pharmacogenomics of thalidomide, and their impact on
      thalidomide safety and effectiveness.
