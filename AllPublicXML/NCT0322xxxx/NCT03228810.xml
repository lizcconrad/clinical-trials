  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biomarkers from circulating cell-free tumor DNA in peripheral blood will identify patients
      with metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed with C11 choline PET/CT who will benefit from
      metastasis-directed radiation, ablative therapies, and/or surgery. Tissue and blood will be
      collected before treatment. If patients receive androgen deprivation, then blood will be
      collected after neoadjuvant androgen deprivation but before radiation, ablative therapies, or
      surgery. Subsequent samples will be obtained at 3 months and 6 months following treatment,
      after which no further patient contact will occur.

          -  Histologically proven diagnosis of prostate cancer.

          -  Radiographic evidence of non-regional lymph node involvement, pelvic lymph node

          -  Requiring a clinically directed biopsy or resection of tumor at Mayo Clinic Rochester.

          -  Receiving local therapy for metastatic disease with radiation, ablative therapies,
             and/or surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester.

          -  Willingness to provide blood sample prior to receipt of treatment, as well as after
             neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and at 3 months and 6 months after radiation,
             ablation, or surgery.

          -  Absence of a second active malignancy.

          -  An understanding of the protocol and its requirements, risks, and discomforts.
