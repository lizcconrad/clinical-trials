      Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
      as a treatment for auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's primary objective is to provide further evidence for the effectiveness of
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to treat auditory hallucinations and to
      collect preliminary data on whether maintenance stimulation sessions can prolong the duration
      of stimulation-induced clinical benefits. The investigators will be looking into effects of
      tACS to re-normalize pathological alpha oscillations in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex
      (dl-PFC) of patients with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder by comparing Auditory
      Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) scores immediately before the first stimulation session,
      immediately after the last stimulation session, and at the end of the 8 weeks of maintenance
      sessions. As a secondary objective, the investigators will assess the differential clinical
      effects of active sham and 10Hz tACS on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of alpha
      oscillations. The investigators will also be using source localization techniques in EEG
      analysis, based on individual locations of the scalp electrodes and anatomical structures
      with the use of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI).
