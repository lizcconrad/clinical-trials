    <textblock>
      Participants were able to use the application the investigators developed for four weeks.
      With the application, the participants were able to monitor their stress level and life style
      patterns. The participants were also provided personalized stress management techniques
      including psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral technique. In 2014, additional relaxation
      techniques—abdominal breathing, progressive muscular relaxation, and meditation—were
      incorporated. Participants' mental health status and life style patterns were evaluated at
      baseline and at 4 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention statuses were compared after adjusting
      for degrees of life stress factors. Brief encounter psychosocial instrument (BEPSI-K) score
      and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score were used as primary
      outcome measures.
