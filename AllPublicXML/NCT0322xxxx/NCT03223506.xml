  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain is composed of several anatomical compartments separated by physiological barriers
      allowing the maintenance of homeostasis. Furthermore, brain-barriers restrain the diffusion
      of some drugs in cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) and in extracellular fluid (ECF) of brain tissue,
      making the development and optimization of dosing regimen of new drugs difficult. Most dosing
      regimen are determined from the plasma concentration because target site concentrations are
      difficult to obtain in the brain, hence making the prediction of the therapeutic effect, the
      adverse effect and the toxicity of a brain- diffused drug difficult. Although quantitative
      and qualitative differences exist in the processes governing pharmacokinetic (PK) in CSF and
      brain tissue, CSF is considered as the best surrogate of drugs penetration in the human
      brain.

      A study previously published has evaluated in rats the cerebral distribution of paracetamol,
      used as a marker of passive diffusion in the ECF by microdialysis in the striatum and in the
      CSF by microdialysis in the ventricular lateralis and the cistern magna. Authors chose
      paracetamol, as it has the property to diffuse passively and rapidly in the central nervous
      system allowing the exclusive description of the relationship between the different
      compartments of the brain. This study has first revealed an unexpected important difference
      between the distribution profiles obtained in ECF and CSF. Based on these results, authors
      developed a physiologically based PK model (PBPK) to describe their results and thereby
      offering the possibility to perform interspecies simulations to predict central nervous
      system (CNS) distribution of paracetamol in human. In this study, authors used this model to
      perform pharmaceutical extrapolations between species converting data from animal to human by
      replacing obtained data from clinical past studies describing paracetamol distribution in the
      CSF and in plasma.

      Microdialysis allows determination of free extracellular concentrations of drug in different
      tissues and also in brain. Our research team, INSERM U1070, has several past experiences with
      studies involving micro-dialysis to study the distribution of antibiotic in tissue in both
      animal and human including cerebral tissue in rat and human. Recommendation from the scholar
      society suggests that brain injured patients should benefit from a multimodal monitoring to
      optimize their care and brain perfusion. This invasive multimodal monitoring consists of
      measuring the intracranial pressure, the oxygen tissue-pressure, the estimation of the
      cerebral blood flow-rate by cranial Doppler as well as the monitoring of cerebral ischemic
      parameters by microdialysis. We also prevent systemic cerebral aggression among which,
      hyperthermia, explaining the prescription of paracetamol among a large number of brain
      injured patients. Furthermore setting up of an external ventricular draining (EVD) to treat
      an intra cranial hypertension is usually necessary to allow the continuous flow of the excess
      of CSF in the brain ventricle.

      Few studies carried on human has aimed at comparing the distribution of drugs in both the CSF
      and the brain extracellular fluid though it is established that the brain barriers differ in
      their permeability as well as the drug's concentrations are different between brain
      compartments. Thus by mean of monitoring through microdialysis and/or through therapeutic
      EVD, required by brain-injured patients, we aim in our study to explore the pharmacokinetic
      of paracetamol in the brain ECF, the CSF and the plasma and to validate in man the PBPK
      developed in rat.
