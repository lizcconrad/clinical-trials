    <textblock>
      This research study will see if electrical stimulation increases heel strike (heel hits the
      floor first when walking), decreases limp, helps muscle contraction, and improves balance in
      children with a hemiplegic leg. An experimental electrical stimulation device called the Gait
      MyoElectric Stimulator (GMES) will be used to stimulate the shin and calf muscles.

      Physical therapists focus on improving gait and balance in children with hemiplegic cerebral
      palsy (HCP). Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has the potential to improve strength
      and functional gait for children with HCP. The investigators hypothesize that a new FES
      system stimulating the dorsiflexor (DF) and plantarflexor (PF) muscles alternately at the
      correct time during gait, would lead to a significant improvement (p&lt;.05) in foot contact,
      gait symmetry and balance, compared to 12 weeks of a healthy lifestyle program called 5210.

    <measure>Aim 1 - Improve initial contact during gait, as measured by Noraxon video software</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the GMES program will improve initial contact during free speed walking (ie decrease toe first or flat foot contact, and increase heel strike).
Based on visual examination of freeze frame videotaped walking patterns, &quot;foot contact&quot; will be scored at initial contact as either heel, foot flat, or toe. A numerical assignment will be placed for each of these contact points. Each step with the heel contact (the most optimal), will receive a score of 3. Each step with the foot flat (the less optimal), will receive a score of 2. Each step the toe contact, (the least optimal), will receive a score of 1. A total of 10 initial contacts will be examined at each testing. The numerical value of the total number of contact points will be calculated for each subject and each trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 2 - Improve walking symmetry, as measured by Noraxon video software</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the GMES program will improve walking symmetry. Symmetry will be calculated using Noraxon for 10 strides for each testing. Normal walking consists of 60% of the time standing on one foot (stance phase) and 40% with the foot in the air (swing phase). It is common for children with hemiplegia to have asymmetrical stance between right and left legs.
The stance phase begins when the foot makes contact with the ground (initial contact) and ends when the foot leaves the ground (toe-off). The swing phase begins with toe-off and ends at initial contact. These gait events (initial contact and toe-off) are determined from freeze frame videotape for children as they walk in the laboratory. Noraxon software calculates these times and determines the percentage for right and left leg.
Gait symmetry will be assessed as the difference in the percentages of the stance phase for each subject.</description>

    <measure>Aim 3 - Improve balance, as measured by the Balance Subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT2).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To Determine if the GMES program will improve balance skills based on the Balance Subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT2). Balance will be measured on the unaffected and on the hemiplegic side using the Balance Subtest of the BOT2. This test assesses 9 balance areas:
Standing with feet apart on a line - eyes open,
Walking forward on a line,
Standing on one leg on a line - eyes open,
Standing with feet apart on a line - eyes closed,
Walking forward heel-to-toe on a line,
Standing on one leg on a line - eyes closed,
Standing on one leg on a balance beam - eyes open,
Standing heel-to-toe on a balance beam,
Standing on one leg on a balance beam - eyes closed. These balance activities are designed to become more difficult as they progress. They are scored based on how many seconds the subject can balance, or how many steps the subject takes on the balance beam. The total raw score will be reported.</description>
