    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare pulpal anesthesia and cardiovascular
      parameters obtained with 0.6 ml of 4% articaine with epinephrine (1:100.000) for anterior and
      middle superior alveolar nerve (AMSA) block performed by standard and computer-controlled
      delivery for maxillary teeth extraction.
