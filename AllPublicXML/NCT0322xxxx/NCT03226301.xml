  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current trial is to evaluate if combination treatment with venetoclax +
      ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RR CLL) can
      lead to MRD negativity, which may induce long lasting remissions for MRD-negative patients
      randomized to stopping treatment after 15 induction cycles.
