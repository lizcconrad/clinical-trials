    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) affects aged above 45 years. RF has been used for several painful
      conditions. There have been a few attempts to use RF current for the treatment of painful
      conditions of joints of the extremities. It was also used for the treatment of painful
      conditions of the hip joint.

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is commonest chronic arthritis affecting patients usually aged above 45
      years. OA decreased health-related quality of life and increased economic costs.
      Radiofrequency (RF), was used for the treatment of chronic pain unresponsive to conservative
      therapies. RF has been used for several painful conditions. There have been a few attempts to
      use RF current for the treatment of painful conditions of joints of the extremities. It was
      also used for the treatment of painful conditions of the hip joint.
