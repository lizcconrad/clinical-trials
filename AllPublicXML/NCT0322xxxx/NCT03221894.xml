  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, herbal therapy as a complementary therapy is very popular. Should conventional
      therapy (such as donepezil and memantine) combined with herbal therapy make add-on benefit?
      Cognition, activities of daily living and behavioral symptoms will be assessed. Data will be
      collected from the medical records of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in memory
      clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional therapy (CT), such as donepezil and memantine are well- known short-term
      treatments for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The efficacy of them, however, drops
      below baseline level after 9 months. Should Chinese herbal medicine make add-on benefit? The
      GRAPE formula was designed by Prof. J Tian, a prepared granules of Chinese herbs, according
      to Qifuyin in Jing Yue Quan Shu (published in A.D. 1624). Patients treated with CT+herbal
      therapy or CT alone for up to and over 12 months are collected. Cognition, activities of
      daily living and behavioral symptoms are selected as outcomes for assessing the
      effectiveness.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Change of global cognition was measured by MMSE, a 30-point scale, higher score indicates better cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Both basic ADLs (6-items) and instrumental ADLs (8-items) were measured. The ADLs contain 14 items (score 1-4), the range is 14 to 56, and higher scores indicate worse function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR is a 5-point scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias. 0 = Normal, 0.5 = Very Mild Dementia, 1 = Mild Dementia, 2 = Moderate Dementia, 3 = Severe Dementia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months, repeated measurement every 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>NPI was used for rating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including 12-items, with a score rang from 0-144, higher score indicates worse state.</description>

    <description>In conventional therapy group, donepezil was the commonly used ChEI(cholinesterase inhibitor) to treat mild to severe AD patients. Memantine, a NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate ) antagonist, was given to moderate and severe AD patients. The dose of donepezil ranged from 5 to 10 mg once a day according to patients.</description>

        AD patients involved in this retrospective, observational study will be selected from the
        clinic registration system of memory clinics in Beijing. All the participants underwent
        routine clinical assessments, including detailed medical history, cognitive and
        neuropsychological tests, neurological examinations, laboratory tests (i.e. thyroid
        function, folic acid levels, vitamin B12 levels, and routine blood tests), and
        neuroimaging. Participants with detailed medical history will be sampled and grouped into
        two cohorts according the therapies received.
