    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study aimed to answer a clinical question whether In a patient with
      bilateral distal extension area, would the metal framework partial denture with OT vertical
      attachment versus partial denture with OT CAP attachment result in better patient
      satisfaction?

    <description>The attachment consists of a male part that is in the form of a steady with a central hole. This part is attached to the abutments .the female component is a white standard retentive clip engaging the outer walls of a steady male. It is incorporated in the partial denture together with a castable balancing pin that fits into the central hole of the steady male and aids in centering the prosthesis during the final stage of insertion; thereby ensuring a longer life to the retentive clips.</description>
