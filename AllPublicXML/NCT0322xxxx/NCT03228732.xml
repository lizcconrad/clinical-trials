  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      (1) To determine how the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (Prozac),
      an antidepressant often used to treat depression, stimulates the participant's body's ability
      to defend against low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). (2) To learn how a hormone,
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), stimulates the participant's body's ability to defend itself
      from low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). DHEA is a hormone produced naturally in the human body.
      However, it can be manufactured and is sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. The
      dose the investigators are giving in this study is higher than the usual recommended dosage
      taken as a supplement for certain medical conditions. (3) To study combined effects of
      fluoxetine and DHEA during low blood glucose. In the present study, the investigators will
      measure the participant's body's responses to hypoglycemia when given fluoxetine or DHEA or
      fluoxetine and DHEA or a placebo (a pill with no fluoxetine or DHEA). Approximately 64
      individuals with type 1 diabetes will take part in this study.
