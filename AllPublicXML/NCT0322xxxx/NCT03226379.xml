  <brief_summary>

      The DREAMM project is investigating whether point of care tests within a diagnostic and
      treatment algorithm together with support and additional training of laboratory and clinical
      staff will reduce two and ten week all-cause mortality of HIV-associated meningo-encephalitis
      in LMICs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection causes significant mortality and places
      a high burden on limited health care resources in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Cohort and
      autopsy studies estimate that CNS infections cause up to 25% of HIV-related deaths.

      Cryptococcal meningitis alone is estimated to account for up to 20% of HIV-related mortality
      and its' incidence in Africa, unlike in resource-rich settings, has remained high despite
      antiretroviral roll out.

      In African low and middle income countries (LMICs) mortality associated with cryptococcal
      meningitis has been estimated at 70% at 3 months.

      Tuberculous meningitis mortality also remains unacceptably high and is reported at over 70%
      in a study from Cameroon. Delays in diagnosis are key causes of poor patient outcomes for
      tuberculous and bacterial meningitis, and cryptococcal meningitis where patients present late
      and with advanced disease.

      The aim of the DREAMM study is to drive down this unacceptably high mortality associated with
      HIV-associated meningo-encephalitis in LMICs.

      A further aim is to provide capacity building in implementation research at each of the sites
      driven by the local African Principal Investigators (PIs) (Dr Cecilia Kanyama, Lilongwe,
      Malawi; Dr Charles Kouanfack, Yaounde, Cameroon; Dr Sayoki Mfinanga, NIMR, Dar Es Salaam
      Tanzania).

      The project is in three phases:

        1. Audit local clinical and laboratory procedures and practices and availability of
           essential drugs and diagnostic tests for routine care of HIV-associated
           meningo-encephalitis patients in three study sites. 75 patients in total will be
           recruited into the audit phase of DREAMM-25 patients from each study site.

        2. Laboratory (led by Institut Pasteur) and clinical training program on HIV-associated
           meningitis in LMICs. Key clinical and laboratory personnel will be trained on the latest
           point of care diagnostic tests and safe administration of essential medicines for
           HIV-associated meningo-encephalitis such as amphotericin B deoxycholate. They will
           disseminate this knowledge to their hospital counterparts.

        3. Implementation of algorithmic approach to diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated
           meningitis with aggressive cryptococcal (urine, blood and CSF) and tuberculous (urine &amp;
           CSF detection) microbiological detection in the three study sites. The aim is to reduce
           the time from patient presentation to diagnostic testing and administration of
           effective, microbiologically-driven treatment. Data from audit and algorithmic phases of
           study will be fed back to local ministries of health (MOH), and access to essential
           antifungal drugs and diagnostic tests for HIV-associated meningitis improved and
           finally, cohesive HIV-related meningitis guidelines for African LMICs developed.

      Important sub-studies include a health economics evaluation study to determine the cost of
      the intervention and routine care costs. A new semi-quantitative cryptococcal antigen lateral
      flow assay (CrAg LFA) (CryptoPS, Biosynex, Strasburg, France) will be evaluated uniquely for
      the diagnosis of patients with meningo-encephalitis. New, point of care (POC) polyvalent
      tests (CrAg/HIV) and (CrAg/Streptococcus pneumoniae) will also be evaluated. Lastly, nanopore
      technology (MinION, Oxford Nanopore Technology, Oxford, UK) will be optimised for the
      diagnosis of HIV-associated meningo-encephalitis in African low and middle income countries
      (LMICs).

      These point of care tests nested within algorithms and the new tests being evaluated have the
      potential to significantly reduce CNS infection-related mortality by reducing delays in
      proven diagnosis and initiation of effective treatments.
