  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal polyposis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nose and sinuses. GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) is embarking on a clinical program to assess treatment of severe, recurrent nasal
      polyps with an anti-interleukin-5 (anti-IL5) (mepolizumab). Subject specific symptomatic
      endpoints will form the basis for the assessment of treatment benefit of nasal polyp
      therapies. However, there is a lack of published qualitative data regarding nasal polyps to
      understand the symptoms or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impacts. This
      cross-sectional qualitative study aims to address this unmet gap by conducting
      semi-structured combined concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive debriefing (CD) telephone
      interviews and real-time data capture. The combined CE and CD interviews (each 90 minutes in
      duration) will investigate the subject experience of nasal polyps, and the relevance and
      understanding of existing patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments and the real-time data
      capture, over a 10 day period, will investigate the subject experience of the symptoms, HRQoL
      impacts and treatment of nasal polyps and any day-to-day variability that exists in these
      experiences in 'real time'. Twenty adult subjects in the United States (US), and 10 adult
      subjects in Germany with severe, recurrent nasal polyps will participate in the CE and CD
      interviews section of the study and of these, 10 subjects from US will also complete
      real-time data capture app task.

    <measure>Generation of subject feedback regarding the adequacy of Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) tool</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>SNOT-22 is a tool to measure HRQoL associated with rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. It contains 22 nose, sinus, and general HRQoL items and subjects will be required to score the experience on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (No problem) to 5 (Problem as bad as it can be) and identify the five most important items affecting their health. Subjects will be asked to complete the SNOT-22 questionnaire during CD interview using a 'think aloud' process to collect subject feedback regarding the adequacy of SNOT-22.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generation of subject feedback regarding the adequacy of GSK visual analogue scales (VAS) tool assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>VAS questionnaire is a tool in which subjects are asked to evaluate overall symptom severity, or the severity of individual symptoms of nasal polyps along a continuum, typically of 10 centimeter (cm) or 100 millimeter (mm) whereby 0 represents 'no symptom' and '10 or 100 represents 'as bad as you can imagine', Scores of 0-3 (or 0-30) are defined as mild disease, &gt;3-7 (or &gt;30-70) as moderate disease and &gt;7-10 (or &gt;70-100) as severe disease. Subjects will be asked to complete the VAS questionnaire during CD interview using a 'think aloud' process to collect subject feedback regarding the adequacy of VAS.</description>

    <measure>Identification of important concepts related to nasal polyps though CE interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>During CE interviews the main areas of exploration will be the symptoms with particular attention paid to the frequency, severity, duration and bother of each symptom, surgical decision-making and surgical/treatment experience and the functional and HRQoL impact experienced by subjects.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the existing PRO instruments via questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete the PRO instruments including VAS and SNOT-22 questionnaire during CD interviews and the content and face-validity of these instruments will be tested.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of 'real time' experience of nasal-polyps by using real time data capture app</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who are taking part in the real-time data capture exercise will be required to participate over the course of 10 days. During this time a series of approximately 10 questions/tasks will be fielded to subjects via the application to explore the experience of the symptoms, HRQoL impacts and treatment of nasal polyps and any day-to-day variability that exists these experiences in 'real time'.</description>
