  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the harms of screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      test outweigh the benefits, 560,000 Ontario men undergo PSA screening each year. Guideline
      developers, such as the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), have
      disseminated patient educational materials (PEMs) on PSA screening widely in Ontario, yet men
      remain confused about screening harms and benefits. One potential contributing factor may be
      that PEMs are typically developed by researchers and clinicians and may not address patient
      barriers to change. The investigators will assess whether a PSA screening PEM that is
      co-created with patients provides added value over PEMs developed using the traditional
      approach (i.e., researchers and clinicians develop a PEM with patient involvement in
      usability testing only. The investigators will also assess satisfaction with the engagement
      process and calculate the costs and resources required for each method (i.e. co-creation,
      usability, and recommendations only). This study will generate a PSA screening PEM to help
      patients make evidence-based screening decisions. It will also help Ontario organizations,
      including Cancer Care Ontario, identify optimal methods for developing PEMs for PSA screening
      and other areas of preventive health care, such as breast and colorectal cancer screening.
