      This is a multi-center, open-label trial of Elbasvir/ Grazoprevir 50/100 mg fixed dose
      combination 12 week treatment aimed to evaluate SVR12 in treatment naïve patients with
      chronic hepatitis C (genotype 1b) infection, associated with of metabolic syndrome. The study
      to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices.

      A total of 60 subjects will be studied at 2 sites in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      Males and Females treatment naïve patients with CHC genotype 1b infection associated with
      metabolic syndrome (MS), 18-70 years of age, with or without severe fibrosis / compensated
      cirrhosis will be enrolled. SVR 12 (primary endpoint) will be evaluated. Patients will be
      stratified by fibrosis stage and presence of metabolic syndrome components. Interim Analysis
      will be performed in order to estimate viral kinetics, applicability of SVR4 and durability
      of SVR12 by evaluation of virologic response at week 4 and 8 of treatment and follow-up at
      week 4 (SVR 4) and 24 will be performed - this will be a descriptive summary only without
      hypothesis testing.

      The main hypothesis is that 12-week therapy with MK-5172 in combination with MK-8742 for
      treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1b with metabolic syndrome is not notably worse
      than the same course for treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1b without metabolic
      syndrome.

      60 treatment-naïve subjects with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b infection associated with
      metabolic syndrome (MS), with or without severe fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis will be
      enrolled, males and females of 18-70 years of age.

      Subjects will fulfill the following study visits: Day 1 (screening), Day 7, Week 2, Week 4,
      Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 36.

      Eligibility criteria re-checked, informed consent signed and medical history will be gathered
      on Day 1.

      Treatment allocation and review study medication diary will be made on Day 7. Physical
      Examinations will be fulfilled on Day 1, Day 7, Week 4 and Week 12. Subject Confirmation of
      Birth Control and Review (Serious) Adverse Events will be made on every visit of subject.

      Laboratory evaluations will include common blood analysis, urinalysis, biochemical blood
      analysis, Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and Т4 free, antigen testings (aHBs, HBsAg,
      HbeAg, aHDV, aHAV, aHEV, ANA, AMA, aHIV), HCV RNA (quantitative), HCV genotyping, Urine
      Pregnancy Test (females of child bearing potential only), Transient elastography, Calculation
      of APRI, Ultrasonography (of liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas), Upper GI Endoscopy.

      Patients will be stratified by fibrosis stage and presence of metabolic syndrome components.
      Interim Analysis will be performed in order to estimate viral kinetics, applicability of SVR4
      and durability of SVR12 by evaluation of virologic response at week 4 and 8 of treatment and
      follow-up at week 4 (SVR 4) and 24 will be performed - this will be a descriptive summary
      only without hypothesis testing.

           assessed by the proportion of subjects achieving SVR12, defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ
           (either TD[u] or TND) 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy.

        -  To evaluate efficacy of MK-5172 in combination with MK-8742 in treatment naïve patients

           subjects achieving undetectable (TND) HCV RNA and HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at Week 2, 4, 8 and
           Follow-Up Week 4 (SVR 4).

        -  To evaluate efficacy of 12 weeks therapy with MK-5172 in combination with MK-8742 in

           the end of all study therapy.

        -  To evaluate safety profile / adverse events of 12 weeks therapy with MK-5172 in
           combination with MK-8742 in treatment naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C (genotype
           1b) with metabolic syndrome
