      To study the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in HIV-infected adults who had
      previously received rabies booster vaccination more than a year before

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous study has shown the higher immunogenicity response among HIV-infected adults who
      received a single visit 4-site intradermal rabies booster vaccination than those who received
      the conventional intramuscular regimen. The investigators follow the persistence of these
      effects. Also, the regulatory T cell levels were examined after the rabies booster
      vaccination .

    <intervention_model_description>The volunteers who participated in the previous clinical trials were invited to join this study.
