      TSetting was selected by randomization (by lottery method) first selected two rooms from
      General Pediatric Wards were coded as E1 (Experimental 1) and E2 (Experimental 2) whereas
      next two were coded as C1 (Comparison 1) and C2 (Comparison 2).

      From the selected settings 60 subjects (30 in experimental and 30 in Comparison) were
      selected by purposive sampling technique. Assessment of anxiety (Pre-test) of the
      hospitalized children admitted in Aashirwad Hospital was done in experimental group and
      Comparison group on 1st day. In Experimental group after taking pretest play interventions
      were introduced to the children and instructions regarding the way to play with all the
      interventions were provided to the children. Though all the children were free to choose the
      play yet the younger children were given simple and easy play interventions such as drawing,
      coloring etc. to obtain more sensory experience whereas the older children were offered play
      interventions such as puzzle, building blocks, ludo etc. with high cognitive demand. The play
      interventions were administered for 1 hour daily from day 1 to day 5 whereas in Comparison
      group all the subjects were given usual general nursing and medical care for continuous 5
      days. No intervention was administered to the comparison group. Posttest anxiety was assessed
      on 5th day.

      Intervention to the control group was given after the accomplishment of Post test for ethical
      consideration.
