    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Immuncell-LC, the adoptive
      immuntherapeutic agent composed of a CIK cell agent, to treat patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer, which are refractory to the 3rd-line chemotherapeutic agents.

      All enrolled patients received the 12 times of Immuncell-LC therapy: 8 times in every 1 week
      and 4 times in every 2 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Stage IV colorectal cancer(CRC) has poor survival rate in spite of the development of
      chemotherapeutic agents. It is regarded as a standard palliative chemotherapy using with both
      targeted agents and cytototic chemotherpeutic agents. However, it is still demanding to treat
      stage IV CRC patients, who are refractory responses in these chemotherapeutics. In addition,
      patients were suffered from the various adverse events by the repetive cytotoxic
      chemotherapies.

    <description>Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, which is refractory to the 3rd-line chemotherapy are enrolled in this study. Enrolled patients receive a total of 12 times of Immuncell-LC therapy: 8 times in every 1 week and the next 4 times in every 2 weeks. The treatment responses of immuncell-LC are evaluated by radiologic findings (Abdomin-pelvic CT and Chest CT), immune-markers and a selorogic tumor marker (Carcinoembryologic antigen (CEA)) at the 8th week and 17th week. The safety of Immuncell-LC is evaluated by the results of serologic tests, vital signs, ECOG-PS and adverse events. The follow-up period is the 1 year after the enrolled date.</description>
