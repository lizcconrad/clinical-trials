    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction
      and polycystic ovaries. Insulin resistance (IR) is a common feature of PCOS, and the
      resultant hyperinsulinemia is theorized to promote hyperandrogenism in the disorder. However,
      30-50% of women with PCOS who are lean do not have insulin resistance. Women with PCOS also
      exhibit chronic low-grade inflammation. In PCOS, glucose ingestion activates nuclear factor
      ĸB (NFĸB), the cardinal signal of inflammation culminating in upregulation of the
      inflammation pathway within mononuclear cells (MNC). This phenomenon is independent of excess
      adiposity and is highly correlated with circulating androgens. In addition, in vitro exposure
      to proinflammatory stimuli is capable of directly stimulating ovarian theca cell androgen
      production. Nonacetylated salicylates suppress NFĸB activation and are well tolerated in
      humans.

      The proposed research is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 90 women with
      PCOS. Forty-five subjects with PCOS (15 lean without IR), 15 lean with IR and 15 obese)
      receiving salsalate, a nonacetylated salicylate, at an oral dose of 3-4 gm daily for 12 weeks
      will be compared with 45 age- and body-composition-matched control women with PCOS receiving
      placebo. The overarching hypothesis is that inflammation contributes to ovarian dysfunction,
      independent of excess adiposity or IR.

      The specific aims are, I: To examine the effect of salsalate administration on the ovarian
      capacity to secrete androgen and on insulin sensitivity in PCOS. II: To examine the effect of
      salsalate administration on the inflammatory response of mononuclear cells induced by lipid
      ingestion and glucose infusion in PCOS. The approach involves evaluation of ovarian androgen
      secretion in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration and insulin
      sensitivity during the euglycemic phase of a two-step pancreatic clamp along with ovulation
      monitoring before and after salsalate administration. The inflammatory response of MNC to
      lipid ingestion and the hyperglycemic phase of the two-step clamp will also be evaluated
      during treatment by measuring reactive oxygen species, the mRNA and protein content of
      inflammation markers, NFĸB activation and cytokine release in culture.

      The investigators expect that women with PCOS receiving salsalate will exhibit decreased
      ovarian androgen secretion and reduced inflammation regardless of adiposity or IR status.
      These results will be significant if they show a causal contribution of inflammation to
      ovarian dysfunction in PCOS, thus improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of PCOS,
      opening previously unexplored therapeutic avenues that are not necessarily dependent on
      improving IR, and guiding the design of future studies aimed at determining what
      interventions will optimally attenuate inflammation in PCOS to reduce medical disease and
      enhance fertility.

      PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction and polycystic ovarian
      morphology. Obesity and IR are common features of PCOS. Under the current model of
      pathophysiology of PCOS, the compensatory hyperinsulinemia of IR is the primary driver of
      hyperandrogenism. This concept was born from the cross-sectional observation that insulin is
      positively correlated with androgens in obese women with PCOS, and is supported by reports of
      increased androgen production from theca cells obtained from obese women with PCOS following
      insulin exposure in vitro4 and increases in circulating androgens in women with PCOS
      following insulin infusion in vivo. However, these in vitro - in vivo responses were elicited
      with supraphysiological insulin concentrations. Physiological insulin infusion on the other
      hand does not augment androgen levels in PCOS. The current model also does not explain the
      cause of hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction in the 30-50% of women with PCOS who are
      lean and lack IR. Thus, some other factor contributes to these abnormalities in PCOS.

      The investigators have shown that ingestion of glucose and saturated fat elicits an
      inflammatory response from circulating MNC in lean women with PCOS who lack excess abdominal
      adiposity. The hallmark of this response is increased activation of NFĸB, the cardinal signal
      of inflammation. These findings illustrate the separate and discrete role of MNC in
      manifesting inflammation in PCOS and that MNC are an excellent model to assess systemic
      inflammation in PCOS.

      The investigators have also shown that in PCOS, there is a link between molecular markers of
      inflammation from MNC and circulating androgens. Chronic suppression of ovarian androgen
      production does not ameliorate inflammation in lean women with PCOS. However, in vitro
      exposure of ovarian theca cells to proinflammatory stimuli upregulates CYP17, the androgen
      producing enzyme and increases testosterone.

      Salsalate is an inexpensive, safe, well-tolerated, well-understood anti-inflammatory agent
      that inhibits NFĸB activation when used at higher doses. The salsalate dose required to
      achieve a salicylate level in the upper therapeutic range is dependent on body mass. This is
      achieved in lean individuals using 3.0 gm/day as the maximum dose recommended in the
      salsalate package insert. Individuals across the obese range (30-40 kg/m2) require &gt;3.0
      gm/day to achieve the same objective. Salsalate and other salicylates have also been shown to
      decrease IR. However, the ability of salsalate to decrease IR would not be necessary if the
      beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of salsalate to reduce hyperandrogenism is on the
      ovaries. In fact, we have shown that in lean insulin-sensitive women with PCOS, salsalate
      reduces HCG-stimulated ovarian androgen secretion by 44% and normalizes basal testosterone
      levels. Studies performed by the investigators in MNC also confirm the ability of salsalate
      to suppress NFĸB activation. Together these observations validate the use of these
      measurements as endpoints to assess the effects of salsalate to probe the pathophysiology of
      PCOS.

      The glucose (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic) clamp is the gold standard to assess insulin
      sensitivity. However, salsalate raises circulating insulin due to its ability to decreased
      insulin clearance from the liver which confounds the assessment of insulin sensitivity from
      post-treatment clamp studies. The salsalate-induced increase in circulating insulin also
      lowers circulating glucose, a known proinflammatory trigger, thus confounding the ability to
      demonstrate the direct anti-inflammatory action of salsalate to inhibit NFĸB activation.
      Performance of a two-step pancreatic clamp eliminates these confounding factors. With this
      approach, pre- and post-treatment insulin levels can be matched in the first step of the
      clamp to accurately assess insulin sensitivity (euglycemic phase - 90 mg/dl) by infusing
      somatostatin to inhibit endogenous insulin secretion with simultaneous replacement infusion
      of lean body mass-based insulin. A subsequent constant physiological hyperglycemic infusion
      during the second step (hyperglycemic phase - 130 mg/dl) before and after salsalate treatment
      can serve as a proinflammatory trigger to accurately assess changes in NFĸB activation.

      In this context, the rationale for the proposed study revolves around the concept that in
      PCOS, inflammation contributes to ovarian dysfunction independent of excess adiposity or IR,
      and may also improve insulin sensitivity when IR is present. The investigators will undertake
      a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the link between
      inflammation and ovarian androgen secretion in PCOS unrelated to IR. If this study of
      pathophysiology demonstrates beneficial effects, this will pave the way for developing novel
      therapies for ovarian dysfunction in PCOS.

      The main objective of this proposal is to evaluate the ability of salsalate to reduce ovarian
      androgen secretion, induce ovulation and decrease lipid- and glucose-stimulated inflammation
      independent of body composition and IR in women with PCOS; and to also improve insulin
      sensitivity in IR women with PCOS. Effects of salsalate will be assessed based on the
      following aims:

      Specific Aim 1. To examine the effects of salsalate administration on the ovarian capacity to
      secrete androgens, menstrual function, and insulin sensitivity in PCOS.

      The hypothesis for this aim is that salsalate treatment will decrease HCG-stimulated ovarian
      androgen secretion and induce ovulation in women with PCOS regardless of body composition or
      IR status; and may also improve insulin sensitivity in IR women with PCOS. The investigators
      will test this hypothesis in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. The ovarian
      androgen response to HCG administration will be evaluated in women with PCOS (15 lean with
      IR, 15 lean without IR and 15 obese) before and after administration of a therapeutic
      salsalate dose for ~12 weeks compared with women with PCOS receiving placebo for ~12 weeks
      (15 lean with IR, 15 lean without IR and 15 obese). Ovulation monitoring and assessment of
      insulin sensitivity during the euglycemic phase of the clamp will be performed before and
      after salsalate or placebo administration. It is anticipated that salsalate will reduce
      HCG-stimulated ovarian androgen secretion, induce ovulation regardless of body composition or
      IR status when compared with placebo. It is also anticipated that salsalate will increase
      insulin sensitivity in IR women with PCOS compared with placebo.

      Specific Aim 2. To examine the effect of salsalate administration on the inflammatory
      response of mononuclear cells induced by lipid ingestion and glucose infusion in PCOS.

      The hypothesis for this aim is that salsalate administration will down-regulate inflammatory
      signal transduction and cytokine production within MNC following lipid ingestion and glucose
      infusion in women with PCOS regardless of body composition or IR status. The investigators
      will test this hypothesis using the study design described in Aim 1. The inflammatory
      response of MNC to a cream challenge test and to the hyperglycemic phase of the clamp will be
      evaluated in women with PCOS before and after salsalate treatment. It is anticipated that
      lipid- and glucose-induced inflammation will decrease with salsalate use regardless of body
      composition or IR status when compared with placebo.
