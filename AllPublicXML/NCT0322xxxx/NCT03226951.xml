  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is to determine if SDM laser can reduce macular thickness in non central CSME and stop the
      progression of non central CSME to central CSME in compare to glycemic control
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      interventional randomised masked study will recruit patients have diabetes mellitus with non
      central CSME with good vision into two groups : 1st SDM laser with glycemic control 2nd SHAM
      laser with Glycemic control where BCVA will be recorded every month starting from baseline to
      24 weeks where OCT will be recorded every 8 weeks from baseline to 24 weeks

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with central diabetic macular edema Best corrected visual acuity is 20/30 or
             more

          -  Non central Macular thickness more than 250 microns

          -  Patients who are able to come for all follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          -  Myocardial infarction, other acute cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 4
             months prior to randomization

          -  For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 3 years.

          -  Macular edema is present that is considered to be related to ocular surgery such as
             cataract extraction

          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more

          -  History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, scleral buckle, any intraocular
             surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or anticipated within the next 6 months following
             randomization.

          -  Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis,
             chalazion, or substantial blepharitis
