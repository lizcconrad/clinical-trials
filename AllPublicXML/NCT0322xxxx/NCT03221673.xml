  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study aiming to identify how daily activities affect children's
      body fitness and general health. Also, the study will address how specific behaviors (such as
      diet and sleep) as well as neighborhood and home environment affect children's metabolic
      health and fitness level.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how daily activities, home, neighborhood and school
      environments affect Arkansas children's health. Children from Central Arkansas ages 7-10
      years will be recruited to participate in a variety of physical activity tests including
      strength, flexibility, balance and endurance. During these tests, participants will perform
      tasks such as cycling on a stationary bike and extending and flexing their knees on a special
      type of chair. Body composition will be measured and blood, saliva, urine and stool samples
      collected. Participants and parents will be asked to complete questionnaires on physical
      activity, home and neighborhood environment as well as sleeping habits. Finally, participants
      will wear an accelerometer based monitor that will track their physical activity and sleeping
      patterns. One in person visit will take place at Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center (Little
      Rock, AR) and will last around six hours. Reimbursement will be provided.

    <description>A fitness test will be performed to determine peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak, ml/kg per min). Correlations between peak VO2 and different markers of cardiometabolic health (IL-6, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, insulin concentrations, etc.) will be determined. Other indicators of fitness level such as strength, flexibility and balance will be measured and correlations assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>June 2016-August 2018</time_frame>
    <description>Home and neighborhood environments will be assessed via interviewer administered questionnaires. Scores obtained from these questionnaires will be correlated with peak oxygen consumption, strength, flexibility and balance scores.</description>
