  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ablation of atrial fibrillation (FA) by disconnection of pulmonary veins is a burgeoning
      intervention. It allows a long-term treatment of this arrhythmia with a success rate of about
      80%. There are, nevertheless, some recidivism.

      Risk factors for recidivism are poorly codified and need further research. Indeed the
      identification of factors of poor prognosis could lead to not propose this procedure to the
      patients who present them and at least to inform them of an increased risk of failure.

      To date, aortic stiffness has not been studied in the context of assessing the risk factors
      for FA recurrence after ablation. On a physiopathological level, the aortic stiffness leads
      to increase left ventricle's post-load. Cardiac remodeling was observed with diastolic
      dysfunction and increased left atrial size. That may constitute a substrate for FA
      recurrence.

      In the literature, aortic stiffness can be measured in several ways:

        1. Measurement of systolo-diastolic variation of the inner diameter of the aorta by scanner
           or transesophageal Echography (ETO).

        2. Measuring of the Pulse Wave Velocity.

        3. Measurement of aortic calcifications.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the impact of aortic stiffness on the recidivism of FA
      6 months after ablation procedure performed in the Croix-Rousse cardiology's department.
