      Phase 2 study, looking at the prophylactic efficacy, safety and tolerability to a repeated
      nasal dose of study drug after being infected with Influenza A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) virus.

    <textblock>
      Screening took place up to 90 days before quarantine. Volunteers completed an informed
      consent and underwent screening assessments to determine their eligibility.

      There were 2 study groups:

      Cohort A: (Sentinel): determined the Challenge Virus infection rate after inoculation with
      Influenza Virus on Day 0. There was 12 subjects (open label, no randomisation) invited to
      attend Quarantine on Day -2 or -1.

      Cohort B: Examined the prophylactic efficacy, safety and tolerability of PrEP-001 compared to
      placebo (randomised 1:1). Subjects attended on Day -4/-3, dosed with PrEP-001 or Placebo on
      Day -2 AND Day-1 and then challenged with virus (volume confirmed from Cohort A) on Day 0.

      Volunteers remained in quarantine unit for 8 days after inoculation.

      At day 28, end of study visit, volunteers seen and assessed by a study physician for
      well-being, on-going symptoms and adverse events.
