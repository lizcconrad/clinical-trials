  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, PLD, an anthracycline encapsulated in stealth liposomes, which are believed to
      efficiently deliver the doxorubicin within the tumour mass with less toxicity compared with
      standard doxorubicin formulation was used. The study aimed to determine whether the
      combination of PLD-docetaxel would increase tumour response in patients with breast cancer.
