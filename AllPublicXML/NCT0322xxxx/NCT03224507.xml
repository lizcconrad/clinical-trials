  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell disorder, is the second most common hematologic
      malignancy in the U.S. No standard curative therapy has yet been found. A variety of
      therapeutic measures including high dose melphalan, induction therapy, and continuous therapy
      have been used but the goal of complete response without relapse has not been achieved. More
      active treatment regimens and better tools for response assessment are needed.

      This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of an induction therapy using the combination
      of dexamethasone, lenalidomide (revlimid), daratumumab (Darzalex) and carfilzomib (Kyprolis)
      to treat patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The therapy with KRdD (Kyprolis,
      Revlimid, dexamethasone, Darzalex) will be followed by autologous hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (auto-HCT) and KRdD consolidation. Duration of therapy will be guided by
      eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD). The hypothesis is that the KRdD therapy
      particularly in combination with the auto-HCT will be safe and lead to deep remission.
      Patients who become MRD- will discontinue therapy (no maintenance therapy) and be actively
      monitored for resurgence of MRD or clinical relapse.

    <intervention_model_description>The study has four cycles (28-days each) of drug therapy prior to being evaluated for auto-HCT. After the completion of induction therapy, the patient will be evaluated for a transplant of their own hematopoietic stem cells. If, after the transplant, the patient still has detectable multiple myeloma, the patient will proceed to a series of consolidation blocks, up to three, consisting of four cycles of the KRdD at specified dosages and time frames. After completion of consolidation therapy, maintenance therapy will begin until disease progression or intolerance.</intervention_model_description>
