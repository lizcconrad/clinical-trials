      Background:

      Some women with breast cancer and ovarian cancer are genetically predisposed to them. This is
      called hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The women have to make hard choices about
      tests and treatment. Researchers want to study the best way to guide them. A kind of writing
      exercise might help if it is done before genetic counseling. It is called a self-affirmation
      (SA) exercise. It may lead to better communication in the counseling and better behavioral
      outcomes.

      Objective:

      To test if an SA exercise done with HBOC genetic counseling could improve client
      communication and behavior.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-90 with an appointment at the HBOC clinic at St. Luke s Health System

      Adults ages 18-90 who are genetic counselors with breast and ovarian cancer clients

      Design:

      Appointment participants will be screened by phone.

      They will arrive 15 minutes early to their appointment.

      They will do a 10- to 15-minute survey and writing exercise. This includes questions about:

      If they have cancer

      If they have had or were offered genetic counseling

      Things that are important to them

      After the appointment, they will take a 10- to 15-minute follow-up survey. It can be in the
      office or online. It includes questions about how they felt about the writing exercise and
      their counseling.

      Counselor participants will take a 2- to 5-minute survey after sessions with clients in the
      study. This includes questions about how the client was in the session. They will take a 10-
      to 15-minute survey at the end of the study. It will be about their opinions of the writing
      exercise.

      The proposed study is a feasibility study to assess the viability of implementing a
      Self-Affirmation (SA) intervention in a Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) genetic
      counseling clinic to improve client communication and behavioral outcomes. Participants will
      be clients and genetic counselors at the St. Luke s Hospital System HBOC clinic. This study
      seeks to identify outcomes that would be most informative in a large-scale research protocol.
      As outcomes, we will assess clients decision self-efficacy, intention to talk with family,
      genetic test uptake, empowerment, and HBOC knowledge. We will also assess counselors and
      clients perceived benefits, perceived harms, and acceptance of the affirmation intervention.

      In this study clients will be invited to participate in an intervention before their genetic
      counseling appointment. The SA intervention is a short written exercise to reinforce clients
      self-integrity (a global sense of personal adequacy) leading to more openness to threatening
      information within the genetic counseling session. Clients and counselors will be surveyed
      after the study to assess outcome measures and feasibility of the intervention.

      Social science research has shown that when people are faced with threatening information
      they often seek to protect themselves and reject the threatening message. Message rejection
      can include minimizing the importance or discrediting the truth of the message. SA
      interventions aim to bolster self-integrity by focusing on aspects of subject s lives they
      value and thereby improving participants self-perception and tolerance towards threatening
      messages. SA manipulations have been shown to increase patient communication within
      appointments and both intentions and actions toward behavior change.

      Often in cancer genetic counseling appointments clients are confronted with the threat of
      having a significantly increased risk of cancers while being asked to make a decision about
      genetic testing. A self-affirmation intervention may facilitate greater client decision
      self-efficacy, empowerment, and positive behavior outcomes, such as communication with family
      regarding genetic risk and screening behaviors.

They will then be asked to write about the 9th ranked item and why it might be important to someone else. The control condition is consistent with the control used in other SA intervention studies. The 9th ranked item is chosen to inhibit a reverse effect, where participants feel affirmed because they do not value something that is averse to them.</description>
