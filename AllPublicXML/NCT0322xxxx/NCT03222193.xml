  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Tongue Right Positioner (TRP Snorless™) is a medical device designed to restore
      physiological tongue positions when functioning or at rest and increase tongue muscles tone.
      Patient wears TRP Snorless™ daily at least 5 hours during night. Published data suggested
      that TRP Snorless™ increases oropharynx diameter and nasal patency, favouring airflow in
      upper airways. Independently of patient's adherence to daily myofascial exercises, the TRP
      Snorless™ treatment should increase tongue muscles' tone and decrease the risk of snoring
      during sleep.
