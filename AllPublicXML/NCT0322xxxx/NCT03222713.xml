  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Health and Education Ministries of Brazil launched the Health in School Program - PSE -
      in 2007. The purpose of the PSE is twofold: articulate the actions of the education and
      health systems to identify risk factors and prevent them; and promote the education for
      health in the public elementary school system. In the health field, the self-regulation (SR)
      construct can contribute to the understanding of life habits which can affect the improvement
      of individuals' health. This study aims to present a school-based program, Promotion of
      Self-Regulation in Health (SRH), which adds the self-regulation approach to the topics of
      healthy eating and oral health of the PSE for elementary school. A study of a randomized
      clinical trial enrolling the 5th grade students of public elementary schools from the south
      of Brazil is presented. The study has two phases. In Phase 1, teachers and health
      professionals will participate in a training program on SRH, and in Phase 2, they will
      conduct an intervention in class: Promotion of SRH. The participants were randomly assigned
      into three groups: Condition I followed the PSE program, Condition II group followed the PSE
      and the SRH program, and the control group did not enroll in either of the health promotion
      programs. For the evaluation of the study, the following measures and instruments were
      applied: Body Mass Index (BMI), Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), Previous Day Food
      Questionnaire (PFDQ), Declarative Knowledge for Health Instrument, Food Preference
      Instrument, Student´s Attitudes and Perceptions and Parents Perceptions and Influences on the
      Health Instrument, Food Availability and Oral Health Instrument, Self-Regulation for Health
      Scale, Self-Efficacy for Health Scale. Students in the three groups will be assessed five
      times throughout the year: before the beginning of the intervention program, three months
      into intervention, six months into intervention, at the end of the intervention, and,
      finally, six months post intervention to check for the impact of the program on children
      health.
