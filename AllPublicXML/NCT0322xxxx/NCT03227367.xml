  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is an effort to investigate the hypothesis that Platelet Rich
      Fibrin/Biphasic Calcium Phosphate may play a role in inhibiting osteoclasts differentiation
      and in bone loss.

      Study design

      Fifty-five individuals from a suburban population were recruited. Out of them, 5 individuals
      refused to participate in the study. Finally, 50 participants were selected and divided into
      two groups, control group [Healthy individuals]: 25 Males/Females, aged 25 to 35 years and
      test group [Chronic periodontitis patients]: 25 Males/Females aged 30 to 45 years.

      Demographic variables and periodontal parameters were measured in both the groups.The
      investigators explored the effect of Platelet rich fibrin (PRF)/Biphasic calcium phosphate
      (BCP) on differentiation and survival of osteoclasts obtained from peripheral blood of
      Chronic Periodontitis patients.
