  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Cancer and cardiovascular diseases combined account for more than 50% of the
      overall mortality burden in the USA. Accumulating evidence indicates that saturated fat
      intake is related to an increase, while unsaturated fat intake is related to a decrease in
      all-causes mortality. Thus, current US dietary guidelines recommend a shift from saturated to
      unsaturated fat.

      Objective The aim of the present study was to estimate the mortality risk reduction related
      to a dietary change from saturated fat to an equal amount of mono or polyunsaturated fat
      intake.

      Design The American National health and nutrition examination surveys conducted between 1999
      and 2010 were linked to the 2011 national US death registry resulting in an observational
      prospective mortality study. Proportional hazards Cox models were used to evaluate the
      association between saturated, mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fat with all-cause, and
      cause specific mortality. Substitution analysis was conducted to estimate an iso-caloric
      substitution of 10% of the energy from dietary fat intake applied to the substitution of
      saturated fat with an equal amount of energy from mono-unsaturated or poly-unsaturated fat.
