    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore patient, support person, and health care providers' experience and
      satisfaction with social support in the abortion procedure room. Although some providers do
      allow a support person in the abortion procedure room, no study has formally examined the
      effects of this practice.

      If this study demonstrates higher patient satisfaction and lower perceptions of pain and
      anxiety levels in patients who have social support in the in-clinic abortion procedure room,
      this could change standard procedures in the in-clinic abortion procedure room, allowing for
      more positive patient experiences.

    <textblock>
      Having an abortion is a complexly emotional experience for many women. Women with strong
      social support, from a partner, friend or family member, report better psychological
      adjustment [1]. During medication abortion, patients reported high satisfaction levels, in
      part, because of being able to share the experience with another person [2, 3, 4]. During
      in-clinic abortion, patients report lower levels of anxiety when they have a support person
      (partner, spouse, friend or family member) in the post-abortion recovery room. Additionally,
      support persons indicate feeling they can successfully comfort the woman [5]. In the abortion
      procedure room, doula support has a positive psychological impact on patients and decreases
      the need for additional clinic support resources [6]. Because doula support in the abortion
      procedure room and social support in the post-abortion recovery room improves patient
      experience, it is reasonable to believe that having a support person in the procedure room
      may also improve patient experience. However, there are no data about the patient, support
      person, and health care provider's experience and satisfaction with a support person in the
      abortion procedure room.

      This study aims to explore patient, support person, and health care providers' experience and
      satisfaction with social support in the abortion procedure room. Although some providers do
      allow a support person in the abortion procedure room, no study has formally examined the
      effects of this practice.

      If this study demonstrates higher patient satisfaction and lower perceptions of pain and
      anxiety levels in patients who have social support in the in-clinic abortion procedure room,
      this could change standard procedures in the in-clinic abortion procedure room, allowing for
      more positive patient experiences.
