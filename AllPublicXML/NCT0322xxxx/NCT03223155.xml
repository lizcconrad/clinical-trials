      Trial Design

        -  Patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer are randomized to nivolumab/ipilimumab
           plus either sequential or concurrent stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

        -  The primary endpoint is the phase I safety endpoint of SBRT dose for each body site.

        -  The same starting SBRT dose levels are used in each arm. If two or more patients
           experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the starting dose level, then the reduced
           dose level will be used (Section 7.1—Page 72).

        -  DLT is defined as any grade ≥3 toxicity possibly, likely, or definitely related to SBRT
           plus nivolumab/ipilimumab (the combination and not the individual components).

        -  Irradiated metastases will be grouped into one of five locations, which have different
           SBRT doses, and the DLTs will be attributed to the relevant organ system.

        -  The starting and decreased SBRT dose levels are found in Table 2 (Page 20).

        -  SBRT will be delivered in 3-5 fractions over the course of 1-1.5 weeks.

        -  Patients in the sequential arm will begin immunotherapy between 1-7 days after
           completion of SBRT

        -  Given the accrual data for IRB15-1130, the investigators anticipate that approximately
           1/3 of patients will contribute metastasis to 2 locations. Since there are 2 arms, and 5
           metastasis locations with 6 patients per location for the starting dose level, this
           translates to 40 patients for the starting dose level, and another 40 patients should
           each of the 5 locations require de-escalation to the lower dose level.

        -  Secondary endpoints include comparisons of efficacy and toxicity between the arms, as
           well as interrogation of changes in the immune microenvironment induced by the two
           approaches.
