  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the accuracy and correlation of estimating arterial CO2 pressure（PaCO2） using
      a transcutaneous CO2 pressure（PTCCO2） monitor in patients undergoing retroperitoneoscopic
      renal or adrenal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients undergoing retroperitoneoscopic renal or adrenal surgery were included in this
      study.Their PaCO2, PetCO2, and PTCCO2values were measured at 3 time points before and 30min,
      60min after pneumoperitoneum and calculated the different between each measure(PetCO2 and
      PTCCO2) and PaCO2. Agreement among measures was assessed by the Bland-Altman method.

    <description>TCM-4 monitor, which had changed new electrode membrane and was calibrated by the same person(who had been trained systematically) before each placement. The electrode should be heated to 44℃, then fixed it to the anterior part of chest in the location of lateral position after remove grease by alcohol. The positon of electrode must be changed every 2 hours in order to avoid thermal injury, and should be calibrated again.</description>
