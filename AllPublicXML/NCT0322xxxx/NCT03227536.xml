  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an historic cohort study based on the birth and delivery register of the HFME
      maternity ward. This study aim at understanding the evolution of asphyxia at birth, at all
      gestational ages, identifying causes and describing neonatal outcomes since 2000, when a
      second line strategy for foetal surveillance (fetal ECG) and systematic umbilical acid-gas
      cord blood were introduced in our maternity ward.

      The investigator's hypothesis was that the neonatal asphyxia decrease could be due to 3 main
      factors including second line strategy introduction, systematic umbilical cord acid-base
      implementation and improvement in antenatal risk factor screening for asphyxia. The
      investigator's second hypothesis was that neonatal prognosis in neonates with acidosis was
      improved with systematic early after birth EEG evaluation, allowing early treatment and
      surveillance.
