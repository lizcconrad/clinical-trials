      Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and a major public health problem
      worldwide. Primary health care is a strategic setting in the treatment of this problem. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Motivational Interview (MI) on the
      smoking cessation rates of the smoking groups performed by the primary care teams of the
      Conceição Hospitalar Group, Porto Alegre, Brasil, and also whether there is an increase in
      the completion rate of the groups. Methodology: A randomized community trial was carried out
      in the 12 units of this service, starting in July 2016, with randomization by cluster, where
      the intervention group received an 8-hour training in MI in order to associate the technique
      with the conventional approach, while the units of the control group used only the
      conventional approach.
