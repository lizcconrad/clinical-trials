      administered every 3 weeks up to 6 cycles.

      Statistical Methodology

      This is a Proof of Principle trial with a minimax two stage design:

      • Step 1: 12 patients enrolled; A 5% response rate will preclude further study, whereas a 20%
      response rate will indicate that further study would be warranted.

      Using alfa and beta errors of 0.10, if an objective response is observed in at least 1 of the
      12 patients enrolled during the first stage the study will go on with a:

      • Step 2: recruitment of an additional 25 patients The treatments will be considered active
      if an objective response is observed in 4 out of 37 patients treated.

      The enrolment period will be 24 months. To ensure patients' safety, a continued safety
      evaluation by an independent DSMB will be performed and formal rules will be planned to
      continue or stop the recruitment; in particular, the enrollment will be interrupted when six
      patients completed at least one cycle of the combo treatment and they will be evaluated for
      safety: if grade ≥3 AEs (except for fever and rash that will be consider only for grade 4) in
      2 (two) or more patients will be observed within 30 days after completion of the first dose
      of combo treatment, the study will be interrupted.
