    <textblock>
      A double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I study to assess safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single/multiple ascending doses of atb-346 orally administered in healthy
      male and female subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single ascending doses of ATB-346 given to multiple cohorts followed by multiple ascending
      doses of ATB-346 given to multiple cohorts in order to assess its safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics. A single dose cohort was also conducted to assess the effect of food on the
      drug's characteristics.
