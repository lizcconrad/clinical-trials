      Project LIFT is a randomized, controlled trial that tests the effectiveness of a
      remotely-monitored, home-based exercise program utilizing wearable fitness trackers to
      monitor steps taken per day, health engagement questions, and financial incentives. 120
      subjects will be randomized into 3 arms: 1) usual care - no fitness tracker or incentive, 2)
      a fitness tracker + no incentives, and 3) fitness tracker plus financial incentives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the most common diseases in the United States - an estimated 35% of adults are
      obese. Among kidney (KT) and liver transplant (LT) recipients, weight gain and obesity is
      associated with poor graft function. Yet, within a year of transplantation, habituation to a
      sedentary lifestyle, changes in metabolism, and immunosuppression drugs contribute to an
      average 4-10 kg weight gain for recipients. Recent innovations in wearable device technology
      can passively monitor an individual's physical activity. Additionally, incentives and health
      questions designed using insights from behavioral economics have been shown to motivate
      device engagement and improvements in health behaviors. A remotely-monitored exercise program
      could improve behavior change and potentially be durable because it takes advantage of the
      high motivation for improving health in this population. The objective of this study is to
      use a randomized, controlled trial to test the efficacy of a home-based exercise program
      using wearable devices, health engagement questions and financial incentives. Participants in
      the intervention arm will establish a baseline step count during the first two weeks,
      followed by a 12-week intervention period and a 4-week follow-up period.

    <description>Tracking Device control: The intervention applied is usual care and self-monitoring of physical activity. Patients will receive a pedometer (e.g. Misfit brand wrist pedometer) to allow for self-monitoring of physical activity. They will be able to obtain daily feedback on step counts via the wearable device and their smartphones. They will also have a 2-week run-in period like the incentive arm.</description>

    <description>The intervention applied is self-monitoring of physical activity with incentives. Patients will receive a a pedometer (e.g. Misfit brand wrist pedometer) to allow for self-monitoring of physical activity. Participants will monitor daily step counts with automated feedback on goal attainment via text message. We will establish a baseline step count for each participant (during a 2-week run-in period) and then recommend a 15 percentage point increase in daily step goal every 2 weeks during the 12-week intervention period (weeks 3-14) with a maximum goal of 7,000 steps. Two health engagement questions will be sent per week to participants as well for the 12-week intervention period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult Kidney transplant, Liver transplant, Simultaneous liver-kidney, or
             kidney-pancreas transplant recipients at the Hospital of the University of
             Pennsylvania within 2-24 months of transplantation

          4. Willing to walk and sync wearable daily during the 2-week run-in in order to determine
             baseline [for Arms 2 &amp; 3]

          5. Willing to provide a final weight at study end.

          1. Inability to provide informed consent

          2. Does not have daily access to a smartphone compatible with the wearable device

          3. Unable or unwilling to complete the baseline measurements and survey, or perform the
             exit interview and weigh-in

          4. Already enrolled in a financial incentive-based exercise program using a wearable
             device

          5. Use of a wearable accelerometer or pedometer outside of the study protocol for
             step-tracking; (e.g., Fitbit; using phone step-tracker is acceptable; using existing
             wearable for cycling or swimming is acceptable)
