  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying Ulocuplumab combined with ibrutinib as a possible treatment
      for symptomatic Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an
      investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ulocuplumab as a treatment
      for any disease. Ulocuplumab is a type of protein called an antibody that attacks CXCR4, a
      protein that is found on B-cells like WM.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has Ibrutinib as a treatment option for this
      disease.

      Ibrutinib has been under investigation in research studies in participants with recurrent
      B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and prolymphocytic leukemia, and
      WM. In a study of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory WM patients, response rates were high and
      the treatment was well tolerated. In that study participants who had a CXCR4 mutation had a
      lower response rate to ibrutinib than those without a mutation.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the safety of ulocuplumab in
      combination with ibrutinib participants with symptomatic WM who have a CXCR4 mutation. The
      investigators are also evaluating how well the ulocuplumab works in combination with
      ibrutinib
