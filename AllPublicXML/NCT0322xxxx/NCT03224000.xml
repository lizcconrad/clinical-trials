    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the use of MRI simulations to plan
      different doses of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the standard IMRT dose in
      patients with low risk human papilloma virus positive oropharyngeal cancer.

      Baseline Visit:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study and agrees, participant
      will have a baseline visit. The following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Participant will have a hearing test.

        -  Participant will have a dental exam. During this exam, participant's saliva flow will be
           measured and participant will be checked for lockjaw.

        -  Participant's swallowing function will be tested with a special type of x-ray called a
           modified barium swallow (MBS). During the test, participant will eat and drink foods and
           liquids mixed with a &quot;contrast&quot; chemical called barium that will make participant's
           throat more visible in the x-rays. A special x-ray tube will be connected to a
           television screen to allow the doctor to watch the foods and liquids pass from
           participant's mouth and down participant's throat.

        -  Participant will complete a questionnaire about swallowing that should take about 5
           minutes to complete.

        -  Participant will have a video-strobe procedure to check participant's vocal cords. To
           perform a video-strobe procedure, a small camera will be inserted into the throat
           through participant's nose or mouth. Participant will be awake for this procedure and
           the study staff will give participant the option of receiving a numbing spray for
           participant's nose and/or throat.

        -  Photos of the inside of participant's mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.

        -  Participant will fill out questionnaires about participant's quality of life, work
           status, medical history, smoking status, and any symptoms participant may have.
           Completing these questionnaires should take about 10-15 minutes.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is among the first 15 patients enrolled in the study, participant will be in
      Group 1.

      If participant joins the study after the first 15 patients have enrolled, participant will be
      randomly assigned (as a flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one
      knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

        -  If participant is in Group 1, an MRI will be used to plan participant's IMRT.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, participant will receive standard-of-care IMRT.

      Length of Study Participation:

      No matter which group participant is in, participant may continue receiving radiation therapy
      for up to 6 ½ weeks. Participant will no longer be able to take part in this study if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow
      study directions.

      Participant's overall participation on the study will be over after 5 years.

      Treatment Planning and Schedule:

      Participant will receive a standard CT simulation which will cover participant's head and
      neck for treatment planning. Participant will also have a PET-CT to check the status of the
      disease and for treatment planning purposes.

      If participant is among the first 15 participants or is in Group 1, participant also will
      have an MRI simulation for treatment planning purposes.

      All groups will then receive radiation therapy 1 time each day, 5 days a week (Monday through
      Friday) for up to 33 treatments (about 6 ½ weeks).

      Study Visits:

      Every week while participant is receiving radiation therapy:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will fill out the same questionnaires as before.

        -  Participant will have an MRI.

      At Weeks 3 and 6:

        -  Photos of the inside of participant's mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.

        -  Participant will have a dental exam.

      At Week 3 only, participant will have the video-strobe procedure to check participant's vocal
      cords.

      If participant is among the first 15 participants or is in Group 1, participant will also
      have the MRI simulation at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 of treatment.

      Within 8-12 weeks after finishing radiation therapy:

        -  Photos of the inside of participant's mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.

        -  Participant will have a hearing test.

        -  If participant is among the first 15 participants or is in Group 1, participant will
           have an MRI simulation.

      Six (6) months, 1 year, and 2 years after finishing radiation therapy:

        -  Participant will fill out the same questionnaires as before.

        -  Participant will have a mouth exam to check participant's swallowing function.

        -  Photos of the inside of participant's mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.

        -  Participant will fill out the same questionnaires as before.

        -  Participant will have a video-strobe procedure to check participant's vocal cords.

      Six (6) months, 2 years, and 5 years after finishing radiation therapy, participant will have
      an MBS exam to test participant's swallowing function.

      One (1) year after finishing radiation therapy, participant will have a dental exam.

      One (1) year and 2 years after finishing radiation therapy, participant will have a hearing
      test.

      Two (2) years after finishing radiation therapy and if the disease gets worse, blood (about 3
      teaspoons) will be drawn for circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This is a test of how many tumor
      cells are in the blood.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed during follow-up, participant will have a tumor biopsy for
      tumor marker testing and a CT scan, MRI scan and/or PET/CT scan to check the status of the
      disease.

      Follow-Up Calls:

      During the 8-12 weeks while participant is recovering from treatment, participant will be
      called or emailed by an automated system every 2 weeks.

      This will be to remind participant to fill out a web-based form that asks about any side
      effects participant may have had. Completing the form should take about 10-15 minutes each
      time.

      This is an investigational study. MRI simulations and radiation therapy are delivered using
      FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The use of MRI imaging to plan the dose is
      investigational.

      Up to 75 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
