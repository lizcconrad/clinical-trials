  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although total knee arthroplasty is an effective intervention for decreasing knee pain and
      improving physical function, physical activity levels remain low up to a year after surgery.
      This study will use mobile-health technology to deliver an intervention designed to improve
      physical activity behavior for Veterans recovering from total knee arthroplasty. The study
      will assess the effectiveness of using behavior-change intervention as a supplement to
      conventional rehabilitation to improve physical activity. The intervention will be delivered
      using home-based tablet computers for Veterans to have remote interaction with the researcher
      and real-time physical activity feedback from a wrist-worn activity sensor.

      This randomized clinical trial will assess the efficacy of using physical activity behavior
      change intervention for Veterans recovering from total knee arthroplasty. Testing will occur
      at baseline (before surgery), at intervention midpoint (8 weeks after surgery), end of
      intervention (14 weeks after surgery), and 24 weeks after intervention. The primary outcome
      is accelerometer-assessed daily step count. Secondary outcomes include the percent time
      engaged in standing and walking activity and physical function (Six-Minute Walk, 30-Second
      Chair-Stand Test, Timed Up-and-Go, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      Index, and the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey.
