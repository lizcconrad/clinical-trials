  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized comparison of the incremental dilation and stent exchange vs.
      sequential stent addition approaches for management of anastomotic biliary strictures will
      facilitate optimal management of patients who develop anastomotic biliary strictures after
      liver transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 and older

          2. Clinical concern for anastomotic biliary stricture following liver transplantation (as
             determined by the referring transplant hepatologist)

          3. Willing and able to comply with the study procedures and provide written informed
             consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18

          2. Potentially vulnerable subjects including, homeless people, pregnant females,
             employees and students.

          3. Complex post-surgical anatomy e.g. Choledochojejunostomy, Billroth type II anatomy,
             Roux-en-Y-gastrojejunostomy

          4. Participation in another investigational study that may directly or indirectly affect
             the results of this study within 30 days prior to the initial visit

          5. Other biliary process which accounts for patient's abnormal liver function
             studies/imaging (i.e. significant non-anastomotic biliary stricture).
