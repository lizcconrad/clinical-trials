  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the musculoskeletal adaptations to bone-loading exercise can be
      significantly augmented in older women (aged 60-85) with low bone mass (osteopenia; T-scores
      &lt;-1.0 and &gt;-2.5) by restoring serum DHEAS to young adult levels by oral DHEA replacement.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first study to measure changes in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and
      fat-free mass (FFM) in response to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) alone and combined with
      exercise in postmenopausal women. The body of evidence from carefully executed Randomized
      Controlled Studies (RCTs) provides support for DHEA therapy to increase aBMD and FFM in older
      women. Less is known about whether DHEA therapy enhances the effects of exercise on the aging
      musculoskeletal system when an appropriate mechanical stimulus is applied.
