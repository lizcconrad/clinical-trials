      The investigators compared the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation program on asthma
      control in patients with uncontrolled and partially controlled asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma treatment is not only medical, it also requires a comprehensive care including
      nonpharmacological treatment. Pulmonary rehabilitation represents the most important part of
      the comprehensive care. The investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pulmonary
      rehabilitation in patients with uncontrolled and partially controlled asthma.

      Asthma patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) unit were classified according to
      asthma control test; as partially controlled patients (Group 1), and as uncontrolled patients
      (Group 2). All patients received of a 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation program. Asthma control
      tests, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases analysis, dyspnea perception, quality
      of life, exercise capacity, anxiety and depression assessments were performed before and
      after pulmonary rehabilitation.
