      Extensive literature exists on the use of alpha-blocker medications for the removal of kidney
      stones. Alpha blockers relax certain muscles and help small blood vessels remain open. They
      work by keeping the hormone norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from tightening the muscles in the
      walls of smaller arteries and veins, which causes the vessels to remain open and relaxed.
      This improves blood flow and lowers blood pressure. There are studies that demonstrate
      alpha-blockers decrease ureteral pressure and help the ureter &quot;relax.&quot;

      Recent studies have shown that phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also help with ureteral stone
      passing. A phosphodiesterase inhibitor is a drug that blocks an enzyme that inhibits
      relaxation of smooth muscle. This means that it can help smooth muscle, such as the muscle
      that lines the ureter, to relax. While ureteral relaxation is helpful in the passage of
      ureteral stones, our study seeks to use this finding by pretreating participants with an
      older generation alpha blocker or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor prior to passage of a
      ureteral access sheath in cases in which ureteroscopy is being used to approach a ureteral or
      renal stone.

      By relaxing the ureter, it is possible that a larger access sheath can be safely placed. This
      may allow for facilitating passage of the ureteroscope and extraction of stone fragments
      while precluding the development of potentially damaging intrarenal pressure from the flow of
      irrigant. The ureteral access sheath also protects the ureter from damage during the
      procedure. Placement of the largest access sheath possible is helpful in that larger stone
      fragments can be retrieved, the flow of irrigant is improved, and the surgical field is kept
      clear of blood or debris. To date, nobody has studied whether use of an uro-selective alpha
      blocker, alone, or in combination with a 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor will result in passage
      of larger access sheaths.

      In this study participants will be randomized into 1 of 4 categories: Flomax (alpha-blocker),
      Cialis (5-phosphodiesterase inhibitor), a combination of the 2, or a placebo arm. In this
      study the placebo, or no active drug, is the current standard of care and will serve as a
      control from the other 3 groups.

      Technological improvements such as the miniaturization and development dual lumen
      ureteroscopes have improved the urologists' ability to treat urolithiasis1. The quality of
      flexible ureterorenoscopy is dependent on adequate visualization of the upper urinary tract.
      Adequate irrigation and visualization are compromised by debris from stone fragmentation
      and/or any bleeding during treatment. Fortunately, use of an ureteral access sheath (UAS)
      increases irrigant flow and reduces intrarenal pressure 2.

      Ureteral access sheath technology was significantly improved by a member of our investigative
      team (RVC) thereby making it more widely acceptable3-5. The design changes allowed for easier
      deployment of the access sheath and the newer design was made to be kink resistant. This
      iteration of the device is easily deployed over a guidewire and has varying lengths such that
      it can be passed to the level of the stone in each case. Today's ureteral access sheaths
      range in size from 11-French to 16-French in diameter. The use of a ureteral access sheath
      has been shown to decrease intraoperative time, provide higher stone free rates, incur less
      cost due to shorter operating room times, and lead to fewer secondary procedures5,6. The
      access sheath should also, in theory, lower the risk of urinary tract infection due to
      decreased intrarenal pressure thereby resulting in less pyelovenous and less pyelolymphatic
      backflow. Lastly, use of an access sheath minimizes damage to the fragile flexible
      ureteroscope and thus increases their longevity while decreasing repair costs7.

      Despite the above findings use of the UAS has not been universally embraced. A single study
      by Traxer et al., showed the incidence of low grade ureteric injury using UAS was 46% and
      that with serious injuries (i.e. urothelial tears) occurred in 13%8. However, a follow-up
      study by the same group showed no evidence of delayed long-term ureteral stricture formation;
      in fact, the patients who had a ureteral access sheath deployed there was a lower risk of
      post-operative complications9. Further, other studies have shown that the rate of ureteral
      stricture formation following use of a ureteral access sheath is 1.4% compared to a baseline
      rate of 1-3% during routine ureteroscopy without an access sheath10. In the afore cited
      study, the solitary occurrence of a post-ureteral access sheath ureteral stricture occurred
      at the ureteropelvic junction in a patient who underwent four endoscopic procedures for
      struvite stones; in all four surgeries, the access sheath was deployed at the level of iliac
      vessels well below the site of the patient's stricture10. Of note, porcine models have shown
      decrease ureteral blood flow following the acute deployment of a large access sheath, however
      over time the flow normalized and in follow-up there was no increase in post procedural
      ureteral stricture formation11.

      Most urologists who place a ureteral access sheath do so without any pretreatment for
      ureteral relaxation. At our institution, the investigators routinely use alpha blockers
      (tamsulosin) as an adjunctive medical therapy to possibly relax the ureteral muscle; the
      medication is begun one week prior to surgery as it takes five days for the medicine to reach
      a steady state. It has been the investigator's experience that they are able to place larger
      ureteral access sheaths (i.e. 14 and 16 French size) with this approach. Additionally,
      examination of the ureter at the end of the procedure has shown minimal effect from placement
      of the access sheath; to date, the study team has not had any patient return with a post
      procedural ureteral stricture. Of note, it is the investigator's practice that if there is
      any resistance to deployment of the ureteral access sheath, then a smaller sized sheath is
      used; should the smaller sheath encounter resistance to its passage then a ureteral stent is
      placed and the procedure is postponed for a week. Stent placement in a ureter facilitates
      subsequent placement of an access sheath8,12.

      An extensive literature exists on the role of alpha-blocker medications on the relaxation of
      ureteral smooth muscle13. This is due to the numerous alpha-1 receptors along the ureter,
      particularly in the distal ureter14,15. This knowledge originally led to the development of
      medical expulsive therapy in the treatment of ureteral stones. Several meta-analyses have
      shown that alpha blockers help passage of distal ureteral stones in the 5-10mm range, in less
      time and with less pain. The most extensively studied medication in this regard has been
      tamsulosin In addition to alpha blockade, recent in vitro studies have shown that
      phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors such as a tadalafil, commonly known by its tradename
      Cialis, also facilitate ureteral relaxation18-20. This has been substantiated by clinical
      studies which showed that sildenafil compared to placebo improved stone passage by 27%21.
      Further when tadalafil was added to tamsulosin the result was improved stone passage; the
      combined medications were well tolerated22,23.

    <description>Our primary objective is to assess the ability of a uroselective alpha-blocker (tamsulosin) and PDE-5 inhibitor (tadalafil), either alone or in combination will facilitate the passage of a 16F ureteral access sheath. Successful deployment will be defined as passage of the 16F ureteral access sheath into the proximal ureter or ureteropelvic junction. Difficulty in passing a 16F ureteral access sheath will be defined as a &quot;failure&quot;. In this situation, we will place smaller ureteral access sheath (i.e. 11F or 14F), or opt to place a stent to dilate the ureter, and plan for surgery in the future; this is standard of care.</description>
