  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this research project is to evaluate the imaging performance of a confocal
      endomicroscope. Fluorescein, an FDA-approved topical fluorescent dye, will be used to provide
      topical mucosal contrast. The purpose of this instrument is to provide real-time endoscopic
      &quot;histology&quot; to guide endoscopic biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in the patient
      study group. This endomicroscope probe will be used during colonoscopies in subjects with
      colonic dysplasia, known colonic adenomatous polyps scheduled for endoscopic resection, or
      suspected dysplasia in subjects with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

Fluorescein will be sprayed on the area of interest to provide imaging contrast for the images taken with the confocal endomicroscope.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject meets at least one of the following criteria:

          -  At increased risk for colorectal cancer and colonic polyps

          -  Known colonic adenomas scheduled for colonic polyp resection

          -  Scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy for follow up surveillance of IBD with known
             dysplasia or who are at high risk for high grade dysplasia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject meets all of the following criteria:

          -  Subject is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy in the Medical Procedures Unit at
             University of Michigan Health System.

          -  Subject is medically cleared for the procedure (e.g. washout for anticoagulants,
             co-morbidities) Standard practice guidelines for safely proceeding with the procedure
             will be sufficient for our study.

          -  Age 18 to 100 years
