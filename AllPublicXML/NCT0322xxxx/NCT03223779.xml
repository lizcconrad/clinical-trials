  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug in combination with radiation therapy as a possible
      treatment for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Trifluridine (TAS-102)

        -  Radiation Therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients are being asked to participate in the Phase I
      portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use
      for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Trifluridine as a treatment
      option for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved Trifluridine in combination with radiation therapy as a treatment
      option for this disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are determining the safest and most effective dose
      of Trifluridine in combination with radiation therapy in participants with hepatic metastases
      from colorectal cancer.

      Trifluridine stops DNA replication which may prevent the cancer cells from growing. Radiation
      may help to kill the cancer cells while protecting normal tissue cells. Studies have shown
      Trifluridine may make radiation more effective.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 4 weeks after the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MTD will be determined using a 3 + 3 dose escalation. 3 participants enrolled at the starting dose of 20 mg/m2 BID (Bis in die, Latin for twice daily). Based on the number of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), the dose can be either be increased to 25 mg/m2 BID then 30 mg/m2 BID or it could be reduced to 15 mg/m2 BID.
If 0 out of 3 have DLT, enroll 3 participants at next dose level
If ≥ 2 DLT out of 3 or 6 participants in a dose cohort have DLT, this will be the MTD and 3 additional participants are enrolled at next lowest dose if only 3 were treated at that level so far.
If 1 out of 3 have DLT, 3 more enrolled at current dose level. If no DLT in those 3, move to next dose level. If ≥ 1 DLT, declare this the MTD and enroll 3 additional at next lowest dose if only 3 treated so far.
If ≤ 1 out of 6 DLT at highest dose level below maximally administered dose, MTD is generally the rerecorded phase 2 dose (RP2D). Dose level 3 is RP2D if MTD not reached.</description>

    <measure>The Duration of Local Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month post treatment, every 6 months for two years or until death</time_frame>
    <description>Local control is the absence of local failure defined as evidence of tumor growth/regrowth that meets Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progressive disease in any direction beyond that present in pre-treatment imaging studies of the treated lesion(s). The duration of local control will be measured from the start date of protocol treatment until the date of local failure.
Marginal failure is defined as appearance of tumor growth at the margin of the target volume.
Nodal failure is defined as failure in regional lymph nodes (i.e. porta-hepatis, para-aortic, diaphragmatic).
Distant failure is defined as appearance of tumor at sites beyond marginal and regional nodal sites.
Intrahepatic recurrence is defined as any new lesion elsewhere in the liver and separate from local failure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Association between KRAS or BRAF mutation status with local control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month post treatment, every 6 months for two years or until death</time_frame>
    <description>Association between KRAS or BRAF mutation status with local control will be assessed using Gray's test with death as a competing risk in the absence of local failure. Local control is defined in the 'Duration of Local Control' description.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have biopsy-proven diagnosis of a colorectal cancer with 1-4 liver
             metastases. There is no upper size limit and participants must have at least 800 mL of
             uninvolved liver. Liver metastases may be diagnosed by imaging alone, no liver biopsy
             is required. Extrahepatic disease is allowed if 1) it has been stable for 3 months
             prior to study entry, 2) the dominant disease burden is intrahepatic and 3) the
             patient is referred for definitive radiation therapy to the disease in the liver.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥
             10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section 13 for the evaluation of measurable disease.

          -  Participants may have had prior chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy (i.e.
             sorafenib), surgery, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation,
             or cryosurgery for their disease as long as the prior therapy occurred more than 3
             weeks before the first radiation treatment. Patients may not have had prior liver
             directed radiation, including radioembolization.

          -  Participants must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of high
             dose liver radiation in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study.

          -  Expected survival must be greater than three months.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1..

          -  Participants must have liver metastases deemed unresectable due to anatomy, medical
             fitness, or presence of extrahepatic disease.

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below. History of
             transfusion is acceptable and transfusions may be given to meet eligibility
             requirements.

               -  Hgb ≥ 9g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3

               -  Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Calculated
                  per Cockroft &amp; Gault formula) for subjects with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal.

          -  If patient has underlying cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh classification Group A patients
             should be included in this study. Clinical assessment of ascites and encephalopathy is
             required. Child-Pugh classification must be determined for all study participants at
             the time of eligibility analysis. As albumin and PT/INR are required for Child-Pugh
             classification; these labs should be drawn with other labs required for eligibility
             analysis. See Appendix B for Child-Pugh classification table.

          -  The effects of radiation on the developing human fetus are known to be teratogenic and
             the safety of TAS-102 in pregnant women and their fetuses has not been established.
             Therefore, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after stopping study
             treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Ability to take oral medications (i.e. no feeding tube and able to swallow whole)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating. Patients must be either surgically sterile (via
             hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), post menopausal or using acceptable methods
             of contraception if they are of child bearing potential. Female patients of child
             bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to starting drug. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radiation,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with radiation.

          -  Participants with gross ascites or encephalopathy

          -  Participants with local conditions or systemic illnesses that would reduce the local
             tolerance to radiation treatment, such as serious local injuries, active collagen
             vascular disease, etc.

          -  Participants who have had prior liver directed radiation treatment, including
             selective internal radiation (SIRspheres or Theraspheres)

          -  Participants with a serious medical illness that may limit survival to less than 3
             months

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to starting study treatment or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents, or any other
             anti-cancer therapy during study treatment.

          -  Participants with any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or serious psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Participants who have previously received TAS-102
