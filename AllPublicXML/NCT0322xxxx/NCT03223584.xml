      Title of the research:

      Exploratory study to inventory opportunities to optimize continuity of pharmacotherapy at
      hospital discharge

      Study area:

      Care region Leuven (individual interviews), care region Bruges (individual interviews) and
      care region Mortsel (One focus group).

      Aims:

      From an explorative angle, the study aims to identify hurdles, barriers, facilitators and
      needs that general practitioners and community pharmacists experience with patients who have
      recently been discharged from a hospital. From a feasibility standpoint, the study aims to
      investigate what supportive actions are feasible and useful to optimize the care process upon
      hospital discharge. For this purpose, a discharge document for the community pharmacist will
      be shown to the healthcare professionals. The HCP will be given the opportunity to give
      feedback on this document.

      Study design:

      A non-interventional, qualitative study is set up using face-to-face, semi-structured
      interviews and a focus group.

      Study population:

      Community pharmacists and general practitioners that are employed in the study region and
      that are considered opinion leaders.

      Number of health care professionals:

      Individual interviews will be organised until there is saturation of information and no new
      elements are provided in the interviews. At least five community pharmacists and five general
      practitioners will be interviewed per care region. In addition, a focus group will take place
      in care region Mortsel.

      Procedures:

      Upon an informed consent of the healthcare professional, a semi-structured face-to-face
      interview will take place. The interview will focus on concrete patient cases, provided by
      the healthcare professional, as well as a fictional case of the researcher. In the focus
      group, data of the individual interviews will be presented and the relevance and completeness
      of the information will be assessed. Finally, the aim of the focus group is to reach a
      consensus on the research questions.
