      A Phase II multi-center, double-blind, parallel group, randomized and placebo-controlled
      clinical trial addressing the treatment of patients with active and symptomatic
      Scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1
      assignment to receive either oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a placebo (Plac) or a
      combination of oral MMF and oral pirfenidone (PFD), with both regimens administered for 18
      months. The primary hypothesis is that the rapid onset and anti-fibrotic effects of PFD,
      which have been observed in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), will
      complement the delayed antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of MMF, to produce a
      significantly more rapid and/or greater improvement in lung function over time than occurs in
      patients receiving control therapy with MMF and Plac.

    <ipd_description>A bio-specimen repository will be created in which de-identified blood specimens will be made available to qualified researchers who submit meritorious applications for the access and use of such samples. Requests for specimens and correlative analyses related to other linked and de-identified clinical data will be overseen by the Study Executive and Steering Committees and/or any sub-committees that they may appoint for this process.</ipd_description>
