  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental disorder that affects
      approximately 7% of the general population. This project's aim is to develop a greater
      understanding of the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of narrative exposure based
      treatments for PTSD. Adult participants (N=162) who meet DSM-5 criteria for PTSD will be
      enrolled in a 3-arm randomized clinical trial consisting of trauma-related expressive
      writing, trauma-related expressive speaking, or a factual expressive writing control
      condition. Treatments will be manualized and conducted entirely through the Qualtrics survey
      platform. Treatment will consist of six sessions, three per week over two weeks, taking place
      via the internet. Assessments will be conducted pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 1-month
      follow-up in the lab. Assessments will be comprised of symptom self-report measures as well
      as two tasks completed in an eye tracker: a reading task to evaluate mechanisms underlying
      trauma narrative processing and a sentence production task to evaluate attentional shifts
      when producing verbal information

      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:

        1. Develop and test the relative efficacy of two cost-effective internet-based expressive
           trauma therapies (written vs. spoken) relative to a non-trauma writing control for PTSD.
           We hypothesize that both trauma-focused expressive therapies will achieve more favorable
           outcomes at posttreatment and follow-up on measures of PTSD and depression symptoms,
           posttraumatic growth, and quality of life compared to the writing control.

        2. Conduct exploratory analyses testing baseline PTSD severity, depression severity, trauma
           type, time since trauma, and emotional engagement in moderating the differential effects
           of the selected expressive therapies.

        3. Test the mediational effects of pre- to posttreatment changes in (1) active language
           processing with eye tracking (i.e. how long certain words are fixated on). (2) selected
           linguistic elements (i.e., frequency of emotional words, frequency of the pronoun &quot;I&quot;),
           (3) perceived self-efficacy to cope with trauma memories; (4) perceived threat
           appraisals associated with intrusive trauma memories on treatment outcome at follow-up.
           We hypothesize that (1) fewer and shorter fixations on ideographic (i.e. personally
           relevant) trauma words when reading the trauma narrative in the eye tracker will be
           associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms at follow-up. (2) increased use of emotional
           words over the course of writing sessions will be associated with reductions in PTSD and
           depression symptoms at follow-up; (3) pre- to posttreatment increases in trauma memory
           acceptance self-efficacy; and (4) pre- to posttreatment reductions in trauma memory
           threat appraisals will be associated with greater symptom reduction at the follow-up
           assessment.

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will complete six sessions during which they will write about their trauma for 20 minutes. The participant will receive instructions to write about the traumatic event that they feel affects them the most. For each session they will be instructed to write about the same event. For the first session, participants will complete psychoeducation and treatment rationale modules. The instructions for writing about the traumatic event will emphasize the importance of exploring their deepest emotions and thoughts at the time of the event, as well as providing detailed information about the event itself. For the remaining five writing sessions participants will be instructed to write about the same event and to focus on providing a detailed description of the part of the event that was most distressing to them, as well as how the event had affected their lives. A researcher will review the writing independently to ensure treatment compliance.</description>
