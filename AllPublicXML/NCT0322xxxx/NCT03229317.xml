  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early lung function deficits represent a significant risk factor for the evolution toward
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease later in life. Prematurity and in utero tobacco smoke
      exposure are already known to predispose children to develop a non-reversible obstructive
      ventilatory defect in adulthood. The role of vitamin D status during pregnancy is less
      certain. In humans, low vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy are associated to an
      increased risk of asthma in children. In murine models, low vitamin D concentrations during
      pregnancy are associated to structural abnormalities of the airways in mouse pups.
      Investigators hypothesized that vitamin D play a role in early airways development, from the
      first trimester of pregnancy. To bring arguments to this hypothesis, the investigators will
      study the association of airway resistance in children aged 5 to 6 years old with the
      concentration of vitamin D during the first trimester of pregnancy in their mothers.

      Children aged 5 to 6 years old will be included from the FEPED cohort. The FEPED cohort is a
      cohort of French pregnant women designed to study the association between vitamin D status
      during pregnancy and the risk of pre-eclampsia. Vitamin D concentration at first and third
      trimester of pregnancy as well as in cord blood is available for 1400 women. Investigators
      will include 200 children born from these women. Children will undergo lung function tests
      and prick-tests and parents will answer the ISAAC questionnaire that is a standardised
      questionnaire designed to evaluate asthma and rhinitis symptoms. The main outcome of this
      study will be specific airway resistance. The investigators will look for an association
      between specific airway resistance and vitamin D concentration measured during the first
      trimester of pregnancy in their mothers.
