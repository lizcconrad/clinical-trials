  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The largest epidemiologic study of Hispanic/Latino participants thus far, i.e., the Hispanic
      Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) documented that 80% of men and 71% of
      women have at least one major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. The American Heart
      Association emphasizes that current CVD prevention efforts are sparse and ineffectual in
      minority populations and acknowledges the need for new and more effective disease prevention
      strategies. This observational study and pilot cluster-randomized clinical trial seeks to
      implement and evaluate a novel 8-week Positive Psychology (PP) Intervention (compared to an
      attention control condition) in Hispanic/Latino adults with uncontrolled hypertension, i.e.,
      elevated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, with primary interest in testing efficacy for
      clinically meaningful improvements in cardiovascular function.

      The study features piloting of a cluster-randomized trial to determine whether a positive
      psychology (PP) intervention is associated with greater improvements in blood pressure
      compared to an attention control condition. The pilot trial additionally evaluates the
      efficacy of the PP intervention with respect to psychological well-being,
      hypertension-related health behaviors, autonomic cardiac control, and high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein. Serum blood assays will facilitate exploration of mechanistic indicators
      linking psychological well-being to cardiac functioning.

    <description>The device, Vitavue, consists of a wireless microcontroller that connects to a desktop computer running proprietary software when operated in real time connected mode. Alternatively, it can be operated in standalone unconnected mode by logging acquired data to an internal memory storage device. The device contains a number of sensors including ECG single channel amplifier, Multispectral Photodiode to record photo pulse plethysmograms, temperature sensor to measure skin temperature, and an accelerometer to record the level of activity.</description>
