    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cytarabine and idarubicin or decitabine work in treating
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and idarubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Decitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving patients cytarabine and idarubicin or decitabine may
      work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome based on clinicogenetic risk stratification.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of complete remission and mortality at 90 days in the entire cohort
      of older patients (&gt;= 60 years) with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), who receive clinicogenetic risk-stratified therapy
      allocation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of complete remission and mortality at 90 days in subsets of older
      patients who receive intensive and low-intensity chemotherapy II. To assess the impact of
      baseline functional status (measured by geriatric assessment) on the rate of complete
      remission and mortality at 90 days in older patients, who receive clinicogenetic
      risk-stratified therapy allocation.

      III. To evaluate the influence of baseline functional status on the quality of life, grades 3
      and 4 toxicities (CTCAE version 4.03 grades) and neurocognitive status at baseline and at 90
      days in older patients.

      IV. To determine the symptom burden at diagnosis and 10, 30 and 90 days following initiation
      of chemotherapy.

      V. To determine whether impairments detected by geriatric assessment are potentially
      modifiable

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percentage of older patients who receive allogeneic stem cell transplant
      during the study period.

      II. To evaluate median time from diagnosis to complete remission and median time from
      diagnosis to receipt of transplant in the study population.

      III. To determine the duration of remission, and overall survival at 1 and 2 years in the
      study population.

      IV. To assess the predictive value of cytogenetic risk categories, FLT3 ITD, TP53 and other
      mutations in older patients treated with intensive and low intensity therapy.

      V. To calculate the rate of response to salvage therapy among patients who have initially
      received low-intensity and intensive therapy.

      VI. To evaluate the cause of deaths in older patients with AML and high-risk MDS who have
      received low-intensity and intensive therapy.

      VII. To determine any correlation between time from diagnosis to initiation of therapy and
      mortality at 90 days in the study population.

      VIII. To calculate the median time to peripheral blood blast clearance and its correlation to
      mortality at 90 days in the study population.

      IX. To determine the percentage of older patients who achieve minimal residual disease
      negative status after intensive and low intensity therapy.

      X. To measure length of stay for initial diagnosis and chemotherapy, and rehospitalization
      rate in older patients treated with intensive and low intensity therapy during the study
      period.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 or 2 groups based on cytogenetic and geriatric
      assessment-based risk stratification.

      GROUP I:

      INTENSIVE INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours on
      days 1-7 and idarubicin over 10-15 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats for 4 weeks for 1
      course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      INTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients who go into remission, receive cytarabine IV over
      1-3 hours twice daily (BID) on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2-4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II:

      LOW-INTENSITY INDUCTION: Patients receive decitabine IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-10.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 1-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      LOW-INTENSITY CONSOLIDATION: Patients who achieve complete remission, receive decitabine IV
      over 1-3 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 or more courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 2 years.
