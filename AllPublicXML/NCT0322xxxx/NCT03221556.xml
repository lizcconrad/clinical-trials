  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to improve outcomes among pregnant and
      post-partum women with symptoms of depression. Both interventions under study will be based
      in the patient-centered medical home setting at Boston Medical Center - specifically, in
      prenatal clinic or in the general pediatrics clinic. The study is a type 1 hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation trial of 230 mothers with clinically significant depressive
      symptomatology. Of the 230 subjects, half will receive the Engagement-Focused Care
      Coordination intervention; the other half will receive the Problem Solving Education
      intervention. Outcomes for mothers will be assessed every 2 months throughout a 12 month
      follow-up period. This trial is funded by a contract with PCORI, the Patient-Centered
      Outcomes Research Institute.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of 230 mothers with clinically
      significant depressive symptomatology being conducted at Boston Medical Center (BMC). The
      effectiveness component of the study (which is the trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov) is
      a pragmatic, parallel group randomized trial that measures patient-reported outcomes over 12
      months of follow-up. The implementation portion comprises a series of qualitative interviews
      to discern barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation.

      The investigators will enroll 230 mothers with clinically significant depressive
      symptomatology according to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a widely used
      screening instrument valid during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

      Engagement-Focused Care Coordination will be compared to Problem Solving Education (PSE).
      Whereas Engagement-Focused Care Coordination emphasizes referral to formal depression
      services following a brief engagement session, PSE offers initial depression treatment
      onsite, followed by referral to further care if depressive symptoms persist or worsen.
      Patients in both arms will have access to the same array of community-based mental health
      services upon referral. Both intervention arms are designed to be peer-delivered; thus, the
      investigators will enlist their existing team of PCMH family advocates - a group of women
      (approximately age-matched with our study participants) - to serve as intervention providers.
      To minimize contamination across comparators, this team will be divided into those trained in
      Engagement Interviewing and those trained in PSE.

    <description>This scale is a 16-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms over the past 7 days. Each item is scored 0-3 (0 = no presence of the symptom; 3 = high burden of the symptom), yielding a total score range of 0 to 27. Because of its wide scoring range, the QIDS can be used to detect depressive illness in populations with low symptoms. Lower scores reflect less depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>The brief intervention in Engagement-Focused Care Coordination is the Engagement Interview. In this model, providers meet one to two times with mothers who screen positive for depression, and use techniques of shared decision-making to help mothers process the results of the screen; explore treatment options; and connect with formal mental health services. Engagement-Focused Care Coordination emphasizes referral to formal mental health services.</description>

    <description>Engagement interviewing is embedded within a traditional PCMH structure using motivational interviewing and shared decision making; it explores treatment options in the context of a patient's life circumstances, and helps her work through ambivalence to receiving care. In one to two sessions, providers disclose the probable diagnosis of depression, provide psycho-education, present treatment options, and engage clients in shared decision making to determine the most appropriate referral.</description>

    <description>Problem solving sessions are one-on-one, workbook-based interactions. Sessions comprise seven sequential steps: 1-defining a problem, 2-establishing goals for problem resolution, 3-generating multiple solution alternatives, 4-Implementing decision making guidelines, 5-evaluating and choosing solutions, 6-Implementing the preferred solutions, and 7-evaluating the outcome.</description>
