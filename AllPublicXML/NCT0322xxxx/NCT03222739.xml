  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a complex 3-dimensional deformity of the spine. It may occur at any time
      throughout growth and development and is typically detected through x-ray imaging. Although
      effective at visualizing a curve, x-ray imaging is costly and may expose children to
      potentially harmful ionizing radiation. This is a 30 patient study to evaluate the
      reliability of ultrasound, an imaging technique without radiation, to effectively measure
      scoliosis deformities compared to the gold-standard of x-ray.

      All patients who present to Children's National Medical Center for initial evaluation of
      idiopathic or juvenile scoliosis will be approached.
