    <textblock>
      This post-market study is being conducted to document comparative safety, clinical
      effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the addition of HF10™ therapy to CMM compared with
      CMM alone in subjects with chronic, intractable, neuropathic lower limb pain due to diabetic
      neuropathy (Painful Diabetic Neuropathy or PDN). This study is a multi-center, prospective,
      randomized comparison of the two treatments.
