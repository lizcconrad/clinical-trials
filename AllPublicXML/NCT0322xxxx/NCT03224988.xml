  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is focused on the gap in understanding of bilateral brain interactions and their
      role in helping normative and clinical elderly populations maintain cognitive health. The
      investigator will focus on investigating this neural mechanism of these interactions and
      promoting them with a precise application of TMS, in order to test the hypothesis that
      excitatory interactions between the hemispheres can provide positive outcomes for patients
      with pre-clinical AD (amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment or MCI-AD). In Session 1, the
      investigator will establish the spatial specificity of bilateral brain mechanisms with
      combination of behavior, TMS, and structural neuroimaging in cortical sites known to be
      active during memory encoding. In Session 2, the investigator will establish the underlying
      dynamics of interhemispheric communication using a novel combination of TMS and
      electroencephalography (EEG) to establish the coordinated activity between the hemispheres;
      Lastly, in Session 3, the investigator will use the TMS entraining parameters delineated in
      Aim 2 to promote specific cross-hemispheric communication, applied to participants performing
      a Picture Encoding task, a general task of memory performance. The outcome of these studies
      will allow our group to evaluate the strength of this brain stimulation protocol in
      alleviating age-related and dementia-related cognitive decline, and enable development of
      novel treatment protocols for dementia in elderly cohorts.

    <description>This will be examined using a Picture Encoding (PE) task in healthy older adults, which will allow identification of spatial brain targets based on the structural pathways connecting left and right DLPFC, ultimately relating the integrity of these pathways based on PE task performance. This Primary Outcome measure will therefore be performance scores (% correct) on this PE task.</description>
