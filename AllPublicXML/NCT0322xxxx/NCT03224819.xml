    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, phase 1, sequential dose escalation study. AMG 673 will
      be evaluated as a short term intravenous (IV) infusion in adult subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML. The study will be conducted at approximately 7 sites in the United
      States, Australia and Germany.

             glomerular filtration rate &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

          -  Hepatic function as follows:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

             subject may be deemed eligible for the trial by the Amgen physician, after discussion
             with the investigator.

             without evidence of disease for &gt; 2 years before screening.

          -  Autologous HSCT within six weeks prior to start of AMG 673 treatment.

          -  Positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen.

          -  Positive for Hepatitis C or Chronic Hepatitis C.

          -  Unresolved toxicities from prior antitumor therapy, defined as not having resolved to
             CTCAE, version 4.0 grade 1 (with the exception of myelosuppression, eg, neutropenia,
             anemia, thrombocytopenia), or to levels dictated in the eligibility criteria with the
             exception of alopecia or toxicities from prior antitumor therapy that are considered
             irreversible (defined as having been present and stable for &gt; 2 months) which may be
             allowed if they are not otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND there is
             agreement to allow by both the investigator and sponsor.

          -  Antitumor therapy (chemotherapy, antibody therapy, molecular-targeted therapy,
             retinoid therapy, or investigational agent) within 14 days or 5 half lives (whichever
             is longer) of day 1.

          -  Treatment with systemic immune modulators including, but not limited to, non-topical
             systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus within 2 weeks before
             enrollment (day 1).

          -  Prior treatment with a monoclonal antibody or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T)
             infusion for the treatment of AML (CD33 or other target).

          -  Prior participation in an investigational study (drug, procedure or device) within 21
             days of study day 1.

          -  Major surgery within 28 days of study day 1 with the exception of biopsy and insertion
             of central venous catheter.
