  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a well known complication about long term transplantation. Cancer outcomes are due
      to the immunosuppressive treatment that prevents transplanted people from rejection. By
      lowering the effectiveness of the immune system, immune cells are no longer able to seek and
      destroy cancer cells.

      The goal here is to study immunes cells population of people that were transplanted 10 years
      ago and are now treated either by a corticosteroid - azathioprine association, or only by
      cyclosporine A.
