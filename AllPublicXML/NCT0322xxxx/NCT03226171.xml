    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of SK-1403 in Hemodialysis Patients
      with Secondary Hyperparathyroidism. In the first treatment period, the efficacy of SK-1403 is
      assessed after 18 weeks of treatment with SK-1403 individually dose-adjusted . Safety is also
      assessed during this period. Patients who completed the first treatment period proceed to the
      second treatment period and receive the treatment with SK-1403 for 34 weeks. Efficacy and
      safety of SK-1403 are also assessed during this period.
