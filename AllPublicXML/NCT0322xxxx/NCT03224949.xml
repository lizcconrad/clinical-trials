  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The availability of biological samples from individuals with alcoholic liver disease (ALD),
      as well as samples from appropriate heavy drinking, yet healthy controls and non-drinking
      healthy controls, is an essential first step in the translation of basic research advances to
      the clinic. The purpose of the Clinical Core component of the P50 Northern Ohio Alcohol
      Center (NOAC) is to provide biological samples (plasma/serum, buffy coats, and urine) from
      patients with different stages of alcoholic liver disease, as well as healthy control
      subjects, to members of the NOAC. These samples can then be used to test specific hypotheses
      related to the presence of specific biomarkers in the serum, functional immune activity in
      PBMCs and/or genetic polymorphisms that may predict severity of disease, short- and long-term
      morbidity and mortality and/or responsivity to specific therapeutic interventions commonly
      used in clinical practice. This study is building on the established biorepositories and the
      diversity of outstanding clinical expertise at the Cleveland Clinic. This biorepository
      included clinical samples (plasma, serum, buffy coats, and urine) from patients with
      different stages of ALD and subjects who are heavy drinkers without ALD, recruited from the
      Cleveland Clinic alcohol use disorder treatment clinic. This study will be responsible for
      collecting more data to help build the CCF-ALD biorepository via subject recruitment and
      communication and specimen collection.
