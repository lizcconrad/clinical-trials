    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the intramuscular nominal thigh injection performance
      and the low threshold strength thigh injection (by evaluating 2 low threshold : upper limit
      and lower limit). All participants will receive an intramuscular nominal thigh injection, and
      half of the participants will receive an intramuscular low threshold (upper limit) strength
      thigh injection, while the other half will receive an intramuscular low threshold (lower
      limit) strength thigh injection.
