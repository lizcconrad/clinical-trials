  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common complication after pulmonary
      complications. This specific form of diabetes is associated with an increased morbidity and
      mortality. CFRD prevalence at the age of 10 is 10% and reaches 40 to 50% in adulthood, while
      another 35% of adult patients presents impaired glucose tolerance.

      In order to identify patients at risk and to implement early therapeutic measures, an annual
      CFRD screening test should therefore be undertaken for CF patients after 10 years of age. The
      2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a sweet beverage is the recommended screening
      test. However, participation rates for screening tests are far from optimal. For examples, in
      2015, the investigators observed that only 47% of non-diabetic patients attended to planned
      screening despite large availability and advertisement (unpublished data). Comparable low
      levels of screening for CFRD, usually below 33%, have been reported by various teams. Several
      reasons could explain these low adherence rates. Some factors are related to patients
      perceptions and experience: OGTT is perceived as an additional medical burden requiring a
      scheduled appointment (several weeks after the last exacerbation); overnight fasting followed
      by the intake of a large glucose load within 5 minutes can lead to nausea, headache, bloating
      and fatigue; some patients fear multiple blood sampling, etc. In addition, in case of CFRD
      diagnosis, recommended capillary blood glucose monitoring, nutritional advice and treatment
      (insulin) are perceived as extremely invasive and complex, thus some patients prefer avoiding
      screening test. To date, no alternative screening method has demonstrated its effectiveness
      to screen for CFRD. The investigators of this study believe that a simplified version of the
      OGTT would be more attractive, would make it more acceptable for patients and has the
      potential to improve their adherence to screening tests, simplify CF-team works and reduce
      costs. By allowing appropriate education and introduction of treatment in a timely manner,
      improved adherence to annual screening for dysglycemia has the potential to minimize or
      prevent clinical deterioration observed in years preceding CFRD onset.

      The investigators propose a pilot study to evaluate the validity and the acceptability of a
      home-based OGTT by comparing, in patients with CF:

        -  Standard hospital-based OGTT with measures of plasma glucose and the use of 75g glucose
           beverage;

        -  Home-based OGTT with measures of glucose using a continuous glucose monitoring system
           (CGMS; without blood sample collection) and the 75g glucose beverage;

        -  Home-based OGTT with measures of glucose using CGMS and 75g of glucose from candies as a
           substitute to this poorly appreciate beverage.

      Specific objectives are to determine i) the internal validity (specificity, sensitivity) of
      both home-based OGTTs versus a standard OGTT in controlled setting, and ii) the predictive
      value (positive and negative). The investigators will also iii) investigate patient's
      perception and likelihood that the proposed method improves adherence to annual screening,
      and iv) evaluate potential cost reduction associated with proposed simplified screening
      tests.

      On the day of the OGTT, and after obtaining informed consent, a CGMS will be installed.
      Patients will receive the very simple training required to use it as well as a pre-packed
      Jelly Beans bag containing 75g of glucose and a standard 75g glucose beverage bottle. This
      CGMS will provide interstitial glucose values each 15 min over the next 14 days.
