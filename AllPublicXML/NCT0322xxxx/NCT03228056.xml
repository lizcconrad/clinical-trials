    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial was designed to assess and
      compare the postoperative pain after VATS lobectomy performed though one, two and three
      incisions. The primary outcome measure is pain intensity measured in VAS scale. The secondary
      outcome measure is cumulative morphine consumption up to 72 hours after surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The best VATS technique for lobectomy has not been well defined yet. Most of the authors
      describe the VATS approach to lobectomy via 2 to even 4 incisions. The final step in the
      evolution of the technique is the use of a single-port approach. If conventional multiportal
      VATS is superior to open thoracotomy by virtue of minimizing surgical access trauma, then
      further reduction in such access trauma should yield even greater benefits. Therefore,
      reducing the number of wounds from three or four to just one, should, in theory, lead to less
      pain, paresthesia, and morbidity as well as faster recovery. However, critics of the
      uniportal VATS approach may raise concerns about whether this most minimally invasive
      surgical approach for lung surgery may compromise safety and treatment efficacy. In addition,
      there's the concern about true invasiveness of the procedure. This prospective, randomized
      controlled trial was designed to compare the postoperative pain after VATS lobectomy
      performed through one, two and three incisions. The primary outcome measure is pain intensity
      measured in VAS scale. The secondary outcome measures are cumulative morphine consumption up
      to 72 hours after surgery in 4-hour intervals and dynamic spirometry (PEF, FEV1 and FVC)
      measured daily at the bedside up to 72 hours after surgery. All patients will receive the
      same regimen of postoperative analgesia based on thoracic epidural block, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and rescue doses of morphine in PCA system. The side effects and
      complications including atelectasis, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, urine retention,
      hypotension, respiratory depression and sedation will be analysed.
