  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug. It is used to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC) and other cancers. It can cause hearing loss for some people. It is not known how
      many people will get hearing loss from cisplatin. It is also not known what other factors
      might influence who gets hearing loss. Factors could include age, sex, noise exposure, and
      other drugs the person is taking. Statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol. Statins may
      also reduce cisplatin-induced hearing loss.

      Objectives:

      To see if statins reduce hearing loss in people getting cisplatin therapy to treat HNSCC. To
      find out how many people taking cisplatin get hearing loss from it. To find out if other
      factors might influence whether cisplatin causes hearing loss.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who are getting treatment with cisplatin for HNSCC

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.

      Participants will have 3 visits. These will be before the onset of cisplatin therapy, at
      about 4 weeks after they finish therapy, and about 6 months after they finish therapy. Each
      visit will include:

      Medication history

      Audiogram/hearing tests. Participants will wear headphones and indicate when they hear
      different sounds.

      Questions about their noise exposure history and whether they have ringing in the ears

      Objectives:

        -  Primary: Determine whether head and neck cancer patients taking statin drugs for
           hyperlipidemia are at decreased risk of cisplatin-induced hearing loss.

        -  Secondary: Determine the incidence and severity of hearing loss in head and neck cancer
           patients undergoing low-dose, weekly cisplatin chemotherapy with concurrent radiation.
           Hearing loss with this more recent cisplatin regimen has not been thoroughly evaluated
           in the literature. Examine whether age, gender, pre-existing hearing loss, other
           medications, or comorbid medical conditions may be risk factors for cisplatin-induced
           hearing loss and/or the acquisition or progression of tinnitus in this patient
           population.

      Study Population:

      -Subjects will be adult patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of the upper
      aerodigestive tract who will undergo cisplatin chemotherapy (40 mg/m2 weekly for 6-7 weeks)
      with concurrent radiation.

      Design:

        -  Observational study

        -  334 subjects will be enrolled.

        -  Subjects will complete a questionnaire to estimate the degree of prior noise exposure
           and impact on baseline hearing. Information on medical comorbidities, names and doses of
           current medications will be obtained from the medical record and verified at each
           subject visit.

        -  Subjects will complete self-administered audiograms using FDA-approved software from
           SHOEBOXTM Audiometry on a portable tablet (iPad) computer.

        -  Audiograms will be completed prior to commencing chemoradiation, within 4 weeks of
           completing treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment.

        -  Subjects will also complete a validated tinnitus questionnaire and a noise exposure
           history along with each audiogram.

        -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.

        -  Audiograms will be performed at the Johns Hopkins Suburban Outpatient Center or the NIH
           Clinical Center.

        -  Two interim analyses will be conducted prior to study completion (after N=88 and N=176
           subjects completing the protocol) to determine whether there are statistically
           significant differences in severity or incidence of hearing loss in subjects taking
           concurrent statin drugs vs. subjects who are not taking statin drugs.

      Outcome Measures:

        -  Primary outcome measure: The primary outcome measure is the change in hearing
           sensitivity (as measured by the self-administered audiogram) between the pre-treatment
           (before cisplatin therapy) hearing test and the post-treatment (after completion of
           cisplatin therapy) audiogram. Hearing loss will be defined according to TUNE and ASHA
           criteria and will be compared in subjects taking statin drugs vs. subjects not taking
           statin drugs. Hearing status will be compared between audiograms collected at baseline
           (prior to treatment) to a repeated audiogram at the end of treatment (within 4 weeks of
           cisplatin protocol cessation).

        -  Secondary outcome measure: Secondary outcome measures include 1) changes in hearing
           sensitivity between the first post-cisplatin audiogram and the second post-cisplatin
           audiogram, and 2) changes in scores on the tinnitus questionnaire between the
           pre-treatment audiogram and the two post-treatment audiograms.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Adult patients over the age of 18.

          -  Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract including the
             larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx, and oral cavity who undergo treatment with
             concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with
             curative intent.

          -  Patients treated with cisplatin chemoradiation either as primary/definitive or
             adjuvant (post-surgical) therapy, with cisplatin dosed 40 mg/m2 weekly.

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to self-administer their hearing test via the iPad
             following a brief tutorial with one-on-one instruction from a member of the study team
             or medical staff.

          -  Subjects must have hearing thresholds at or better than 80 dB SPL at 1, 2, and 4
             kilohertz (kHz) at the time of their baseline audiogram.

          -  Subjects must have a Type A tympanogram.

          -  Subjects must be able to provide their own consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
