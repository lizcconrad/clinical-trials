  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The definitive treatment for knee osteoarthritis is Total Knee Replacement (TKR),
      which results in clinically meaningful improvements in pain and physical function. However,
      evidence suggests that physical activity remains unchanged after TKR. This randomized
      clinical trial is investigating the efficacy, fidelity, and safety of a physical therapist
      administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR.

      Methods/Design: One hundred and twenty-five individuals, over the age of 45, who seek
      outpatient Physical Therapy (PT) following a unilateral TKR will be randomized into a control
      and intervention group. The intervention group will receive a weekly physical activity
      intervention during PT, which includes a FitbitTM monitor, individualized step goals, and
      face-to-face feedback provided by the physical therapist. Efficacy of the intervention will
      be measured by minutes/week spent in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MPVA) using an
      Actigraph GT3X monitor from enrollment to discharge, 6 months and 12 months from discharge
      from PT. The association of self-efficacy for exercise and kinesiophobia with physical
      activity will also be measured at the same time points. Fidelity and safety of the
      intervention will be assessed during outpatient PT.

      Discussion: This study is designed to fill a critical clinical need to increase physical
      activity after TKR. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a
      physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. The
      secondary objectives are to evaluate the fidelity and safety of a physical therapist
      administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR and to investigate changes
      in self-reported and performance-based physical function after a physical therapist
      administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. The tertiary objective is
      to explore the association of psychosocial factors with physical activity 6 and 12 months
      after discharge from a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for
      people after TKR. The findings will be used to support a large multi-site clinical trial to
      test the effectiveness, implementation, and cost of this intervention.

    <description>Intervention fidelity will measure the adherence of implementing the physical activity intervention in PT practice. This will be measured by reviewing the participant's home exercise program. We will check if the physical therapist documented that they reviewed the participant's physical activity using the FitbitTM and to see if they reviewed the individualized step goal with the participant in the home exercise program log.</description>

    <measure>Safety of the Physical Activity Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>AE that occur from enrollment to 12-months will document the safety of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured by documenting Adverse Events (AE). An AE is defined as any unfavorable or unintended diagnosis, sign, symptom, or disease associated with the study which may or may not be related to the intervention. In the case of a major AE the principal investigator (PI) and the University of Delaware Internal Review Board (IRB) will be notified immediately. Pre-enrollment AEs will not be included in the safety assessment.</description>

    <description>Standardized PT and a physical activity intervention. Participants will be provided a FitbitTM Zip within one week after enrolling in the study. Participants will self-track their steps/day using their FitbitTM Zip. Participants â‰¤ 3 weeks' post-operative TKR are expected to maintain and not increase steps/day. Beyond 3 weeks after surgery, step goals will be initiated and evaluated on a weekly basis. Progression of weekly steps/day goal will be a joint decision between the participant and physical therapist. As a guide, a 10-20% increase in steps/day until at least 6,000 steps/day is achieved. Each week the physical therapist will review the participant's steps/day goal and if at least 4 of the 7 previous days per week were at or above the prior week's steps/day goal, then next week's steps/day goal will increase. The physical therapist will discuss current steps/day with the participant using the Fitbit TM Zip and set a personalized steps/day goal each week during PT.</description>
