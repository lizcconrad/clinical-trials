  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS, OMIM 210710) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder belonging to
      the group of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfisms (MOPD). This syndrome is
      characterized by short stature, skeletal anomalies, severe microcephaly with brain
      malformations and facial dysmorphism, and is caused by mutations in RNU4ATAC. Although
      RNU4ATAC-associated TALS is a recognizable phenotype, an atypical presentation is sometimes
      observed, thus expanding the clinical spectrum (TALS-like phenotype).

      This study aims to identify new variants involved in Taybi-Linder syndrome and associated
      phenotypes (i.e.TALS-like).

      This non interventional study will be performed on patients with no proven mutation of
      RNU4ATAC and their blood relatives (19 samples total) by high throughput sequencing and
      genetic analysis of already collected deoxyribonucleic acid samples.

      Altogether, such a study will allow a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms
      responsible for the Taybi-Linder syndrome and Taybi-Linder syndrome-like phenotypes as well
      as the pathophysiology of these devastating forms of microcephalic dwarfism.
