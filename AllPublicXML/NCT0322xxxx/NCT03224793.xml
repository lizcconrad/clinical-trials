    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; life-threatening event; requires inpatient hospitalization; significant disability; congenital anomaly; medically important event.</description>
