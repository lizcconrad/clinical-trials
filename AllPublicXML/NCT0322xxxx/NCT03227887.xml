  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand how foods such as Sponge cake or Brioche are broken
      down in the mouth. More specifically, investigators wish to evaluate the link between oral
      physiology (salivation and mastication) and (i) formation of the food bolus during the
      consumption of Sponge cake or Brioche, that is to say the way in which the food is broken
      down to be swallowed (ii) mouthfeel during the consumption of Sponge cake or Brioche, meaning
      the sensations that participant feel when they eat these products.

      The study will take place at the INRA in Dijon during 7 one-hour sessions spread over 3
      months. The first session will allow us to characterise the chewing behaviour of the subjects
      and their salivation, and will enable us to train them in the instructions for the following
      sessions. The 6 other sessions will allow us to study the structure of the food bolus while
      being formed and the mouthfeel of the foods in the project.

      In the first session:

        -  Two samples of saliva will be taken

        -  A video will be made of subjects eating Sponge cake or Brioche

        -  Subjects will be trained in exercises for the following sessions - this will consist in
           chewing the study foods and spitting them out on the experimenter's signal.

      During the 6 other sessions, subjects will be asked to:

        -  Chew one of the study foods and spit it out on the signal of the experimenter.

        -  Evaluate the mouthfeel while eating Sponge cake or Brioche by answering different
           questions. This test will be done during 4 of the 6 sessions.
