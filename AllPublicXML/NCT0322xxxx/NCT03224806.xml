  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health organizations recommend fiber-rich and whole-grain foods for healthy diets due to
      their physiological beneficial effects on human health. But, little information is available
      between these 2 food categories, i.e. fiber added to foods versus fiber naturally present in
      foods. The present study investigated the effect of enriching white wheat flour with wheat
      bran at 2 levels (15 and 30%) to produce 15% fiber-rich bread (15FRB) and 30% fiber-rich
      bread (30FRB) and compared them with white bread (WB) and whole-grain bread (WGB) in terms of
      bread quality, palatability, satiety, and glycemic response. Ten healthy subjects were
      studied on 4 separate days with each subject testing all 4 types of bread. On each test day
      subjects came to the test center after an overnight fast. After 2 fasting finger-prick blood
      samples, they ate a portion of one of the breads containing 50g available carbohydrate and
      had further blood samples at intervals over 2 hours. They also rated their feelings of
      satiety fasting and at intervals over 2 hours.

      samples 5 minutes apart, they ate a portion of one of the breads containing 50g available
      carbohydrate and had further blood samples at 15, 30, 45, 60,90 and 120 min after starting to
      eat. After each blood sample also rated their feelings of satiety on a 7-point scale from
      extremely hungry to extremely full.
