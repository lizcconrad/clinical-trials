  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the dose-response relationship of 2 doses of
      JNJ-42847922 before interim analysis, and potentially 3 doses based on interim analysis
      results, compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy to an antidepressant drug in improving
      depressive symptoms in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have had an
      inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); and to assess the
      safety and tolerability of JNJ-42847922 compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy to an
      antidepressant in participants with MDD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the antidepressant effects of a range of doses of JNJ-42847922
      (seltorexant) (versus placebo), as adjunctive treatment to antidepressant drugs for treatment
      of MDD, and will assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-42847922. The study will be
      conducted in 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 4 weeks), a double-blind treatment phase (6
      weeks), and a post-treatment follow-up phase (2 weeks). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic,
      and biomarker evaluations will be performed in the study at defined timepoints. The duration
      of the study will be up to approximately 12 weeks (84 days).

    <measure>Primary Efficacy Parameter: Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a clinician-administered scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The MADRS evaluates the following 10 items: apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. Each item is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>

    <measure>Primary Safety Parameter: Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>

    <measure>Primary Safety Parameter: Suicidal Ideation Measured Using Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations are not powered for this study. C-SSRS is a clinician rated assessment of suicidal behavior and/or intent. Scale consists of 28 items in 4 sections: suicide behavior, actual attempts, suicidal ideation, and intensity of ideation. Suicidal ideation consists of 5 'yes/no' items: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intention to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act without specific plan, active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent. Only items with yes responses are listed. Worsening of suicidal ideation was an increase in severity of suicidal ideation from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Primary Safety Parameter: Sexual Functioning Measured by the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations are not powered for this study. The ASEX is a 5-item rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm. Possible total scores range from 5 to 30, with the higher scores indicating more sexual dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Primary Safety Parameter: Potential Withdrawal Effects Measured By the Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 to 8</time_frame>

The PWC (20 items; PWC-20) is a simple and accurate method used to assess potential withdrawal symptoms following cessation of treatment. The PWC-20 is a reliable and sensitive instrument for the assessment of discontinuation symptoms. Each individual item score ranges from 0 (not present) to 3 (severe), where higher scores = more affected condition.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Depressive Symptoms Using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 9-item, participant Reported Outcome measure to assess depressive symptoms. The scale scores each of the 9 symptom domains of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th Edition (DSM-5) major depressive disorder (MDD) criteria. Each item is rated on a 4 point scale (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day). The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score (range of 0 to 27), with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

Each of the items has a set of 4 response categories-Definitely Agree (=1), Agree (=2), Disagree (=3), and Definitely Disagree (=4). A total score is created with either of the Disagree responses receiving a score of 1 and either of the Agree responses receiving a score of 0. The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score ranging from 0 to 14. A higher total SHAPS score indicates higher levels of current anhedonia.</description>

It assesses a range of symptoms from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. Ratings are done on a 5-item Likert scale ranging from 'not at all' to 'very much' and 'never' to 'always'.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life and Utility Using the European Quality of Life (EuroQol) Group, 5 Dimension, 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, primarily designed for self-completion by respondents. It consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (Level 1 indicating no problem, Level 2 indicating slight problems, Level 3 indicating moderate problems, Level 4 indicating severe problems, and Level 5 indicating extreme problems). The EQ-VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his or her overall health status at the time of completion, on a scale of 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health you can imagine).</description>

    <description>The WLQ is a 8-item questionnaire self-report rating scale developed to measure the on-the-job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment (&quot;work limitations&quot;). It comprises four dimensions of limitations: handling time, physical, mental-interpersonal, and output demands. Participants respond to each item with options ranging from 'Almost all of the time' to 'none of the time', or 'Does not apply to my job'. Each dimension of limitations will have a scale score ranging from 0 to 100 with lower score indicating low level of work limitations.</description>

             diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), without psychotic features,
             based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for
             DSM-5 Axis I Disorders- Clinical Trials Version (SCID-CT). In addition their major
             depressive episode must be deemed &quot;valid&quot; using the SCID Screening Questionnaire (SSQ)
             interview administered by remote, independent raters. The length of the current
             depressive episode must be less than or equal to (&lt;=) 18 months

          -  Have had an inadequate response to at least 1 but no more than 3 antidepressants,

             measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital-Antidepressant Treatment Response
             Questionnaire (MGH-ATRQ). An inadequate response is defined as less than (&lt;)50 percent
             (%) reduction in depressive symptom severity, as assessed by the MGH-ATRQ. An adequate

             screening. If the results of the clinical laboratory tests are outside the normal
             reference ranges, the participant could be included only if the investigator judges
             the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be
