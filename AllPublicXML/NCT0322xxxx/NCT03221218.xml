  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine whether enhancing screening-informed follow-up letters will improve
      (i) family physician compliance with best practice guidelines for managing persistent
      symptoms following concussion, and (ii) clinical outcomes from concussion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family physicians are well positioned to proactively manage symptoms in the weeks following
      MTBI, which could prevent chronicity and reduce the need for specialist treatment. Clinical
      practice guidelines are now available for MTBI management in primary care, such as those
      developed by the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (ONF). However, awareness and use of these
      guidelines may be low. Distilling the guidelines into a small number of actionable messages
      that are tailored to an individual patient may facilitate family physician implementation.

      The ONF guidelines for MTBI propose that early intervention should prioritize the most
      readily treatable symptoms - mood (depression and anxiety), insomnia, and headaches. The
      present cluster randomized trial will evaluate whether screening for these conditions and
      sending family physicians treatment algorithms for positive screening test results will
      result in earlier evidence-based treatment.

      Patients will be recruited from two concussion clinics that provide group education sessions.
      Following the education session, eligible participants will complete self-reported screening
      measures for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches. Family physicians will be
      randomized to receive these screening test results with associated treatment algorithms from
      the ONF guidelines or a letter providing generic MTBI management recommendations from the ONF
      guidelines (currently done as usual care).

      Patients will be assessed by telephone one month and three months after the intervention. The
      primary outcome will be patient-reported treatment utilization that is congruent with the ONF
      guidelines for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches after MTBI.
