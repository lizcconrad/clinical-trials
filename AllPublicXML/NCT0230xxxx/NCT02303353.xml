      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate the situation regarding ambulant therapy of
      cancer patients in different practices in Germany. It should provide insight into the
      implementation of schemes for cancer therapy predefined in the guidelines, the treatment of
      diverse adverse reactions and the counter measures taken. Thereby, potential differences in
      treatment and with that differences in quality amongst individual practices might be
      identified. The medium to long term aim is to contribute to positively influence the quality
      of medical care of cancer patients in Germany.
