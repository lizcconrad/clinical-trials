  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ixazomib can prevent AML or MDS from
      coming back in patients who are in remission. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take ixazomib capsules
      on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle. Ixazomib capsules should be swallowed whole, with water,
      on an empty stomach (take the dose at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal).

      If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, as long as the next scheduled dose is
      more than 3 days away. If you vomit after taking a dose, do not make up the dose but continue
      with the next scheduled dose as planned.

      You may receive the study drug for up to 12 cycles. If the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest, you may be able to continue taking the study drug beyond Cycle 12.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 1 day):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every third cycle, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status
      of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After your last dose of study drug, you will return to the clinic for an end-of-study visit.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Ixazomib is not FDA-approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

          2. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          3. Female patients who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year, OR Are surgically
             sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective

             days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence when this
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence
             [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception.) Male patients, even if surgically
             sterilized, must agree to one of the following: Agree to practice effective barrier
             contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 90 days after the
             last dose of study drug, OR agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

          4. Patients must have a history of de novo or therapy-related AML (defined by World
             Health Organization (WHO) classification of &gt;/= 20% bone marrow blasts) or high-risk

             salvage therapy as evidenced by &lt;/= 5% bone marrow blasts and absence of
             extramedullary disease. (For patients with prior MDS who then transformed to AML,
             therapy received for MDS is not considered prior therapy for AML)

          6. Patients should have received at least 2 cycles of induction therapy or 1 induction
             and 1 consolidation cycle, OR patient should be considered to have completed all

             screening period.

          2. Failure to have fully recovered (ie, &lt;/= Grade 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects
             of prior chemotherapy.

          3. Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.

          4. Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small, 7 days
             will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and administration of the
             MLN9708.

          5. Known central nervous system involvement
