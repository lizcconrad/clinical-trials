  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a common disease affecting 0.5 to 1% of the general population. Epilepsies
      refractory to drug treatment lead to increased morbidity, mortality and high costs for public
      health (representing 75% of the costs associated with epilepsy is among the most costly
      diseases in Neurology). The only curative therapy is surgical removal or disconnection of the
      epileptogenic network. To do this, a comprehensive presurgical evaluation is essential to
      accurately define the location of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and its relationship with the
      functional areas that must be preserved. This approach requires in some cases intracerebral
      EEG recordings. This latter technique, expensive and invasive, remains at present, the
      standard method in the location of the ZE. In this context, the development of non-invasive
      and inexpensive methods is a priority in the field. Moreover, many fundamental studies have
      shown changes in ion homeostasis including sodium associated with hyperexcitability related
      to epilepsy. The investigators team at CEMEREM, CHU Timone, specialized in the development
      and validation of innovative methods in MRI, has developed an in vivo sodium MRI acquisition
      and processing of data unique in France, capable of quantifying the intracerebral sodium
      concentration in three dimensions in a completely non-invasive and non-irradiating manner
