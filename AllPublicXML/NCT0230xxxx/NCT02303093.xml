      A Non-Interventional Study on the Tolerability and Efficacy of octagam速 10%. Patients with
      any indication (replacement and immonomodulation) as described by the treating physician.
      Marketed Octagam 5% or 10% will be used according to the investigator prescription;
      intravenous (iv) administration.The primary objective is to detect and evaluate adverse drug
      reactions (ADRs) occurring during or after the administration of Octagam in any indication,
      age group or treatment regimen, where a causal relationship to the administration of Octagam
      is suspected.
