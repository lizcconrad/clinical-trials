  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Î¼-opioid receptor agonist methadone is frequently used in adult anesthesia and adult pain
      therapy. Methadone has an extremely long half-life, which confers therapeutic advantage by
      providing more stable plasma concentrations and long-lasting pain relief. Methadone
      perioperative pharmacokinetics and effectiveness in perioperative pain relief in inpatients
      is well characterized. There is, however, no information on methadone use in an ambulatory
      surgery setting and outpatient procedures. This pilot investigation will determine
      effectiveness of intraoperative methadone in reducing postoperative opioid consumption and
      providing improved pain relief in patients undergoing moderately painful, ambulatory surgical
      procedures.

    <description>Data on opioids administered postoperatively will be collected from the subject's EMR. Pain severity will be assessed using Numeric Rating Scale and colored-visual analogue scale. Pain relief postoperatively will be assessed using a 5 point scale [0-no relief, 4-complete relief]</description>

    <description>Daily opioid consumption and daily pain self-assessments using a colored-visual analogue scale will be recorded in a home diary for approx 30 days following surgery (from hospital discharge until postop clinic visit). Additional ORSDS assessments will be recorded at various timepoints (approx 7, 14 and 30 days postop) in the home diary.</description>
