  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      mTOR kinase is part of the mTORC1 complex that promotes cap-dependent protein translation,
      and part of the mTORC2 complex that activates AKT. Everolimus (Afinitor) is an allosteric
      inhibitor of mTOR that suppresses mTORC1 activity. Everolimus is FDA-approved for the
      treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer (in combination with exemestane), renal cell carcinoma,
      subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), and neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin
      (PNET), and is currently being tested in ongoing clinical studies in other indications. While
      everolimus-based therapies elicit anti-cancer effects, most cancers ultimately progress and
      exhibit everolimus resistance. This study will evaluate genetic mechanisms of resistance to
      everolimus.

      Tumor biopsy and surgical specimens obtained through routine clinical procedures and archived
      in the institution's Pathology tissue bank will be used for DNA extraction for genetic
      analysis.

      Blood samples collected prospectively will be used to extract plasma and leukocytes, which
      will be used to extract DNA for genetic analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with everolimus (as a single-agent or in combination) for any malignancy for
             ≥3 months.

          2. A- Patients who are scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated tumor biopsy (as
             standard of care, or as part of another study) within 5 years following cancer
             progression on everolimus are eligible.

             B- Patients who already had such a biopsy procedure performed are eligible. Tumors
             biopsied shortly after progression on everolimus are strongly preferred.

          3. Excess tumor tissue from biopsy must be available for molecular analysis. This will
             include tumor tissue sufficient to make ≥5 five-micron sections; more tumor tissue is
             preferred.

          4. Patients currently seen at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center must be capable and
             willing to provide informed written consent for study participation. Patients who are
             no longer seen at DHMC will not be consented for use of archived tissues and data.

          5. For patients currently seen at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, patients must be
             willing to provide an extra 10-20 mL of blood during a routine, clinically indicated
             blood draw procedure.
