    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 hours after trial medication application</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity (PI) was assessed on a 11-point numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible) at pre-dose baseline and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after trial medication application.
The left side of each scale (0) is marked 'no pain' and the right side of the scale (10) is marked 'worst pain possible'.
PID8h= Pain intensity (PI)8h - PI(baseline).
Means reported are the adjusted means.</description>

    <description>Pain intensity was assessed on a 11-point numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible) at pre-dose baseline and 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after trial medication application. The left side of each scale (0) is marked 'no pain' and the right side of the scale (10) is marked 'worst pain possible'. PID4h= PI(4h) - PI(baseline).

    <measure>Difference of Average Pain Intensity (APID) From Pre-dose Baseline on the Last Individual Treatment Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 to 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Difference of average pain intensity from pre-dose baseline on the last individual treatment day (The last individual treatment day was the last day on which the patient had recorded the study drug applications within the patient diary). Pain intensity was assessed by the patient using 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS).
Patients were given two 0-10 numerical rating scales (NRS) - to self-report of pain intensity at given time points for the period 0-8 hours post first dose and to self-report of average pain intensity they had at each treatment day. The left side of each scale (0) is marked 'no pain' and the right side of the scale (10) is marked 'worst pain possible'. APIDtime point = APItime point - PI baseline (time point is the last individual treatment day (either Day 1, 2, 3 or 4 after drug administration)).
Means reported are the adjusted means.</description>

             regulation prior to participation in the trial.

          2. Patients must agree to cooperate with all trial evaluations and perform all required
             tasks.

          3. Patients must have acute nonspecific low back pain, ICD-10 code: M54.5.

          4. Patients must have acute low back pain for more than 2 days and less than 21 days (= 3
             weeks).

          1. Patients with a significant disease other than acute nonspecific low back pain. A
             significant disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may (i) put the patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii)
             influence the results of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's
             ability to participate in the trial.
