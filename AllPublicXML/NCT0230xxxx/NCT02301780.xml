      Phase III two arm double-blinded randomised controlled trial to examine the effect of
      prophylactic low-dose aspirin from the first-trimester of pregnancy in women at increased
      risk for PET on the incidence and severity of the disease

      Screening and Prevention of Pre-eclampsia (High Blood Pressure): Randomised Trial of Aspirin
      Versus Placebo (ASPRE)

      Screening: All women with singleton pregnancies undergoing routine screening for aneuploidies
      will be invited to participate in the screening study for PET.

      Interventions: Participants who are screened with a high-risk of developing PET will be
      randomised into one of 2 arms of the trial (on the same day as screening or within 1 week of
      the screening visit). Randomised participants will be advised to start 150mg of
      Aspirin/Placebo once per night within 24 hours of randomisation until 36 weeks' gestation or
      when signs of labour commence.

      The maximum duration for aspirin or placebo intake will be 180 days.

      Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria for participant selection for RCT Age
      &gt; 18 years, Singleton pregnancies, Live fetus at 11-13 weeks of gestation, High-risk for
      preterm-PET at 11-13 weeks by the algorithm combining maternal history and characteristics,
      biophysical findings (mean arterial pressure and uterine artery Dopplers) and biochemical
      factors (pregnancy associated plasma protein-A and placental growth factor), English,
      Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch or Greek speaking (otherwise interpreters will be used),
      Informed and written consent.

      Exclusion criteria Multiple pregnancies, Women taking low-dose aspirin regularly
      (administration must have ceased &gt;28days prior to randomisation), Pregnancies complicated by
      major fetal abnormality identified at the 11-13 weeks assessment, Women who are unconscious
      or severely ill, those with learning difficulties, or serious mental illness, Bleeding
      disorders such as Von Willebrand's disease, Peptic ulceration, Hypersensitivity to aspirin or
      already on long term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, Age &lt; 18 years, Concurrent
      participation in another drug trial or at any time within the previous 28 days, Any other
      reason the clinical investigators think will prevent the potential participant from complying
      with the trial protocol.
