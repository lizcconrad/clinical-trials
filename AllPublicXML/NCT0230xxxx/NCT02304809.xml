      Patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced malignancies harboring BRAF genomic
      alterations, the biological target of vemurafenib, and who are no more amenable to curative
      treatment.

      To explore the efficacy of vemurafenib as a single agent across diverse type of tumors guided
      by the presence of identified activating molecular alterations in the vemurafenib target
      gene, per cohort.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a biology driven, trans-tumoral, multicentric phase II trial assessing the efficacy
      and the safety of the targeted agent vemurafenib as a monotherapy in cohorts of patients with
      identified activating molecular alterations in BRAF gene. A cohort is defined by a pathology
      and a BRAF- alteration (eg ovarian cancer with BRAF V600 mutation).

      To explore the efficacy of vemurafenib per pathology and per target. To assess the safety
      profile of vemurafenib. To explore whether molecularly driven, high quality multi-tumor
      screening phase II trials are feasible in the French multiinstitutional, multidisciplinary
      setting.

      To investigate the additional molecular mechanisms in patients with tumor response versus
      patients without tumor response within the same cohort.

      The study will include 11 cohorts of adult patients with the following cancers and
      alterations:

        -  NSCLC V600 mutated

        -  Ovarian cancer V600 mutated

        -  Cholangiocarcinoma V600 mutated

        -  Thyroid cancer V600 mutated

        -  Prostatic cancer V600 mutated

        -  Bladder cancer V600 mutated

        -  Sarcoma/GIST V600 mutated

        -  Multiple myeloma V600 mutated

        -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) V600 mutated

        -  Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) V600 mutated (this excludes Hairy Cell Leukemia variant
           types, marginal zone splenic lymphoma (MZL), splenic red pulp lymphoma (SRPL) patients)

        -  Other pathology / other alteration than those pre-defined above.

      The cohort named &quot;Other&quot; will include adult patients with tumor harboring BRAF genomic
      alterations only tested via emerging biomarkers programs or molecular pangenomic programs:

        -  with any other non-predefined pathology harboring a V600 mutation

        -  Same or other non-predefined pathology harboring non V600 activating mutations

        -  Same or other non-predefined pathology harboring BRAF amplifications.

    <description>Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available, inhibitor of BRAF serine-threonine kinase. Mutations in the BRAF gene which substitute the valine at amino acid position 600 result in constitutively activated BRAF proteins, which can cause cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that would normally be required for proliferation</description>
