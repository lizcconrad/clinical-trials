  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behcet's disease, is a rare disorder that causes inflammation in blood vessels throughout the
      body. The signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease may include mouth sores, eye inflammation,
      skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores that vary from person to person and may come and
      go on their own. The exact cause of Behcet's is unknown, but it may be an autoimmune
      disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy
      cells.

      This study will test whether apremilast is better than placebo (inactive substance in the
      same form as the drug) for the treatment of oral ulcers in subjects with active Behçet's
      disease. Other manifestations of the disease will also be assessed, such as, pain and
      tenderness in joints, eye inflammation, genital ulcers, and skin disease. This study also
      will test how well the body tolerates apremilast.

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design. About 204 subjects will
      participate. The placebo-controlled period will be 12 weeks long and patients will receive
      apremilast or placebo. After the 12-week placebo-controlled period, all subjects will receive
      apremilast for 1 year. All subjects will have their final study visit 4 weeks after stopping
      apremilast treatment.

          -  1. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study
             related assessments/procedures being conducted.

             2. Male and female subjects ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed
             consent document.

             3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 4.
             Diagnosed with Behçet's disease meeting the International Study Group (ISG) criteria
             5. Oral ulcers that occurred at least 3 times in the previous 12-month period,
             including oral ulcers at the Screening Visit.

             6. Subjects must have at least 2 oral ulcers at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), and:

             a. at least 2 oral ulcers at Visit 2 (day of randomization), when Visit 2 occurs at
             least 14 days after Visit 1. OR b. at least 3 oral ulcers at Visit 2 (day of
             randomization), when Visit 2 occurs at any time between 1 day and 42 days after Visit
             1.

             7. Have prior treatment with at least 1 non-biologic Behçet's Disease therapy, such
             as, but not limited to, topical corticosteroids, or systemic treatment.

             8. Candidate for systemic therapy, for the treatment of oral ulcers.

             a. A candidate for systemic therapy is a subject judged by the study Investigator as
             someone whose mucocutaneous ulcers are considered inappropriate for topical therapy
             based on the severity of disease and extent of the affected area, or whose oral ulcers
             cannot be adequately controlled by topical therapy.

             9. Laboratory Measures: Must meet the following laboratory measures:

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

          -  White blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 3000 /L(≥ 3.0 X 10^9/L) and

             ≤ 14,000/L (≤ 14 X 10^9/L )

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 /L (≥ 100 X 109/L)

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (≤ 132.6 μmol/L)

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, SGOT]) and
             alanine transaminase (ALT [serum glutamate pyruvic transaminase, SGPT]) ≥1.5 X ULN.
             Subjects who fail screening due to ≥ 1.5 X ULN AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT will be
             allowed to repeat AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT tests within the Screening Phase. Repeat
             test results should be ≤ ULN (within reference range) to be eligible.

        Laboratory tests will be allowed to be repeated 1 time if, in the Investigator's clinical
        judgment, there is a reasonable possibility of the repeat tests not meeting the exclusion
        values, and with concurrence from the Medical Monitor.

        Contraception Requirements:

        All Females of Child Bearing Potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved contraceptive
        options as described below while taking apremilast and for at least 28 days after
        administration of the last dose of the apremilast.

        At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a FCBP's contraceptive
        measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the Investigator will educate the subject
        regarding contraception options and the correct and consistent use of effective
        contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.

        All FCBP must have a negative pregnancy test at Visits 1 and 2. All FCBP subjects who
        engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved
        contraceptive options described below:

        Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral,
        injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal
        ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or
        non-latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]);
        PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with
        spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide.

        Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which
        conception is possible must use barrier contraception (latex or non-latex condoms NOT made
        out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on IP and for at least
        28 days after the last dose of IP.
