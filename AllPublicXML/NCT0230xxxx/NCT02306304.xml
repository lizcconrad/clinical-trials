      The study aims at screening Israeli Arab men, smokers or past smokers, for abdominal aortic
      aneurysms (AAA).

      The screening is to be performed at the family doctors clinics in the rural arab erea of the
      north of Israel.

      Goals:

      The investigators aim at revealing the actual prevalence of AAA in the Israeli Arab smoking
      men population. By revealing this prevalence we believe the need for a nation-wide screening
      program for AAA will turn available for assessment.

      In addition, the goal of improving the accessibility of health services for the Israeli Arab
      population is a key issue in the design of the research.

      2000 patients are to be enrolled in the study over a period of 2 years. Each of the patients
      will be examined once for a duplex ultra-sound and will be classified into one of 4
      sub-groups according to the maximal aortic diameter found.

      Study Rationale

      In the United States ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are the 15th leading cause of
      death overall and the 10th leading cause of death in men older than 55 years. The prevalence
      of AAA found in population-based ultrasonography (US) screening studies from various
      countries is about 4-9% in men and 1% in women older than 65yr.

      If left untreated, the aneurysm continues to expand; thinning of the aortic wall ensues and
      rupture may eventually occur. Most of large AAA are asymptomatic and often rupture occurs
      with no warning signs.

      Mortality due to rupture of an aortic aneurysm is high (80-90%), compared to 5-7% in elective
      surgery for AAA repair and even lower when treated by endovascular means (1-2%).

      Ultra-sound can reliably demonstrate the aorta in 99% of the population, and its sensitivity
      and specificity in diagnosing AAA approaches 95-100%. Screening with Ultra-sound for AAA has
      been proved in multiple studies to reduce AAA related mortality by an average of 42% in the
      screened population compared with the non-screened population. The reduction in mortality was
      achieved in a cost effective way. Based on such studies a number of screening programs have
      been implemented in the United Kingdom (UK), United States (USA), Scotland and Sweden.

      As for today there is no screening program for AAA in Israel. The investigators would like to
      conduct a study in a specific group of the population demonstrating the need for screening in
      such group.

      The major risk factors for AAA include Age (&gt;65 years), male gender and a history of ever
      smoking. It has been demonstrated that smoking rates among Israeli Arab men are significantly
      higher than those of Israeli Jewish men. Most of the Israeli Arab population inhabits rural
      areas with less access to hospitals and medical centers.

      Therefore, the investigators decided to conduct a prospective study in which Israeli Arab men
      between the ages 60-80 years old, with a history of smoking, will undergo an ultra-sound
      examination for screening for AAA.

      Goals The investigators aim at revealing the actual prevalence of AAA in the Israeli Arab
      smoking men population. By revealing this prevalence the investigators believe the need for a
      nation-wide screening program for AAA will turn available for assessment.

      In addition, the goal of improving the accessibility of health services for the Israeli Arab
      population is a key issue in the design of the research. Performing the screening ultra-sound
      in the family-physician's clinics (see below under &quot;Research Design&quot;) will save the patients
      the time and the trouble involved with being examined in the central vascular clinics. It
      will also improve the knowledge and awareness of the population in general and of the
      family-physicians in particular of the AAA disease and for the need of early diagnosis and
      treatment as mentioned above.

      Last but not least, the private benefit of each patient either from ruling out the option of
      having an AAA or from diagnosis of an AAA and referral to treatment is a valuable by-product
      of the research.

      Research Design 2000 men (according to the inclusion criteria) are planned to be included in
      the &quot;screening study&quot; over a period of one year to two years.

      The family-physicians of the Haifa and Western Galilee district, Clalit Health Services will
      be notified by the head researcher about the research. The organization will be asked to
      provide a list of potential patients according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
      list will only include patients whom the physician had addressed and whom had given their
      approval for being approached by the research team.

      The patients will then be invited for a meeting with one of the researchers at the
      family-physician clinic. After a full explanation will be given, an informed consent form
      will be signed by the patient. Each patient will be documented on a Case Report Form (CRF)
      and will be given a code for the rest of the research. The coding system is aimed at securing
      the confidentiality of the patients' personal and medical information.

      Then after, with the help of the technician a Duplex Ultra-sound examination of the abdominal
      aorta will be performed. Since the examination is performed after a 6 hours fasting period,
      the fasting instruction will be given to the patients in advance. The results of the scans
      will be recorded in each patient Case Report Form (CRF).

      The patient will be classified according to the Duplex US findings into one of 4 sub-groups
      as detailed under &quot;End-Points&quot;. A recommendation for further follow-up or treatment will be
      given to each patient and will be documented in his CRF accordingly. The results of the scan
      and the recommendations will be sent the patient and to his family-physician within a short
      period following the exam.

      It is to be made clear both hereby and in the informed consent form that the consent of the
      patient to participate in the research bares no further obligations to follow the
      recommendations of the research team nor to be followed-up or treated under the umbrella of
      the vascular service of Haifa and Western Galilee district, Clalit Health Services.

      Non-the-less, each of the patients is entitled for full follow-up and treatment by the
      vascular service of Haifa and Western Galilee district, Clalit Health Services regardless of
      his consent to participate in the research or to follow the research team recommendations.

      Each patient will be documented digitally in a separate research file. A copy of the informed
      consent will be given to patient. The same document will be scanned and filed in the patients
      research file. The file will also contain the CRF and the exam results.
