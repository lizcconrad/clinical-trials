  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circadian rhythms, which play crucial roles in physiology, are emerging as important
      regulators of specific immune functions. Hospitalization in intensive care unit leads to a
      deep impairment of circadian rhythm. Infection is a frequent event during ICU
      hospitalization.

      The investigators hypothesis is that in trauma patients the lack of circadian rhythm
      variations is associated with the occurrence of infection. The primary aim of the study is to
      assess the circadian variations of plasma Bmal1 in the occurrence of healthcare related
      infection during the 30 days after inclusion. The secondary aims are to assess the plasma
      expression of circadian genes (Clock, Cry1, Per3, and Rev-erba), the production of cytokines
      in plasma, and the concentration of cortisol, according to the occurrence of an infection.
