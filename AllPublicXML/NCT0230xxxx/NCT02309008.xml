        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy men aged 19 to 65 years at the time of screening

          2. Whose weight is 50 kg or more, but less than 90 kg, and whose body mass index (BMI) is
             18.0 kg/m^2 or more but less than 27 kg/m^2

               -  BMI (kg/m^2) = weight(kg) /{height(m)}^2

          3. Who doesn't have skin disease, skin damage (including tatoos or scars), or excessive
             hair in application area which can affect drug absorption

          4. Who voluntarily decides study participation after receiving detailed explanation about
             the study and fully understanding it and who provides written consent for compliance
             with study requirement including proper contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Who has clinically significant medical history or diseases involving liver, kidney,
             neurological system, respiratory system, endocrine system, urinary system,

             study drug administration, or who has taken any over-the-counter (OTC) drugs or
             vitamins within 1 week before the study drug initiation (Investigators will determine
             his eligibility by considering the effect of the drug on his safety or pharmacokinetic
             results in case other inclusion/exclusion criteria is satisfied.)

          4. Who has drug abuse history or positive result at urine screening tests (cannabinoid,
             opioid, amphetamine, cocaine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine)

          5. Who has smoked within 3 months before study drug administration (Smoker who has
             stopped smoking for more than 3 months before study drug administration is eligible to
             participate)

          6. Who has confirmed positive at serological tests (HBs antigen, HCV antibody and HIV
             antibody)

          7. Who consistently consumes alcohol

          8. Who has participated in other clinical study within 8 weeks before study drug
             administration (however, the last dosing day is considered as the end of clinical
             study.)

          9. Who has had bleeding or blood collection and donation over 400 mL within 8 weeks
             before study drug administration

         10. Who donated whole blood within 2 months before study drug administration, who donated
             via plasmapheresis/plateletpheresis within 1 month before study drug administration,
             or who received a blood transfusion within 1 month before study drug administration

         11. Whose vital sign measured at sitting position after resting at least 3 minutes is as
             following

               -  Low blood pressure (Systolic pressure: less than 90 mmHg, Diastolic pressure:
                  less than 60 mmHg)

               -  High blood pressure (Systolic pressure: higher than 150 mmHg, Diastolic pressure:
                  higher than 100 mmHg)

         12. Who is determined ineligible for study participation by investigators for any reason
             including clinical lab test and ECG results.
