  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a common symptom of respiratory medicine clinic patients, which has complex etiology
      and wide-ranging. Cough is usually divided into three categories by time: acute cough,
      subacute cough and chronic cough. Subacute has a 3~8 weeks course of disease. Its main
      etiology is postinfectious cough, which is mostly secondary to viral infection.Considering
      its overexpression in postinfectious patient, Cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLTs) plays a role in
      gathering eosinophils to respiratory. The level of FENO has a significant correlation with
      inflammatory airway eosinophils. While CysLTs overexpressed in vivo, the level of FENO may
      increase. Montelukast, as CysLTs-receptor-1 antagonists， plays a role of controlling airway
      inflammation and decrease airway high activity by suppressing the biological activity of
      CysLTs. It is effective in theory to therapy sub-acute cough by Montelukast, to short the
      course and to relieve cough symptoms as soon as possible. The aim is to research whether FENO
      can be used as a biomarker to optimized treatment regimen of sub-acute cough.

      This project is a prospective, open label, randomized and controlled trial. All subacute
      cough patients that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were recruited after signing the
      consent form. Patients were randomized into biomarker treatment arm and standard treatment
      arm. Positive or negative biomarker expression was confirmed by assessing fractional
      concentration of exhaled NO (FENO) level, FENO＜25ppb was regarded as negative and FENO≥25ppb
      was regarded as positive.

      Patients in biomarker guided positive treatment arm were given Montelukast Sodium Tablets
      (p.o., 10mg, q.d.) . Patients in biomarker guided negative treatment arm were given placebo
      tablets(p.o., 10mg, q.d.). Patients in standard treatment arm were given Montelukast Sodium
      Tablets (p.o., 10mg, q.d.).All treatment regimens lasted for 10 days and no other
      antitussive/decongestant or bronchodilators are given to any patients.

      Examine results of all patients from all arms were recorded before and after the 10 day
      treatment. The examine recorded are FENO levels, cough symptom assessment, cough visual
      assessment, Leicester cough questionnaire, total white blood cell count, neutrophil blood
      percentage, eosinophil blood percentage. Patient cough free days after treatment and
      Montelukast Sodium Tablets . Follow up was carried out at the 8th week after first record of
      symptom and 2 month after treatment.
