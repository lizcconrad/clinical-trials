  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled trial of subjects with
      advanced (Barcelona stage B/C) hepatocellular carcinoma. Subjects will be receive one
      treatment with Trans-Arterial Chemo-Embolization (TACE) prior to randomization. Subsequently,
      subjects will be randomized to observation or, if indicated, up to an additional TACE
      treatments, or to Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT). Tumor response following
      interventions will be evaluated at three months.

    <description>TACE is a treatment modality where local delivery of an anti-neoplastic agent is performed through the feeding artery of the tumor followed by end embolization of the artery. The goal of TACE is to cause tumor necrosis and tumor control via acute arterial occlusion while preserving as much functional liver tissue as possible.</description>

    <description>This intervention adds Stereotactic Body Radiation (SBRT) to TACE therapy. SBRT is the precise administration of large doses of radiotherapy delivered over 1-5 treatments to extra-cranial tumors.</description>
