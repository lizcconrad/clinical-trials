    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of stereotactic body radiation therapy and
      pazopanib hydrochloride in treating patients with kidney cancer who are not able to undergo
      surgery. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers
      high doses of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less
      damage to normal tissue. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking an enzyme needed for cell growth. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride before stereotactic
      body radiation therapy may help make the tumor smaller and be an alternative treatment for
      patients who cannot undergo surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of treatment related toxicity reports following stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) as a determination of the
      tolerability of combined therapy in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tumor diameter/volume change prior to and following pazopanib treatment
      prior to SBRT.

      II. To determine the impact of pre SBRT pazopanib therapy on radiation therapy target volumes
      for evidence of tumor shrinkage.

      III. To evaluate tumor change in radiation therapy target volumes and the incidence of
      treatment related toxicity reports and sparing of non-involved nephron.

      IV. Report change in tumor control following pazopanib and SBRT as evaluated by post
      treatment repeat biopsy and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) daily for up to 60 days. Patients then
      continue to receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily and undergo SBRT every other day over
      days 60-65.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is considered a poor surgical candidate for removal of a renal mass as
             determined by pre-operative assessment due to the following factors or various
             combinations thereof:

               -  Significant comorbidity precluding ability to deliver anesthesia, without
                  compromised ability to undergo systemic chemotherapy with pazopanib as deemed by
                  the Urologist and Medical Oncologist

               -  Medically documented contraindication for surgery due to religion or risk of
                  blood transfusion

               -  Size or location of tumor deemed high risk for surgical intervention by Urologist

               -  Unacceptable risk for anesthesia, such as history of malignant hyperthermia

               -  Any one of these factors may or may not constitute unresectability, but for
                  consideration for this trial, the surgical and medical oncologist must agree that
                  the particular constellation of findings for the patient under consideration
                  would likely entail a low probability (&lt; 50%) that the tumor would be resectable
                  (with negative margins) or that the potential morbidity associated with an
                  attempt at surgical resection would not be clinically acceptable

               -  The numerical thresholds noted above are only a guideline and the clinical
                  judgment of the surgeon and medical oncologist will determine unresectability or
                  if patient refuses surgery or other forms of local therapy; the histopathology
                  for this cohort is limited to clear cell carcinoma of the kidney

          -  Patient is able to give and sign study specific informed consent

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to registration for women
             of childbearing potential and agrees to use contraception for the duration of the
             treatment cycle and for a minimum of 30-days following the end of therapy (a minimum
             estimate 95 days)

             and/or MRI within 6 months of screening is required

          -  Patient has inadequate organ function as defined by:

               -  Serum aspartate transaminase (AST; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
                  [SGOT]) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
                  [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Urine to protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio &lt; 1; if UPC &gt; 1, then a 24-hour urine
                  protein must be assessed; subjects must have a 24-hour urine protein value &lt; 1 g
                  to be eligible
