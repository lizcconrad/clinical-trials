  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and activity of RO7009789 administered in combination with atezolizumab
      (ATZ) in participants with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. The study will be
      conducted in two Parts (I and II), with Part I divided into Parts IA and IB. All participants
      will be followed up for survival until death or loss of follow-up after the last visit or
      withdrawal of consent.
