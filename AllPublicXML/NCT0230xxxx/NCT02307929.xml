  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past two decades, as a result of population aging and shifts in patient needs, we have
      seen an increased demand for chronic disease management (CDM) delivered in the community. The
      Hong Kong Government introduced six nurse allied health clinics (NAHC) programme to assist
      the delivery of care to facilitate the increased demand on chronic disease management (CDM)
      in the community, which are currently being piloted within the government funded general
      outpatient clinics (GOPC) of the Hospital Authority (HA). These programmes are designed to
      enhance CDM in primary care through patient empowerment and use of multi-disciplinary nurse
      and allied health led teams, and aim for secondary prevention and treat-to-target for
      specific health conditions. This model of care has already been established in a number of
      countries, namely United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and United States, where
      multi-disciplinary allied-health clinics, nurse practitioners and nurse-led clinics have
      already been integrated into routine practice in primary care (Thomas, Cullum et al. 2000;
      Laurant, Reeves et al. 2005).

      The six NAHC programmes which have been developed to date address falls prevention (FP),
      continence care (CC), mental wellness (MW), wound care (WC), respiratory disease management
      (respiratory clinic) and medication management and compliance (MMCC). The evaluation on the
      QOC is an essential part of the programme in order to inform future policy. he Department of
      Family Medicine and Primary Care (FMPC) of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) has been
      appointed by the HA to carry out the evaluation of the QOC of the programme.

      The Action Learning and Audit Spiral methodologies to measure whether the target standard of
      care intended by the NAHC programme is achieved. Each NAHC participating clinic will be
      invited to complete a structured evaluation questionnaire. Anonymized data of all patients
      who have enrolled into the NAHC programme for more than 6 months will be included in the
      evaluation on the process and outcomes of care. Data on the process of care will be retrieved
      from the HA medical records.

      In-depth study of NAHC CC programme: In order to compare the outcomes over time between
      subjects who have and who have not participated in the NAHC Continence Care Programme, three
      hundred and sixty control patients who have not been enrolled into the NAHC CC programme will
      be selected for the comparison in the outcomes of care. Subjects will be followed up by
      telephone to evaluate the effect of the programme in quality of life (QOL), patient
      enablement, and global rating of change in health condition at baseline , 12-month and
      24-month after enrollment.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are the proportion of participants who have
      received the planned process of care and have improvement in clinical outcomes.

      Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics on proportions meeting the QOC criteria will be
      calculated. The changes in clinical, service and patient reported outcomes between baseline
      and discharge will assessed by paired sample t-test. The audit cycle will be repeated 4 times
      over a period of 5 years.

      In-depth study of NAHC CC programme: the clinical outcomes between NAHC CC subjects and
      control group will be compared by independent sample t-test or Chi-square test.

      Results: The QOC of the NAHC programme will be determined. Areas of deficiency and possible
      areas for quality enhancement will be identified.

      Conclusion: The results of this study will provide empirical evidence on whether the HA's
      NAHC programmes enhance the QOC of their participating patients. This information will be
      used to guide service planning and policy decision making.
