    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of intranasal administration of OT on
      behavior and discourse of insecure adolescents during a disagreement (stressful situation)
      with parents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional dysregulation and impaired attachment in adolescence are seen by clinical
      researchers as potential contributors to development of psychopathology. Recent evidence
      suggests that administration of intranasal OT may facilitate social interaction by
      attenuating the stress response to interpersonal conflict. However, to date there have been
      no studies investigating the effects of intranasal OT on parent-adolescent interaction and on
      neurophysiological emotional strategies in adolescence. To understand these mechanisms, this
      study examines the effects of OT on interpersonal emotional regulation in adolescent-parent
      stressful interaction, and on individual visual and physiological strategies in the
      visualizing attachment-related emotions pictures.

      The main objective will be to evaluate the effect of intranasal administration of OT on
      behavior and discourse of insecure adolescents during a disagreement (stressful situation)
      with one of his parents.

      Secondary is determine the effect of OT on visual exploration strategies and on the
      physiological responses (heart rate, galvanic skin response) on images elicited
      attachment-related emotions in insecure adolescents.

      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel designs, 60 healthy male
      adolescents classified with an insecure attachment will receive 24 IU of intranasal OT or
      placebo, 45 min before the experimental tasks. Adolescent will be invited with his/her parent
      to an experimental conflict discussion. The conflict session will be videotaped and coded for
      verbal and nonverbal interaction behavior (e.g., eye contact, nonverbal positive/negative
      behavior, and self-disclosure) with GPACS. Eye tracking and physiological responses will be
      recorded simultaneously and continuously during pictures viewing.

    <description>OT spray will be performed by the research pharmacy at the University Regional Hospital Pharmacy of Besançon. The placebo contained all inactive ingredients except for the neuropeptide. Placebo and OT spray containers will be prepared to look identical and will be counterbalance to be randomly assigned by the pharmacy as well. Double blinding and randomization of patients in the two groups will also be carried out by the pharmacy service. Researchers, as well as participants, will be blinded to the content of the spray. Participants will be instructed to sit and take one puff every 30 seconds, alternating nostrils. Participant will take each dose in front of the clinician to assure correct administration and tolerability.</description>
