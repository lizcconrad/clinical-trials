  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, prospective, monocentric study to assess clinical features, imaging and
      biologic biomarkers in Parkinson disease (PD) patients and rate of progression compared to
      healthy controls (HC) and subjects at risk to develop PD.

      The primary objective of this study is to identify clinical, imaging and biologic markers of
      PD onset and progression for use in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICEBERG will be a four-year natural history study of de novo idiopathic PD patients, healthy
      controls, and subjects at risk to develop PD (idiopathic Rem Behavior Disorder -iRBD, and
      probants of patients with PD genetically confirmed).

      All subjects will be comprehensively assessed at baseline and every year thereafter. Subjects
      will undergo clinical (motor, neuropsychiatric, sleep, ocular and cognitive evaluations) and
      imaging assessments. Blood (including a DNA sample), stools, skin biopsy and cerebral spinal
      fluid (CSF) samples will be collected.

    <description>Slopes of change of clinical, imaging and biomics compared between PD patients, subjects at risk to develop PD and healthy subjects.
Identification of predictive factors of these rates of change. As examples, outcomes include: MDS-UPDRS, Mattis dementia rating scale, Non Motor Signs scale, DAT striatal uptake.</description>

    <time_frame>4 years (annual visits)</time_frame>
    <description>Occurence of complications such as falls, freezing, dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, cognitive impairment, dysautonomia.
Identification of predictive factors of these complications. Rates of progression in sub-groups of patients defined by the presence of these complications.</description>

    <measure>Prodromal features in subjects at risk to develop PD</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years (annual visits)</time_frame>
    <description>Prodromal features such as anosmia, dysautonomia, color vision impairment, will be evaluated at inclusion and during followup in subjects with iRBD or first-degree relatives of genetically confirmed PD patients.
Frequency of these features will be compared between subjects who phenoconvert and those who don't.
Relation between baseline DatSCAN binding and risk of phenoconversion will be analysed.</description>

    <measure>Phenoconversion in subjects at risk to develop PD</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years (annual visits)</time_frame>
    <description>Phenoconversion is defined as occurence of an extrapyramidal syndrome, confirmed 12 months later.
Exploratory analysis to determine whether rates of progression clinical, imaging and biomic markers may predict phenoconversion in groups of patients with iRBD or probants of patients with PD genetically confirmed.</description>
