    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the treatment effects of an
      internet-delivered CBT-program for adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is prevalent and associated with low quality of life in
      adolescents. Medical or dietary treatments lack evident efficiency, while psychosocial
      interventions, i.e. cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)has shown promising effects in
      face-to-face treatments. Therapists trained to deliver CBT for IBS are scarce, leading to a
      situation where very few adolescents with IBS receive the only evidence-based intervention.
      Exposure-based internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) for adults with IBS has shown strong stable
      effects and cost-efficency. Our aim is to develop a treatment that enhances the availability
      to evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents with IBS. Such a treatment could
      swiftly be implemented in regular health care for this large population. The main purpose of
      this study is to compare the effectiveness of exposure-based ICBT to treatment as usual
      (wait-list) for adolescents with IBS.

    <time_frame>Weekly during treatment (treatment week 1-9). Baseline to 10 weeks, baseline to 9 months, baseline to 15 months, baseline to 27 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain intensity measured with a self-rating scale weekly during treatment for mediation analyses, and from baseline to 10 weeks, baseline to 9 months, baseline to 15 months, baseline to 27 months for analysis of effect.The Faces Pain Scale is a self-report measure used to assess the intensity of children's pain. Faces have four faces representing least pain and most pain on equal intervals on a scale from 0-10. Its validity is supported by a strong positive correlation (r=0.93, N=76) with a visual analogue scale (VAS) measure in children aged 5-12 years. The metric for scoring (0-10) conforms closely to a linear interval scale.</description>

    <description>Change in IBS-specific behaviors measured with a self-rating scale weekly during treatment for mediation analyses, and from baseline to 10 weeks, baseline to 9 months, baseline to 15 months, baseline to 27 months for analysis of effect. IBS-BRQ is a self-rating scale measuring IBS-specific behavioral responses shown to be unhelpful and probably maintain IBS-symptoms. The scale consists of 26 items on a seven-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 7 (always). The scale includes items related to avoidance behavior such as &quot;I avoid certain social situations (e.g. restaurants) because of my IBS&quot; and to toilet behavior such as &quot;I spend more time on the toilet than ideally I would like&quot;. IBS-BRQ is both reliable and valid with a high degree of internal consistency for adults with IBS (Cronbach's α=.86). The scale differentiate significantly between IBS patients and healthy controls (F=221, P&lt;.01).</description>

It is a self-report scale with 10 items on daily hassles and the current feeling of being able to handle problems that need to be addressed. It is a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). It is a widely used questionnaire to measure perceived stress and has adequate internal and test-retest reliability.</description>

Two items affect frequency of worry about not being able to do things now, and in the future because of the pain. Questions are answered on a 6-point scale from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 6 (&quot;very much&quot;).

    <description>Change in function measured with a self-report scale at baseline to 10 weeks, baseline to 9 months, baseline to 15 months, baseline to 27 months. Functional disability index (FDI) have15 items on daily activities. Questions are related to specific activities such as climbing stairs, running 100 meters and to go shopping, and general activities such as eating meals and being in school all day. The scale ranges from 1 (no problem at all) to 5 (impossible). It is validated for children and adolescents with chronic abdominal pain with high internal consistency, α = .86 for boys and α = .91 for girls (Claar and Walker, 2006). FDI is the scale that is recommended in pediatric pain studies to measure the influence of pain on function (McGrath et al., 2008).</description>

    <description>The Internet-delivered exposure treatment is based on the well-established internet-delivered CBT-treatment for IBS in adults, and adapted for adolescents and their parents. The feasibility of the treatment were tested in a pilot study during 2012. Components in the treatment are exposure for symptoms and parent training. The purpose of the treatment is to reduce fearful and anxious responses to symptoms and lessen avoidance of symptoms in the adolescents, and to teach the parents how parental behavior can influence symptoms in children. Detailed behaviour analysis is made for each individual and instruction is given on how to gradually expose to symptoms to lessen fear for symptoms and widen the behavioral repertoire.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 13-17 at inclusion date.

          -  fulfilling Rome III-criteria for IBS with a written statement from patient's physician
             confirming a diagnosis of IBS and negative required tests (Blood samples: C-reactive
             protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Blood count and IgA-Transglutaminase.
             Stool: f-Calprotectin).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  concurrent serious medical conditions.

          -  a psychiatric diagnosis, judged to be a more important treatment target than the
             abdominal pain.

          -  on-going psychological treatment.

          -  absence from school exceeding an average of 2 days a week is a cause for exclusion
             since high absence demands more intensive interventions than can be offered in ICBT.

          -  on-going abuse or severe parental psychiatric illness in the family.

          -  since treatment format assumes normal reading and writing skills, pronounced language
             skill deficits and learning difficulties lead to exclusion from the study.

          -  lack of regular internet-access.
