  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Flomoxef. Flomoxef is being tested in people
      with a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) including a kidney infection. This study
      compares Flomoxef to Cefepime, another antibiotic.

      The study enrolled 13 patients.

      Participants are randomly assigned by a computer generated number to one of two treatment
      groups:

        -  Flomoxef - intravenous infusion 2g twice daily (every 12 hours); or

        -  Cefepime - intravenous infusion 1g twice daily (every 12 hours).

      This multi-center trial is conducted at 4 sites in the Russian Federation. The overall time
      to participate in this study is 30+/-3 days. Participants make six visits to the clinic.

      Study was prematurely terminated due to administrative and strategic reasons.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Resolution of All Clinical Symptoms of a Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (cUTI) at the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 7 to 14</time_frame>
    <description>At the EOT visit (Days 7 to 14), the Investigator collected information about each symptom and performed a judgement about the participant's status. Clinical symptoms present at trial entry were considered to be resolved if the participant has no pyuria; no fever; no malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or costo-vertebral angle pain or tenderness; and no symptoms of dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, suprapubic discomfort, new urinary incontinence, or worsening of pre-existing incontinence. Resolution of all clinical symptoms of cUTI were assessed relative to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Microbiological Success at the EOT and Test-of-Cure (TOC) Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7 to 14 and 14 to 21</time_frame>
    <description>A urine sample was collected at EOT (Days 7 to 14) and TOC (Days 14 to 21) visits to determine level of uropathogen. Cultures of urine sample were processed by calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Microbiological success was defined as bacterial uropathogen level of &lt;10^4 CFU/mL. Microbiological response was categorized as:microbiological eradication/persistence/new infection/superinfection. An infection was eradicated if all uropathogens isolated at study entry at a level ≥10^4 CFU/mL have decreased to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL, persistent if level of uropathogen has increased by ≥10^4 CFU/Ml. A new infection, if there is isolation and growth of a uropathogen other than original pathogen and superinfection if there is growth of a uropathogen other than original pathogen at a level ≥10^4 CFU/mL. Microbiological success was assessed relative to baseline.</description>

    <description>A urine sample was collected from the participants at the EOT (Days 7 to 14) and TOC (Day 14 to 21) visits to determine the level of uropathogen. Cultures of the urine sample were processed by using a calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 CFU/mL. Microbiological response at the TOC visit was based on the same grades as for the EOT visit. The infection was considered to be eradicated if all uropathogens isolated at study entry at a level equal to or greater than 10^4 CFU/mL have decreased to less than 10^4 CFU/mL.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Treatment-Emergent-Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

        <description>A urine sample was collected at EOT (Days 7 to 14) and TOC (Days 14 to 21) visits to determine level of uropathogen. Cultures of urine sample were processed by calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Microbiological success was defined as bacterial uropathogen level of &lt;10^4 CFU/mL. Microbiological response was categorized as:microbiological eradication/persistence/new infection/superinfection. An infection was eradicated if all uropathogens isolated at study entry at a level ≥10^4 CFU/mL have decreased to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL, persistent if level of uropathogen has increased by ≥10^4 CFU/Ml. A new infection, if there is isolation and growth of a uropathogen other than original pathogen and superinfection if there is growth of a uropathogen other than original pathogen at a level ≥10^4 CFU/mL. Microbiological success was assessed relative to baseline.</description>

          <description>At Visit 3 (Day 3) and at the TOC (Days 14 to 21) and LFU visits (Day 30), the Investigator collected information about each symptom and performed a judgement about the participant's status. Clinical symptoms present at trial entry were considered to be resolved if the participant has no pyuria; no fever; no malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or costo-vertebral angle pain or tenderness; and no symptoms of dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, suprapubic discomfort, new urinary incontinence, or worsening of pre-existing incontinence. Resolution of all clinical symptoms of cUTI were assessed relative to baseline.</description>

Microbiological response at the TOC visit was based on the same grades as for the EOT visit.

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>
