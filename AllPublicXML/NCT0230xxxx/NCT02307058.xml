    <textblock>
      The BLaStM clinical trial extends the Phase I LEAD trial and compares the LEAD SBRT upfront
      technique for increasing dose to the MP-MRI defined GTVs to the HEIGHT method of using a
      moderate hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost to the MP-MRI defined GTVs through
      the course of radiotherapy. The hypothesis is that alternate mechanisms of cell death,
      including bystander effects, are put in place when doses above 8 Gy per fraction are used in
      a lattice on the first day of treatment and that the effects on local tumor eradication will
      be greater using this strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) is a commonly applied primary (initial definitive) treatment alternative to
      prostatectomy that allows for preservation of anatomy and the potential for improved
      functional outcome with better tumor targeting and normal tissue sparing. About 30-50% of men
      ultimately develop biochemical failure (BF) after RT. Persistence of disease in the dominant
      lesion is indicated to be a common mechanism responsible for progression. Prostate cancer has
      a long natural history. BF typically precedes clinical progression to metastasis by many
      years and local persistence has been implicated. While survival at 10 years is high overall,
      quality of life is affected by failure of any kind. Pathologic complete response (PathCR) by
      standard ultrasound guided systematic prostate biopsies at 2-3 years after RT is the
      strongest post-treatment (post-Tx) predictor of patient outcome yet identified.
      Multiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) parameters identify dominant tumor areas in the prostate with a
      fairly high sensitivity and specificity, and MP-MRI directed biopsies should, therefore,
      further strengthen the association between prostate biopsy results and patient outcome.

      The proposed research compares two previously explored methods (LEAD and HEIGHT) for
      escalating dose to MP-MRI defined prostate regions directly and addresses the goals of 1)
      improving local control via targeted radiotherapy (RT) dose escalation to the MP-MRI defined
      high risk (dominant) tumor areas using PathCR based on MP-MRI-directed biopsies at 2-2.5yr
      after treatment as the primary endpoint; 2) preserving quality of life by minimizing dose to
      the nearby organs at risk around the prostate; and 3) establishing the relationship of pre-
      and serial post-Tx MP-MRI parameters to PathCR.

    <description>HEIGHT RT: Radiotherapy will begin within two months of fiducial marker placement. The therapy will consist of 38 fractions over ~7.5 weeks. The MRI defined GTV will receive a higher dose per day than the clinical tumor volume (CTV) by dose painting. The GTV will receive an absolute dose of 91.2 Gy. Assuming an α/β ratio of 3.0, this would be equivalent to 98.5 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions. The prostate plus proximal seminal vesicles CTV1 will receive 76 Gy in 38 fractions (Fxs) at 2.0 Gy per Fx. For High Risk patients, the distal SVs (CTV2) may be treated to 56 Gy in 38 Fxs or full IMRT dose of 76 Gy, and the pelvic lymph nodes (CTV3) may be treated to 56 Gy in 38 Fxs.</description>

        Eligibility Criteria:

          -  A. Biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma (including ductal) of the prostate.

          -  B. T1-T3 disease based on digital rectal exam.

          -  C. No evidence of metastasis by any clinical criteria or available radiographic tests
             (N0M0 by clinical or imaging criteria).

          -  D. Gleason score 6-10.

          -  E. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is at the discretion of the treating physician;
             but, must be decided (none, short-term or long-term as counted from the luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist injection) prior to enrollment.
             An anti-androgen (e.g., bicalutamide at 50 mg per day po) is recommended to start
             prior to LHRH agonist injection (not recommended for LHRH antagonist injection) and is
             recommended to not be administered for more than 4 months. However if it is planned,
             the following restrictions apply:

               -  i. It may be initiated no more than 3 months prior to the signing of consent

               -  ii. It must be started prior to the start of radiotherapy and

               -  iii. The total length planned must be ≤ 30 months

          -  F. Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) ≤ 100 ng/mL within (+/-) 4 months of signing of

             of &gt;15 ng/ml, should have a bone scan within (+/-) 4 months of signing of consent that
             is without evidence of metastasis. A questionable bone scan is acceptable if
             additional imaging studies (e.g., plain x-rays, CT, or MRI) do not confirm for
             metastasis.

          -  H. Suspicious peripheral zone or central gland lesion on MP-MRI

               -  i. Peripheral zone: Distinct lesion on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)

             stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (well-differentiated small cell lymphocytic
             lymphoma). If a prior malignancy is in remission for ≥ 5 years then the patient is
             eligible.

          -  L. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  M. Zubrod performance status ≤ 2. (Karnofsky or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) performance status may be used to estimate Zubrod).

          -  N. Willingness to fill out quality of life/psychosocial forms.
