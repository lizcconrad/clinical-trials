      Objective of this study is the comparative assessment of the beneficial impact of the Viscoat
      viscoelastic (OVD) and Visthesia OVD on endothelial cells and corneal edema following
      torsional-ip cataract extraction surgery.

      Participants will be recruited from the Cataract Service of the University Hospital of
      Alexandroupolis (UHA) in a consecutive-if-eligible basis. Eligibility criteria include
      diagnosis of senile cataract with stage 3 nuclear opalescence according to the Lens Opacities
      Classification System III (LOCS-3) grading scale. By means of a custom computer randomization
      program all participants will randomly populate two study groups according to the OVD used
      (ie. viscoat or visthesia).

    <description>Cataract extraction surgery performed with the Alcon Infiniti VisionSystem platform. Pupils were dilated with Tropicamide 0.5% (Tropixal, Demo, Greece) and Phenylephrine Hydrochloride 5% (Phenylephrine, Cooper, Greece). Periorbital skin and the lids were cleaned and the conjuctival cul-de-sac was irrigated with povidone iodine (Betadine). Patients received topical anesthesia with propacaine hydrochloride 0.5% drops (3 drops prior to surgery). By means of a 2.75mm, superior-temporal (eleven o'clock), self-sealing, clear-cornea incision 3% Sodium Hyaluronate, 4% Chondroitin Sulfate (Viscoat, Alcon, Greece) was injected in the anterior chamber</description>
