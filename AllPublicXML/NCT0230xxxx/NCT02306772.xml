    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single-site trial to evaluate the drug release, using
      Scintigraphic images and mesalazine plasma levels (PK) in healthy subjects. Overall, nine [9]
      subjects per prototype coating (a total of 18) will be evaluated. Eligible subjects will be
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive radio-labelled TP05; the first 9 subjects will receive
      formulation B and the second 9 subjects will receive formulation A. The subjects will be
      treated once with the radio-labelled study medication.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects, male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, between 18 and 55 years
             old. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to the intake of study drug, and must use a hormonal (oral, implantable or
             injectable) or a double barrier method of birth control throughout the study. Females
             unable to bear children must have documentation of such in the source records (i.e.,
             tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or post-menopausal [defined as a minimum of one year
             since the last menstrual period]).

          2. Ability of subject to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial.

          3. Voluntarily signed informed consent must be obtained and documented.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participating in a clinical study involving investigational drugs or dosage forms
             within the previous 2 months.

          2. History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          3. Radiation exposure from clinical trials, including that from the present study and
             from diagnostic X-ray but excluding background radiation, exceeds 5 mSV in the last 12
             months or 10 mSv in the last 5 years. No subject whose occupational exposure is
             monitored will participate in the study.

          4. Any nuclear medicine procedure prior to study day 1 that might interfere with the
             scintigraphic images that are acquired.

          5. Clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, haematology or urine analyses:

               -  White blood count &lt; 3 x 109/L and &gt; 8 x 109/L

               -  Lymphocyte count &lt; 0.85 x 109/L

               -  Haemoglobin &lt; 110 g/L

               -  Platelet count &lt; 125 x 109/L or &gt; 600 x 109/L

               -  Alanine-Aminotransferase (ALT) or Aspartate-Aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2x upper
                  limit normal

               -  Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2x upper limit normal

               -  Serum Creatinine &gt; upper limit normal

          6. History of gastrointestinal surgery, with the exception of appendectomy unless it was
             performed within the previous 12 months.

          7. History of cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory and particularly
             gastrointestinal disease, especially peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding,
             ulcerative colitis, Crohn`s disease or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (within the previous
             12 months).

          8. History of adverse reaction or allergy to Mesalazine or other salicylates.

          9. Acute diarrhoea or constipation in the 14 days before the predicted first study day.
             If screening occurs &gt;14 days before first study day, this criterion is to be
             determined on the first study day. Diarrhoea will be defined as the passage of liquid
             faeces and/or qa stool frequency of &gt; 3 times per day. Constipation will be defined as
             a failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day.

         10. Donation of blood within the previous three months.

         11. Positive HBV-Antigen (Hepatitis-B), HCV-Antibody (Hepatitis-C) or HIV-Antibody (Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus) results.

         12. Over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medication (including laxatives, vitamin-pills
             and natural herbal remedies) between screening visit (visit 1) and completion of the
             study. Occasional paracetamol or acetyl-salicyl-acid is permitted.

         13. Failure to satisfy the Principle Investigator to participate for any other reason.
