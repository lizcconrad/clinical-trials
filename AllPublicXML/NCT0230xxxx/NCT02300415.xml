  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis and sepsis shock are common in emergency department, with a high mortality
      rate. The potential severity of this disease impose a diagnosis as early as possible to start
      antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic support. Conventional biomarkers are an important support
      for the emergency physician. However, comparison of sensitivity and specificity for new
      biomarkers, like presepsine, suggests that they can be more efficient in this area.

      In this single-center, prospective, non-interventional study, we propose to compare the
      sensitivity of presepsine to that of lactate for the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic
      shock We emit to main hypothesis that the sensitivity of presepsine is higher than that of
      lactate for the diagnosis of severe sepsis.

      Severe sepsis and sepsis shock are common in emergency department, with a high mortality
      rate. The potential severity of this disease impose a diagnosis as early as possible to start
      antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic support. The conventional biomarkers are an important
      support for the emergency physician. However, comparison of sensitivity and specificity for
      new biomarkers, like presepsine, suggest that they can be more efficient in this indication.
      Presepsine is a soluble fragment of CD14, its concentration is a reflection of cellular
      activity (macrophages and monocytes) in response of a sepsis's aggression. Today, it's
      possible to asses the presepsine value at bedside, with new device (PATHFAST), in just 17
      minutes, reinforcing the interest for this biomarker.

      We will conduct a single-center, prospective, non-interventional study, between december 2014
      and July 2015 in the university emergency department of Nice. The primary outcome is to
      compare the sensitivity of presepsine to lactate for the diagnosis of severe sepsis and
      septic shock. The dosage of presepsine will be made in 194 patients over 18 years old , with
      at least two S.I.R.S criteria, a suspected infection, and the presence of one organ failure.

      The secondary outcomes are to asses the link between the presepsine value and the germ
      responsible of sepsis, the correlation between presepsine value at the admission and the
      mortality at J-28. And we will try to determine if there is a correlation between the initial
      presepsine value, and the P.I.R.O score.
