  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multi-center, single-dose, parallel group study to determine the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of cobimetinib administered at 10 mg to fasted
      male and female adult subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function. The study will be
      conducted based on the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic impairment. The anticipated
      duration of the study is 7.5 weeks. The target sample sizes are: 18 volunteers with varying
      degrees of hepatic function and up to 12 healthy control volunteers.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed.

          <title>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</title>
          <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
