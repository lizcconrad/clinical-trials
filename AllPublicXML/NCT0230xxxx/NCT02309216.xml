      The purpose: to pilot whole-body MRI scanning in infants who are already getting brain MRI
      for suspected child abuse

      Research design: prospective, blinded reading of Whole-Body MRI (WB-MRI) images during the
      routine care of the hospitalized infant with comparison to routine radiographic skeletal
      survey images

      Procedures to be used: whole-body MRI images

      Risks and potential benefits: no additional risk (the infant will be receiving and MRI of
      their brain as part of routine care, the additional images will be obtained at the same time
      without additional sedation); benefits to the infant include the identification of injuries
      which would have otherwise been missed by routine care importance of knowledge that may
      reasonably be expected to result: results from this study will potentially influence the use
      of radiographic skeletal survey and decrease the radiation exposure to infants being
      evaluated for suspected child abuse.
