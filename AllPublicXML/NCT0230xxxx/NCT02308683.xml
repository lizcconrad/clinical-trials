  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence supports a central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of
      atherosclerosis and diabetes [57-60]. Diabetes Mellitus type 2 is an inflammatory
      atherothrombotic condition associated with high prevalence of thrombotic cardiovascular
      disease. In patient with DM type 2, this inflammation is reflected by elevated plasma levels
      of several biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) [51-55]. HsCRP is
      considered as a strong predictive of cardiovascular risks and death [53, 61-72]. Besides its
      predictive role in determining cardiovascular risk, there is some evidence that CRP may
      represent an active participant in atherogenesis [54]. CRP is expressed in human
      atherosclerotic plaques and both vascular cells and monocytes/macrophages appear to represent
      a significant source of CRP in the inflammatory vessel wall [54].

      Among the DM risk factors (like hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance,
      impaired fibrinolysis, inflammatory profile), definitely, inflammation is the neglected one.

      Moringa oleifera has been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory effects [42][43][45] and
      hypoglycemic property [80]. As with many reports of the nutritional or medicinal value of a
      natural product, there are an alarming number of purveyors of &quot;healthful&quot; food who are now
      promoting M. oleifera as a panacea. While much of this recent enthusiasm indeed appears to be
      justified, it is critical to separate scientific evidence from anecdote.

      Herein, the investigators will investigate the effects of Moringa oleifera leaves
      supplementation on levels of inflammatory marker specifically hsCRP, hgbA1c level and
      clinical outocome in diabetic patients through a cohort study.

      We performed a prospective cohort study of adult diabetics who were given 12-weeks
      supplementation of Moringa oleifera. Plasma hsCRP and serum HgbA1c were compared before and
      after treatment with M. oleifera.
