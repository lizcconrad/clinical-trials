  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF) have lost the function to excrete urea and
      maintain electrolyte balance, which is lethal unless they are given renal replacement therapy
      (Gibney, Hoste et al. 2008). As one of the initiatives of service improvement, the HA has
      introduced the haemodialysis public-private partnership (HD PPP) programme to shorten the
      waiting time for patients with ESRF needing HD treatment. HD PPP programme is a new service
      provision model that purchases healthcare services from non-Government healthcare
      organizations. The evaluation on the quality of care (QOC) is an essential part of the
      programme in order to inform future policy. The Department of Family Medicine and Primary
      Care of the University of Hong Kong has been appointed by the HA to carry out the evaluation
      of the QOC of the programme.

      The Action Learning and Audit Spiral methodologies to measure whether the target standard of
      care intended by the HD PPP programme is achieved. Each HD PPP participating hospitals and
      centers will be invited to complete a structure evaluation questionnaire. Sixty patients who
      have agreed to join HD PPP and 60 control patients who have refused to take part in HD PPP
      will be included. The participants will be followed up by telephone to evaluate the effect of
      the programme on quality of life (QOL), patient enablement, and global rating of change in
      health condition. Data on the process of care and clinical outcomes of care will be retrieved
      from the HA medical records.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are the proportion of participants who have
      received the planned process of care and adequate haemodialysis (HD) measured by the Kt/V

      Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics on proportions meeting the QOC criteria will be
      calculated. The outcomes of HD PPP subjects will be compared at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months
      by paired sample t-test. The outcomes between HD PPP subjects and control group will be
      compared by independent sample t-test or Chi-square test.

      Results: The QOC of the HD PPP programme will be determined. Areas of deficiency and possible
      areas for quality enhancement will be identified.

      Conclusion: The results of this study will provide empirical evidence on whether the HD PPP
      can achieve equivalent QOC as the usual HA care in order to guide service planning and policy
      decision making for patients with ESRF.

        Sixty patients currently being followed up at the HA on HD, PD, or are new ESRF cases will
        be recruited. Both PD and new ESRF cases must fulfill certain inclusion criterion to take
        part in the study. The PD patients will be enrolled into the HD PPP if they have poor
        ultrafiltration, inadequate dialysis, or with frequent bacterial/fungal peritonitis that
        failed to put back on PD; whereas new ESRF patients will be enrolled if they have
        previously had multiple/extensive abdominal surgeries or have any abdominal pathology that
        makes PD not feasible. Patients who do not have a good vascular access, are not
        hemodynamically stable for HD, are not mentally sound, ambulatory and independent, are
        unable to understand and communicate in Chinese language, or refuse to give consent will be
        excluded from the HD PPP programme.
