      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of early (before the age of 5 years) and
      intensive intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. The type of intervention
      proposed in Switzerland differs greatly depending on where people live. Several international
      studies show positive outcomes in children with Autism after receiving early behavioural
      intervention.

      However, Disability Insurance (DI) in Switzerland does not fully cover these scientifically
      proven interventions. Since January 2014 they cover 45 000 CHF per child for only two years
      of early treatment across five centres chosen by the Federal Social Insurance Office. The
      remaining costs are covered by the parents, foundations or by the cantons. In addition,
      families benefit from this early intervention only if their child is enrolled in one of the
      five selected centres.

      There are currently various types of support for children with Autism in Switzerland before
      age five, early intensive behavioural interventions, eclectic early intervention and less
      intensive interventions with a treatment that is not specific to Autism (about 3 hrs./week),
      which includes occupational therapy, speech therapy and early curative education. Some
      children do not receive any treatment.

      This research aims to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions (early intensive
      behavioural/ eclectic/treatment as usual) as has been done previously in international
      studies. The study also aims to include centres other than those selected by the Swiss
      Federal Social Insurance Office.
