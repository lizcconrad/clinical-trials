      The National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) collects data and produces
      analysis to enable hospitals and healthcare improvement bodies to monitor and improve the
      quality of care and outcomes of cardiovascular patients.

      The Congenital Heart Disease audit collects data on all cardiac surgery and therapeutic
      cardiac catheterisations procedures used to treat patients with congenital and acquired heart
      disease.

      For acquired heart disease, the audit covers all arrhythmias &amp; cardiomyopathies in patients
      less than 16 years old only. For congenital heart disease, the audit collects data on both
      children and adult patients. The audit covers all specialist centers in the UK and Republic
      of Ireland.

      The project aims to improve the quality of care for children and adults with congenital heart
      disease by providing national comparative analysis of procedure specific activity and
      outcomes of cardiac surgery and therapeutic cardiac catheterisation procedures. The audit
      also provides quality indicators for the antenatal detection of major congenital heart
      disease.

      The current dataset is available from here:

      The Congenital Heart Disease audit collects data on all cardiac surgery and therapeutic
      cardiac catheterisations procedures used to treat patients with congenital and acquired heart
      disease

      Data collection:

      Hospitals use Patient Administration Systems and manual data entry by cardiac database
      managers to submit data to NICOR.

      Data are either assimilated locally using third party commercial software and imported as a
      .csv file, or entered directly onto the NICOR database.

      Data quality:

      NICOR provide tools that communicate possible errors to centres submitting data. A data
      submitting schedule has been agreed with the centres, data is submitted and a validation
      report is returned each quarter. Centres are responsible for updating errors in the records.

      An import log highlights missing and invalid data as well as records that failed to import
      due to data quality or compatibility issues.

      In addition, data is validated by on site visits with a NICOR representative.

      Data linkage:

      Data is annually linked with Office fot National Statistics (ONS) life status and Hospital
      Episodes Statistics (HES) admission data to verify case ascertainment and to track long term
      outcome measures.

      Information governance:

      NICOR has Section 251 approval and data protection registration. An organisation-wide
      standard operating procedure is in place for Information Security Incident Management.
      University College London has a robust information governance framework, to which NICOR
      adheres.

    <description>Analysis include 1-year outcome but a death would not appear in the table until a full year has passed for the whole cohort of patients within that year. For example, the audit collection period is based on financial year of April 1st to March 31st. A patient that died in April would be reported within the same period as one that died 11 months later in March.</description>

        All potential patients are assessed through a systematic process of clinical evaluation,
        diagnostic assessment. Patient selection is effected in each individual unit through a
        multidisciplinary team process. These teams consist not only of cardiac surgeons and
        interventional cardiologists but also of many other medical specialties and allied
        professionals. The decision as to the access route to be used is determined by the
        multidisciplinary team.
