      Trial ECU-MG-301, a phase III clinical trial, has been initiated to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of eculizumab in the treatment of refractory gMG. This extension trial is designed
      to provide the subjects who have participated in the ECU-MG-301 trial an opportunity to
      receive eculizumab and to collect clinical data that will provide long term safety and
      efficacy information on eculizumab in subjects with refractory gMG.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has completed the ECU-MG-301 trial.

          2. Subject has given written informed consent.

          3. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the duration
             of the trial.

          4. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum
             human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]). All subjects must practice an effective, reliable
             and medically approved contraceptive regimen during the trial and for up to 5 months
             following discontinuation of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who withdrew from the ECU-MG-301 trial as a result of an AE related to trial
             drug.

          2. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding or intend to conceive during the
             course of the trial.

          3. Any medical condition or circumstances that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might
             interfere with the subject's participation in the trial, pose any added risk for the
             subject, or confound the assessment of the subjects.
