      The SchlaHF XT Registry is a longitudinal study of patients with heart failure (HF). The
      study aims to understand the importance of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered
      breathing (SDB) on HF with the following questions:

      How often does SDB occur in HF? What forms of SDB occur and how are they treated? How does
      SDB develop over time? How does the heart failure therapy affect SDB? What is the treatment
      adherence of patients treated? Does SBD and its treatment affect the survival of heart
      failure patients?

        The study population is patients with Heart failure (HF). HF is defined as a symptom
        complex of shortness of breath and rapid fatigability on the basis of cardiac disease
        (World Health Organisation).
