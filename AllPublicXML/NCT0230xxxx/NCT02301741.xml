    <textblock>
      A fundamental clinical problem in individuals with chronic low back pain is the significant
      alteration in movement patterns that restrict lumbar spine motion. This is particularly true
      for individuals with fear of re-injury with movement (i.e., kinesiophobia). The primary aims
      of the current study are to use a whole body video game environment to 1) determine the
      effects of game play on lumbar spine flexion and expectations of pain and harm and 2)
      determine the effects of altered movement gain on lumbar spine flexion.

      Using a 2 groups (Game, Control) between subjects design, the investigators will assess the
      influence of participation in a computer game of virtual dodge ball that requires whole-body
      reaching movements to manipulate an on-screen avatar. Further, the investigators will
      gradually reduce the gain of lumbar spine motion of the participant's on-screen avatar across
      the three game sessions such that participants will need to produce progressively larger
      excursions of the lumbar spine to manipulate their avatar's spinal motion. Specifically, in
      game session 1, the spine motion of the avatar is equal to that of the participant (gain=1);
      in session 2 spine motion of the avatar is 5% less than the participant (gain=0.95); in
      session 3 spine motion of the avatar is 10% less than the participant (gain=0.90). The
      investigators will recruit participants with chronic low back pain and kinesiophobia.
      Participants in the GAME condition will complete laboratory sessions on five consecutive
      days. Session 1 (baseline) and Session 5 (post-test) will be used to assess lumbar spine
      motion and expectations of pain and harm during standardized reaching tasks. In sessions 2
      through 4 they will play the virtual dodge ball game. Participants in the CONTROL condition
      will complete baseline and post-test standardized reaching tasks, but will not play the game
      in the intervening three days.

    <description>This assessment tracks the magnitude of spine motion used to complete standardized reaching tasks in which participants reach to 3 targets (High, Middle, Low) located in the mid-sagittal plane. Participants will perform five reaching trials to each the target location and then return to an upright posture, with rest provided between each trial. Lumbar spine flexion will be defined as the change in joint angle (i.e., the difference between the joint angles at the beginning of the trial before the go signal and those extracted 100 ms after target contact). The average of the five reaches to each target location will serve as the dependent variable.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (day 1) to post-test (day 5)</time_frame>
    <description>For each target height, prior to the first reaching trial participants will be asked to rate the level of &quot;expected pain&quot; using a visual analog scale. The scale will consist of a 10-cm horizontal line with no numbers, marks, or descriptive vocabulary along its length. The scale will be anchored with the descriptors &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;Worst pain imaginable&quot;, respectively, at each end of the line. The pain expectancy ratings for each target location will serve as the dependent variable.</description>

The scale will be anchored with &quot;Not at all concerned&quot; and &quot;Extremely concerned&quot; regarding potential harm to the back during task performance. The harm expectancy ratings for each target location will serve as the dependent variable.</description>
