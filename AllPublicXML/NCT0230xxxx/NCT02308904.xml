  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improved long-term survival of thalassemia major (TM) patients has resulted in increased
      focus on the ability to preserve fertility. While the association of iron toxicity with vital
      organ dysfunction, heart and liver, has been extensively investigated, the correlation of
      reproductive capacity and extent of iron overload is not well understood. Despite remarkable
      progress in methodology for prediction of reproductive status and intervention for preserving
      fertility, implementation in thalassemia is lacking.

      The investigators hypothesize that iron toxicity to the anterior pituitary occurring in the
      process of transfusional iron loading is directly associated with a decline in gonadal
      function. The investigators expect pituitary MRI measurements of iron deposition as well as
      markers of oxidative damage to correlate with the functional studies of pituitary-gonadal
      axis performed in this study. This cross sectional study will examine the relation of
      pituitary iron deposition and pituitary volume; serum iron and oxidative stress measures,
      liver iron concentration (LIC), cardiac iron and chelation adequacy with pituitary and
      gonadal reproductive hormone levels (and spermatogenesis in adult male patients), in order to
      better define the association of iron burden and chelation patterns with fertility potential,
      in thalassemia patients with iron overload. The study will assess whether the current
      chelation treatment regimens, in particular during the pubertal developmental age, are
      adequate for preserving fertility and could lead to improved chelation routines for
      preventing the high prevalence of compromised fertility. In addition, by utilizing
      state-of-the-art markers for fertility status, findings from this study may improve current
      methods for screening for hypogonadism and reproductive potential and allow earlier
      intervention.

      The investigators propose to examine 26-30 patients, 12 years and older, with measures of
      fertility potential, and correlate them to their current iron burden parameters and to the
      cumulative iron effect as indicated by past iron overload patterns and chelation history.

    <description>Each patient's pituitary iron and pituitary volume will be correlated with each hormone levels: LH, FSH, estrogen and AMH (Females), testosterone Inhibin B and (males).
We will then evaluate potential associations using Pearson correlations. Univariate analyses on all variables and it's relation with iron, will also be conducted.</description>

    <measure>Retrospective analysis of annual LIC and of type and dose of iron chelation agent in the parallel time period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate potential associations using Pearson correlations of each measure: Mean LIC with each of the fertility hormone levels and with pituitary volume and height. Mean ferritin with each of the fertility hormone levels and with pituitary volume and height. NTBI with each of the fertility hormone levels and with pituitary volume and height. Oxidative measures (Vit C, Vit E, GSH/GSSG) with each of the fertility hormone levels and with pituitary volume and height. Regression analysis will be utilized to assess correlation of pituitary iron, LIC and cardiac iron. We will compute descriptive statistics for all measures by group. We will assess differences between the 2 groups using Student's t-test for continuous data and chi-square or Fisher's exact for categorical. A detailed retrospective analysis of LIC and chelation patterns (type of chelator and average dose) on these 2 groups will also be performed and fertility measures will be compared.</description>
