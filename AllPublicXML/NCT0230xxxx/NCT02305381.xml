  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of
      the trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of semaglutide once weekly versus placebo as
      add-on to basal insulin alone or basal insulin in combination with metformin in subjects with
      type 2 diabetes.

    <measure>Change in HbA1c (Glycosylated Haemoglobin)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 30. The post-baseline responses are analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment, country and stratification variable (HbA1c level at screening [&lt;= 8.0% or &gt; 8.0%] crossed with use of metformin [yes or no]; 2 by 2 levels) as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit. Mean estimates are adjusted according to observed baseline distribution. Missing data was imputed using mixed model for repeated measurements.</description>

    <time_frame>week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated mean change from baseline in insulin dose at week 30 was measured in terms of ratio to baseline. Responses at week 30 are analysed using an Analysis of covariance model with treatment, country and stratification variable (HbA1c level at screening [&lt;= 8.0% or &gt; 8.0%] crossed with use of metformin [yes or no]; 2 by 2 levels) as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate.

    <description>Estimated mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at week 30.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes, Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The DTSQs questionnaire was used to assess subjects' treatment satisfaction and contained 8 components and evaluates the diabetes treatment (including insulin, tablets and/or diet) in terms of convenience, flexibility and general feelings towards the treatment. The result presented is the 'Treatment Satisfaction' summary score, which is the sum of 6 of the 8 items of the DTSQs questionnaire. Response options range from 6 (best case) to 0 (worst case). Total scores for treatment satisfaction range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. The post-baseline responses are analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment, country and stratification variables (HbA1c level at screening [&lt;= 8.0% or &gt; 8.0%] and use of metformin [yes or no]) as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate. Mean estimates are adjusted according to observed baseline distribution. Missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward.</description>

Missing data imputed from a mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment, country and stratification variable (HbA1c level at screening [&lt;= 8.0% or &gt; 8.0%] crossed with use of metformin [yes or no]; 2 by 2 levels) as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit.</description>

          <title>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The DTSQs questionnaire was used to assess subjects’ treatment satisfaction and contained 8 components and evaluates the diabetes treatment (including insulin, tablets and/or diet) in terms of convenience, flexibility and general feelings towards the treatment. The result presented is the 'Treatment Satisfaction' summary score, which is the sum of 6 of the 8 items of the DTSQs questionnaire. Response options range from 6 (best case) to 0 (worst case). Total scores for treatment satisfaction range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes, Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ)</title>
        <description>The DTSQs questionnaire was used to assess subjects’ treatment satisfaction and contained 8 components and evaluates the diabetes treatment (including insulin, tablets and/or diet) in terms of convenience, flexibility and general feelings towards the treatment. The result presented is the 'Treatment Satisfaction' summary score, which is the sum of 6 of the 8 items of the DTSQs questionnaire. Response options range from 6 (best case) to 0 (worst case). Total scores for treatment satisfaction range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. The post-baseline responses are analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment, country and stratification variables (HbA1c level at screening [&lt;= 8.0% or &gt; 8.0%] and use of metformin [yes or no]) as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate. Mean estimates are adjusted according to observed baseline distribution. Missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward.</description>
