  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The uptake of postpartum contraception, postpartum care attendance and the practice of
      exclusive breastfeeding are low in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the involvement of men in
      maternity care has been shown to be a promising strategy for the achievement of other
      reproductive health goals, little is known about the effect of their participation on these
      outcomes. This study aims to test whether the involvement of men can improve care-seeking and
      promote healthy behaviours among postpartum women in Burkina Faso.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of evidence on strategies to increase the uptake of postpartum
      contraception and attendance at facility-based postpartum care in developing countries,
      including in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is also a need to test new solutions to improve
      adherence to recommended infant feeding practices in these settings. Partner opposition is a
      major barrier to women's uptake of contraceptive methods in the postpartum period in Burkina
      Faso, and research has shown the need to sensitise and inform men about a broad range of
      topics related to reproductive health. However, the effect of involving male partners on
      women's and newborns' health and wellbeing in low-resource settings is not well known, and
      there is particularly little evidence for outcomes related to the postpartum period.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether male partner involvement in maternity care has the
      potential to increase care-seeking and promote healthy behaviours among postpartum women in
      an urban West-African setting. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to
      promote the involvement in maternity care of the partners of pregnant women attending primary
      health care facilities will be conducted in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. The intervention
      consists of three extra components in addition to standard maternity care: one extra couple
      counselling session during pregnancy (A), partner participation in a group education session
      for men (B), and partner participation in the pre-discharge consultation after birth (C).
      Women in the control group will receive standard maternity care only, in which men do not
      participate.

      A qualitative component will be carried out alongside the RCT, in order to examine the
      factors that may have determined the success, or lack thereof, of the intervention by
      reflecting on the experience of participants (women, partners , and health workers), and to
      explore their attitudes, beliefs and concerns relative to partner involvement in maternity
      care, through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews.

      The policy implications of the study findings will be assessed and, if appropriate, a
      strategy will be developed for their dissemination among policymakers and other stakeholders.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of effective modern contraception at 8 months postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Effective modern methods are defined as those having a rate of unintended pregnancy per 100 women of 10% or less per year, as commonly used. Based on local availability, these methods are: implants, IUDs, injectables, oral contraceptives, and permanent methods. Each woman will be considered a &quot;user&quot; or &quot;non-user&quot; for each method. She will be considered a user of the implant if she currently has implant in place; of the intrauterine device (IUD) if she currently has an IUD sited; of injectables if she received an injection in the last three months; of oral contraception if she took a pill within the last 24 hours or according to instructions; of permanent methods if she or her husband have undergone sterilization or vasectomy. By protocol, progestin-only pills are the only oral contraceptive provided in the first 6 months postpartum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postpartum care attendance</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as attending at least two postpartum care consultations in the first six weeks after birth. This will be assessed through a review of the health centre postnatal care (PNC) logbooks. The process will be facilitated by the use of study stamps near the entries for participants. This will be corroborated by women's self-report in cases where they state they attended this care in a facility that is not part of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined according to the WHO criteria for exclusive breastfeeding: &quot;the infant has received only breastmilk from his/her mother or a wet nurse, or expressed breastmilk, and no other liquids or solids with the exception of drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, mineral supplements or medicines&quot;. Although the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months postpartum , 3 months has been chosen as the reference period because by that point only 20% of infants are still exclusively breastfed. Data will be collected during the 8-month follow-up through questions concerning whether the infant was breastfed, and open-ended questions about how long after birth specified other liquids and substances were introduced into its diet.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of long acting or permanent (LA/PM) methods of contraception at 8 months postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the proportion of women using IUDs, implants, female sterilization or male sterilization at 8 months postpartum.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contraceptive use over the 8-month postpartum period</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the use of all contraceptive methods throughout the 8-month postpartum period, according to self-report at 8 months postpartum. This be particularly useful to assess the use of &quot;natural&quot; methods, such as withdrawal, which may be higher than reported in DHS surveys. Changes in the prevalence of contraceptive use of any method over time will be assessed, taking continuation and switching between more and less effective methods into account.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timeliness of initiation of postpartum contraception</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Timeliness of initiation of effective modern contraception will be assessed at 8 months postpartum. This will be assessed with users of effective modern contraception as the denominator. Timeliness is defined in relation to the timing of initiation (first 6 months postpartum or later), whether at that point in time the woman had resumed intercourse, and whether her menses had returned.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unmet need for contraception at 8 months postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>A strict definition of unmet need will be used for postpartum women. Women will be classed as having an unmet need if they are: not using any contraceptive method, not amenorrheic, not abstaining, and are either undecided about whether they want another child at any point in the future or in the next two years, or state that they do not want another child at any point in the future or in the next two years. This definition is preferred for this context compared to the definitions of unmet need used in Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), because the latter do not take abstinence into account.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship adjustment at 8 months postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Relationship adjustment is defined as the woman's self-reported satisfaction and empowerment within the relationship and level of agreement with her partner on key issues. This will be assessed using a tool adapted from Spanier's Dyadic Adjustment Scale and the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (LWMAT). Questions that are not relevant to the context will be modified or eliminated, and others will be added to capture agreement and decision-making relative to reproductive health and care-seeking.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The uptake of intervention components A, B and C will be measured through the use of dedicated registers where the details of attenders at each session will be recorded. Full uptake of the intervention will be defined as woman/partner having attended all three components.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with care</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>A tailored satisfaction score has been developed. Questions in the follow-up questionnaire have been adapted from the K4 Health's Respectful Maternity Care toolkit, and from the UK's Care Quality Commission (CQC)'s 2013 Maternity Services Survey.</description>
