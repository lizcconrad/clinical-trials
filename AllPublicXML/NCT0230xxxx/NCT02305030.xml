    <textblock>
      Single-centre, open-label, fixed-sequence design consisting of 2 periods separated by a
      washout period of at least 14 days. In Period 1, a single dose of 25 mg warfarin was
      administered alone. In Period 2, subjects received 475 mg OPC, on Day 1 and D2 followed by 50
      mg OPC once daily for 5 days (D3 to D7). On D8, 50 mg OPC was administered with a single dose
      of 25 mg warfarin.
