      The main objective of the trial is to measure the thermogenic effect of two different doses
      of whey protein microgels.

      It will be a randomized crossover double-blind design conducted in 20 subjects.

      Primary objective and outcome:

      The primary objective of the trial is to measure the thermogenic effect of two different
      doses of whey protein microgels (WPM).

      Secondary objectives and outcomes:

      Explore the mechanism of action of WPM on thermogenesis including:

      Protein turnover in response to the dose and the source of protein (WPM versus casein)
      Insulinemic and glycemic response to the dose and source of protein (WPM versus casein)

      Design: The proposed study is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center,
      crossover design.

      At the start of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to 4 different groups in a
      crossover design, where they will be asked to consume a beverage containing Product 1: 0g of
      protein (maltodextrin control) Product 2: 30g of WPM Product 3: 50g of WPM Product 4: 50g of
      micellar casein (MC) Number of subjects: The number of subjects will be 15. Sufficient
      subjects should be recruited to provide a 30% drop-out rate. Therefore 20 subjects will be
      needed including drop-outs.
