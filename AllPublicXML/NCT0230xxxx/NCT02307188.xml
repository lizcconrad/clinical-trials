    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation utilizes the Constellation Full Contact Mapping catheter in the
      left and right atria to explore atrial signal characteristics that can guide atrial
      fibrillation and atrial flutter ablation procedures more effectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are the most common cardiac arrhythmias in
      adults, and account for a substantial portion of patient morbidity and healthcare
      expenditures. Great effort has been put forth to discover effective treatments for AF/FL.
      Promising results of catheter ablation suggest that AF/FL may be eliminated in a majority of
      patients. For example, data from numerous laboratories shows that up to 85 percent of
      patients with the paroxysmal form of AF may be free of recurrences and off anti-arrhythmic
      drugs at one year follow-up.

Constellation Full Contact Mapping Catheter: 64-electrode intracardiac mapping catheter.
Since enrollment began, a total of five (5) patients consented to enrollment in the study during their atrial fibrillation/tachycardia ablation procedures. The catheter (a new catheter was used for each patient) was used in the left atrium in one patient who met all inclusion criteria and did not have any exclusions.</description>
