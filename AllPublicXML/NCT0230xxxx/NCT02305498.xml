  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that regular physical activity may make cancer survivors do better
      in the long run. Laboratory studies suggest that stress may be bad for cancer patients as
      well. The investigators are interested in whether yoga, a practice that combines physical
      activity and stress reduction, is beneficial to cancer survivors. To answer that question,
      the investigators will need to do a large scale clinical trial.

      Before the investigators can do that large study, they need to know whether people are
      willing to participate in this kind of study, whether they can do the yoga practice regularly
      and for how long, what kind of changes they may experience in how they can handle their daily
      activities, emotion, sleep, memory and problem solving ability, and what are the changes that
      can happen in their body after doing the yoga practice. Answering these questions is what
      this study is about.

    <description>The study will be deemed feasible and safe if at least 15/20 patients in each arm complete the study. If the underlying feasibility rate is 90%, then the probability of 15/20 patients or more completing the study is 98.9%, and 97.8% for 15/20 patients completing in the study in both arms simultaneously.</description>

    <description>Each serious adverse event (SAE), defined as grade III or IV toxicity, will be evaluated by the PI or a Co-PI and its relationship to the study intervention is determined by the PI or a Co-PI. The study will be deemed feasible and safe if at least 15/20 patients in each arm complete the study.</description>
