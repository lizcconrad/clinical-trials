      Project 1, Study 2 will evaluate the impact of very low nicotine content cigarettes with and
      without transdermal nicotine on cigarettes smoked per day, nicotine exposure,
      discomfort/dysfunction, other health-related behaviors, nicotine/tobacco dependence,
      biomarkers of tobacco exposure, intention to quit, compensatory smoking, other tobacco use,
      cigarette characteristics, cue reactivity, cardiovascular function, perceived risk and cue
      reactivity. The investigators will also consider differences between conditions in compliance
      with product use and the ability to abstain from smoking when provided a financial incentive
      for abstinence.
