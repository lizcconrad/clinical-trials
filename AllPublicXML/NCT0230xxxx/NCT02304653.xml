      Aim: To investigate if the results of CRP and leucocytes had any positive or negative
      influence on the surgeon's decision-making when handling patients with suspected AA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective observational cohort study including patients (â‰¥15 years of age) admitted on
      suspicion of AA. The surgeons were instructed to perform their physical examination and
      register whether they found the patient more or less than 50% likely to have AA. Thereafter,
      the surgeons had to assess the blood results and reevaluate their diagnosis. The surgeon's
      diagnosis before and after was compared to the final diagnosis defined by surgical findings
      or follow up. Gold standard was any degree of appendicitis on histology.
