  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to compare the histopathological and molecular characteristics of tumour
      tissue from metastases with similar analyses of the primary tumour in the lung, where it is
      available.

      The investigators will therefore perform analysis of blood samples if possible, to identify
      predictive markers in blood samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to make genome analysis of tissue samples. This involves analysing the
      RNA, DNA methylation, for example in cancer cells. This will provide information regarding
      somatic changes in cancer cells, such as mutations. All of the investigators analysis will be
      cancer-focused, with the goal of increasing understanding of the heterogeneity.

      The investigators will therefore perform analysis of blood samples if possible, to identify
      predictive markers in blood samples. This will then be the miRNA, RNA expression or protein
      expression in blood samples.

    <description>We will do profiling of the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) expression of microRNA and perform single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of cancer tissue and compare the expression using statistical methods such as SAM (Significance analysis and microarrays), PAM (Prediction analysis of microarrays). In addition, we wish to perform specific genetic analysis of cancer-related genes. These will be made with available methods like sequencing or TaqMan assays for specific mutations.
Blood samples will be analysed by microarray methods for RNA and microRNA in addition to serum analysis of proteins.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastasizing lung cancer where further treatment is still applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Terminal patients or patients in a reduced general condition with EGOC 3-4, i.e.
             patients who are confined to bed more than 50% of the day, with no clinical indication
             to perform sampling of the tumor and metastases.

          -  Patients where further cancer treatment is no longer applicable.

          -  Patients with cognitive impairment.

          -  Patients with inaccessible metastases where sampling may cause distress to the patient
             and are at increased risk of complications.
