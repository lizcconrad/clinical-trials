      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing Fenofibrate capsules,
      USP 130 mg manufactured by Ohm Laboratories Inc, NJ 08901 with ANTARA速 (fenofibrate) capsules
      130 mg manufactured by Ethypharm Industries Saint Cloud, France for Oscient Pharmaceuticals
      Corp. Waltham, MA 02451 in healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fed condition.

      The subjects were subjected to breath test for alcohol and test for drugs of abuse (opioids
      and cannabinoids) in urine prior to admission in each period.

      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a high-fat high calorie breakfast was served
      to the study subjects. Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of
      fenofibrate capsules 130 mg of either test or reference formulation was administered during
      each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature under
      low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel.

      Blood samples were collected at pre-dose and at 1.000, 2.000, 3.000, 4.000, 4.500, 5.000,
      5.500, 6.000, 6.500, 7.000, 7.500, 8.000, 8.500, 9.000, 9.500, 10.000, 11.000, 12.000,
      16.000, 24.000, 36.000, 48.000, 72.000 and 96.000 hours post dose in each period under low
      light condition. The pre-dose blood samples in each period were collected in duplicate (2 x 5
      mL), within a period of 1.5 hour before dosing. Post-dose samples were generally collected
      within 2 minutes of the scheduled time.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis at screening). Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry were repeated at
      the end of the study.
