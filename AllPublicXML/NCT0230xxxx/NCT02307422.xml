  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design and purpose of the current study is to expand and validate previous findings that
      the IL-1 gene cluster composite genotype patterns potentiate the risk for coronary artery
      disease (CAD) and cardiovascular events mediated by OxPL and Lp(a). A secondary objective is
      to validate other, non IL-1 genetic variants associated with CAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The conclusions from an earlier study indicate that the contribution of OxPL/apoB and Lp(a)
      on angiographically documented CAD and CAD events is conditional on proinflammatory IL-1
      genotypes. This novel paradigm links the etiology of atherogenesis attributed to OxPL and
      Lp(a) from genetics to clinical expression of CAD. ILI has also identified the functional
      IL-1 gene variations that regulate the IL1B gene in a haplotype context and appear to explain
      over-expression of IL-1β, as well as the expression of other inflammatory biomolecules that
      are downstream of IL-1β. The functional IL-1 variants have been combined into patterns that
      have been associated with risk for more severe periodontal disease across multiple
      ethnic/racial populations. It is also important to test this functional genetic pattern for
      similar interactions with OxPL and Lp(a) biomarker levels in association with
      angiographically documented CAD and CAD events. DNA has been extracted from previously
      obtained subject blood samples (1173 subjects; 18 years to 90 years at entry (coronary
      angiography)) at the University General Hospital of Ioannina, Greece study site. DNAs will be
      labeled by anonymized subject ID # (de-identified), and shipped to ILI for genotyping and
      genetic analysis. Phase II will determine whether other gene variations (SNPs) previously
      shown in the literature to be associated with CAD and/or CAD-related secondary events can be
      validated in this study population.

    <description>Diabetic patients undergoing coronary angiography (both sexes), who are age 18-90, and admitted in the Department of Cardiology in the University General Hospital of Ioannina and Catheterization Laboratory of 1st IKA Hospital in Athens and undergo coronary angiography for clinical purposes will be studied. Presence epicardial vessel stenosis (&gt;50%), and multi-vessel disease will be recorded. Excluded: previous history of revascularization procedure or moderate to severe stenosis. Patient samples will be evaluated for quantitative levels of the biomarkers Lp(a) and OXPL/apoB. IL-1 Genotypes, and other SNPs associated with CAD will be assessed in this group and related to levels of Lp(a) and oxidized phospolipids. No interventions other than the post-hoc DNA testing will be performed.</description>

    <description>Genotyping will be carried out by a CLIA-certified genotyping facility at ILI, Waltham MA. DNA concentrations will be adjusted to a range compatible with multiple PCR conditions. Genotyping will be accomplished by performing multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR) specifically targeting the surrounding sequences for the SNPs being studied. A single base extension assay will be hybridized to a 48-plex microarray plate and read on a SNPstream Genotyping System (Beckman-Coulter).</description>
