  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions during primary HIV infection (PHI) can modify the immune control and the
      clinical evolution during the chronic phase. Although several studies suggest the benefit of
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) during PHI, indication of ART is still not universally
      recommended. The investigators randomized patients with PHI, with a favourable immunological
      profile and well controlled on ART, to undergone structured treatment interruptions alone or
      with low doses of IL-2, stopping ART thereafter. The endpoints were immune control of HIV
      replication and time to resume ART. Immunological profile, specific CD4 and CD8 responses and
      clinical data were analysed for both groups up to 48 weeks, and during a long follow-up, up
      to nine years since final ART stop.

      The study design included two phases. The first phase consisted in four STI of 8 weeks each
      (off-ART), separated by 16 weeks of treatment -or the time necessary to reach again to PVL
      &lt;20 copies/mL- (on-ART). At the end of the 4th off-ART cycle (week 0) an interim evaluation
      was performed and the second phase initiated. During the second phase, the first 6 patients
      received ART until they reach PVL&lt;20 copies/mL, discontinuing thereafter (final stop). The
      last 6 patients received ART and low doses of IL-2. ARV therapy was stopped after reaching
      PVL&lt;20 copies/mL (final stop) and IL-2 after 6 months of treatment. IL-2 was prescribed at a
      dose of 750.000 UI/m2 daily and was self-administrated in all patients previous trained by a
      specialized nurse. ART was resumed in patient dropping CD4 cell count less than 350 cell/mm3
      in two consecutive determinations or in patients who developed opportunistic infections. A
      long term follow up analysis was performed at 3, 6 and 9 years since the final stop. It
      included time to resume ART, clinical events, survival rate, CD4-CD8-CD4/CD8 ratio.
