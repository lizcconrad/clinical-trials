    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about the effects of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) on the function of blood vessels, the heart, and muscle at rest and
      during exercise.

    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between pro and antioxidant molecular species in
      favor of the former, has recently been recognized as a potential mechanism in the peripheral
      muscle dysfunction associated with COPD. a series of studies are proposed to better
      understand the role and source of oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle of patients with
      COPD. Specifically, three main aims will address the following questions regarding COPD,
      skeletal muscle, and oxidative stress: where is oxidative stress most prevalent, why does
      oxidative stress occur, and what are the consequences of oxidative stress in COPD? the
      overall hypothesis to be tested is that COPD results in a shift toward greater intramuscular
      oxidative stress and this is, at least in part, responsible for the diminished mechanical
      efficiency and greater peripheral muscle fatiguability during muscular work often associated
      with this disease. The vascular consequence of this augmented free radical load is altered
      vascular function and a disruption of the local matching of perfusion and metabolism in
      skeletal muscle during exercise. These crucial changes result in a cascade of factors such as
      local hypoxia and elevated vascular shear stress, entering a vicious cycle that leads to the
      generation of more free radicals, especially during physical work. It is proposed that this
      imbalance between pro and antioxidant potential, toward oxidative stress, plays a significant
      role in the attenuated exercise capacity and reduced muscle fatigue resistance associated
      with COPD.
