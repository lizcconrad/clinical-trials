  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of Dental Cone Beam Computed Tomography
      (CBCT) in assessment of bone density. The study population contains men and women above the
      age of 60 years, eligible for Bone Density Testing in accordance with their health insurance,
      who underwent a Dental CBCT recommended by their Dental Practitioner. Any patient (eligible
      for bone density screening by age criteria) undergoing CBCT of either one of the jaws (or
      both) due to dental reasons, will be sent to a bone mineral density DEXA Scan, and for blood
      testing for PTH, Phosphor, Calcium ,Vitamin D and Creatinine levels.

      Density measurements will be done in specific sites on the CBCT's of the jaws. These
      measurements will be correlated with the blood tests and DEXA scan results.

      The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of Dental Cone Beam Computed Tomography in
      assessment of bone density.

      The study population contains men and women above the age of 60 years, eligible for Bone
      Density Testing in accordance with their health insurance, who underwent a Dental CBCT
      recommended by their Dental Practitioner. Any patient (eligible for bone density screening by
      age criteria) undergoing CBCT of either one of the jaws (or both) due to dental reasons, will
      be sent to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) Scan, and for blood testing for
      parathormone (PTH), Phosphor, Calcium ,Vitamin D and Creatinine levels.

      The investigators estimate thousands of Dental Cone Beam Computed Tomographies are being
      ordered every year, due to dental needs in Israel. In this preliminary prospective pilot
      study the investigators will evaluate 50 subjects who underwent both Dental CBCT and DEXA
      scan as a preliminary testing.

      Density measurements will be done in specific sites on the CBCT's of the jaws. These
      measurements will be correlated with the blood tests and DEXA scan results.

      The outcomes of this study are:

        1. Bone density measurement on Dental CBCT can be used for diagnosis of low bone mass
           conditions.

        2. There is an association between bone density DEXA results, blood tests for Calcium,
           Phosphor, PTH and Vitamin D and Bone density measurements on Dental CBCTs.
