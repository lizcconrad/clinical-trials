    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort pilot study of non-cardiac patients to determine the feasibility of
      recruiting 150 patients to undergo postoperative continuous hemodynamic monitoring for up to
      3 days.

      Patient will start wearing the Philips' hemodynamic and ECG monitor in the Post Anaesthesia
      Care Unit (PACU). This device will continuously measure heart rate, pulse oxymetry, and
      ST-segments. The device will measure blood pressure every hour from 7 am to 10 pm and every 2
      hours from 10 pm to 7 am.

      Patients will have postoperative Troponin I monitoring and telephone follow-up at 30 days
      postop.
