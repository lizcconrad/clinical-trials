  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate how safe, how well tolerated and
      how effective a range of doses of L-DOS47 in combination with standard doublet therapy of
      pemetrexed/carboplatin in patients with Stage IV (TNM M1a and M1b) recurrent or metastatic
      non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned that patients will receive 4 cycles of combination treatment with L-DOS47 +
      pemetrexed/carboplatin. Patients who have not progressed following the 4 cycles of
      combination treatment and who have not experienced unacceptable toxicity will have the
      opportunity to continue to receive L-DOS47 treatment for as long as there is clinical benefit
      and it is well-tolerated, in the opinion of the Investigator, until disease progression.
      Patients who are unable to complete 4 cycles of L-DOS47 + pemetrexed/carboplatin combination
      treatment due to pemetrexed/carboplatin toxicity will have the opportunity to continue
      receiving L-DOS47 treatment following discontinuation of pemetrexed/carboplatin, for as long
      as there is clinical benefit and it is well-tolerated, in the opinion of the Investigator,
      until disease progression.
