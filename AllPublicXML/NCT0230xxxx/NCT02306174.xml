      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the effectiveness of a manualized, 20-week
      group cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and exposure therapy (ET) course for compulsive hoarding.
      The overarching aim is to understand whether this course will decrease the core symptoms of
      hoarding and associated features.

                  relevant symptoms of hoarding as indicated by scores on the Hoarding Rating Scale
