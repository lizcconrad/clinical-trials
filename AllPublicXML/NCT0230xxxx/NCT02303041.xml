    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well sonidegib and buparlisib work in treating patients with
      basal cell carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body. Sonidegib and buparlisib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of sonidegib (erismodegib) in combination with
      buparlisib (hereby referred to as &quot;LB therapy&quot;) for patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in Smoothened inhibitor-naive patients (Cohort 1) and
      those whose disease is refractory or relapsed on Smoothened inhibitor monotherapy (Cohort 2).

      NOTE: This study does not compare the treatment effect between these 2 dissimilar participant
      groups.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the median duration of response, on or after LB therapy.

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of LB therapy.

        -  Assess the histopathologic effect of LB therapy in tumor biopsies obtained at baseline
           and following 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  Assess the effect of LB therapy on gene expression including Hedgehog pathway and
           phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.

        -  Assess correlation between gene mutations in Smoothened, suppressor of fused homolog
           (Sufu), patched (PTCH), glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli)1, 2 and gene expression
           profiles and response to LB therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and buparlisib PO QD on days 1 to 28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.

                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); for female subjects

                            or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository

               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed

               -  Fertile males, must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of
