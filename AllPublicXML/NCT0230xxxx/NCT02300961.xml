      This pilot study will primarily be evaluated by feasibility and adherence to an iPad-based
      neurocognitive intervention program. It will secondarily be evaluated by performance on the
      neurocognitive testing post-transplant and change in performance in subsequent years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a histologic or cytological diagnosis of ALL treated with stem
             cell transplantation. There are no restrictions on prior therapy.

          -  Patients must be between the ages of 6 years and 21 years of age (inclusive), but
             there will be no discrimination based on gender, race, creed, or ethnic background.
             The age limits are set at 6 years of age in order to ensure that patients will be able
             to participate in these specific cognitive rehabilitation tasks. ECOG/KPS will not be
             employed.

          -  Patient and/or parents/guardians as appropriate must sign an informed consent, be
             mentally responsible, able to understand and willing to sign a written informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with significant concurrent medical complications that in the judgment of the
             Principal Investigator(s) could affect the patient's ability to complete the planned
             trial. There are no therapy restrictions or restrictions regarding the use of other
             Investigational Agents.

          -  Pregnant patients will be excluded.
