      To determine the appropriateness of the dose of nintedanib 200 mg b.i.d. plus docetaxel 75
      mg/m2 as starting dose by evaluating the safety in Japanese patients with body surface area

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients aged 20 years or older at the date of informed consent

          2. Patients with BSA&lt;1.5 m2 at screening

          3. Patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
             adenocarcinoma subtype NSCLC after failure of first line platinum-based chemotherapy
             (patients with non-target lesion only are eligible) First line chemotherapy may
             include continuation or switch maintenance therapy. One prior adjuvant and/or
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy is accepted.

          4. Patients who have life expectancy of at least 3 months

          5. Patients who are Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of
             0 or 1 at screening

          6. Patients obtained written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and Japanese GCP

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients who have received more than one prior line of chemotherapy (i.e., second or
             third line chemotherapy) for advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Prior monotherapies with an
             epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors [EGFR-TKI]) or anaplastic
             lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor can be allowed)

          2. Patients who have received previous therapy with other vascular endothelial growth
             factor (VEGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors (other
             than bevacizumab) for the treatment of NSCLC at any time

          3. Patients who have received following treatments within 4 weeks prior to start of study
             therapy 1) Other investigational drugs 2) Chemo-, hormone-, immunotherapy, or
             monoclonal antibody.

          4. Patients who have received molecular target therapy including EGFR TKIs and ALK
             inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to start of study therapy

          5. Patents who have received radiotherapy within the past 3 months (in the case of
             limited -field [e.g. brain or bone metastasis] radiotherapy with palliative intent),
             within 2 weeks) prior to start of study therapy

          6. Patients who not recovered clinically relevant therapy related toxicities from
             previous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (=CTCAE grade 2 AE from previous treatment)
             at screening
