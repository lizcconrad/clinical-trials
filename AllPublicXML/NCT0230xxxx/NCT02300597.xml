  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young people between age 15 and 25 with ADHD and/or autism spectrum disorders are offered
      internet-based support and coaching during eight weeks (chat and e-mail). Data is collected
      before and after the intervention and six months after end of treatment using self-report
      questionnaires pertaining to sense of coherence, self-esteem, quality of life, depressive and
      anxiety symptoms and socioeconomic status. Parents complete an assessment scale for the next
      of kin. After treatment the young people are interviewed regarding the quality of the
      intervention. A comparison group matched for age, gender and neuropsychiatric diagnosis is
      offered treatment as usual and is assessed at the same time points as the intervention group.
      The individuals are not randomized due to difficulties to recruit if the individuals do not
      know group assignment in advance.

      Young people between age 15 and 25 with ADHD and/or autism spectrum disorders are
      consecutively included in the project and are offered coaching and support during eight weeks
      over the internet (chat and e-mail) twice a week. Data is collected before and after the
      intervention as well as six months after end of treatment using self-report questionnaires
      (Sense of Coherence (SOC), Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, Manchester Short Assessment of
      Quality of Life (MANSA), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)). A parent or a partner completes an assessment scale for
      the next of kin. When treatment is completed, the young people are interviewed using a
      structured interview pertaining to the quality of the intervention. A comparison group
      matched for age, gender and neuropsychiatric diagnosis is offered treatment as usual (TAU)
      and is assessed at the same time points as the intervention group. The individuals are not
      randomized to the intervention and comparison groups due to difficulties to recruit if the
      individuals do not know group assignment in advance. In all, 24 individuals will be offered
      the intervention and 24 individuals will receive TAU.
