  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been increasing use of technology in delivery of healthcare and increasing use of
      cellular phone and text messaging services to help with various healthcare related issues
      including but not limited to medication adherence and clinic attendance. Mobile phones
      technology has been used for healthcare delivery and prevention strategies such as smoking
      cessation. In the present era, cell phones have become part of daily life for most people
      even among those in lower economic groups. There have also been several studies looking at
      cell phone text messaging services to improve adherence to ART among HIV infected subjects
      but no studies have so far been done in HIV infected young women to help retention and
      adherence to care. The overall goal of this study is to evaluation of the impact of texting
      intervention to improve adherence to care and treatment in HIV infected young women.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Text message intervention will improve adherence to ART in HIV infected young women.

    <description>This study will utilize mobile texting services to send text messages to enrolled subjects on a weekly basis. The text would convey messages that promote better awareness and knowledge on HIV and its treatment, reminders for medication adherence and clinic appointments. The text content would also be customized based on individual subject requirements. English will be used in texting. We would also assess the subjects for traditional demographic items (e.g., age, marital status, education, number/age of other children, employment, and religion), and potential environmental barriers (e.g., transportation and childcare).</description>
