      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EVICEL® when used for
      suture-line sealing in dura-mater closure in elective or urgent paediatric cranial
      neurosurgery to provide intraoperative watertight closure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, open-label, multi-center controlled study evaluating the
      effectiveness of EVICEL® as an adjunct to sutured dural closure compared to control to obtain
      an intraoperative watertight dural closure.

      Paediatric subjects, undergoing elective or urgent craniotomy/craniectomy for pathological
      processes in the posterior fossa (such as benign or malignant tumors, vascular malformations,
      and Chiari 1 malformations) or in the supratentorial region and who were demonstrated to have
      persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage following a primary attempt at suture closure of
      the dural incision.

      Paediatric subjects for this study are classified as:

        -  Newborn infants (birth to 27 days. Pre-term newborn infants born ≤ 37 weeks gestation
           will be included within the group)

        -  Infants and toddlers (28 days to &lt;24 months)

        -  Children (2 to 11 years)

        -  Adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years)

           42 paediatric subjects with intra-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak following
           primary suturing of the dura will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio and will be
           stratified by surgical procedure, posterior fossa or supratentorial to either EVICEL®
           Fibrin Sealant (Human) or additional dural sutures.

      Subjects will be followed post-operatively through discharge and for 30 days (±3 days)
      post-surgery. The incidence of CSF leaks will be assessed within 5 days (± 2 days) and 30
      days (±3 days) post-operatively as detected by any of the following: clinical observation,
      diagnostic testing or the need for surgical intervention to treat a CSF leak or
      pseudomeningocele.

          -  Use of implants made of synthetic materials coming into direct contact with dura
             (e.g., PTFE patches, shunts, ventricular and subdural drains);
