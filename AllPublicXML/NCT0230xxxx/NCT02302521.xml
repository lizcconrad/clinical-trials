  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate our recently developed MRI reconstruction strategy
      for producing artifact-free neuro and abdominal MRI data. The new reconstruction strategies,
      including 1) REKAM and 2) MUSE, are capable of effectively removing motion-related artifacts
      resulting from global and local motion during neuro and free-breathing abdominal MRI scans,
      without modifying the MRI pulse sequences and protocols that are currently used in clinical
      scans. The study team aims to recruit 60 subjects across multiple challenge patient
      populations: 10 healthy young adults (age 20-30) and 10 healthy older adults (aged 50-70) for
      abdominal MRI, as well as 20 tremor dominant PD patients and 20 children (age 4-8) for brain
      MRI scans. There are no known risks in taking MRIs and a unique code will be assigned to each
      participant to protect their PHI.

        There are 4 separate cohorts of patients. Please see earlier section. 60 subjects will
        participate in our study.

          -  10 healthy younger adult volunteers (ages 20 to 30)

          -  10 healthy older adult volunteers (ages 50 to 70) will be recruited for

          -  20 tremor-dominant patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease

          -  20 healthy children (4 to 8 y.o.)
