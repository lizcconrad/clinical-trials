    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single-site trial to evaluate the drug release, using
      scintigraphic images and mesalazine plasma levels (PK) in healthy subjects. Overall, nine [9]
      subjects will be evaluated. The subjects will receive one [1] radio-labelled tablet after a
      high fat and a rich in calories breakfast.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects, male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, between 18 and 55 years
             old. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to the intake of study drug, and must use a hormonal (oral, implantable or
             injectable) or a double barrier method of birth control throughout the study. Females
             unable to bear children must have documentation of such in the source records (i.e.,
             tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or post-menopausal [defined as a minimum of one year
             since the last menstrual period]).

          2. Ability of subject to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial.

          3. Written informed consent must be obtained and documented.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participating in a clinical study involving investigational drugs or dosage forms
             within the previous 30 days.

          2. History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          3. Radiation exposure from clinical trials, including that from the present study and
             from diagnostic X-ray but excluding background radiation, exceeds 5 mSv
             (milli-Sievert) in the last five years. No subject whose occupational exposure is
             monitored will participate in the study.

          4. Any nuclear medicine procedure prior to study day 1 that might interfere with the
             scintigraphic images that are acquired.

          5. Clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, haematology or urinalysis:

               -  White blood count &lt;3 x 109/L and &gt;8 x 109/L

               -  Lymphocyte count &lt; 0.85 x 109/L

               -  Haemoglobin &lt; 110g/L

               -  Platelet count &lt; 125 x 109/L or &gt; 600 x 109/L

               -  Alanine-Aminotransferase (ALT) or Aspartate-Aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2x upper
                  limit of normal

               -  Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2x upper limit of normal

               -  Serum Creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal

          6. History of gastrointestinal surgery, with the exception of appendectomy unless it was
             performed within the previous 12 months.

          7. History of cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory and particularly
             gastrointestinal disease, especially peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding,
             ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (within the previous
             12 months).

          8. Acute diarrhoea or constipation in the 14 days before the predicted first study day.
             If screening occurs &gt;14 days before first study day, this criterion is to be
             determined on the first study day. Diarrhoea will be defined as the passage of liquid
             faeces and/or a stool frequency of greater than three times per day. Constipation will
             be defined as a failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day.

          9. History of adverse reaction or allergy to aspirin, mesalazine or other salicylates.

         10. Donation of blood within the previous three months.

         11. Positive HBV-Antigen (Hepatitis-B), HCV-Antibody (Hepatitis-C) or HIV-antibody (Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus) result.

         12. Over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medication (including laxatives, vitamins and
             natural herbal remedies) between screening visit (visit 1) and completion of the
             study. Occasional paracetamol or acetyl-salicylic acid is permitted.

         13. Failure to satisfy the Principal Investigator to participate for any other reason.
