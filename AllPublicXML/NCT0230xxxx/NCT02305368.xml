  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with colonic adenocarcinoma stage 4 which are potentially resectable metastases
      (lung and liver metastases), treatment with chemotherapy is necessary but not end in success
      in 10% of cases. The development of techniques for administering personalized treatment
      becomes necessary for these patients. Thus, in vitro tests on cells from tumors of these
      patients and evaluating the effect of chemotherapy on these could be made for each patient.
      In France, the company develops Oncomedics these tests.

      This is a pilot study that will make a first evaluation under actual conditions of
      chimio-oncogramme.

    <textblock>
      A fragment of colon tumors will be taken from a specimen or a cold biopsy, tissue from
      patients diagnosed with colon carcinoma metastatic (stage 4). In parallel and systematically:
      analysis by the pathologist of a histological section.

        -  Culturing the cells obtained from the tumor by Oncomedics fragment in a defined medium
           and provided for enriching tumor cells compared to stromal cells.

        -  Maintaining the cells in culture for 7 days.

        -  Effects of conventional chemotherapy (corresponding to protocols) on these cells for 72
           hours (growth chambers) by Oncomedics (chimio-oncogramme).

        -  For each chemotherapy tested, measuring the proportion of dead cells / total cells.

        -  Retained by Oncomedics results, not given to the nursing team. The patient will be
           treated and followed up in the usual way.

        -  At the end of the study, comparing the in vitro results (chimio-oncogramme) to the
           patient's response to (x) the same (s) chemotherapy (s).
