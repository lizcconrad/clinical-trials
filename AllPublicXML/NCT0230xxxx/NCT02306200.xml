      The goal of this project is to establish a biobank of clinical information, DNA, plasma, and
      aortic tissue samples from patients with cardiovascular disease as well as healthy controls.
      The aims of the study are to collect biological specimens (blood, plasma, serum, aortic
      tissue) and family history; establish a biobank, establish a comprehensive database with
      information from consented patients, and provide researchers with high quality well annotated
      DNA samples with demographic and clinical information.
