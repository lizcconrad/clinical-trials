  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to identify demographic and non-spirometric clinical
      features predictive of the asthma-COPD overlap population. The study aims to explore and
      identify characteristics of the Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) patient's clinical
      profile that enable clinical differentiation from subjects with a primary diagnosis of either
      asthma alone (without persistent obstruction) or COPD alone (without reversibility). The
      study is designed as a targeted medical history survey which consists of a 41-item
      questionnaire, which will be administered by a qualified health care practitioner at the time
      a subject's medical history is taken. The questionnaire has been developed to elicit specific
      details of the respiratory history, including the following: bronchodilator use, disease
      progression, variation in symptoms, atopic history, symptom triggers, vagal bias, burden of
      disease, symptom presentation, co morbidities and age of onset. In addition, demographic
      information, standard medical history, co morbidity and spirometric results will also be
      obtained and analyzed in conjunction with the questionnaire results. Approximately 1000
      subjects are required for the study.

    <measure>Summary of spirometry data: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 measures how much air a person can exhale during a forced breath in 1 second. FVC is the total amount of air exhaled during the FEV test. FEV1 and FVC were performed on Day 1 (pre- and post-bronchodilator) using spirometry. Spirometry results obtained within 6 months and were used for this study. For participants without spirometry in the past 6 months, spirometry was performed to obtain pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1, FVC.</description>
