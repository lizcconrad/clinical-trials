  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2982772 in humans. The study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and exploratory pharmacodynamics (PD) of single
      and repeat oral doses of up to 14 days with GSK2982772 in healthy male subjects.

      This study is planned to include approximately 52 subjects and will consist of 2 parts: Part
      A - single ascending dose, randomized, placebo controlled, 4 way crossover. In addition to
      the crossover treatment periods, up to 8 subjects in cohort 2 will participate in an
      additional treatment period and receive GSK2982772 with a high-fat meal. Part B - repeat
      dose, randomized, placebo controlled, sequential-group. In both cohorts of Part A (Cohorts 1
      and 2), subjects will be randomized equally (1:1:1:1) to one of 4 treatment sequences. Within
      each period, allocation of active to placebo treatment will be 3:1.

      In all cohorts in Part B (Cohorts 3, 4 and 5) subjects will be randomized to GSK2982772 or
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio. If required, subjects in the additional cohorts in Part A (Cohort 6)
      and Part B (Cohort 7) will be randomized to GSK2982772 or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 and 3:1 ratio,
      respectively. The study duration, including screening and follow-up, is not expected to
      exceed 105 days for any subject in the study.

             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. As
             potential for and magnitude of immunosuppression with this compound is unknown,
             subjects with presence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) should also be excluded.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody.

          -  A positive tuberculosis test.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

        Part B Specific Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Total cholesterol &gt;=300 mg/dL or triglycerides &gt;=250 mg/dL. - Subjects who, in the

             suicide risk may include any history of suicidal behavior and/or any evidence of
             suicidal ideation on any questionnaires (e.g., type 4 or 5 on the Columbia Suicide
             Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] in the last 5 years).

          -  For Cohort 5 Only (or another Cohort where Entero Test is to be performed) - History
