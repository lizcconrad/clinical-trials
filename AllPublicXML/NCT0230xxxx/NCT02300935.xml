  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the combination of two drugs, trametinib and nab-paclitaxel, in
      patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Each drug has shown activity in
      trials of patients with melanoma. However, the combination of these two drugs has not been
      studied. In this trial the investigators will determine the maximum dose of the drug
      combination to be administered to patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma
      and examine the safety profile of the drug combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While treatment for melanoma has evolved in the last few years, advanced/metastatic melanoma
      remains an aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Trametinib and nab-paclitaxel have
      demonstrated single-agent activity in Phase III trials of patients with melanoma. The
      investigators propose to investigate this drug combination in patients with advanced
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This open-label Phase I study is designed to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), and safety profile of
      trametinib and nab-paclitaxel given in combination. Patients with melanoma and known BRAF
      mutation status will receive escalating doses of trametinib and nab-paclitaxel to determine
      the MTD. Once the MTD is determined an additional 6 patients will be treated at the MTD to
      establish the dose for future studies.

    <description>Trametinib will be dosed at 1mg, 1.5mg, and 2mg orally (PO) daily based on Phase I data of this drug as a single agent. All patients entering this study will receive intravenous (IV) nab-paclitaxel on Day 1, 8, and 15. Dose levels will be assigned to each patient, and dose escalation decisions will be based on the evaluation of safety data from the prior cohort.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically-confirmed advanced
             unresectable or metastatic melanoma. BRAF mutation-positive and wild-type tumors are
             allowed.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function

          -  Life expectancy ≥12 weeks

          -  Any pre-existing neuropathy must be &lt;grade 2 per Common Technology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting

          -  Prior MEK inhibitor therapy (prior BRAF inhibitor allowed)

          -  Prior nab-paclitaxel (prior taxane allowed)

          -  Use of an investigational anti-cancer drug within 21 days or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is shorter) prior to first dose. A minimum of 10 days after termination of
             investigational drug is required. Any drug-related toxicity should have resolved to
             Grade 1 or baseline.
