      To evaluate the effects on contrast sensitivity (CS) measurements of intravitreal bevacizumab
      injections associated with standard metabolic control in eyes with diabetic macular edema
      (DME) associated with standard metabolic control.

      Prospective, randomized, masked and interventional study. Patients with diabetes mellitus
      (DM) 2, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) less than 11% and previously treated macular edema three
      months before will be randomized in two groups. The baseline examination consisted of visual
      acuity (VA), CS using the Pelli-Robson Charts, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
      Fluorescein Angiography for all eyes.

      The same tests will be repeated above, in both groups, again, in the week 2,6 and 12, when
      the data is then collected for analysis and so ended the closed phase. On the same day will
      start the open phase, which will be applied intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in both
      groups and the same tests of closed phase will be held in the week 14,18 and 24 when the
      study will be completed then [Table 1] .

      Patients will be monitored and controlled clinically including blood pressure measurements,
      laboratory blood tests such as blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, urea, creatinine, total
      cholesterol and fractions.
