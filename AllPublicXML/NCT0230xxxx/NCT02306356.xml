      An open trial will be conducted at the Child and Mental Health Service (CAMHS) unit in the
      rural county Jämtland in Sweden to test the feasibility and efficacy of Internet-delivered
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for children with anxiety disorders in a clinical setting.
      20 children with a principal diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), separation
      anxiety, specific phobia and their parents will be recruited from the CAMHS-center in
      Östersund. They will receive 12 weeks of therapist-supported ICBT and will be assessed by
      clinician ratings and child- and parent-reports at baseline, post-treatment and 3 month
      follow-up. The primary outcome measures the Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scale
      (CGI-S). Secondary outcome measures include clinician rated global functioning, and child and
      parent-rated anxiety and functioning.
