  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is intended to provide a rigorous test of the Turtle Program, an early
      intervention program for behaviorally inhibited preschoolers. The proposed project will
      extend promising pilot study findings by: (a) evaluating the integrated intervention in a
      larger sample (n = 150) of 45-64 month children and their parents, which will allow for an
      examination of mediators and moderators of treatment effects; (b) comparing the Turtle
      Program to the best available treatment for preschool behavioral inhibition, the Cool Little
      Kids (CLK) parent psychoeducation group; (c) examining heart rate reactivity and regulation
      as both baseline moderators of treatment response and as outcome measures; (d) examining
      parent anxiety disorders as a moderator of treatment response; (e) including a mid-treatment
      assessment and extending follow-up to one year.

    <description>The Turtle Program involves a child social and emotional skills group (Social Skills Facilitated Play) and a modification of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in which parents are provided in-vivo coaching in following their children's lead and encouraging approach behaviors within the peer context. The child group provides a forum of same-age peers to learn to develop social and emotion regulation skills. The Turtle Program is administered over an 8-week period.</description>
