      Title: Intravitreal aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) in neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration with limited response to ranibizumab

      Purpose: The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the duration of
      treatment effects of intravitreal aflibercept on sub- and intraretinal fluid and best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in choroidal neovascularizations (CNV) due to age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD) in which the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided treatment
      interval failed to be extended to 6 weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the mean maximum recurrence-free treatment
      interval (Imax in weeks) with aflibercept treatment during the 24 months study peroid (for
      explanation see section Objectives). The individual maximum recurrence-free treatment
      interval (in weeks) at 24 weeks is defined as the maximum extension interval which is reached
      during the study follow-up period without showing any CNV activity (any intra-or subretinal
      fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage). This measure reflects the duration of aflibercept
      effect in these lesions with limited response to ranibizumab. Key secondary Outcome Measures
      are mean changes in BCVA score at 24 weeks from baseline (Δ BCVAscore), mean changes in CRT
      (µm) at 24 weeks from baseline (Δ CRT), mean number of treatments needed during the 24 weeks
      study follow-up, number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events (for
      further outcome measures see section Objectives).

      Population: This outpatient study population will consist of a representative group of 33
      male and female patients ≥ 50 years of age. The study population will include patients with
      subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD and being pre-treated with intravitreal ranibizumab in a treat
      and extend regimen and failed to be extended to 6-weeks intervals without showing CNV
      activity (for further information see section Criteria).

      Interventions: 1-arm interventional study with 2mg aflibercept intravitreally up to 4-weekly.
      The first treatment interval with aflibercept will be 4 weeks and corresponding to the treat
      and extend regime intervals will be increased in 2-weeks-steps as long as no CNV activity
      (any intra-or subretinal fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage) occurs. In case of occuring
      CNV activity the interval is shortened by 4 weeks with a minimum treatment interval of 4
      weeks.

      Title of study: Intravitreal aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) in neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration with limited response to ranibizumab

      Study purpose: The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the duration
      of treatment effects of intravitreal aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) on sub- and intraretinal
      fluid and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in choroidal neovascularizations (CNV) due to
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in which the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided
      treatment interval failed to be extended to 6 weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the mean maximum recurrence-free treatment
      interval (Imax in weeks) with intravitreal aflibercept treatment in an OCT- and fundus
      examination- guided treat and extend regimen within a 24 weeks study period. The individual
      maximum recurrence-free treatment interval (in weeks) at 24 weeks is defined as the maximum
      extension interval which is reached during the study follow-up period without showing any CNV
      activity (any intra-or subretinal fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage). This measure
      reflects the duration of aflibercept effect in these lesions with limited response to
      ranibizumab.

      Secondary Objectives are:

        -  mean changes in BCVA score at 24 weeks compared to baseline (Δ BCVAscore=BCVAscore 24
           weeks - BCVAscore Baseline)

        -  mean changes in CRT (central retinal thickness; in µm) at 24 weeks compared to baseline
           (Δ CRT=CRT 24 weeks - CRT Baseline)

        -  percentage of patients with a maximum recurrence-free treatment interval of more than 4
           weeks at 24 weeks

        -  mean number of treatments needed during the 24 weeks study follow-up

        -  percentage of lesions showing incidence of fluorescein leakage at baseline and 24 weeks.

        -  mean change in total lesion area at 24 weeks compared to baseline (ΔTotalArea=TotalArea
           24weeks - TotalArea Baseline)

        -  mean change in area of leakage from CNV at 24 weeks compared to baseline
           (ΔLeakageArea=LeakageArea 24weeks - LeakageArea Baseline)

        -  change of quality of life scores (VFQ-25, EQ 5D) from baseline to 24 weeks.

        -  number of participants with adverse events (not fullfilling the criteria of serious
           adverse events) as a measure of safety and tolerability of up to 4weekly dosing of
           aflibercept in CNV due to AMD

        -  number of participants with serious adverse events as a measure of safety and
           tolerability of up to 4weekly dosing of aflibercept in CNV due to AMD

      Population: This outpatient study population will consist of a representative group of 33

    <description>All eligible patients have to show a maximum treatment interval with ranibizumab (pre-study period) of 4 weeks (failed to be extended to 6 weeks, see Inclusion criteria), meaning that the mean maximum treatment interval at baseline is 4 weeks. During the study the treatment intervals with aflibercept will be increased in 2-weeks steps corresponding to the treat and extend regime (see Study design). The individual maximum recurrence-free treatment interval (in weeks) at 24 weeks is defined as the maximum extension interval which is reached during the study follow-up period without showing any CNV activity (any intra-or subretinal fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage).
