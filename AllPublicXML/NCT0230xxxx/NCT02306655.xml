      Fundamentals of scientific research The &quot;coital incontinence&quot; (IC), defined as the
      &quot;involuntary loss of urine in association with sexual intercourse.&quot; The incidence reported in
      the literature ranges from 10% to 27%, but is likely to be underestimated because of the
      embarrassment of the woman to report the disturbance. It was in fact estimated that only 3%
      of women speaks spontaneously to their doctor, and increases up to 20% only after a request
      by the medical staff.

      The CI is traditionally divided into two forms:

        1. incontinence at the time of penetration (60% of cases)

        2. incontinence during orgasm (40% of cases) Many theories have been proposed to justify
           this form of urinary incontinence, but none has been conclusively proved .Moreover, it
           has not been possible, to date, to identify risk factors, anatomical or urodynamics, for
           this condition.

      The IC is rarely a symptom isolated, but more frequently associated with other forms of
      urinary incontinence. In particular, the IC during penetration of associated with stress
      urinary incontinence (loss of urine that occurs due to coughing, sneezing and in general to
      all those activities that increase abdominal pressure); the IC during orgasm is associated
      more frequently to a condition of overactive bladder (presence of urgency, urge incontinence,
      increased urination day and night).

      The IC has a strong impact on female sexuality and can cause loss of libido, non orgasmic,
      decreased sexual satisfaction and, in some cases, termination of sexual activity.

      Research goals Evaluate a prospective investigation of health statistics, the incidence of
      coital incontinence into consideration that there are few data in the literature on this
      disorder and those who have reported a wide variance probably connected to how the data
      collection. The aim is to be able to identify a &quot;threatening condition&quot; which, if not
      evaluated, worsens the prognosis of the treatment of female urinary incontinence, a condition
      that has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients with significantly worse than
      that related to other recognized debilitating chronic diseases such as diabetes.

      And this individual psychosocial cost, hardly quantifiable, must be added the cost of
      significant socio-economic and welfare dependents of incontinent patients, the community and
      national health services. It is indeed evident from international and national literature
      that the more incisive and determined is the strategy of information, awareness and
      education, and adopted much wider and earlier the diagnosis, the more significant is the
      socio-economic savings, as well as psycho social, we get.

      Ultimate goal is to differentiate between them the two forms of incontinence coital (to
      penetration and during orgasm) because each of them is associated with pathogenesis and
      therefore to a separate treatment. And while the forms of IC penetration favorably affected
      the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, the forms of IC during orgasm, usually
      associated with a functional disorder of the detrusor (detrusor overactivity) show an
      inferior efficacy to treatment antimuscarinic traditionally reserved to the condition of
      overactive bladder and therefore need a more targeted diagnostic and individualized
      treatments.

      Materials and methods

      Self administered questionnaires will be dispensed to the patients The
      questionnaires,validated in Italian language, will be used, according to the guidelines of
      the International Consultation on Incontinence, :

        -  ICIQ-UI on urinary incontinence short-form: for the evaluation of symptoms and quality
           of life:

        -  Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC): to assess the impact of such a
           subjective condition;

        -  Urinary incontinence and quality of sexuality;

        -  Urinary incontinence and frequency of sexual activity; The questionnaire is anonymous in
           order to protect privacy. The patients will be recruited at the outpatient surgery and
           Urogynaecology urodynamics of Urology Clinic of the University of Perugia.

      The investigators defined that the statistically significant number of subjects can not be
      less than 200 units.

      The time duration of the collection of medical records was estimated at two years.

      There are no extremes of the conflict of interest, will not be tested or used drugs or
      medical equipment.
