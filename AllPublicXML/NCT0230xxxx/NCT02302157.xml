  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of cross sequential escalating doses of
      AST-OPC1 administered among 5 cohorts at a single time-point between 21 and 42 days post
      injury, inclusively, to subjects with subacute cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI).

    <criteria>

        Major Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sensorimotor complete, traumatic SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale A) for cohorts 1,2,3

          -  Sensorimotor incomplete, traumatic SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale B) for cohorts 4,5

          -  Last fully preserved single neurological level (SNL) from C-4 to C-7

          -  From 18 through 69 years of age at time of injury

          -  Single spinal cord lesion on a post-stabilization magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             scan, with sufficient visualization of the spinal cord injury epicenter and lesion
             margins to enable post-injection safety monitoring

          -  Informed consent for this protocol and the companion long term follow-up protocol must
             be provided and documented (i.e., signed informed consent forms) no later than 37 days
             following injury

          -  Able to participate in an elective surgical procedure to inject AST-OPC1 21-42 days
             following SCI

        Major Exclusion Criteria:

          -  SCI due to penetrating trauma

          -  Traumatic anatomical transection or laceration of the spinal cord based on prior
             surgery or MRI

          -  Any concomitant injury that interferes with the performance, interpretation or
             validity of neurological examinations

          -  Inability to communicate effectively with neurological examiner such that the validity
             of patient data could be compromised

          -  Significant organ damage or systemic disease that would create an unacceptable risk
             for surgery or immunosuppression

          -  History of any malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancers)

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 or weight &gt; 300 lbs.

          -  Active participation in another experimental procedure/intervention
