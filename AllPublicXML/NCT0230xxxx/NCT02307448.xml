    <textblock>
      This investigation plans to initiate the healing of chronic wounds by providing a
      concentrated platelet and growth factor therapy directly to the wound site by topical
      delivery. This therapy will be derived from autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP), an
      emerging surgical and wound care treatment. This investigation aims to demonstrate that
      patients with chronic, non-healing wounds treated with autologous PRP and standard medical
      care have a reduction in wound volume and improved healing rate that results in
      patient-centered clinically significant health outcomes as compared to patients treated with
      standard medical care only.

      This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, with a single-blind parallel design. 1,500
      subjects are planned to enroll in the study. Each subject will be assigned to the treatments
      in random order. The stratified permuted block randomization method will be applied to the
      patient assignment. In addition to three study populations, i.e., DFU, VU and PU, and study
      centers, stratification will be based on one overall variable, (1) nutritional status (Low:
      Prealbumin &lt;12mg/d vs. moderate: Prealbumin &gt;= 12 mg/d) and one variable for each wound type.
      Diabetic food ulcer will be based on offloading (2a) (Specialty shoes vs. Total contact
      cast), pressure ulcer will be based on offloading (2b) (mattress vs. cushion), and venous leg
      ulcer will be based on compression (2c)(Low: &lt;10 mmHG vs. High: &gt;=30mmHG). Randomization will
      proceed within strata according to a permuted block scheme with a block size, or balancing
      interval, varying randomly between 2, 4 or 6. The primary endpoint will be evaluated by a
      blinded physician to avoid the bias.

      Total duration of each patient in the study is expected to be 20 weeks.
