  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center trial to examine the rate of negative biopsy result and
      quality of life after focal ablation by radiofrequency energy. The primary evaluation
      involves assessing the rate of negative biopsy result using MR-US fusion biopsy six months
      after focal ablation of the prostate. Urinary and sexual quality of life will be assessed
      through validated measures. The hypothesis of our study is that focal ablative therapy will
      result in a greater likelihood of negative biopsy on followup biopsy than that observed in
      men who elect not to undergo therapy.

    <time_frame>6 months after focal bipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the trial will be assessed at 6 months after focal bipolar RFA by repeat mp-MRI imaging and fusion biopsy. Treatment efficacy, defined as a negative, will be determined by the results of the MRI-US targeted biopsy that will include regions treated by focal bipolar RFA.</description>

    <description>Men identified as having suspicious regions on a pre-biopsy mpMRI will be considered for enrollment. Following an MRI-US targeted biopsy of the prostate, men testing positive will be eligible for enrollment. All men enrolled in the study will undergo focal radiofrequency ablation and evaluated in follow-up.</description>
