      The purpose of the study is evaluating safety and clinical efficiency of full femtosecond
      laser-assisted anterior lamellar keratoplasty (FS-ALK) for curing patients with keratoconus
      and corneal opacities

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratoplasty is the most widely spread tissue transplantation procedure. Although penetrating
      keratoplasty (PKP) is still commonly used for curing corneal dystrophy and opacities of
      different genesis, lamellar techniques provide significant advantages in terms of safety and
      predictability.

      Al in all 13 FS-ALK procedures were performed for 11 eyes with advanced keratoconus and 2
      eyes with superficial corneal scattering Before and after surgery uncorrected visual acuity
      (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), postoperative astigmatism,
      endothelial cell loss, central cornea thickness, residual recipient's tissue thickness,
      corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CFR) were evaluated . At 1-year
      follow-up Confoscan investigation of donor-recipient interface was performed.

      All FS-ALK procedures were performed with Intralase FS 60kHz femtosecond laser in a following
      way. At first a 80% thickness corneal graft was prepared. Then maximum thickness recipients
      corneal dissection was performed according to OCT (optical coherence tomography) data and
      superficial tissue was removed. Transplant was fixed in a resulted bed by continuous suture.
