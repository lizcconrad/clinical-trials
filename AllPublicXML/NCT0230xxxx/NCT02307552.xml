      This study is being performed to verify the ability to use minimally invasive transurethral
      ultrasonic imaging technology for the purpose of identifying prostate cancer. Transurethral
      ultrasonic prostate imaging, may in the future, be used for detection and monitoring these
      disease processes to minimize the need for obtaining surgical biopsy specimens. The
      hypothesis is that tissue-density variations, as revealed in diagnostic ultrasonic imaging,
      results in unique image signatures for identification of prostate cancer. This imaging
      procedure provides a multifaceted view of the entire in-situ gland.

      The current use of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) for determining the likelihood of presence
      of cancer in the prostate gland requires interpretation and has a good but limited to predict
      prostate cancer on biopsy, with significant false prediction rates. More importantly as a
      blood test, the PSA test lacks the ability to pinpoint the location of the cancer within the
      prostate gland. Preliminary study findings have suggested that &quot;Transurethral Ultrasonic
      Scanning&quot; (TUUS) presents the desired improved diagnostic sensitivity for detection of cancer
      within the imaged prostate gland, and has the intrinsic capability to provide high resolution
      images of the transverse and future three-dimensional views of the entire gland better than
      currently used Transurethral Ultrasound (TRUS). Two important goals of the practicality of
      this minimally invasive technology will be assessed by this study. 1. The ability of TUUS to
      directly detect prostate cancer locations in the prostate. 2. The use of TUUS to successfully
      guide the prostate needle biopsy to cancer loci with a high rate accuracy.

      The Purpose of the Research The primary objective of this Institutional Review
      Board-controlled study is to determine if the presently manually-read results of TUUS data
      obtained with the novel UreScan device can be correlated with pathologist findings in a
      harvested prostate gland from an individual with diagnosed prostate disease. If successful, a
      future Institutional Review Board study will explore the use of computer software to examine
      the 256 transverse image slices of a large number of prostate cancer patients to establish
      the clinical applicability of TUUS for screening and assessment of individuals with elevated
      levels of PSA and/or positive digital rectal examinations (DRE), potentially reducing the
      number of future biopsy examinations with false-positive findings.

      Background Information The current use of Prostate Specific Antigen for determining the
      likelihood of presence of cancer in the prostate gland has been shown to be seriously flawed.
      Multiple studies reviewing the findings of referred biopsies, based on elevated PSA levels,
      resulted in as many as 70% false positive findings for cancer. Improved rapid,
      minimally-invasive, low-cost methodology and technology should be developed to provide
      diagnostic cancer findings that have higher sensitivity and specificity is the objective goal
      of the present research. Preliminary study findings have suggested that &quot;Transurethral
      Ultrasonic Scanning&quot; (TUUS) presents the desired improved diagnostic sensitivity for
      detection of cancer within the imaged prostate gland and has the intrinsic capability to
      provide high resolution images of the transverse and future three-dimensional views of the
      entire gland. Two important goals of this minimally invasive technology will be assessed by
      this study. 1. The ability of TUUS to directly detect prostate cancer in situ in the
      prostate. 2. The use of TUUS to successfully guide the prostate needle biopsy to cancer loci
      with a high rate accuracy.

      In a 2003 study by Holmes et al, the TUUS device was tested on 2 patients who had seeds
      implanted for prostate cancer. TUUS revealed more seeds (82%, 84%) than standard TRUS (63%,
      65%) in the 2 patients. These simple cases demonstrated the feasibility of providing
      transverse images of the entire prostate gland. Holmes postulated that this procedure would
      have to be automated to achieve any clinical utility value and the project essentially was
      abandoned by Mayo.

      The TUUS/&quot;UreScan&quot; system is a marriage of an off label usage of the FDA approved vascular
      probe, placed inside a standard foley catheter which is inserted into the penis onto the
      prostate to the neck of the bladder. The ultrasound probe travels the length of the prostate
      (~4-8cm) within the sheath of the catheter and images the entire prostate with ultrasound.
      The travel of the ultrasound probe is controlled by a small motor which is driven from
      outside the catheter and patient as well. This motor driven probe offers the possibility of
      accurate and reproducible ultrasounds of the prostate, as the patient's prostate apex is used
      the anchor point for study.

      Refinements to the TUUS system include:

        1. A Foley type introducer should be used for placing the intravascular ultrasound
           transducer in the prostatic urethral region to be imaged

        2. Use of a fixed-position, ultrasonic coupling gel-coated Introducer to eliminate the
           possibility of urethral abrasion or trauma as might otherwise occur without the
           Introducer when moving the transducer within the prostatic imaging region.

        3. Insertion into the Introducer of the wire-rotationally-driven ultrasonic transducer as
           coated with sterile water ultrasonic coupling between the transducer and introducer

        4. The examiner would then initiate the automated scanning procedure with analog/digital
           video data for each of 256 transverse axial image slices of the prostate gland. The
           scanning of the gland can be stopped or started at the election of the examiner

        5. A video-media record of the images derived from the procedure is available to an
           experienced reader for interpretation.

      The initial UreScan hydrophone verified specifications included: 1. 256 transverse,
      automatically axially advanced, image slices. 2. Approximately 267 megabits of video data. 3.
      Diagnostic ultrasound scanning of 100 revolutions per minute at 9.0 M Megahertz. 4. Radial
      penetration of 6 cm. The scanner features:

        1. The amplitude of reflected ultrasonic echoes from biological tissue, as displayed by a
           density-based oscillogram is directly proportional to the density of the tissue being
           insonated in an adjusted flat far-gain ultrasonic system.

        2. Longitudinal time-related, ultrasonic densitometry and image-registered comparisons of
           sonograms have demonstrated progression and/or regression of disease consistent with
           efficacy of treatment procedures. This facilitates future &quot;wait and watch surveillance&quot;
           of known or suspected lesions while potentially minimizing and/or eliminating
           unnecessary surgical biopsy tissues procedures

        3. The reflected echo waveform and sonogram has been shown to be unique for each type of
           disease entity. In prostate disease, there is a unique difference between the
           image-markers for prostate cancer and normal tissue.

      The present study protocol is to determine if image-markers for cancer and other unique
      prostate pathology can be specifically identified. Further clinical studies will be required
      to determine sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and (+/-) predictor values of this procedure.
      Additional studies will be required to determine if the amplitude of the image-markers could
      be used for determining the approximate stage of the image detected disease processes.

          <title>Measure Novel Transurethral Ultrasound Signatures to Detect Prostate Cancer</title>
          <description>The primary objective of this Institutional Review Board -controlled study is to determine if Trans urethral ultrasound can be used to identify prostate cancer, thus avoiding prostate needle biopsies for diagnosis</description>
          <population>Data were not collected because the study was discontinued due to lack of feasibility and negative results.</population>

          <title>All Patients</title>
          <description>All patients in the study will receive a scan of their prostate with the novel UreScan machine. All scans will be evaluated in their accuracy of detecting cancer loci within the prostate as compared to histopathological reviews of the prostate post robotic prostatectomy.
UreScan: The TUUS Foley/catheter will be inserted into the urethra via the ultrasound visualization onto the apex prostate, and the ultrasound extended through the urethra until the bladder neck and stopped. This is recorded twice automatically, and this should take 5-10 minutes for completion, and the prostate ultrasound data stored in memory. The ultrasound/subject interaction is now complete, and the study should add 30-60 minutes to the preoperative visit. No local or general anesthesia is used. The subject will be given 500 mg of Ciprofloxacin as a preventative measure against a urinary tract infection.</description>
