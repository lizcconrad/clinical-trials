      The study is designed to investigate difference in percentage of presentation of atelectasis,
      bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, or consolidation in 6 months after discharge in
      those treated with a low dose regimen of methylprednisolone initiated with 2 or 4 mg/kg/d for
      3 days followed by tapering, combined with sequential treatment with azithromycin versus a
      high dose regimen of methylprednisolone initiated with 10 mg/kg/d for 3 days followed by
      tapering, combined with sequential treatment with azithromycin.

    <textblock>
      Mycoplasma pneumonia pneumonia (MPP) accounts for approximately 10-30% of childhood
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in China. Macrolide is the first choice for MPP. However,
      progression to severe pneumonia might occur despite antibiotics therapy. And some patients
      have sequelae of bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiectasis and atelectasis, et al. Based on
      inflammatory and immunological mechanism, there is some clinical evidence that adjuvant of
      corticosteroid reduced morbidity and improved the outcome in the children with severe MPP.
      However, the dosage of corticosteroid varied greatly in studies. Therefore, a large
      prospective study is needed to define the benefits of high-dose corticosteroid therapy in
      MPP.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups: the low dose group and the high dose group. The
      low dose group will receive methylprednisolone 2 or 4 mg/kg/d for 3 days followed by tapering
      in 9 days, combined with sequential treatment with azithromycin. The high dose group will
      receive methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg/d for 3 days followed by tapering in 9 days, combined
      with sequential treatment with azithromycin. After discharge, patients of both groups will be
      followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.

      The number of pulmonary lesions, including atelectasis, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis
      obliterans, or consolidations, in 6 months after discharge will be compared in two groups.
      The number of adverse events, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, increased intraocular
      pressure, will be compared between the two groups.

      The trial will be completed in 35 months, with 630 subjects recruited from 9 hospitals in
      partnership with clinical research collaboration of National Clinical Research Center for
      Respiratory Diseases.
