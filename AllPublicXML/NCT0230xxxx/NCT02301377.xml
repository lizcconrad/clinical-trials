  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators know that adherence to medications in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is
      poor. Forgetfulness has often been reported as a barrier to adherence by both CF patients and
      their parents. Many of the investigators patients also report being motivated by the results
      of their lung function studies (PFTs) to stay adherent to their medications. In this study,
      the investigators would like to see if providing medication reminders and allowing patients
      to measure their lung function at home will lead to better adherence. This will be a pilot
      study to determine the feasibility of providing such as a device to children with CF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of home lung function monitoring
      and medication reminders on adherence, clinical outcomes and quality of life in children with
      cystic fibrosis (CF) who are between 10 and 21 years of age.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group.
      Those in the intervention group will receive a personal spirometer device that provides
      medication reminders and allows for lung function monitoring at home. The control group will
      receive the current standard of care. All participants will be aware that their adherence is
      being monitored over the course of the study using prescription refill data. Changes in lung
      function, body mass index and rate of hospitalization will be used as measures of clinical
      outcome. Responses to age-appropriate well-validated patient questionnaires will be used to
      assess the impact of the investigators interventions on quality of life and perceptions of
      treatment burden.

      Since this device has never been previously studied in this patient population, the
      investigators would like to do a pilot study with 5 patients (3 in the intervention group and
      2 in the control group) over a 3-month period to determine feasibility. This will also help
      us with the investigator power calculations and ultimately deciding the number of
      participants that will be needed for the larger study.

    <description>Participants will receive a Spiro PD personal spirometer that will allow them to measure their lung function at home and provide medication reminders. Participants will be instructed to use the device to check their lung function once a week. They will also be asked to use the medication reminder feature of their device daily. Participants in this group will receive a telephone call once a week from the research team to review lung function results and answer questions. All participants need to fill out a quality of life questionnaire at the time of enrollment and at the end of the study. Participants will be asked to sign a release form so their pharmacies can be contacted for prescription refill data to monitor adherence over the course of the study. All participants will be asked to come to their quarterly clinic visits with their pediatric pulmonologist where their height, weight, body mass index, lung function and frequency of hospitalizations will be assessed.</description>

        <title>Medication Adherence</title>
        <description>Overall adherence to inhaled hypertonic saline, dornase alfa and CF multivitamins based on prescription refill data. The actual number of prescriptions of each of the three medications filled in the 3-month period was divided by the number that should have been filled based on the prescribed amount of each medication and that value was multiplied by a 100 to generate a percentage.</description>

            <description>Subjects in this group were asked to use the Spiro PD personal spirometer to check their lung function once a week for 3 months. They were also asked to use the medication reminder feature of their device daily. Participants were trained on the appropriate use of their device at the time of enrollment. They also received weekly telephone calls from a respiratory therapist to review that week's lung function results. They filled out a quality of life questionnaire at enrollment and at 3 months. Information regarding their height, weight, lung function and frequency of hospitalizations over the previous 3 months were obtained at enrollment and 3-months from review of their medical records. Pharmacies were contacted for refill data during the 3-month study duration for inhaled hypertonic saline, dornase alfa and CF multivitamins.</description>
