  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and implement quality improvement programs for the
      treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in China based on the successful experience of the
      AHA‚ÄêGet with the Guidelines program. This two-year program will use data collection,
      analysis, feedback, and process improvement to extend the use of evidence-based guidelines
