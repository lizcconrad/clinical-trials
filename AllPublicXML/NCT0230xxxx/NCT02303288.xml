    <textblock>
      This is a post-market study of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. The study is being
      conducted in France. The objective of the study is to obtain data to further demonstrate the
      effectiveness and evaluate the safety of Argus II System in patients with retinitis
      pigmentosa who have a bare light perception or worse in both eyes.

      This study is a controlled, prospective, multi-centre, single-arm post-market study. All data
      collected will be obtained from procedures that are performed as part of routine patient case
      and from non-interventional questionnaires.

      Control will consist of three different matched comparisons:

        -  Post vs. pre-implantation (Baseline) data.

        -  Prospective within-subject comparisons (implanted vs. non implanted eye)

        -  Prospective subjects' visual performance Argus II System ON vs Argus II System OFF.

      Subjects participating in the study will undergo a Baseline Visit. The Baseline Visit is
      performed to screen the subject for eligibility for the device and to collect the study
      baseline assessments. Assessments include a complete eye examination and medical evaluation,
      retinal photography and Optical Coherence Tomography, Ultrasound A- and B-scans, the
      photographic flash test, visual acuity tests, the FLORA and a psychosocial evaluation in
      order to ensure that the subject has realistic expectations about the system. The NEI-VFQ-25
      questionnaire will also be administered.

      Subjects who are enrolled in the study will undergo a surgery to have the Argus II device
      implanted. Following implantation surgery, subjects will return to the clinic for periodic
      clinical follow-up and device fitting. They will also receive training and visual
      rehabilitation.

      Clinical follow-up visits will take place 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
      post-implant. Examinations and tests will be performed as at baseline. In addition, a patient
      satisfaction, Ease of Use, and Utilization of the System Questionnaire will be administered.
      Most of the visual function tests and measures will be conducted in both the implanted and
      fellow eye to provide data on the natural course of the participants' vision loss and as a
      control for measurements of visual function. In addition, the visual function tests and the
      FLORA will be done for the implanted eye with the device ON as well as OFF.

      Device Fitting refers to the procedure for customizing the Video Processing Unit (VPU) for
      use by the subject. Device Fitting is typically begins one week post-implant and is completed
      in approximately 4 sessions.

      Beginning approximately one month post-implant, subjects will receive training on how to use
      the Argus II System. There are two phases of training: system training and visual
      rehabilitation. During system training, subjects learn basic skills: how to connect the
      glasses to the VPU, change battery etc., how to control eye movements and RF link, how to
      scan the environment with head movements and how to use different filters and switch between
      program settings. During visual rehabilitation, subjects learn how to integrate the use of
      the Argus II System into their everyday life. Visual rehabilitation sessions will be provided
      by certified low-vision therapists and/or orientation and mobility specialists and will take
      place both at the clinic and the subject's home.

    <description>Visual function will be assessed using the following tests:
Square Localization: This test assesses subject's light projection.
Direction of Motion: This test indicates a subject's ability to detect the direction of a moving object.
Grating Visual Acuity: This test is designed to determine a subject's visual acuity using the principles of acuity charts such as ETDRS, modified for extremely low vision. It measures visual acuity between 1.6 to 2.9 logMAR.
Subjects' performance on the 3 tests above will be compared:
o Pre-vs. post-implant and. With the Argus II System ON vs. OFF</description>

    <description>The Argus II System is designed to provide visual function to individuals with severe to profound vision loss due to outer retinal degeneration. It consists of implanted and external components. The implant is an epiretinal prosthesis that is surgically implanted in and around the eye. The external equipment includes glasses and a video processing unit (VPU). The glasses include a miniature video camera, which captures video images, and a coil that sends data and stimulation commands to the implant. The VPU converts the video images into stimulation commands and is body-worn. The Argus II System operates by converting video images into electrical energy that activates retinal cells, delivering the signal through the optic nerve to the brain where it is perceived as light.</description>
