  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current model of care for the hospitalized elderly patients has been conditioned by many
      factors unrelated to the disease process that caused the hospitalization and usually worsen
      the outcome of hospitalization circumstances. Many times hospitalized elderly patients spend
      most of the time in bed (even higher than 83% of bed rest versus 4% of those who stand or are
      walking). These patients have their functional and physiological reserve reduced which makes
      them more vulnerable to the effects of being bedridden. The consequences are at multiple
      levels emphasizing the functional loss or cognitive impairment, longer stays, mortality and
      institutionalization, delirium, deconditioning, pressure ulcers and decreased caloric intake,
      social isolation, poor quality of life and increased use of resources related to health.
      Exercise training can prevent functional and cognitive decline and modify even the posterior
      trajectory.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in a Department of Geriatrics of a
      tertiary public hospital with 35 beds allocated. Hospitalized patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Patient recruitment will
      begin in the first 48 hours of admission to the ward, which will be identified through the
      list of patients admitted to the hospital and assigned to the Department of Geriatrics. The
      doctor who decides the inclusion in the intervention or control group will not be the
      attending physician. Patients or their families (if the patient has cognitive impairment)
      will be informed of the random inclusion in one group, but will not be informed as to which
      they belong. Randomization will be performed by applying http://www.randomizer.org/. The
      information in both the intervention group and the control group will obtained in four
      different stages: the initial visit and at months 3, 6 and 12 after hospital discharge.
