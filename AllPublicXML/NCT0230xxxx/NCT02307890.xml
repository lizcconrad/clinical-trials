  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers are increasingly utilised in liver transplantation
      but concerns exist regarding negative results. Ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) is damage to one
      or more bile ducts probably caused by inadequate blood flow or a failure of biliary
      epithelium to regenerate. It typically presents weeks to months after liver transplantation,
      is often refractory to treatment and can result in a requirement for re-transplantation.
      Although IC is more common following DCD liver transplantation, it is otherwise very
      difficult to predict and the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. The aim of this
      study is to correlate microRNA (miRNA) levels and markers of senescence in liver and bile
      duct biopsies taken during liver transplantation with the incidence of IC following liver
      transplantation.

      Study population

      Tissue from all deceased adult liver transplant grafts will be collected. The test samples
      will be selected from procedures were the liver transplant recipient has developed IC. The
      control samples will include tissues from procedures were the transplant recipient had an
      uncomplicated outcome. There will be matching of test samples and control samples based on a
      range of clinical factors.

      Consent

      Standard consent for organ donation documentation has a general consent to research section.
      Due to the small risk of damage to blood vessels when taking samples the liver transplant
      recipient will also be consented for these procedures to take place.

      Tissue sampling

      Liver and bile duct samples from each graft will be obtained at various different time points
      during liver transplant procedures.

      Processing of specimens

      Following removal of the specimens, samples will be divided then added to RNAlater (Life
      Technologies, Paisley, UK), 10% formaldehyde or will be snap frozen. At a later time point
      samples will be analysed.

      Definition of ischemic cholangiopathy

      IC will be defined as strictures, dilatations, or irregularities of the intra- or
      extrahepatic bile ducts of the liver graft. Isolated strictures at the bile duct anastomosis
      will be excluded. The diagnosis will be based on at least one adequate imaging study of the
      biliary tree, after exclusion of hepatic artery thrombosis by Doppler ultrasound, computed
      tomography or conventional angiography.
