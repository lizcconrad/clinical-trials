  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to identify psychological stress in children and adolescents of mentally ill parents
      as early as possible, a special intervention program (CHIMPs = Children of mentally ill
      parents) was developed. The study at hand will implement this intervention program at five
      sites in Germany and will further evaluate its effectiveness. The CHIMPs intervention is
      assumed to reduce children's psychopathology and enhance their health related quality of
      life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to implement the manualized family intervention CHIMPs
      (Children of mentally ill parents) for children and adolescents of psychiatrically ill
      parents aged between 3 and 18 years at the six participating centres in regular care. The
      intervention aims at reducing children's psychopathology and enhancing their quality of life
      in a sustainable way and, moreover, aims at introducing especially remarkable children and
      adolescents to an early intervention.

      The study represents a prospective, randomized and controlled multicenter study (RCT),
      contrasting one intervention group and one control group (TAU = Treatment as usual) by
      measurements at baseline and after six, 12 and 18 months. Within the data collection, the
      perspective of the psychiatrically ill parent, the partner, each child and the therapist will
      be considered. Children between 3 and 9 years of age will be evaluated only by the parents
      and the therapist, from 10 years on, an additional self-report form will be filled out by the
      child. The measurement will be ruled out indirectly (for the pre-post-measurement) as well as
      directly (at the end of treatment).

      For each endpoint, one comprehensive mixed model will be fitted to the data containing the
      baseline value and further relevant patient characteristics as covariates, the random group
      as factor and cluster (center, therapy group, family) as random effect. Missing values will
      be treated by direct imputation to allow an intention-to-treat analysis.

    <description>The long-term effectiveness of the CHIMPs intervention under conditions of practice will be examined in comparison to a control condition receiving the usual after care (Treatment as usual = TAU); this testing of effectiveness will be performed in due consideration of the health economic aspects.
The treatment as usual implies that families of the control Group receive the Treatment that is customary in regular care. Thus, these families normally don't receive any post-treatment. If, however, a member of a control group family appears to have an urgent need for treatment (every Family receives a comprehensive diagnostic investigation at the beginning of the study), the respective family will be placed in the ambulatory care system.</description>
