    <textblock>
      This trial will determine if depression treatment will reduce cardiovascular risk in
      HIV-infected patients already receiving HIV treatments. Half of the participants will undergo
      a specific computerized depression treatment with the other half receiving usual care from
      their HIV providers.

      The objectives of this study will be met by performing a 24-week, randomized, controlled,
      single-blinded, two-arm, parallel group, pilot trial at a single center. A total of 200
      subjects may be screened to identify 110 participants to be enrolled and randomized. These
      participants will be ≥ 18 years old, have been receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least
      one year with an HIV viral load &lt; 75 copies/mL at screening, and have major depression using
      the PHQ-9 questionnaire. These participants will be randomized 1:1 to either depression
      treatment with the Beating-the-Blues cognitive behavioral therapy program (N=55) or usual
      care (N=55).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by both: (1) any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme
             test kit at any time prior to study entry and (2) by at least one detectable HIV-1
             antigen or at least one detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load

          -  Age equal to or greater than 18 years

          -  Receipt of antiretroviral therapy of any kind for at least 360 days prior to screening

        Note: Interruptions in ART of up to 14 days total during the 360 days prior to screening
        are allowed

          -  HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 75 copies/mL at screening

        NOTE: There are no CD4 cell count eligibility criteria for this trial

          -  For women who are still of reproductive potential, a negative urine pregnancy test

             (yes) to one or more of the three questions on the Patient Suicidality Form (with last
             suicide attempt within the past ten years)

          -  Diagnosed vascular disease (documented history of angina pectoris, coronary disease,
             peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, aortic aneurysm, or otherwise
             known atherosclerotic disease)

        result in postponement of that study visit until the course of therapy is completed;
        postponement outside of the allowed study visit timeframe will result in study
        discontinuation

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding during the course of the study
