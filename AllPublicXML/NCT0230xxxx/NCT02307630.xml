  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how an antibody called Hu3F8 travels through the
      body and to tumors. Antibodies, like Hu3F8, are proteins that help attack tumors or fight
      infections. Antibodies can be made by your own body or in a laboratory. The target of an
      antibody is called an antigen; antibodies fit their antigen like a lock fits a key.

    <description>124I-hu3F8 at a dose of 3mCi/m2 (with a maximum dose of 5mCi) will be injected IV. 124I-hu3F8 PET/CT scans will be performed at approximately 2-4 hours, 18-26hours, 48-72 hours and 96-144 hours after injection of 124I-hu3F8. A low dose CT scan will be obtained with each PET scans. PET/CT scan images will be analyzed to determine biodistribution of 124I-hu3F8 and to determine dosimetry to organs and sites of disease. Comparison of tumor targeting and tumor dosimetry will be made between the two cohorts of patients: (a) NB and (b) other solid tumors. Blood will be drawn where feasible at multiple time points: approximately 0h, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4-8h, 24h, 48h, 96h and 120h-144h after injection of 124I-hu3F8 and radioactivity measured to determine pharmacokinetics of 124I-hu3F8.</description>
