  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the treatment by wearing shoes inclined at
      kinesitherapy because it is the first treatment offered by primary care physicians in chronic
      Achilles tendinopathy.

    <description>The shoe is inclined from front to back and from top to bottom of 8 °. This causes a controlled and an eccentric contraction during the passage.
During the walk we will have:
In support tardigrade : an ankle dorsiflexion with a stretching the Achilles tendon (eccentric contractions).
In support digitigrade: plantar flexion of ankle with a muscle contraction of triceps surae (concentric contraction).</description>
