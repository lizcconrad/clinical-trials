  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections and reactivation during pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) are a common occurrence and significantly contribute to
      post-transplant morbidity and mortality. The risk is high due to prolonged periods of immune
      deficiency while awaiting immune reconstitution post-transplant. Current strategies to reduce
      complications from viral infections include prophylactic treatment, close monitoring for
      viral infections and prompt treatment at the first sign of symptoms or increasing viral load.
      However, the most definitive treatment for viral infections remains the host's cellular
      defenses. Improved understanding of the immune systems response to viral infections may lead
      to better treatment strategies.

      This study is being done to explore the relationships between T-cells and NK cells (infection
      fighting cells) and viral infections or reactivations in young allogeneic stem cell
      transplant patients. The investigators will be looking at how these cells react and function
      in young patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as well as in healthy stem
      cell donors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To explore the expansion patterns of KIR+CD56+ T-cells and FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells in
           response to viral infection and reactivation in pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem
           cell transplant (HSCT) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To describe the phenotype of KIR+CD56+ T-cells and FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells in pediatric
           allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.

        -  To describe the specificity and functional capacity of KIR+CD56+ T-cells against viral
           antigens in both pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.

        -  To describe the functional capacity of FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells against CMV-infected
           cells in both pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.
