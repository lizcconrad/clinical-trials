    <textblock>
      Outpatients treatment with NSAI in renal colics has not been well investigated and there is
      no clear recommendations regarding this matter.

      The aim of this study is to determine if an oral NSAI treatment is beneficial in patients
      discharged for the emergency departement after the first line treatment of a renal colic
      investigating the recurrence of pain, the reconsultation rates and the admissions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal colic (RC)are a frequent cause of consultation in the emergency departement (ED).

      They count for approximatively 20% of patients presenting to the ED with severe acute onset
      abdominal pain.

      The first line treatment of renal colics is based on NSAI drugs associated with antalgics and
      is further investigated in the NSAI vs Morphine study (NCT02156596).

      But there is no clear recommendations regarding the outpatient treatment of renal colics.

      Oral NSAI are still widely used as a second line medicine for this condition and variety of
      molecules were tried with no solid scientific arguments.

      Piroxicam, a non-selective COX inhibitor drug appared to the Oxicam class of NSAI, is widely
      used to treat rheumatoid conditions and other inflammatory conditions and often prescribed in
      Tunisia as a second line treatment of RC.

      In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficiency and safety of the use of oral NSAI
      drugs (Piroxicam) compared to placebo as a second line treatment of renal colics.
