  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine affects 16% of the world population and is one of the most disabling of all
      disorders. It is a complex brain disorder characterized primarily by recurrent headache
      attacks. The signaling molecule serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has for decades been
      thought to play a central role in migraine pathophysiology. The most effective class of
      abortive migraine drugs, the triptans, act on 5-HT receptors. However, the migraine-specific
      actions of serotonin and the mechanisms of triptans are still unknown. In this project the
      investigators will use high-resolution positron emission tomography and specific radioligands
      to investigate the significance of serotonin in migraine. Two newly developed radioligands
      that are specific for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT4 receptor, respectively, will be applied. To
      investigate the level and distribution of serotonin in the migraine brain the investigators
      will compare the binding of these ligands in episodic migraine patients with healthy
      controls. In addition, the investigators will include chronic migraine patients to evaluate
      the relation between the level of serotonin in the brain and the frequency of migraine
      attacks. To investigate the changes in the serotonin level during a migraine attack and the
      effects of triptans on the central nervous system the investigators will repeat the scans
      using the 5-HT1B specific ligand during induced migraine attacks and following treatment with
      sumatriptan. The results from this study will shed light on the role of serotonin in the
      migraine brain and elucidate the migraine-specific action of triptans. This will improve our
      understanding of the migraine pathophysiology and, potentially, facilitate the development of
      more efficient treatment of migraine.
