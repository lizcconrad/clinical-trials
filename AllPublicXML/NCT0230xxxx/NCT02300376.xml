  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of patients with renal insufficiency and recommendations for medical treatment of
      patients who suffer from chronic renal failure are based on the different stages of
      Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). Many formulas exist to assess GFR. However these formulas
      are unreliable in many clinical situations (old people, obese patientsâ€¦). Methods for
      measuring GFR using exogenous tracers exist: Inulin and 51Cr-EDTA are historical reference
      tracers. Renal clearance of Inulin is the gold standard. However, using these methods is
      restricted to specialized services because it is long and expensive.

      There is no medical data for the use of Calcium edetate de sodium as a tracer to assess GFR.
      Calcium edetate de sodium is a treatment for lead intoxication. The extension of use as a
      tracer comes from its exclusive elimination by glomerular filtration.

      Plasma and renal clearance of Calcium edetate de sodium and Inulin will be measured for every
      included patient during a hospital day care (First visit V1). For transplanted patients,
      plasma clearance of Calcium edetate de sodium will be repeated within one week (more or less
      48hours) during annual medical check-up of renal transplantation (Second visit V2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria for V1:

          -  For transplanted patients : patients from 18 to 80 years, after estimation of their
             renal function by MDRDs formulas (MDRD = Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) ,

             function by MDRDs formulas, who need a reliable assess of their renal function, with a
             normal state body hydratation, with a social insurance and who have given their prior
             consent.
