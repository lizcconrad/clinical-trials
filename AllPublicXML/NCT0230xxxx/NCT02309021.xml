  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to examine the effect of exercise (EX) training on individuals currently receiving
      ST - either opiate replacement therapy (ORT) or heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) - for their
      opiate dependence. Main outcome variables will be: cardiovascular fitness; consumption of
      substances (e.g. &quot;street heroin&quot;, cocaine, cannabis, alcohol, cigarettes) other than
      prescribed ST or other prescribed medications; substance craving; blood pressure; lung
      function; resting pulse; social interaction; self-control capacity; objective and subjective
      sleep; cortisol levels; quality adjusted life years (QALYs); depression; mood. Covariates are
      current substitution dose and psychiatric diagnoses.

      The investigators aim is to carry out a randomized controlled trial comparing exercise
      training group and a control group of patients receiving substitution therapy (ST). The
      specific goals of the study are:

        1. To understand the exercise preferences, barriers to participation, motivation,
           experiences and attitudes regarding exercise training in patients under ST.

        2. To examine whether a 12-week exercise programme affects the mental health, subjective
           and objective sleep, quality of life, self-control capacity, substance craving, hair
           cortisol levels, secondary consumption, cardiovascular fitness, blood pressure, lung
           function, resting pulse, and social interaction in patients receiving ST.

        3. To compare the effects of the EX and control conditions on the above-mentioned outcome
           variables.

        4. To examine to what degree the covariates of heroin substitution dose and psychiatric
           comorbidities affect outcome variables.

        5. To explore to what extent objective variables (cardiovascular fitness, pulse, blood
           pressure, lung function, cortisol, objective sleep-EEG-parameters) and
           subjective-psychological dimensions (subjective sleep, social interaction, symptoms of
           depression and anxiety, self-control, substance craving) are interrelated.

    <description>Participants randomised to the exercise condition will receive 12 weeks of physical exercise training. Once they have been assigned to this group, they will be informed about the training programme and its content. Training will be carried out in groups (two groups of ten or four groups of five, depending on scheduling, sport preferences, available materials) to ensure that individual attention can be paid to each participant.</description>

    <description>The control group will not receive any exercise training. In order to control, as far as possible, for the potentially therapeutic effects of extra contact time with investigators, and the potentially motivational elements of participation in an intervention, the C group will have equal contact time with an investigator and participate in a leisure program without physical activity component. This time will be filled with group mealtimes, games, films, painting, handcrafts, stretching or relaxation exercises.</description>
