  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to monitor physical activity longitudinally with a wrist
      activity tracker specifically in PAH patients newly initiating ERA therapy and to assess the
      correlation with the 6MWD at different time points. Further objectives are to assess the
      correlation of physical activity measured with the tracker and other parameters for clinical
      evaluation and right ventricular function assessment (i.e. Biomarkers, WHO Functional class,
      hospitalization due to PAH, Echochardiography and Quality of Life) as well as sleep efficacy
      in PAH patients newly initiating ERA therapy.
