    <textblock>
      UX023T-CL201 is an, open-label, Phase 2 study. The study will be conducted in adults aged 18
      years or older with TIO or ENS whose tumor/skin lesion is inoperable to assess the efficacy
      and safety of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous injections monthly (every 4 weeks) for a
      total of 144 weeks. Subjects will need to discontinue oral phosphate and vitamin D metabolite
      therapy prior to randomization and throughout the duration of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a clinical diagnosis of TIO/ENS based on evidence of excessive FGF23 that is not
             amenable to cure by surgical excision of the offending tumor/lesion (documented by
             investigator)

          2. Be ≥18 years of age

          3. Have a fasting serum phosphorus level &lt;2.5 mg/dL

          4. Have an FGF23 level ≥ 100 pg/mL by Kainos assay

             filtration rate (TmP/GFR) &lt;2.5 mg/dL

             formula). Subjects with eGFR ≥30 but &lt;60 mL/min will be considered eligible as long as
             in the opinion of the investigator the decline in renal function is not related to
             nephrocalcinosis.

          8. Have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and be willing to have additional

             had a total hysterectomy

             study (sexually active subjects), and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug

         10. Be willing to provide access to prior medical records to determine eligibility
             including imaging, biochemical, and diagnostic, medical, and surgical history data

         11. Provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has been explained, and
             prior to any research-related procedures

             schedule and comply with the assessments (in the opinion of the investigator)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a prior diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and/or
             hepatitis C

          2. Have a history of recurrent infection, a predisposition to infection, or a known
             immunodeficiency

             partner) at any time during the study

          4. Have participated in an investigational drug or device trial within 30 days prior to
             Screening or are currently enrolled in another study of an investigational product or
             device

          5. Have used a therapeutic monoclonal antibody, including KRN23, within 90 days prior to
             Screening or have a history of allergic or anaphylactic reactions to any mAb

          6. Have or a have a history of any hypersensitivity to KRN23 excipients that, in the
             judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

          7. Have used a pharmacologic vitamin D metabolite or its analog (e.g., calcitriol,
             doxercalciferol, and paricalcitol), phosphate, or aluminum hydroxide antacids (e.g.,
             Maalox® and Mylanta®) within 2 weeks prior to Screening or during the study

          8. Have used medication to suppress PTH (e.g., Sensipar®, cinacalcet, calcimimetics)
             within 2 months prior to Screening

          9. Have a history of malignancy within 5 years of study entry with the exception of
             PMT-MCT (Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors of the mixed connective tissue type) tumors
             or non-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell skin cancer

         10. Have donated blood or blood products within 60 days prior to Screening

         11. Have a history of allergic reaction to or have shown adverse reactions to a
