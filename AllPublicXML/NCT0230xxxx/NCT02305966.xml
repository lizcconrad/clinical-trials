  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reverse total shoulder replacement surgery (RTSA) is performed for individuals with advanced
      arthritis of the shoulder who also have tears in their rotator cuff muscles. A metal
      hemisphere is placed in the shoulder blade, and a plastic cup on a stem is placed in the
      upper arm. This orientation is opposite to the normal anatomy, giving rise to the term
      &quot;reverse&quot; shoulder replacement. While RTSA has a good clinical track record, no studies have
      examined how well fixed the implanted components are within patients.

    <description>All patients will receive a Delta XTEND reverse shoulder implant (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, IN). At the time of surgery, 0.8 mm diameter Tantalum marker beads will be injected into the bone surrounding the implant, (n = 6 surrounding the glenoid and n = 6 surrounding the proximal humerus). Half of the patients (n = 20) will be randomized by an opaque envelope intra-operatively to receive a cemented humeral component, and half will be randomized to receive a press-fit (uncemented). Similarly, half of the patients (n = 20) will be randomized by an opaque envelope intra-operatively to receive a lateralized glenoid component, and half will be randomized to receive a non-lateralized glenoid component.Therefore, 4 randomization groups will be created and one of them is -pressfit humerus &amp; non-lateralized glenoid.</description>
