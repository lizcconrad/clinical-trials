  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro results showed a protective effect against acids for the mouthwash containing
      Curolox™ peptide. The goal of this in situ study is to detect the Curolox™ peptide under
      natural oral conditions on the tooth surface and to proof the in vitro results obtained. So
      far there are no effect and safety data of the Curolox™ mouthwash under natural oral
      conditions available.

      The primary objective of the study is the detection of the Curolox™ peptide on the bovine
      enamel sample (proof-of-concept) under in vivo conditions after rinsing with the
      peptide-containing mouth wash.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. safety and tolerance of the mouthwash in participants

        2. identification of the duration the Curolox™ peptide is present on the bovine tooth
           surface under in vivo conditions

        3. identification of the most effective mouthwash rinsing volume (2.5 mL or 5 mL)

        4. prophylactic effect of multiple applications of the mouthwash confirmation of the
           prophylactic effect of the Curolox™ peptide obtained in in vitro study
