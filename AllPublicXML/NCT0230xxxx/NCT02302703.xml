      Background: IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) describes chronic abdominal pain, which may be
      relieved with defecation and a change in stool frequency and consistency. Its prevalence
      among children and adolescents is estimated to be 10-15%. Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity is
      defined as gastrointestinal symptoms which increase with eating gluten-containing foods and
      improve with a gluten-free diet. FODMAP (fermentable oligo-,di-,mono-saccharides and polyols)
      are carbohydrates that are not absorbed well in the small intestines, therefore fermented by
      gut microbiota, increasing osmotic load at the intestine causing fluid shift and gas
      production. The patient suffers bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and change of stool
      consistency. Many foods are FODMAP-rich, including fruit and vegetables, legumes, artificial
      sweeteners and soft drinks.

      Working hypothesis and aims: To study the effect of Low FODMAP diet vs. Gluten free on
      gastrointestinal symptoms in children with IBS, assuming a beneficial effect based on
      research in adults.

      Methods: 40 children with IBS, aged 6-18 years, will be examined by the pediatric
      gastroenterology team at Hadassah. All children will record one week of baseline diet and
      symptoms, then will be randomly selected into a low-FODMAP or Gluten-free diet for one week,
      together with a washout period of one week between the diets. During the two weeks of
      intervention diets, the children aided by their parents will document and score symptoms
      (bowel movements, abdominal pain, flatulence). An analysis of the symptom score will measure
      the anticipated influence of each diet against baseline diet and symptoms.

      Expected results: In previous studies, a change in symptoms was viewed within a few days. We
      expect to see a reduction of symptoms in one or other of the diets, to prove our hypothesis.

      Outline of Study Design, including Plan of the Study and Methods:

      Aims: comparing the effects of low FODMAP diet versus gluten-free diet on IBS symptoms in
      children.

      Study design: prospective randomized, crossover trial. Study Population: we are aiming to
      recruit 40 children aged 6-18 years who answer the pediatric ROME III criteria for IBS.
      Children will be recruited to the study by physicians at pediatric gastroenterology clinics.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Other diagnosis (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease).

        2. Patient receiving chronic medical therapy.

        3. Patient already on a restrictive diet (e.g. gluten-free, lactose-free) All patients will
           document baseline diet - a diary of 7 days by parents/patient specifying exact contents
           of meals. They will document and score baseline symptoms including stool consistency and
           frequency, abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence. The baseline documentation will be
           performed by the child, or by his parents, according to the patient's age and ability.

      The patients will be randomly selected to one of the intervention groups. A clinical
      dietitian has created interventional diets. Half of the patients will start with the low
      FODMAP diet and half will start with Gluten free. After 7 days, the participants will return
      to a 7 days washout period of their regular diet. After this period, the groups will switch
      between the intervention diets, for additional 7 days. During the two weeks of intervention
      diets, the patients will document and score symptoms as described for the baseline
      documentation.

      -There will be special consideration to several dietary elements in the baseline diet, e.g.
      patients who may regularly consume high lactose, gluten or FODMAP in their daily diet.
