    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies a palliative care program in improving the quality of life
      of patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer. Palliative care is care given to patients
      who have a serious or life-threatening disease, and focuses on managing disease symptoms,
      side effects of treatment or the disease, and improving patient quality of life. Studying a
      palliative care program used for other types of cancer may help doctors learn whether it can
      improve the quality of life of patients with pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To pilot-test an interdisciplinary Palliative Care Planning Intervention (PCPI) in
      pancreatic cancer. Specifically, to describe patients' satisfaction with the timing, content,
      and delivery of the PCPI intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To pilot-test all selected measures for the study, including measures for healthcare
      resource utilization, overall cost, and patient/family out of pocket expenses.

      II. The long-term objective of this pilot study is to conduct a larger PCPI intervention
      study for pancreatic cancer patients and evaluate its impact on quality of life (QOL),
      symptom intensity, healthcare resource utilization, and healthcare costs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a handbook titled &quot;Supporting You During Cancer Treatment&quot; with educational
      material on QOL issues. Patients undergo 2 education sessions on handbook material in-person
      or by telephone, with session 1 focusing on physical and social well-being issues and session
      2 focusing on psychological and spiritual well-being issues. At the beginning of each
      session, patients select 3 priority topics from a list, and content is tailored to patient
      needs.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.

Transcripts will be assigned codes. Content analysis occurring through coding consisting of line-by-line analysis with themes identified will be initiated. The research team will independently analyze selected segments of the data to verify themes. Coding will be checked and validated by the principal investigator and research team.</description>
