    <description>Stroke: sudden, focal neurologic deficit from a presumed cerebrovascular cause, not reversible within 24 hours and not due to na identifiable cause.
Non-CNS systemic embolism: abrupt vascular insufficiency associated with clinical or radiologic evidence of arterial occlusion.
Valve thrombosis: any thrombus attached to or near an implanted valve that occludes part of the blood flow, interferes with function or warrant treatment.
Mortality: Deaths any cause. Venous thromboembolism: verification by definitive diagnostic evaluation. Deep Vein Thrombosis: abnormal compression ultrasound or intraluminal filling defect on venography or autopsy.
Pulmonary embolism: at least one: 1) intraluminal filling defect on CT scan; 2) intraluminal filling defect on pulmonary angiogram; 3) high- probability on v/p lung scan; 4)inconclusive spiral CT, pulmonary image with demonstration of DVT in the lower extremities; 5) autopsy</description>
