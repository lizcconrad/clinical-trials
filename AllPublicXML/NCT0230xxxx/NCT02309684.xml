      The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of the bio-ConneKt™ wound dressing and
      compare its performance with the standard of care at NFRMC Wound Therapy Services, for the
      treatment of chronic foot/leg ulcers (DFU/VLU) in a prospective single center open one-arm
      clinical study.
