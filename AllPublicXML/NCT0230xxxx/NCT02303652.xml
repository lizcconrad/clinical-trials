      This study aimed at evaluating multiple aspects of biatrial contractility recovery after
      modified maze procedure during mitral valve surgery.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent complication in patients affected by mitral valve
      disease, causing systemic embolism, cardiac chamber dilation and decreased cardiac output.
      Cox et al. have designed the maze procedure as a surgical treatment for patients with AF in
      whom conventional therapy has failed and their lesion set is nowadays currently performed
      with different energy sources in order to surgically treat such supraventricular arrhythmia.
      In particular, the original maze was designed with three specific goals in mind: 1) the
      permanent AF ablation 2) the restoration of atrioventricular synchrony and 3) the
      preservation of atrial transport function (1). If , by one side, the efficacy of the
      procedure in reaching the first two goals are widely known, the restoration of the sinus
      rhythm does not always accompany the corresponding recovery of atrial mechanical &quot;kick&quot;. If
      the atrial transport function fails to recover, benefits deriving from arrhythmia abolition
      might only be marginal, since, by one side, blood stasis in the atria persist, thus
      maintaining unchanged thromboembolic risk and, by the other side, heart hemodynamic
      performance is still impaired resulting from the loss of atrial contribution to cardiac
      output. Despite its relevant role for judging maze comprehensive success, atrial
      contractility outcome and clinical importance have not been deeply investigated. The purposes
      of this study were to evaluate by serial transthoracic echocardiography temporal modality of
      biatrial contractility restoration, predictive factors of atrial transport recovery and its
      possible relationship with cardiac chambers dimensions and function evolution after
      radiofrequency (RF) maze during mitral surgery.

    <description>All patients were evaluated with 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography at 3,6,12,24 months in order to specifically monitor the evolution of cardiac chambers dimensions and systolic performance and to record left and right atrial contractility presence.
Transmitral flow velocity was measured with pulsed Doppler echocardiography, with a sample volume positioned at the level of the mitral tip in the apical four-chamber view and was recorded on a strip chart at a paper speed of 100 mm/s. Peak velocity and the time-velocity integral of the early filling wave (E wave) and of the late filling wave (A wave) were determined. A/E ratio, representing atrial contribution to ventricular diastolic filling, was obtained. Each measurement was obtained as an average of 6 to 8 consecutive beats.</description>
