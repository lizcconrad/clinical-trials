  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severity of colorectal cancer (CRC) is evaluated by its local staging, locoregional and
      general ( presence of metastases , usually liver ). This is the most common cancer in France
      and, despite surgical treatment of the primary tumor, it is still subject to a high mortality
      rate due to metastatic evolution, mainly hepatic .

      There is currently no specific marker for predicting cancer, the same hardly changed , which
      would modulate the aggressive therapeutic strategy . antigen (CEA) is used in the monitoring
      of JRC made.Tissue factor (TF) is the VII tissue factor receptor. it initiates the
      coagulation cascade. it was noted as a true cell marker tumorale1 aggressiveness.
      Corroborating evidence that the way the TF plays an important role in the invasive and
      metastatic potential of CRC. First, various human cancer cell lines express the FT colic.
      Furthermore, there is a relationship between the importance of monocyte TF expression and the
      evolutionary potential of human CRC.

      The investigators hypothesize that these interest intra-platelet and plasma markers are a
      reflection of tumor angiogenic potential. And the investigators will verify the superiority
      of their preoperative levels in the CRC group compared with the control group, normalization
      of postoperative after surgical resection rates and their possible re-ascent in case of tumor
      recurrence in the CRC group.

      The levy to one month in controls allow us to verify the absence of secondary modification to
      laparotomy, the colectomy and general anesthesia.

      The investigators assume that the rate of soluble TF in peripheral blood of the holders of
      CRC patients may be a marker of invasion and aggression (i.e. prognosis).

      The study is to measure the TF in the blood, as well as ACE, C reactive protein and
      E-selectin. The TF will also be measured in the tissue removed during surgery.
