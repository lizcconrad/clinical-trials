               -  Post-menopausal defined as amenorrhoea for at least 12 months or more following
                  cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments and follicle stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) levels in the post menopausal range.

               -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral

             Effective contraceptive methods are:

               -  Sexual abstinence from before the first administration of the IMP until 3 months

               -  For Part 2: Subjects with a history of recurring gingivitis/periodontitis or
                  signs of current gingivitis/periodontitis. Gingival evaluation will be performed
                  by a dental hygienist or trained study physician. Evaluation of bleeding
                  propensity due to gingivitis will be performed by using dental hygienist
                  instrumentation. Exact measurement of gum pockets is not needed.

               -  Subjects with a history of hyperkeratosis or erythema in palms or soles.
