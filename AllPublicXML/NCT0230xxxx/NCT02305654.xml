  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international phase III trial, with a Bayesian design, incorporating two
      sequential randomisations. It efficiently examines a series of questions that routinely arise
      in the sequencing of treatment. The study design has evolved from lengthy international
      consultation that has enabled us to build consensus over which questions arise from current
      knowledge and practice. It will enable potential randomisation for the majority of patients
      with inguinal lymph node metastases and will provide data to inform future clinical
      decisions.

      InPACT-neoadjuvant patients are stratified by disease burden as assessed by radiological
      criteria. Treatment options are then defined according to the disease burden strata.
      Treatment is allocated by randomisation. Patients may be allocated to one of three initial
      treatments:

      A. standard surgery (ILND); B. neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by standard surgery (ILND);
      or C. neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by standard surgery (ILND).

      After ILND, patients are defined as being at low or high risk of recurrence based on
      histological interpretation of the ILND specimen. Patients at high risk of relapse are
      eligible for InPACT-pelvis, where they are randomised to either:

      P. prophylactic PLND Q. no prophylactic PLND

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>

    <description>The primary outcome measure that will be measured for all trial patients is survival time. This is defined in whole days as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause; for those who have not been reported as dead at the time of analysis, the survival time will be censored at the date of last follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-specific survival time which is defined in whole days as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death specifically from disease; for those who have not been reported as dead at the time of analysis, the survival time will be censored at the date of last follow-up and for those whose death is reported as non-disease specific then the survival time will be censored at date of death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-free survival time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival time (DFST) which is defined in whole days as the time from date of randomisation to the date of either locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis or death from disease, whichever occurs first; for those who have not been reported as experiencing any of these events, the DFST will be censored at the date last known to be alive and free of disease or date of non-disease-specific death. A supplementary exploratory outcome measure will also be calculated taking date of penectomy as the origin rather than date of randomisation.
Subsidiary outcome measures will be
locoregional recurrence free survival time (LRFST).
distant metastases free survival time (DMFST).
A supplementary exploratory outcome measure will also be calculated taking date of penectomy as the origin for all these outcome measures rather than date of randomisation.</description>

    <description>In addition to the outcome measures, the acceptability of both randomisations will be monitored based on the proportion of eligible patients approached for randomisation, the proportion of approached patients consenting to randomisation and the proportion of randomised patients receiving their allocated treatment. This will provide ongoing information regarding the feasibility of the trial successfully completing to target.</description>
