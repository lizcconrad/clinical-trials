  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in this study the investigators will call patients who had Subchondral fractures and treated
      in our department over the last 20 years.

      The investigators will evaluate their shoulder function by a questionary, Constant score and
      radiologic evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient evaluation by:

      - Physical examination, questionary Constant score: Pain (severe, moderate, mild, non),
      activity level (sleep affected/sport limitations/daily living limitations/arm positioning)
      and range of motion (forward flexion/lateral elevation, internal and external rotation).

      - Radiologic examination: Axial view, Axillary view and Anterior posterior view- to evaluate
      the level of osteoarthritis by Kellgren Lawrence score and Samilson score.
