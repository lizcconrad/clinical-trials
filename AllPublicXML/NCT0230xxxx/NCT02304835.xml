      This study was a national, longitudinal, prospective, observational survey, carried out in
      metropolitan France, with a sampling of 21 birth control centres.

      The aim of this study was to assess, in real life conditions, the benefit of a urinary
      semi-quantitative test (hCG Duo 5-1000) in the follow-up of medical abortion by analysing the
      concordance between qualitative results from the urinary test and quantitative values from
      the beta-hCG blood measurement.

    <measure>concordance between qualitative results from the urinary test and quantitative values from the beta-hCG blood measurement.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the follow-up at 2-3 weeks after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>There was concordance if :
The result of urinary test is &lt; 1000 IU/L and the value of β-hCG blood measurement was &lt; 1000 IU/L, Or if
The result of urinary test is ≥ 1000 iu/L and the value of β-hCG blood measurement was ≥ 1000 IU/L.
There was discrepancy if:
The result of urinary test is ≥ 1000 IU/L and the value of β-hCG blood measurement was &lt; 1000 IU/L, Or if
The result of urinary test is &lt; 1000 IU/L and the value of β-hCG blood measurement was ≥ 1000 IU/L.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the urinary semi-quantitative test by the patient</measure>
    <time_frame>at the follow up at 2-3 weeks after the inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of the acceptability is descriptive:
The rate of patients who performed the urinary test.
Assessment of the urinary test by physicIan : very easy/easy/difficult/Impossible
The assessment by the patient: questionnaire (Have you found the explanations given sufficient for performing the test?, How did you find the carrying out of this test? What are your feelings about checking the results of the medical abortion yourself?)</description>
