    <textblock>
      Efavirenz, an antiretroviral drug used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1
      (HIV-1) infections, is known for its neurological and psychiatric adverse events. Efavirenz
      is part of Atripla®, a single tablet regimen (STR), currently the most prescribed
      antiretroviral drug in the Netherlands. Recently, a new STR has become available, Eviplera®
      containing a successor of Efavirenz, named Rilpivirin. It has been shown in the phase-3 ECHO
      and THRIVE studies that Atripla as well as Eviplera have excellent and comparable
      antiretroviral efficacy in naive HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, data from these studies
      have shown that Eviplera was associated with fewer neurological and psychiatric adverse
      events than Atripla over 48 weeks. However, this was only patient reported adverse events,
      not neuropsychological evaluation. Furthermore, they were treatment naïve for HIV. Moreover,
      there might be a bias in these kind of switch studies due to the fact that those patients who
      switch will mostly regard their new combination better than the old one. Contrary, data on
      the long term impact of Efavirenz on neuropsychological performance and symptoms are
      conflicting.

      Objective: This study aims to investigate the effect of switching from Atripla to Eviplera on
      neurocognitive performances (neurocognitive testing) and imaging (functional MRI scanning) in
      virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients.

    <measure>To evaluate the neurocognitive performance as measured by neuropsychological test composite score after 12 weeks in stable HIV-infected patients switched from Atripla to Eviplera compared to a control group of patients on Atripla.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo a neuropsychological test battery where multiple standardized test will be undertaken to assess 7 different domains; Verbal Fluency, Executive Functioning, Speed of Information Processing, Learning, Memory, Attention/Working Memory, Motor skills. Raw scores can be calculated per domain and as a composite score. Differences in mean changes in composite score between baseline and end of study will be assessed with a paired T-test. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Within-arm changes will be assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and between-group comparisons will be evaluated with Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Multivariate analyses will be performed to analyse differences in the primary endpoints between the study groups.</description>

    <measure>to assess the correlation between neurocognitive improvement (neuropsychological evaluation) and functional imaging (fMRI) after switching Atripla to Eviplera</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The aim is to investigate if there is a correlation between improvement on neuropsychological test scores after 12 weeks of Eviplera therapy, and changes on fMRI after 12 weeks of Eviplera therapy. If there is a correlation, that means fMRI could be used to evaluate neurocognitive decline. Basically, we will asses if there is a correlation between ∆neuropsychological score and ∆fMRI-score. Because this is ordinal data, we will use a Spearman rank-order correlation to calculate a correlation-coefficient.</description>

    <measure>to assess drug levels of Efavirenz (as a component of Atripla) and Rilpivirin (as a component of Eviplera) in relation to changes in neurocognitive performance and fMRI in both patient groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>With this study, we want to investigate the effect of switching Efavirenz (as a component of Atripla) to Rilpivirine (as a component of Eviplera) on neurocognition. Our hypothesis is that neurocognition (as measured by neuropsychological testing scores) will improve when switching from Efavirenz (as a component of Atripla). If that is the case, hypothetically a lower or higher drug level of Efavirenz (as a component of Atripla) could have an effect on neurocognition (as measured by neuropsychological test scores). We will assess the correlation between drug level of Efavirenz or Rilpivirine and changes in neurocognitive function as measured by neuropsychological testing, and fMRI changes by regression analyses using drug levels as an independent variable and neuropsychological test scores as a dependent variable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>to evaluate the usefulness of PROMIS instruments in HIV research</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In our study, we will use the PROMIS instruments Anxiety, Depression, Sleep disturbance and Satisfaction with social roles and activities. These are all short forms containing 8 questions or statements. Patients are asked to rate the questions from 1-5 into which extent they believe them to be true; 1 being not at all and 5 being very much. For each short form, a score will be calculated by adding the values of the response to each question. PROMIS provides a score conversion table where the score can be translated into a T-score. This rescales the patient's score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. In order to provide these results, PROMIS uses a calibration sample containing data from over 21000 respondents. Differences in mean changes between baseline and end of study, as well as between the two study groups will be calculated using a paired T-test.</description>
