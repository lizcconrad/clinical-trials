  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn if the medication Memantine Hydrochloride (the
      study medication) can help adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. Dr. Alberto Costa
      and his research team want to see if a 16-week treatment with this medication can improve the
      participant's ability to learn and remember things. In this study, memantine hydrochloride
      will be used. Thus, the researchers want to learn whether the study drug can help improve
      memory in young adults with Down syndrome. To test the effect of the study medicine, half of
      the people in the study will receive the study medicine and half will receive a placebo (an
      inactive substance). Memantine is an approved medication to treat memory and thinking
      problems in persons with Alzheimer disease. However, little is known about the effect of this
      medication in persons with Down syndrome and it has not been approved for use in persons with
      Down syndrome.

      This study seeks to investigate if the medication Memantine Hydrochloride can help young
      adults with Down syndrome. Two hundred persons with Down syndrome from both genders and
      between 15 and 32 years of age will be recruited from two sites: Cleveland, OH, USA and SÃ£o
      Paulo, SP, Brazil. Participants will be assigned randomly to either a placebo group or a
      group taking the active medication with a 50% probability of being on either group. Neither
      the participants nor the investigators will know who will be taking the study medication and
      who will be taking the placebo during the study. Only the investigational pharmacist will
      have access to this information.

      Up to 60 people with Down syndrome of the recruited study participants will take part on an
      optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. This investigation is aimed at helping to
      make the EEG study more precise and to find out whether the study medication has any
      significant effect on the structure of the brain.

      Additionally, we will recruit a control group of 60 age- and gender-matched participants
      without Down syndrome. The goal is to investigate how different groups of people activate
      their brains when they hear or see something, and if he can use high-density EEG and MRI to
      see how this study medication works in persons with Down syndrome. In other words, this
      additional control group should help us ascertain which parts of the test results are due to
      a person having Down syndrome and which ones are not. Persons without Down syndrome will only
      come for one EEG visit and one MRI visit, and not be asked to take the study medication.

      The visits for the participants with Down syndrome will be as follows:

      Screening visit (approximately 2-hour long). The subject will be asked about his/her health,
      medical history, social background, and work background, as well as some simple questions to
      determine performance on tests of memory and function that are part of this study. Informed
      consent and assent will be obtained in this visit. At the end of this visit, an EEG machine
      will be used to access brain responses to different auditory and visual stimuli. Some will be
      asked if they would be willing to have an MRI performed, but this portion is not imperative.

      A urine sample will be collected and used to obtain cells that will be kept frozen for
      potential future studies. If the date of the screening visit is not convenient, this sample
      can be collected during any of the next five visits.

      Visit 1 (approximately 1 hour). Pulse, blood pressure, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be
      taken. At the end of the visit, urine and blood samples will be taken. Pregnancy will also be
      checked.

      Visit 2 (2-3 hours). Tests of memory, learning, and reasoning skills will be conducted before
      the start of the study medicine or placebo. At the end of this visit, a 60-day supply of
      either the study medicine or the placebo will be given. This will need to be taken for 16
      weeks.

      Visit 3 (approximately 30 minutes). Eight weeks after the beginning of the treatment, the
      participant will return to assess how she/he is doing under the treatment. Pulse, blood
      pressure, a physical exam, and pregnancy will be checked. At this visit, another supply of
      study medicine will be given.

      Visit 4 (2-3 hours). Sixteen weeks after starting the medicine, the participant will take a
      second series of tests in learning, memory, and reasoning skills to find out whether there
      were any changes in these skills.

      Visit 5 (approximately 1 hour). In the 16th or 17th week after starting the medicine, the
      participant will meet one more time with the doctor from visits 1 and 3. Vital signs, a
      physical exam, and an ECG will be taken, as well as a blood sample to ensure nothing has
      changed with the participant's general health. For women, a pregnancy test will be performed.

      If for some reason the subject withdraws from this study prior to Visit 5, he/she will be
      asked to return to the clinic for a &quot;Treatment Discontinuation Visit.&quot; In addition, if the
      participant discontinues the medication prior to the end of the study, he/she will be asked
      to complete a &quot;Retrieved Dropout Visit&quot; on the date that should have represented Visit 5.
      Study medication will not be provided beyond the study period.

    <measure>Efficacy of the drug Memantine as assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) short form</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy measure is focused on episodic memory. It assesses supraspan word learning ability as an index of episodic verbal long-term memory. The choice of the appropriate measure for individuals with Down syndrome was based on results of our pilot clinical trial of the drug memantine in young adults with Down syndrome (Boada et al., 2012). We hypothesize that treatment with memantine will produce significant improvements in the CVLT-II short form. Two dependent variables were selected, based on prior literature, as indexing hippocampal function: Total number of target items correct summed across learning trials 1-4, and total free recall discriminability for the learning trials, which takes into account hits as well as false positives.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the drug Memantine as assessed by Paired Associates Learning (PAL) from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of non-verbal memory that requires the participant to learn associations between an abstract visual pattern and its location. Two dependent variables have been selected: Total number of items correct on the first trial of each stage, and total number of stages completed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the drug Memantine as assessed by Recall of Digits (Differential Ability Scales; DAS-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of rote short-term verbal memory. Total number of items correct will be used as the dependent variable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the drug Memantine as assessed by Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM; part of the CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of non-verbal memory. Total number correct across the two series of items presented will be used as the dependent variable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the drug Memantine as assessed by Spatial Working Memory (part of the CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The test requires participants to search under a series of colored boxes to locate a &quot;blue token&quot; hidden underneath one of them. During a series of trials, the participant is told that the token will be in a new location each time and that they should not go back to a location he or she has looked in previously. Two dependent variables were selected: 1) The total number of errors (&quot;between errors&quot;), which indexes the number of times a participant went back to a box where a token had already been found; and 2) a &quot;strategy&quot; score, which indexes the number of times the participant started a search with a different box, the latter being an inefficient strategy (i.e., high strategy scores denote poorer performance).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the drug Memantine as assessed by Spatial Span (part of the CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is a computerized version of the Corsi Blocks task, a long-standing neuropsychological test. Two dependent variables were selected for this test: 1) span length, which is the longest sequence of numbers recalled accurately (possible score ranges from 2 to 9); and 2) total usage errors, which represents the number of times a subject selects a box no in the sequence being recalled.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the drug Memantine as assessed by The Go - No Go task</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of inhibitory control, often used as a marker for prefrontal-striatal function integrity. Specifically, it measures the participant's ability to inhibit pre-potent behavioral responses that have been established by provision of prior &quot;go&quot; or &quot;no-go&quot; cues in a classical conditioning paradigm. Two dependent variables were selected: 1) the proportion of no-go targets in which a subject fails to inhibit a response under the go-cue (pre-potent) condition; and 2) speed of response execution to Go targets.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability of the drug Memantine as assessed by the incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse events will be monitored by clinical history, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, and the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intellectual functioning of the participants as assessed by Matrices subtest of the Differential Ability Scales-II (DAS-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This test will provide a measure of non-verbal reasoning ability that requires subjects to visually inspect a matrix of 4 or 9 pictures that has a missing piece. Participants have to infer a rule or pattern in the stimuli, and select the appropriate response from a range of 4-6 possibilities. Since age norms are not available for individuals older than 17y11m, the ability score will be used as the dependent variable. This is an intermediate score based on Rasch modeling that corrects for different items set being administered to participants.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Linguistic functioning of the participants as assessed by the Test for Reception of Grammar 2nd edition (TROG-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of receptive syntax skills (Bishop, 1983). Participants are asked to point to a picture (out of 4) that corresponds to a phrase or sentence spoken by the examiner. The total number of items correct (rather than blocks passed) will be used as the dependent variable, following the administration manual's ceiling rule.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Linguistic functioning of the participants as assessed by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-IV (PPVT-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of receptive semantics, whereby the participant is asked to point to a picture (out of 4) that corresponds to a word spoken by the examiner. As this test has a 0.85 correlation with composite measures of Verbal IQ (i.e. from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale series), it can be used in conjunction with the Matrices subtest to estimate overall intellectual functioning. The total number of items correct was used as the dependent variable, following the administration manual's rules for basals and ceilings.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adaptive/Behavioral Functioning of the participants as assessed by the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised (SIB-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of adaptive functioning that integrates information from 13 different domains (e.g., gross motor, social interaction, eating, toileting, dressing, personal self-care, etc.). It is in a questionnaire format, which a caregiver can complete while the participant is being tested. Standard scores for all indices will be derived from age norms that extend from birth to age 80, as these will be used as dependent variables.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory study of electroencephalographic (EEG) Recordings of Evoked Potentials as potential biomarkers for the severity of the cognitive disability associated to Down syndrome and for the efficacy of the memantine treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Auditory and visual evoked potential experiments will search for significant differences in peak amplitude and latency of MMNs in persons with Down syndrome in relation to typically developing persons without Down syndrome, and in participants with Down syndrome before and after memantine treatment</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory study of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as potential biomarkers for the severity of the cognitive disability associated to Down syndrome and for the efficacy of the memantine treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>MRI studies will be to provide precise source localization for the high-density EEG recordings of evoked potentials in a subset of 30-60 participants of this trial. In addition, these experiments will also produce high resolution sagittal slice images of the hippocampus and simple connectivity data sets</description>
