  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can improve health, prevent complications due to HIV infection,
      and prevent HIV transmission by making people less infectious. Men who have sex with men
      (MSM) are at high risk for transmitting HIV, but face stigma and discrimination that can make
      ART adherence difficult. Our goal is to find out if an intervention involving provider
      counselling and support from an MSM peer will improve ART adherence and engagement in care
      among Kenyan MSM. This study will be carried out in the KEMRI clinic in Mtwapa with 70 MSM
      patient participants who reside in this area, identified through our outreach and testing
      programs in Mtwapa. Six providers and five peers who are trained for the intervention will
      also be consented in order to collect data on their feedback and help monitor the study. Our
      intervention consists of support from a trained peer with experience taking ART and enhanced
      counselling from providers that is aimed to motivate patients to improve and maintain their
      health. In an initial pilot test, we will implement our intervention with 10 MSM starting ART
      for the first time. After any needed revisions to research procedures and training, we will
      next conduct a small randomized controlled trial with 60 MSM patient participants to
      determine feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, and safety, and estimate an initial
      effect size for the adherence intervention. The 60 patient participants will be randomized to
      our intervention or to standard counselling care, and will be followed for 6 months to
      evaluate their ART adherence and retention in care. Providers and peers will give feedback at
      regular project meetings and in in-depth interviews after the pilot test and after the RCT.
      The work proposed for this project will be carried out over 2 years, from June 1, 2014
      through May 31, 2016.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although men who have sex with men (MSM) are at very high risk for HIV globally, this group
      has only recently become an important focus of national HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan
      Africa. While it is clear that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce AIDS-related morbidity
      and mortality and prevent sexual transmission from HIV-infected MSM, this group faces
      significant stigma that can impede engagement in care. Based on qualitative research
      conducted in 2013-2014 in coastal Kenya, we have developed an intervention called &quot;Shikamana&quot;
      (a Kiswahili word meaning &quot;to form a bond or stick together&quot;) to improve HIV treatment
      engagement, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes in this group. We now propose a 2-year study
      to pilot test and conduct an initial evaluation of this intervention. Our specific aims are
      to: 1) pilot test our evidence-based intervention for MSM and ensure that the intervention is
      feasible and acceptable to patient, peer, and provider participants; and 2) implement a small
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the resulting multi-component intervention versus
      standard care with 60 MSM patient participants. Ten patient participants will be followed in
      the pilot test for 3 months each, with monthly measurement of ART adherence, baseline and
      month 3 measurement of adherence correlates, and feedback from participants and staff on the
      intervention procedures. After fine-tuning of the intervention based on the pilot test, we
      will follow 60 MSM patient participants for 6 months each, with monthly measurement of ART
      adherence, baseline and quarterly measurement of adherence correlates, viral load testing at
      month 3 and month 6 as a biomarker of treatment success, and feedback from participants and
      staff on the intervention procedures. Findings from this formative 2-year study will provide
      qualitative data on the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, safety, and quantitative
      data on preliminary effect sizes to test this intervention and its components in a fully
      powered RCT including a larger, more diverse sample of MSM from multiple sites in sub-Saharan
      Africa.
