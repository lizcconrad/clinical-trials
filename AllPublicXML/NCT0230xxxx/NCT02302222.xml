    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of Customizable in the management of
      extensive closed surgical incisions for Subjects undergoing abdominal surgery for incisional
      hernia repair and/or functional panniculectomy as compared to SOC dressing, and to
      significantly reduce the SSC rate experienced by Subjects receiving Customizable vs. SOC
      surgical incision dressing.

          2. able to provide their own informed consent

          3. will undergo:

               1. a functional panniculectomy with a transverse or a fleur-de-lis incision

                    -  AND/OR -

               2. an incisional hernia repair with a vertical incision at least 20 cm in length and
                  at least 10 cm of undermining on each side of the incision

          4. BMI equal to or greater than 30

          5. has maintained a stable weight for at least 3 months as determined by the Investigator
             (applies to post weight loss patients only)

          6. pre-operatively assessed to undergo a procedure with a CDC Wound Classification of:

               1. Class I (Clean): An uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is
                  encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital or uninfected urinary tract
                  is not entered

                    -  OR -

               2. Class II (Clean Contaminated): An operative wound in which the respiratory,
                  alimentary, genital or uninfected urinary tract are entered under controlled
                  conditions and without unusual contamination

          7. willing and able to return for all scheduled study visits

          8. if a female of child-bearing potential, must test negative on a urine pregnancy test

          9. if a female of child-bearing potential, must be willing to utilize an acceptable
             method of birth control (i.e. oral contraceptives, condom with spermicide, diaphragm
             with spermicide, implants, IUD, injections, vaginal rings, hormonal skin patch) for
             the duration of the study

        Intra-Operative Inclusion Criteria:

          1. continues to meet all pre-operative inclusion criteria

          2. has undergone a Class I or II CDC Wound Classification procedure resulting in a closed
             surgical incision able to be covered completely by Customizable dressing

        Pre-Operative Exclusion Criteria:

          1. has a systemic bacterial or fungal infection at the time of surgery for incisional
             hernia repair and/or functional panniculectomy

          2. has a remote-site skin infection at the time of surgery for incisional hernia repair
             or functional panniculectomy

          3. pre-operatively assessed to undergo a procedure with a CDC Wound Classification of:

               1. Class III (Contaminated): Open, fresh, accidental wounds, and/or major breaks in
                  sterile technique or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract

                    -  OR -

               2. Class IV (Dirty-Infected): Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue
                  and those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera

          4. will have a transverse or fleur-de-lis incision that extends beyond the flank area and
             requires moving the Subject from the supine position during surgery

          5. has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to silver, or drape materials that contain
             acrylic adhesives

          6. has participated in a clinical study within the past 30 days

          7. who, in the investigator's opinion, would have any clinically significant condition
             that would impair the Subject's ability to comply with the study procedures

        Post-Operative Exclusion Criteria:

          1. found to meet any of the pre-operative exclusion criteria

          2. determined to have a CDC Wound Classification of:

               1. Class III (Contaminated): Open, fresh, accidental wounds, and/or major breaks in
                  sterile technique or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract

                    -  OR -

               2. Class IV (Dirty-Infected): Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue
