  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a simple to use device that facilitates the monitoring of
      the upper eyelids motion, acquires the eyelid vertical movement and enables analysis and
      graphic presentation of the results. the device system consists 3 components : glasses for
      the patient including magneto sensitive probes, hardware and dedicated software.

      Our purpose is to characterize eyelid motion in normal population. The methods include
      measuring each patient 10 minutes during watching a short movie.

      Essentially, for Hall-probes monitor the magnetic field generated by a tiny magnets attached
      to the upper eyelid.
