    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of UCB5857. Part 1 of the study explores single doses
      of the drug. Part 2 of the study explores giving the drug every day for 14 days. The study
      uses healthy and psoriasis subjects.

      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single
      center study designed to evaluate the safety/ tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of UCB5857 following oral administration of single ascending doses
      (SAD) in healthy subjects (Part 1) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) in healthy and
      mild-to-moderate psoriatic subjects (Part 2).

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of UCB5857
      when given as single oral doses in healthy subjects and as ascending multiple oral doses in
      healthy subjects and mild-to-moderate psoriatic subjects.

             effective contraception will be used (eg, condom + spermicide, and an additional
             contraceptive method used by the partner). Male contraception is not required if the
             male subject has undergone effective vasectomy &gt;3 months prior to the study; however,

             99.5°F) inclusive

          -  Subject's ECG is considered &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot; but clinically nonsignificant (as
             interpreted by the Investigator). If the subject has 1 isolated finding outside the
             specific range that is deemed potentially clinically significant, rescreening may be
             allowed at the discretion of the Investigator, following discussion with the Sponsor's
             Study Physician

          -  Subject

               -  Has an active infection (eg, sepsis, pneumonia, abscess)

               -  Has history of latent, chronic, or recurrent infections (eg, tuberculosis,
                  recurrent sinusitis, genital herpes, urinary tract infections) or at risk of
                  infection (surgery, trauma, infection requiring antibiotics, history of skin
                  abscesses) within 3 months prior to IMP administration

               -  Has experienced a significant episode of gastroenteritis (defined as loose stools
                  associated with abdominal pain and/ or fever) during the 7 days prior to IMP
                  administration

               -  When in doubt, the Investigator should confer with the Sponsor's Study Physician

          -  Subject has a history of positive tuberculosis (TB) test or evidence of possible TB or
             latent TB infection at Screening (interferon gamma release assay [IGRA] testing)

          -  Subject has received live attenuated vaccination within 3 months or any other type of
             vaccine within 4 weeks prior to Screening or intends to have such a vaccination during
             the course of the study

          -  Subject who has any of the following hematology values at Screening:

               -  Hemoglobin; for women &lt;11 g/ dL; for men &lt;13 g/ dL

               -  ANC &lt;1.5x109/ L (&lt;1500/ μL)

          -  Subject has an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study. In
             addition any subject with any of the following findings will be excluded:

               -  QTcF interval &gt;450 ms in 2 of 3 ECGs.

               -  Bundle branch blocks and other conduction abnormalities (other than mild first
                  degree atrioventricular block) such that PR interval ≥220 ms

               -  Irregular rhythms other than sinus arrhythmia or occasional, rare
                  supraventricular or rare ventricular ectopic beats

               -  In the judgment of the Investigator, T-wave configurations are not of sufficient
                  quality for assessing QT interval duration

          -  Subject has active neoplastic disease or history of neoplastic disease within 5 years
             of Screening (except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in
             situ that has been definitively treated with standard of care)

          -  Subject has any other acute or chronic illness which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator or the Sponsor's Study Physician, could pose a threat or harm to the
             subject

          -  Subject is legally institutionalized or has a mental health condition or related care
             provision (eg, guardianship) that would impede the subject from providing voluntary
             informed consent to participate in the study

        Healthy subjects only

          -  The subject has used nicotine-containing products (including, but not limited to,
             cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch, or nicotine gum) within 6
             weeks prior to Check-in (Day -1) or anticipates an inability to abstain from these
             products for the duration of the study

          -  Subject has a high consumption of xanthine-containing products (≥300 mg of xanthine
             equivalent per day [1 cup of coffee ≈ 100 mg of caffeine; 1 cup of tea ≈ 30 mg of
             caffeine; 1 glass of cola ≈ 20 mg of caffeine]) Psoriatic subjects only

          -  Subject has received systemic nonbiologic psoriasis therapy (methotrexate [MTX],
             steroids, cyclophosphamide) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA)/ultraviolet A (UVA)
             phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Subject has received treatment with biologic agents within 12 months prior to the
             study
