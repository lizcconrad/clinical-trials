        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject whose age is ≥ 18 years;

          -  Subject has a single target aneurysm located in the following zones:

          -  Zone 1 - Petrous through cavernous of the ICA

          -  Zone 2 - Ophthalmic segment of the ICA

          -  Zone 3-Posterior Circulation, basilar artery (not including the basilar bifurcation),
             vertebral artery

          -  Subjects with a single target intracranial aneurysm located along the internal carotid
             artery, or the vertebral or basilar artery for whom existing endovascular options
             (coiling, stent-assisted-coiling) could be ineffective or because aneurysm is
             predisposed to recurrence due to having any of the following characteristics:

          -  Aneurysms with a neck &gt; 4mm, dome to neck ratio ≤2 or no discernible neck

          -  Fusiform aneurysms of any size requiring treatment;

          -  The parent artery must have a diameter of 2.5 - 5.0mm distal/proximal to the target
             intracranial aneurysm (IA);

          -  Subject fulfills study requirements, and the subject or his/her legally authorized
             representative provides a signed informed consent form;

          -  Negative pregnancy test in a female subject who has had menses in the last 24 months;

          -  Subject is willing to return for the 1-month and 6-month follow-up evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding; Subject who suffers from a subarachnoid
             hemorrhage in the last 60 days;

          -  Subject who suffers from any intracranial hemorrhage in the last 30 days;

          -  Subject currently undergoing radiation therapy for carcinoma or sarcoma of the head or
             neck region;

          -  Subject with stenosis of the parent artery (&gt;50%) proximal to the target aneurysm;

          -  Subject with known platelet dysfunction or a contraindication to or inability to
             tolerate anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents;

          -  Subject with contraindications or severe allergies to anticoagulants or antiplatelet
             medications (aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor);

          -  Subject with known hypersensitivity to metal, such as nickel-titanium and metal
             jewelry

          -  Subject with documented contrast allergy, or other condition, that prohibits imaging.

          -  Evidence of active bacterial infection at the time of treatment;

          -  Subject who has had a previous intracranial stenting procedure associated with the
             target aneurysm;

          -  Subject with life-threatening diseases.
