  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that aligning adherence with the patient's own clinical course
      achieves better asthma control and identifies risks for future loss of control, compared to
      current best practice. The study has an adherence optimisation phase, week 1-12 followed by a
      medication management phase, week 12 to week 32.

      The investigators will compare two asthma education interventions, standard Guideline
      recommended practice and feedback from the individual's own INCA device, which assess inhaler
      adherence and relates adherence with changes in PEFR and symptom scores over time.

      The aim of the study is to then incorporate adherence into Guideline recommended medication
      changes so that asthma control is improved and medication rationalised at the end of the
      intervention.

      A secondary aim is to assess the long-term effectiveness of this approach on control and
      exacerbations.

      The investigators hypothesize that aligning adherence with the patient's own clinical course
      achieves better asthma control and allows physicians to identify risks for future loss of
      control, compared to current best practice.

      The investigators will compare two asthma education interventions, standard Guideline
      recommended practice and feedback from the individual's own INCA device, which assess inhaler
      adherence and relates adherence with changes in PEFR and symptom scores over time.

      The aim of the study is to improve and maintain adherence to preventor therapy, so that
      medication and other costs as well as quality of life, exacerbation rates are optimal.

    <description>Normal Care group This management is based on the recommendations of the BTS/SIGN group (http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/Portals/0/Guidelines/AsthmaGuidelines/sign101%20Jan%202012.pdf)
The core features of the &quot;usual care&quot; group are:
The patient's inhaler technique will be checked using a checklist, at each visit. If there are errors these will be corrected using teach-to-goal principals.
Adherence will be discussed and barriers to adherence addressed, using motivational interview techniques.
Written action plans for managing asthma, based on changes in PEFR and symptoms will be given.
In follow up, medication changes in response to the above will be directed by these, as suggested by Guidelines</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>INCA feedback</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The patient's treatment goal is established and used as the focus of the conversation.
Data from the INCA device including (1) time of use, (2) handling proficiency and (3) inhalation flow rates are discussed, with three graphs as shown in the appendix and derived as discussed. These are aimed to enhance the value of the inhaler.
Data from the hand held PEFR and AQLQ are correlated with the adherence so that these can be used to account for improvements or declines in these measures.
In follow up, medication changes in response to the above(adherence, PEFR, ACT and exacerbations) will be made</description>

    <intervention_name>INCA feedback</intervention_name>
    <description>The study team have developed a device which is attached to inhalers that makes an audio recording of the inhaler being used. Analysis of this audio data provides objective evidence of the time of inhaler use, technique of use and the peak inspiratory flow the patient makes each time they use their inhaler. Our preliminary experiences with the information obtained from this device indicate that adherence is poor in patients with severe asthma due to any one the following issues poor time of use, errors in handling and low peak inspiratory flow rates.</description>
