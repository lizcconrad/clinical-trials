    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial, a type of research study. The purpose of this phase 1
      clinical trial is to find out whether a new study drug, ibrutinib, is safe in patients with
      T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has either come back or not responded to treatment. In this
      phase 1 study, different doses of ibrutinib (560 mg and 840 mg daily) will be tested to see
      what effect the drug has on the patient and the disease.

    <description>This will be a standard dose-escalation study to determine the MTD of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory PTCL or CTCL. At each dose 6 patients with TCL (PTCL or CTCL) will be enrolled. The first 6 patients will be enrolled at dose level 1. Dose escalation to the next dose level will proceed after DLT assessment of all 6 patients at the end of cycle 1 (28-days).</description>

    <description>Ibrutinib will be administered once daily continuously until disease progression (confirmed by two assessments for CTCL patients only) or intolerance. The dose levels for the Phase 1 portion of the study. Either 560 mg (4 X 140 mg capsules) or 840 mg (6 X 140 mg capsules) doses will be administered. After the recommended expansion dose is established, an expansion cohort of 12 additional patients will be treated at the recommended expansion dose to further characterize the safety at that dose and to further assess preliminary efficacy</description>
