      This pilot-study aims to evaluate the treatment effects and feasibility of an
      internet-delivered CBT-program adjusted for adolescents with functional abdominal pain and
      functional dyspepsia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional abdominal pain (FAP) and functional dyspepsia, are common in adolescents and
      associated with impaired quality of life. In adults with IBS, internet-delivered CBT leads to
      reduced symptoms and increased quality of life, but studies in children are lacking. This
      pilot-study aim to evaluate the treatment effects and feasibility of an internet-delivered
      CBT-program for adolescents with FAP and FD.

      Method: Pilot study with a pre-post-design and no control group. The internet-delivered
      CBT-program will last for 10 weeks and include weekly therapist support, consisting of online
      messages and telephone calls.

    <measure>Faces pain scale - R</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain intensity measured with a self-rating scale daily during 2 weeks at baseline and daily during 10th to 12th week post treatment for analysis of effect.The Faces Pain Scale is a self-report measure used to assess the intensity of children's pain. Faces have four faces representing least pain and most pain on equal intervals on a scale from 0-10. Its validity is supported by a strong positive correlation (r=0.93, N=76) with a visual analogue scale (VAS) measure in children aged 5-12 years. The metric for scoring (0-10) conforms closely to a linear interval scale.</description>

The scale ranges from 1 (no problem at all) to 5 (impossible). It is validated for children and adolescents with chronic abdominal pain with high internal consistency, α = .86 for boys and α = .91 for girls (Claar and Walker, 2006).

    <description>The Internet-delivered exposure treatment is based on the well-established internet-delivered CBT-treatment for IBS in adults, adapted for adolescents with FAP/FD and their parents. Main component in the treatment is exposure for symptoms. The purpose of the treatment is to reduce fearful and anxious responses to symptoms and lessen avoidance of symptoms in the adolescents, and to teach the parents how parental behavior can influence symptoms in children as well as how to support exposure. Detailed behaviour analysis is made for each individual and instruction is given on how to gradually expose to symptoms to lessen fear for symptoms and widen the behavioral repertoire.</description>
