      A chart review will be completed on patients with multiple sclerosis to determine potential
      early characteristics that might be helpful in defining aggressive onset MS and predicting
      subsequent disease course and disability

    <description>Disability outcomes will be determined based on EDDS at last visit. EDSS at last follow up will be compared to EDSS at start of respective therapies and grouped into 3 categories: EDSS improved, EDSS no change and EDSS worsened. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to test individual variables that could potentially influence the outcome, including treatment, age at onset, gender and race.</description>
