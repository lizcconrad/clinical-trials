      The purpose of this study is to compare the tolerability of Pregvit® to a common prenatal
      vitamin (Orifer® F) among pregnant women with morning sickness or those suffering from a
      variety of conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, there is a large choice of perinatal vitamins on the market. Materna® is taken by
      70% of Canadian women. A recent study by the investigators team has shown that up to 35%-53%
      of women with moderate to severe morning sickness discontinue their Materna®. One main reason
      is that its large size causes difficulties in swallowing, which prompts women to stop taking
      the drug. The second main reason for stopping is gastrointestinal adverse effects from the
      iron content, which causes nausea, vomiting and constipation.

      A new periconceptional multivitamin supplement, Pregvit®, was introduced to the market in
      September 2003 by the Canadian company Duchesnay Inc. with the aim of trying to overcome the
      disadvantages of the existing multivitamin supplements. PregVit® is a prenatal multivitamin
      that contains 35 mg elemental iron, as ferrous fumarate. It is formulated into 2 small
      tablets (each tablet:16 mm × 9 mm × 4 mm), containing different vitamins and minerals,
      particularly separating the iron (morning tablet) from the calcium (evening tablet) to
      optimize iron absorption. The use of PregVit® requires a physician's prescription.

      Since Materna® or other generic products are the most commonly used non-prescription (i.e.
      over-the-counter) prenatal multivitamins, they were not selected for comparison in the study
      because enrolled subjects who had discontinued a prenatal multivitamin most likely had
      discontinued any one of them. Ethically, subjects in this situation cannot be randomized to
      resume Materna® or another generic prenatal multivitamin.

      Instead, Orifer F® was selected as the small-tablet prenatal multivitamin (one tablet: 5 mm
      radius, 5 mm thickness), containing a high iron content (60 mg elemental iron as ferrous
      sulphate). It is taken daily as a single tablet and the use of Orifer F® does not require a
      physician prescription (i.e. over-the-counter).

      Comparing tolerability of PregVit® to Orifer F® would address separation of the potential
      effect of iron content from that of tablet size on multivitamin tolerability among pregnant
      women and women suffering from morning sickness or those suffering from a variety of
      conditions such as, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Peptic-Duodenal Ulcer, Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome, Celiac Disease, as well as anemia or hypothyroidism.

    <measure>The difference in rates of ability to take multivitamin [either Pregvit® or Orifer®F]</measure>
    <time_frame>Study completion was defined as completing monthly telephone interviews (when possible) to document pill intake and adverse events up until the end of pregnancy (i.e. 36 weeks gestation or further).</time_frame>
    <description>Rates of adherence and adverse events will be compared by using chi-squared tests, as appropriate. Adherence will be also compared between the 2 treatment groups through Kaplan-Meier survival curves in 2 ways. The first survival curve analysis will compare the proportion of women with standard adherence (i.e. at least 80% pill intake over time), after having commenced supplementation with the assigned multivitamin, and the p-value was determined by the Wilcoxon (Peto-Prentice) test.</description>

    <description>Rates of adherence and adverse events will be compared by using chi-squared tests, as appropriate. Adherence will be also compared between the 2 treatment groups through Kaplan-Meier survival curves in 2 ways. The second survival curve analysis will compare overall adherence among women who commenced supplementation with the assigned multivitamin, at any percentage of pill intake over time, and the p-value was determined by the log rank statistic. All curves will be plotted from the coordinates of 100% (y-axis point of 1.0) at time zero (x-axis point of 0) to represent that at the beginning of the study, all subjects who commenced supplementation in each multivitamin group were adherent.</description>
