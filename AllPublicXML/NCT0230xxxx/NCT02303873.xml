  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alendronate should be considered as an alternative therapy of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)
      because it significantly increased areal bone mineral density (BMD) and its Z score,
      decreased fracture incidence, inhibited bone resorption biomarkers. Alendronate exerted
      beneficial roles in different age brackets, especially in young patients with OI.
