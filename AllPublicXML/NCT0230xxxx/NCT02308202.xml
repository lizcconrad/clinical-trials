      The aims of this study is to determine the effects of treatment with doxazosin XL 16 mg/d
      combined with virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

      The effects of treatment with doxazosin XL 16 mg/d combined with virtual reality (VR)
      exposure therapy will be assessed in double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study will
      enroll 30 participants. The investigators will use a within groups design in which all
      participants receive both placebo and doxazosin (N=16) with the order counterbalanced across
      participants. A second group of patients (N=16) will receive both 16mg perindopril and
      placebo instead of doxazosin/placebo.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to receive either doxazosin XL or placebo. Participants will receive doses of study medication as over-encapsulated doxazosin XL or placebo dosed once in the morning. Study medication will be initiated as one capsule of doxazosin XL 4 mg or placebo given in the morning. The dose will be titrated up to 16 mg/d doxazosin XL or placebo as follows: Days 1-4: 4mg, Days 5-8: 8mg, Day 9-12: 12 mg, Days 13-16: 16 mg.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be male OIF/OEF veteran or active duty. Males only are included in this small pilot
             study because we will not have sufficient sample size to analyze gender effects. Women
             will be included in subsequent studies

          2. Be aged between 18 and 55 years

          3. Meet DSM-IV TR criteria for PTSD

          4. Meet inclusion criteria for VRE participation

          5. Have vital signs as follows: supine blood pressure &gt; 100/65 mm Hg, a seated blood
             pressure greater than 90/60 mm Hg, and an orthostatic change smaller than20 mm Hg
             systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic on standing. Participants should not have hypertension
             (BP above 150/100)

          6. Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within reference limits
             (±10%), with the following exceptions: (a) total bilirubin must be less than 2x upper
             limit of normal and ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase less than 3× the upper limit of
             normal and (b) kidney function tests (creatinine and BUN) within normal limits

          7. Have a baseline ECG that demonstrates clinically normal sinus rhythm, clinically
             normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias

          8. Have a medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no clinically
             significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of the
             admitting physician and the principal investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have any history or evidence suggestive of seizure disorder or brain injury

          2. Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis or bipolar illness as
             assessed by Structural Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (SCID); clinically
             significant organic brain disease or dementia or Axis I psychiatric illness other than
             PTSD that would interfere with study; acceptable history of suicide attempts within
             the past year and/or current suicidal ideation/plan

          3. Have evidence of untreated or unstable medical illness including neuroendocrine,
             autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active infectious disease

          4. Have HIV and are currently symptomatic or are taking antiretroviral medication

          5. Have any other illness or condition which in the opinion of the PI and/or the
             admitting physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion of the study

          6. Dr. Newton (medical supervisor) will review potential participants' prescribed
             medication to make a final decision on eligibility. We anticipate that participants
             will be on a wide range of medications prescribed for PTSD. However, these treatments
             will unlikely interact with the doxazosin effects of this study. We will not ask
             participants to change their medications
