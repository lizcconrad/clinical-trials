    <textblock>
      p53 is a tumor suppressor gene which plays an important role in controlling normal cell
      proliferation regulation that is located on the chromosome 17 (17p13.1). It is the most
      common goal of genetic alteration in many tumors. Serum p53 protein is presence in normal
      healthy individuals. However p53 antibody is extremely rare. Mutations in this gene cause an
      accumulation of non-functional proteins and development of anti-p53 antibodies, which can be
      detectable in tissues, slouhed cells, blood and other body fluids. Some studies have reported
      that, p53 mutations are highly common in leukemia, lymphoma, lung, esophagus, stomach, liver,
      bone, bladder, ovarian, and brain cancers. Lung cancer is the most common cause of
      cancer-related deaths and the survey is low after the initial diagnosis. Accurate staging is
      important for determine the choice of treatment and predict prognosis. 18F-FDG PET/BT has
      important value for initial staging and it is the most advanced imaging technique developed
      all over the world for determine of the characterization of the metabolic tumor volume.
      Maksimum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) which was acquired by PET imaging is commonly
      used in clinical practice as a criterion for malignancy. Due to the development of new
      software programs recently studies have shown that metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total
      lesion glycolysis (TLG) may be useful quantitative parameters for the prognostic evaluation.
      Viable tumor volume could be estimate with this programs.The purpose of this study was to
      assess the relation between serum anti-p53 antibody level and quantitative PET parameters as
      SUVmax, SUVave, MTV and TLG.
