  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the best treatment for &quot;wet&quot; macular degeneration involves regular injections of
      Ranibizumab (Lucentis). In the initial clinical trials, the drug was injected into the eye
      every month. Since then a number of studies have found similar benefits when the drug is
      given with a fixed number of injections initially and then with further injections only when
      needed. This approach has been adopted in the UK, following recommendation by the National
      Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).

      Although this approach reduces the expense and risk of un-necessary treatment, it does
      require regular hospital assessment of disease activity to determine if a repeat injection is
      required or can be deferred. The hospital assessment is time-consuming, inconvenient and the
      large number of assessments can cause delays in hospital follow-up.

      Using three different assessment criteria to monitor disease activity at home, the
      investigators plan to see if home monitoring is as good as hospital assessment. The
      investigators have already identified that many patients dislike the lengthy hospital
      assessment visit and would welcome the opportunity to do some of the monitoring of disease
      activity at home. The investigators have also shown that they understand and can complete
      each of the home assessment tests. In this pilot project, the investigators aim to get an
      idea of how reliable home monitoring can be in a small sample of just over 30 patients. The
      data that the pilot project generates will be used to influence and to help plan a
      subsequent, larger, national study to be submitted for funding to the National Institute for
      Health Research.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 60 years with a clinical diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular
             degeneration (ARMD), receiving treatment with intra-vitreal ranibizumab in accordance
             with current UK practice

          -  At least 6 months of prior treatment beyond the loading phase of three fixed
             injections

          -  At least 2 injections during the prior 6 months of the maintenance phase of treatment

          -  Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart letter score at 2m of
             between 30 and 70 letters at the start of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic intra-retinal cycts or sub-retinal fluid in the study eye on
             Optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination despite prior treatment and judged to
             be stable without the need for further treatment

          -  Significant hearing impairment, felt likely to interfere with training and the
             telephone calls prior to the home monitoring

          -  Lack of informed consent
