  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a computerized
      technique designed to improve processing speed (i.e. the amount of time it takes for a
      person's brain to process information) in a multiple sclerosis (MS) population. The study is
      designed to study how well this technique can help people with MS increase their processing
      speed and their ability to function better in everyday life. This treatment protocol has been
      studied extensively with older adults, showing improvements on standard laboratory measures
      of processing speed and performance of activities of daily living.

      This study is a double-blind, placebo-control randomized clinical trial examining the
      efficacy of Speed of Processing Training (SPT) for improving processing speed (PS) deficits
      in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Slowed PS is one of the most common deficits in
      individuals with MS and such deficits have been shown to exert significant negative impact on
      multiple aspects of everyday life, including occupational and social functioning. Despite
      these findings, few studies have attempted to remediate PS deficits in order to improve the
      everyday functioning of individuals with MS. This study is designed to (1) apply a treatment
      protocol for PS impairments well-validated in an aging population to individuals with MS with
      objectively observable deficits in PS and document its efficacy on standard
      neuropsychological outcome measures. In addition, the investigators will (2) assess the
      effectiveness of the intervention utilizing global measures of everyday life, including an
      objective measure (the Timed Activities of Daily Living; TIADL), as well as additional
      questionnaires to be completed by both the participant and a significant other. This study is
      also designed to (3) examine the influence of degree of PS impairment on treatment efficacy
      using neuropsychological tests, (4) evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment protocol
      and (5) examine the utility of booster sessions to facilitate long-term treatment effects.

    <description>SPT involves trainer-guided practice of computer-based exercises, including Target Detection (indicating presence or absence of targets, identifying targets, etc.) and Discrimination and Localization (performing same/ different discriminations of targets presented very quickly and followed by a masking pattern) 10, 19, 84. Display speed, ranging from 17 to 500 ms, is the primary manipulation during training, which increases task demands and thus demands on PS itself.
SPT will be administered on a laptop computer twice a week for 5 weeks (10 training sessions).</description>
