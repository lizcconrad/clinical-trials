      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Sirius Cemented Stem
      used in conjunction with the Exceed ABT Cemented Acetabular Cup, either with E1 or Arcom
      polyethylene, and OptiPac/OptiVac bone cement mixing systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative, prospective randomized Radiostereometry (RSA) study, lead on 48
      patients in a single site.

      All 48 patients will be pooled in a single group for the evaluation of the primary criterion
      for evaluation, but randomized into four groups for the evaluation of the secondary criteria
      for evaluation

      The objectives of the study are to:

        1. Demonstrate a comparable migration pattern as is described in published literature on
           other double tapered polished cemented stems

        2. Measure wear pattern in the cup made of vitamin-E doped polyethylene or conventional
           Arcom polyethylene

      2)Demonstrate non-inferiority of Optipac vs. Optivac cement mixing systems on the stem side
      3)Evaluate the clinical outcome and survivorship of the implant
