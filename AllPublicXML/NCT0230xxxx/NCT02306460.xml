    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a common arrythmia. It is an independent risk factor for stroke. There
      for anticoagulation therapy is used for atrial fibrillation patients. Alternatively, left
      atrial appendix closure can be used, if the risk for bleeding complications is deemed greater
      than the possible antithrombotic benefit of anticoagulation medication. Up to 70% of ischemic
      complications can be prevented with anticoagulation therapy, and left atrial appendix closure
      seems to have comparable results. Also left atrial catherter ablation (LACA) is gaining
      popularity as a therapeutic intervention for atrial fibrillation.

      However, the procedure is associated with 0,5-1% perioperative risk of clinically evident
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. While the incidence of clinically evident ischemic
      complications remain relatively low, recent data suggest that 13%-20% of patients undergoing
      LACA are affected by post-operative neurocognitive dysfunction (POCD) 90 days after ablation.

      The goal of the study is to improve detection of subtle brain dysfunction after cardiac
      interventions by employing an experimental executive reaction time (RT) test along with EEG
      recording in aims to improve objective detection of subtle brain dysfunction assumed to
      underlie persistent cognitive, somatic, and affective complaints reported by patients who
      have undergone atrial fibrillation ablation.

        A total of 80 patients will be drafted for the study. The subjects will be recruited from
        Tampere University Hospital Heart Hospital Co. Total of fifty patients, men and women
        between 50-70 years, undergoing left atrial catheter ablation (LACA) (30 patients) or
        percutaneous left atrial appendix closure procedure (20 patients) because of paroxysmal or
        persistent atrial fibrillation, will be recruited for the study.

        A control group of 15 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and 15 patients with
        persistent atrial fibrillation who are treated with antiarrhythmic and anticoagulation
        therapies suggested by current guidelines will be tested with the same testing schema and
        time points. Control group will be drafted from the cardiologic patients of the Heart
        Hospital and also from Hatanpää Hospital cardiologic outpatient clinic.

             atrial fibrillation (EHRA classification 2-4) and if their risk of thromboembolic
             complications with CHA2DS2VASc scale is low (0-2 points).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age under 18 or over 70 years.

          -  Contraindication for anticoagulation therapy (in ablation group),

          -  Previous neurological or psychiatric disorder.

          -  Significant visual problem that can't be corrected for,

          -  problems with upper arm/hand use, that would make the execution of the test difficult.

          -  normal contraindications for the ablation and appendix closure procedures.
