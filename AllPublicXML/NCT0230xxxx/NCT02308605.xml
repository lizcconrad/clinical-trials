  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that a stroke causes release of purines from brain into blood and that this
      is a very early biomarker of brain ischaemia. The investigators propose a simple blood test
      of substances (the purines) that result from cellular metabolism and are produced in excess
      when brain cells are starved of oxygen and glucose (as occurs during a stroke).

      In this study, the investigators propose to use newly developed biosensor technology
      (SMARTCap) to directly address whether purines are indicators of real strokes, and can
      distinguish strokes from other conditions with similar symptoms, more rapidly.

    <description>The Sarissa Biomedical SMARTCap biosensor array. This is an array of biosensors and electrodes in a simple moulded device that will fit into a vacutainer blood tube and will enable the rapid measurement of purines in freshly drawn blood. Therefore, this is not an intervention as such as the device is an In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stroke patients: Admitted to the Hyperacute Stroke Unit having a suspected stroke
             within 1 hour of admission. Important to note that not all these patients will have
             suffered a stroke

          2. Control participants: Relatives of patients admitted to the stroke treatment pathway,
             who are healthy and have no signs of cardiovascular illness

          3. Healthy volunteers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Stroke patients: Delay in admission exceeds the time window of 4 hours between stroke
             symptoms and admission

          2. Control participants: Obvious signs or history of cerebrovascular disease

          3. Unhealthy volunteers
