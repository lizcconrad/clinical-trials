  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of loratadine in decreasing the
      incidence and severity of bone pain following G-CSF administration in patients with
      hematologic malignancies, patients undergoing mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells,
      and patients who have undergone an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant. This is a
      different patient population than those being assessed in current clinical trials.

      Objectives

      The primary objective is to determine the incidence of bone pain following G-CSF
      administration in patients with hematologic malignancies, patients undergoing mobilization of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells, and patients who have undergone an autologous hematopoietic
      cell transplant. Incidence will be determined via patient-reported incidence following G-CSF
      administration.

      Secondary objectives include determining the efficacy of loratadine for bone pain prevention
      as indicated by a decrease in incidence and a decrease in severity (questions 4 and 5 of the
      survey).
