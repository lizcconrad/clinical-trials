  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects approximately 4.7 million of people in the UK, with
      children and pre-menopausal women being at higher risk (1). Each year more than 6.8 million
      prescriptions for oral iron are filled in England alone (NHS Information Centre data).
      However, gastrointestinal symptoms limit adherence in 10-30% of otherwise healthy patients
      (2-4) and in up to 50% of patients with gastrointestinal disorders (5). Simple ferrous iron
      salts constitute the vast majority of currently prescribed oral iron because these are cheap
      and well absorbed. However, they are also poorly tolerated and thus, we believe, are
      expensive to the NHS.

      Funded by the Medical Research Council, we have developed an alternative oral iron
      supplement, that we name IHAT (iron hydroxide adipate tartrate), as an efficacious therapy
      for IDA with minimal side-effects.

      In the study proposed here we aim to assess the total health cost associated with current
      oral iron supplements and, hence, define the clinical unmet need for alternative treatments.
      We will use Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD data to (i) estimate the pattern
      of prescribing to oral iron in primary care in the general population and (ii) develop a
      health economics model in pre-menopausal women. These data will provide evidence for the
      total health system costs associated with current oral iron treatment. Furthermore, this
      study will provide data from which the cost-effectiveness and total health system costs of
      alternative effective and treatments with minimal side-effects could be estimated.

      Our research objective is to gather evidence for the unmet clinical need for safe,
      low-side-effect oral iron in the UK.

      To achieve this objective we aim to determine:

        1. Pattern of prescribing to oral iron in primary care in GP practices in England: estimate
           prescription rates, efficacy and intolerance of treatment with all forms of currently
           prescribed oral iron.

        2. Health economics of the use of ferrous iron salts in primary care: estimate patterns of
           individual response to treatment; determine the costs of ferrous iron (sulphate,
           fumarate and gluconate) therapy in pre-menopausal women in primary care, and develop a
           cost-effectiveness model for alternative treatments with minimal side-effects.

    <description>In this analysis we will determine the following to parameterise the model that will be based on the cohort study over a 10 years period:
i) Frequency of repeat oral iron prescriptions, ii) Number of hospital admissions, i) Incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects, ii) Treatment cessation rate iii) Haemoglobin changes
The basis for the model will be the above data extracted from the CPRD, further informed by publicly available clinical trial data.</description>

        For the 1-year cohort study we are not defining a sub-population group and will investigate
        all individuals (adults and children) prescribed any type of oral iron at least once in the
        time period assessed, although a breakdown by key sociodemographic (age, gender, ethnicity)
        will be conducted.

        For the 10-year plus cohort study, pre-menopausal women in receipt of ferrous iron
        supplements are our study population of interest.

        Pre-menopausal women are the population group with the largest number of individuals
        affected (nearly 2M) by IDA in the UK, mainly because dietary iron intake does not
        sufficiently offset menorrhagic iron losses.
