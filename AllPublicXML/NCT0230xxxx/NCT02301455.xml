    <textblock>
      One of the most powerful predictors of stroke is hypertension, with estimates of
      approximately 33% of adults in the United States experiencing this condition.

      Hypertension is very prevalent in the emergency department (ED), but significantly
      undertreated. The overall goal of this project is to develop a text messaging intervention to
      improve hypertension care in the ED. This will first be done by testing the feasibility of
      identifying hypertensive patients in the ED, and the response rate to text messages.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (≥18 y/o)

          -  At least one BP of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥160 or a diastolic blood pressure
             (DBP) ≥100 or only BP performed prior to enrollment is SBP ≥160 or a DBP ≥100 (If the
             patient has repeated measurements after achieving Criteria 1, but prior to being
             enrolled, at least one of the repeat BP remains SBP ≥140 or a DBP ≥90)

          -  Must have mobile phones with text-messaging capability

          -  Likely to be discharged from the ED
