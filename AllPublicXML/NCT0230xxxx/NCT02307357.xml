  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Habitual physical activity was found to be positively related to better health and
      well-being. One of the most popular physical activity forms is ball games. In Israel, there
      is a growing popularity in a new ball game - Newcomball - which is being played by many
      middle age, non-athlete, women. However, so far, no study had evaluated the contribution of
      the game to improvement in the participants' physical fitness. The aim of this study,
      therefore, is to evaluate the effects of six month two weekly Newcomball training sessions to
      the physical fitness of middle age women.

      &quot;shuttle run&quot; test for aerobic capacity, 3. vertical jump, 4. power ball throw, 5. &quot;sit and
      reach&quot; flexibility test , 6. 20 m all-out run speed test.
