    <textblock>
      Post-market registry aimed at further evaluating the safety and performance of the ACURATE
      neo™ Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Delivery System in patients with
      severe aortic stenosis treated with the commercialized device

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SAVI TF is s single arm, multicenter, non-randomized and open registry. The purpose of
      this registry is to collect and monitor ongoing safety and performance data from commercial
      use of the ACURATE neo™ Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Delivery System.

      The ACURATE neo™ and its Transfemoral Delivery System are intended for use in minimally
      invasive, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using transfemoral access in patients
      presenting with severe aortic valve stenosis.

      The primary objective is to further evaluate the safety and performance of the ACURATE neo™
      Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Delivery System in the first 1000
      consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with the newly marketed device.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate adverse events and device performance of the newly
      marketed device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is included in the registry if eligible for transcatheter treatment of severe
             aortic stenosis with the ACURATE neo™ Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE TF™
             Transfemoral Delivery System as per the Instructions for Use

          2. Patient is willing to participate in the study, provides signed Informed Consent/Data
             Authorization Form and authorizes the sharing of data in the registry

             post-procedure follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients are excluded from the registry if they are not eligible for transcatheter
        treatment of severe aortic stenosis with the ACURATE neo™ Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE
        TF™ Transfemoral Delivery System as per the Instructions For Use.
