          -  Appropriate for GA (AGA).

          -  Enteral feeding of human milk initiated by 21 days of life (birth date is day of life
             0).

          -  Mother agrees to provide human milk as the exclusive feeding during the study period;
             use of donor milk is permitted if the plan is that it will be fortified.

          -  Singleton or twin births only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enteral feeding of preterm infant formula or HMF for &gt; 7 days.

          -  Expected to be transferred to another facility and will not be able to be followed for
             at least 15 days.

          -  Serious congenital abnormalities or underlying disease that may affect growth and
             development.

          -  5 minute APGAR ≤ 4.

          -  Steroids used at the time of randomization.

          -  Grade III or IV periventricular/intraventricular hemorrhage (PVH/IVH).

          -  Mechanical ventilator dependence.

          -  Maternal incapacity: including maternal cocaine or alcohol abuse during pregnancy or

             HIV therapy.

          -  Infant has a history of major surgery (intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal procedures or
             other surgery requiring general anesthesia).

          -  Asphyxia defined as progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia with significant metabolic
             acidemia characterized by APGAR score &lt;3 at 10 minutes, seizures within the first 12
             hours of life, or a cord blood gas &lt; 7.0 and seizures and/or severe tonic
             abnormalities in the first 12 hours of life (24).

          -  Confirmed necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's Stage II or III, Appendix J) or confirmed
             sepsis (positive culture requiring antibiotic treatment).

          -  Infant has any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes
             participation in the study.

          -  Participation in another study that has not been approved as a concomitant study by
             AN.
