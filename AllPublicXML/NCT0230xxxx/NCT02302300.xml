  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After cardiac surgery, many complications can arise, in particular at the cardiac and lung
      level and it is true especially as the patient is with comorbidity. A patient will be
      considered at risk of a cardiac surgery if risk factors are present in preoperative (obesity,
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc...). The non-invasive ventilation
      (NIV)developed these last years in the treatment of acute cardiac insufficiency and the
      hypercapnic COPD exacerbations; its use is more and more envisaged in cardio-thoracic and
      abdominal surgery services.

      Studies showed that the NIV allowed an improvement of the oxygenation, the lung volumes and a
      decrease of ventilation work. According to these observations, the preventive NIV could
      reduce the incidence of appearance of the lung and/or cardiac complications at the patients
      to risk. we estimate 40 to 50%of cardiac surgery patients at a high risk level and we expect
      to obtain a benefit with this particular population. If we meet our goal (a significant
      difference in terms of morbi-mortality with the preventive NIV versus classical care), we
      expect the systematisation of this procedure to all cardiac surgery high risk patients.
