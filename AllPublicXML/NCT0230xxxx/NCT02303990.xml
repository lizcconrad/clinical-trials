             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of
             treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment. Systemic steroids administered specifically as a premedication for
             chemotherapy infusion or radiotherapy are allowed.

          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not
             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

          -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may
             qualify for the study.

          -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

          -  A history of prior radiotherapy that precludes delivery of hypofractionated
             radiotherapy

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.

          -  Has an active automimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3
             months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Has a history or current evidence
             of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results
             of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the
             trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of
             the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.
