      Objectives: Verify the effect of auriculotherapy in patients with tension-type headache
      resulting from temporomandibular dysfunction.

      Design: Randomized clinical study Setting: Randomized Study Participants: The study consist
      of 38 participants randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 18, sample loss =
      1) and placebo group (n = 20, sample loss = 6) Interventions: The intervention group will
      receive treatment with auricular acupuncture in the Shen Men, Kidney, Sympathetic, Subcortex,
      Adrenal and Cerebral points. The placebo group will receive auriculotherapy in the trachea
      point.

      Main outcome measures: visual analog scale for pain pain (VAS) and surface electromyography
      (EMG).

      This is an experimental clinical trial in which will be selected at the University, 40
      students with tension-type headache due to temporomandibular dysfunction. Among the selected
      subjects will be randomized by blind draw into two groups: intervention group (IG) and
      placebo group (GII).

      The instruments that will be used for the evaluation are the visual analog pain scale, the
      Survey questionnaire for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC) 3, and surface electromyography
      (EMG System of Brazil).

      The EMG signals will be collected in the rest position (3 samples) and maximum voluntary
      isometric contraction (3 collections). The masseter and temporalis muscles bilaterally will
      be evaluated according to the protocol of Rodrigues.

      For treatment of Ear, initially cleaning the pinna is made to be manipulated with 70% alcohol
      and later will be inserted mustard seed with a tape in the following points: Shenmen,
      Sympathetic, Kidney, subcortex, Adrenal and Brain second Souza in GI and GII point of the
      trachea. Such treatment will last 15 minutes each session, being held 2 times a week,
      alternating the ear to be manipulated over a period of 5 weeks.

      For comparison between groups the Mann-Whitney test statistic with Software BioStat 4.0
      software will be used. With a significance level (p &lt;0.05).

    <description>The placement, points according to Souza (1997), will be: Shen Men, Sympathetic, Kidney, Subcortex, Adrenal and Cerebral. The point descriptions are: Shen Men, is located in the vertex of the angle formed by the lower root and the upper root of the antihelix; the Sympathetic is situated in the middle of the lower root below the Helix membrane (located at the lower end of the Lobe); the Kidney point is situated in cymba concha, near its junction with the lower root of the antihelix, in the same line as the Shen Men point; the Subcortex is situated on upward curve towards the apex of the antitragus, on the upper edge of the concha; the Adrenal is located at the apex of the tragus, on its projection towards the concha cava; the Cerebral point is situated above the edge of the antitragus. As sessions will held twice a week for a total of 10 sessions.</description>
