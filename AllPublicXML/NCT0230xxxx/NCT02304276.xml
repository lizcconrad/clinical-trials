    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the two main types of replacement tissue heart valve used in current
      practice, comparing outcomes from surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) with that of the
      more recently introduced &quot;key-hole&quot; procedure called transcatheter aortic valve implantation
      (TAVI). Participants will be recruited at various time points ranging from 1 month to 10
      years following valve replacement with either AVR or TAVI. It is thought that progressive
      calcium (chalk) formation is responsible for the failure of the majority of these valves. All
      participants will therefore have a PET-CT scan with a special type of &quot;tracer&quot; called
      18F-fluoride in order to measure active calcium formation in the valve. They will then have
      annual clinical follow-up for 5 years and be invited back for a repeat CT scan at 2 years to
      measure change in calcium burden. This study aims to investigate, firstly, the effects of
      valve age and type on calcium formation as measured by PET-CT and, secondly, whether this
      measure of calcium formation can help to predict how long different types of valve will last.
      If successful, 18F-fluoride PET-CT could become a valuable tool for testing new treatments to
      improve valve longevity and new valve designs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the commonest form of valve disease in the western world and the leading
      indication for valve surgery. Bioprosthetic valves are known to degenerate via a process that
      is predominantly driven by calcification. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has
      recently emerged as a less invasive alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement
      (AVR) surgery. Whilst this technique holds great promise, long-term follow up data are
      lacking and the longevity of these valves remains to be established.

      In this longitudinal, cross-sectional study of 180 subjects with either surgical or
      transcatheter implanted bioprostheses, this study proposes to look for the earliest signs of
      active calcification using 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET). During a 5 year
      follow-up period, this study hopes to demonstrate that 18F-fluoride PET will predict
      subsequent bioprosthetic valve degeneration and identify patients at risk of premature valve
      failure. The study also hopes that it will inform about the comparative durability of novel
      percutaneous valves. If successful, 18F-Fluoride could provide a useful method of assessing
      novel therapeutic strategies targeted at improving the longevity of bioprostheses and help to
      guide future valve design.
