  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of multiple doses of an immediate release
      (IR) formulation of tramadol hydrochloride (HCl) at therapeutic and supratherapeutic levels
      in healthy adult participants on the electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval corrected for heart
      rate (QTc).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), 4-way crossover (method
      used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another), placebo- and
      positive-controlled (the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to an inactive
      substance and a standard treatment or procedure), single site, multiple dose study. The study
      has 3 phases: a Screening Phase (up to 35 days); a Double-blind Treatment Phase (4 treatment
      periods with a washout period of 7 to 15 days); and a Post-treatment Phase (Day 5 of Period 4
      or at the time of early withdrawal). All eligible participants will receive each of the 4
      treatments: tramadol HCl at therapeutic dose of 400 milligram per day (mg/day), tramadol HCl
      at supratherapeutic dose of 600 mg/day, placebo, and positive control moxifloxacin 400 mg; in
      any of the treatment period as per assigned treatment sequence. The total duration of each
      participant's participation will be up to a maximum of 100 days. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
