    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a study &quot;Resect and Discard Diminutive Polyps: a new paradigm&quot;
      (IRB ID # 201105473) from September, 2011 to July, 2013. This study examined whether doctors
      performing colonoscopy are accurate enough at predicting histology of small colorectal
      polyps, such that these small polyps could be resected and discarded (instead of being sent
      to pathology). One of the main advantages of this approach is significant cost savings by
      reducing pathology costs associated with screening and surveillance colonoscopy. A
      disadvantage is that there is a 0.03% chance that small polyps contain cancer. There is no
      data regarding patient preferences toward this approach. The investigators therefore designed
      a patient survey to determine the patient's view toward this approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) published a review article on a new
      paradigm in colorectal cancer screening termed &quot;resect and discard&quot;. This new paradigm
      challenges the current practice of sending all colorectal polyps, regardless of appearance or
      size, to pathology for analysis. &quot;Resect and Discard&quot; describes a new approach in which small
      polyps could be removed, but be discarded instead of sent for pathology analysis. This is
      based on data showing that gastroenterologists can predict the pathology of small colorectal
      polyps with 80-90% accuracy, and that discarding small polyps would not alter surveillance
      recommendations.

      Neither the ASGE document nor published research, however, assessed patient attitudes toward
      this approach. This study surveyed patients prior to first time screening colonoscopy, in
      order to determine their preferences about the resect and discard approach; specifically
      would patients be willing to pay for pathology analysis of small colorectal polyps with their
      own money, and what factors influence their decision. We also inquired about factors that
      would influence their decision to pay/not pay pathology costs themselves.
