  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human skin undergoes some morphological changes with the effects of chronological aging and
      photoaging, these are especially remarkable in the facial skin. Changes in pigmentation,
      sallowness, deep wrinkling, laxity and elastosis are the main changes seen in photoaging and
      chronologic aging of skin. With the increasing demand, it needs to provide new approach for
      the prevention and treatment of these morphological changes.

      Fibroblasts have a key role on skin aging. It is known that platelet rich plasma activates
      the fibroblasts and increases the synthesis of collagen and other type of matrix components.
      Because of these specialities, platelet rich plasma is thought to be effective on skin aging.
