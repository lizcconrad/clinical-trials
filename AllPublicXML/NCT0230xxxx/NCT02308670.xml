    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to observe any changes in MRI in MS patients who have
      switched from 20mg injections/day to 3 40mg injections/week of glatiramer acetate.

      The primary aim of this study is to observe the effect of switching from daily injections of
      20mg glatiramer acetate (GA) (20mg/daily) to GA 40mg three times a week (40mg x 3/weekly) on
      thalamus pathology, as measured by changes in diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). We hypothesize that GA 40mg x 3/weekly will
      exert similar, if not better effect on prevention of thalamic pathology, as compared to GA
      20mg/daily. The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of switching
      from GA 20mg/daily to GA 40mg x 3/weekly on evolution of microstructural changes in normal
      appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal appearing gray matter (NAGM), as measured by DTI.

        One hundred fifty (150) consecutive RRMS patients who are on treatment with GA 20mg/daily
        for at least 12 months and who switched to GA 40mg x 3/weekly, because of convenience of
        application, will be recruited in the study.
