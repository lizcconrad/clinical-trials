      The NeoVas Bioresorbable Coronary Scaffold Registry Trial is a prospective, multi-center,
      single arm registry trial based on the NeoVas FIM study which verified the safety and
      effectiveness of NeoVas initially. This study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      NeoVas sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable coronary scaffold in the treatment of patients with de
      novo coronary lesion.

      Approximately 825 subjects will be enrolled and receive NeoVas BCS(Lepu Medical Technology
      (Beijing) Co.,Ltd). Subjects will have clinical follow-up at 30, 90, 180 and 270 days and at
      1,2,3,4 and 5 years. The primary endpoint is target lesion failure(TLF) at 1 year follow-up.
