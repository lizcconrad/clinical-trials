  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of 2 different dose levels
      of trimeric glycoprotein140 (gp140) administered as a 2-dosage regimen, intramuscularly
      (injection of a substance into a muscle), with and without aluminum phosphate as adjuvant in
      healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a
      pretend treatment with no drug in it to test if the drug has a real effect), and double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives) study.
      The study comprises a Screening Period (up to 4 weeks), a Vaccination Period (participants
      will be vaccinated on Days 1 and 29), and a Follow-up Period (up to 48 weeks). All eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 sequential cohorts (low dose cohort and
      high dose cohort). Participants in low dose cohort will receive 1 of the following
      treatments: low dose (50 microgram [mcg]) gp140 drug product (DP), low dose gp140 DP with
      adjuvant (aluminum phosphate), placebo matched to low dose DP; and participants in high dose
      cohort will receive 1 of the following treatments: high dose (250 mcg) gp140 DP, high dose
      gp140 DP with adjuvant, and placebo matched to high dose DP. There will be an interim safety
      review of safety/tolerability from low-dose cohort before the high-dose cohort receives study
      treatment. Total study duration will be 56 weeks per participant. Participants' safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.
