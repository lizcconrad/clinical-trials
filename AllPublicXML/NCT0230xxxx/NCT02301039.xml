      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with
      advanced sarcomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced
      sarcomas. This study will have two treatment groups, one group for patients with soft tissue
      sarcoma and one group for patients with bone sarcoma.

      Initial enrollment for this study included a total of 86 patients with soft tissue sarcoma
      and bone sarcomas.

      In the expansion portion, there will be an additional 30 patients with undifferentiated
      pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) and 30 patients with dedifferentiated or other high grade
      liposarcoma (LPS) enrolled into the study.
