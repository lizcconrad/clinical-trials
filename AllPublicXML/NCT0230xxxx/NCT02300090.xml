      A real world study to determine the effectiveness of a patient support service to aid COPD
      patients in their self management.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate a digital health wellness support tool for patients
      in primary care with COPD using a smart mobile app, patient web portal and technology
      attached to the patients SABA reliever inhaler. Using the patients pre-defined COPD self
      management plan, the active arm of the study complete a daily diary (EXACT PRO) and record
      their daily SABA inhaler usage. After defining a health and symptom score baseline over a two
      week period, any significant deviations in SABA reliever use or daily diary scoring will
      alert patients that they may be having a change in their symptoms and advise them to refer to
      their self management plan and if they need to start their rescue medication. The primary
      outcome measure for the study is a 25% reduction in unplanned COPD hospital admissions (n=250
      completing the study in each arm).
