  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic stimulation of the brain (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) and of neck
      muscles (repetitive peripheral muscle stimulation) is used to alter tinnitus-related cortical
      activity and neck muscles tension.

    <textblock>
      Chronic tinnitus is characterized by several comorbid disorders. One of them is neck and back
      pain. Here, we investigate the feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy of the combination
      of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and peripheral muscle stimulation
      (rPMS) in chronic tinnitus in a pilot study. rTMS is considered to interact with neural
      tinnitus networks. rPMS is suggested to bring relief to muscle tension. This is an one arm
      study where explorative analyses will be done with special consideration on patients
      suffering from neck pain in the analysis.

    <description>rPMS Stimulation of the neck muscles in five medial-lateral movements starting from the neck: left and right trapezius and deltoid muscle, trapezius and lattissimus dorsi muslce, and over the backbone. 20 stimuli per movement with 2s inter-train interval; four repetitions for each of the five movements; the first 20 trains with a frequency of 5Hz, the second 20 trains at 20Hz; stimulation at individual comfortable level (20-30% stimulator output); round coil.
rTMS 20Hz stimulation with 2000 stimuli over the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex at 110% motor threshold; followed by 1Hz stimulation with 2000 stimuli over the left temporo-parietal cortex; stimulation intensity 110% motor threshold; butterfly coil.
For stimulation we use MagPro X100 (Medtronic, Denmark).</description>
