  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the effect of a four-hour ultrasound course on physicians' point-of-care
      ultrasound performance on patients representing acute abdominal surgical conditions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial with physicians was conducted. The intervention group
      participated in a four-hour abdominal POC US course before performing ultrasound on four
      patients with different abdominal surgical conditions. The control group did not participate
      in a course before performing ultrasound on the patients.
