      This study is an observational, cross-sectional study. A representative sample of 2800
      eligible women with different occupations such as farmers, service providers, workers,
      professional specialists, students and civil servants will be recruited. A cluster sampling
      method with probability proportional to the distribution of occupation in women in Beijing
      will be used. Demographic data will be collected by questionnaire. Menstrual bleeding will be
      evaluated by Pictorial Blood loss Assessment Chart (PBAC). According to the international
      definition of HMB, a PBAC score more than 100 is considered as HMB.
