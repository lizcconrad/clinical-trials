    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this program of research is to develop a collaborative narrative
      intervention for patients with depression being treated in primary care.

      The purpose of the proposed project is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary effects of our newly developed narrative intervention on depression.

      To achieve the specific aims, the investigators will conduct an open trial to further develop
      and refine the intervention (n = 10).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The public health impact of existing treatments for major depression is limited by our
      ability to disseminate those treatments. There is a particular need to find innovative ways
      to disseminate key principles of empirically supported psychotherapy in primary care
      settings. Narrative communication is an alternative way to disseminate psychotherapy behavior
      change principles. Narrative communication refers to &quot;storytelling&quot; -real people talking
      about their struggles and successful ways of coping. An advantage of narrative communication
      is that it can be easily distributed (by video) and may reach people who do not have access
      to other technologies or who experience barriers to traditional psychotherapy. We propose
      that key principles of a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy (Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy, or ACT) can be readily disseminated through a video storytelling intervention. ACT
      is an empirically supported therapy for depression. Together with a video production firm
      with a record of working in healthcare and developing documentary-style videos, we will
      produce a storytelling video intervention (sTVi).

      Our aim is to conduct a small open trial (n = 10) of antidepressant medication treatment as
      usual + sTVi. Assessments will occur at baseline and 4 weeks (post-treatment). We will
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of sTVi (e.g., uptake and completion of sTVi,
      engagement with videos, and understanding of key ACT principles) and of this research design.
      We will examine treatment effects (within relevant confidence intervals) on outcomes (e.g.,
      depression severity). We will examine change in potential mechanisms, i.e., ACT-consistent
      coping strategies derived from key ACT principles.

    <description>We will develop a series of 4 videos, each episode approximately 30 minutes long, which will illustrate the key principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.
We will add a short, non-narrative, epilogue at the end of each of the 4 episodes that summarizes key messages and provides information on identifying signs of depression and suggestions for efficacious treatments.
In addition, we will develop an accompanying &quot;personal journal&quot; for participants that includes a brief self-help guide which encourages participants to write about what they learned in the videos and how they will take similar steps in their own lives to cope with depression.</description>
