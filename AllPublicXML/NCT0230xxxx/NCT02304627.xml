      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the effect of food
      on the pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of NNC0123-0000-0338 in
      a tablet formulation in healthy subjects.

    <description>Each subject will be randomly allocated to a fixed treatment sequence of four single-dose administrations of oral insulin 338 in a GIPETÂ® I tablet, administered on four separate dosing visits. The subjects will be dosed in the morning in the fasting state prior to four different post-dose fasting periods.</description>
