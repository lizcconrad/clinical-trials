  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects should assess pain on a numerical scale (EN), during painful skin stimuli of
      variable intensity delivered by a CO2 laser used at the power of 0.3 W, known for its safety.
      ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) will be raised simultaneously. This sequence will be made
      on subjects at rest and in a state of hypnosis using the technique of &quot;remembering a pleasant
      memory&quot; and the ideo-sensory technique of &quot;protective glove&quot;.

      The average value of the ANI will be compared to the value of the EVN of pain intensity.

    <description>No drug and no placebo will be used in this study. The study participants will only rate their pain on a numerical scale (EN) following cutaneous painful stimulation (6 for each phase) of variable intensity, delivered by a CO2 laser. ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) will be raised simultaneously by the ANI monitor. This sequence will be performed on subjects at rest and in a state of hypnosis by the technique of &quot;remembering a pleasant memory&quot; and the ideo-sensory technique of &quot;protective glove&quot;.</description>

    <description>Painful skin stimuli of variable intensity will be delivered by a CO2 laser used at the power of 0.3 W for each stimulation (6/phases) and this for each of the 3 phases (critical consciousness or hypnosis). During each stimulation, ANI values will be identified by the Physiodoloris ® monitor, through 3 standard ECG electrodes placed on the thorax of the subject.</description>
