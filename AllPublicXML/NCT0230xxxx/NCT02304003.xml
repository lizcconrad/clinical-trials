  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aim of this study is to investigate wether an evidence-based physiotherapy regimen is
      more effective than standard care in patients referred for arthroscopic surgery of the
      shoulder. It is hypothesized that a multimodal physiotherapy regimen will relieve pain,
      improve shoulder function and reduce the need for subacromial decompression surgery of the
      shoulder compared to standard care/wait and see controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a fourfold increase in surgery rates for non-traumatic shoulder disorders ,
      despite increasing evidence demonstrating that there is no difference in effect between
      physiotherapy based- and surgical interventions. The target population for this study is
      patients suffering from rotator cuff tendinopathy waiting for subacromial decompression
      surgery at a university hospital in Norway. During this waiting period , study participants
      will be randomly assigned to standard follow up or a physiotherapy regimen in primary care.
      We want to compare the effect of a structured physiotherapy regimen consisting of heavy slow
      resistance exercises, stretching, manual mobilization and low level laser therapy to standard
      follow up.
