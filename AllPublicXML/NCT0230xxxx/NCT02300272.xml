  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, observational study design. Enrolled participants will be typically,
      healthy older adults. Participants will complete daily computerized measures, in addition to
      continuously wearing an Actiwatch device. The study period will last 2 weeks. The objectives
      of the study are to examine the impact of sleep, pain, and circadian rhythm on
      practice-related learning in older adults at their preferred versus nonpreferred times of
      day.

      Participants will be asked to review the informed consent and consent to the study prior to
      any study procedure.

      There are four stages to this study: 1. a telephone interview, 2. an in-person interview and
      completion of questionnaires, 3. an in-home single night sleep recording, and 4. two weeks of
      computerized cognitive testing, subjective sleep and pain recordings, and wearing a
      Actiwatch.

      During the telephone interview, participants will be asked question about their age, sleep,
      pain, and medical/mental health history. At a second visit, participants will complete a more
      in-depth interview of their physical health, mental health, sleep, and pain history. They
      will complete a brief test of their cognitive functioning. They will also complete 4
      questionnaires about their time of day preference and mood. At the third visit, participants
      will visit the University of Florida to be connected to a machine which will monitor their
      sleep. Participants will return home to sleep while still connected to the machine and will
      return the machine to the University of Florida the next day. Participants will complete
      brief computerized daily questionnaires of sleep and pain and cognitive testing in the
      morning and evening, and and wear an actigraph (wristwatch-like device) that measures arm
      movements and ambient light for two weeks.

    <description>Participants will be screened for sleep disorders other than chronic insomnia with an in-home overnight sleep monitoring. Monitoring will consist of six electroencephalography (EEG) measures, two electrooculography (EOG), and chin electromyography (EMG) according to standard placements. Other channels will include oxygen saturation level, bilateral anterior tibialis EMG, heart rate (EKG), thoracic strain gauge, and a nasal/oral thermistor. A single night of polysomnography will be collected during the 2 weeks of assessment.</description>
