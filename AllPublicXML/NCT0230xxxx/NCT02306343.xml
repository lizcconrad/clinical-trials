      The study is an open-label, randomized, two-period, one-way crossover study using the Meal
      Tolerance Test (MTT) protocol or the daily life setting protocol.

      The study consists of two parts. Subject may participate in both parts or just in one part.

      The first part tests the effect of local heating on the post prandial glucose levels
      following a bolus at in-patient settings.Type I and type II diabetic patients on basal bolus
      insulin therapy admitted after overnight fast for a meal tolerance test. Subjects injected
      0.2 units/kg and consumed standardized liquid meal. Blood samples for glucose and insulin
      measurements was taken from a venous line. The study was conducted twice with (test) and
      without (control) the use of the InsuPad device.

      The second part evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device use at daily life settings.
      Type I and type II diabetic patients enrolled to the study. They will be required to perform
      at least 3 self monitored blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. Study length is up to 25 months.
      Up to one month run in period, up to 12 months with the device (test) and up to 12 months
      without the device (control).The subjects will be asked to record events of hypoglycemia,
      hyperglycemia and any adverse events related to diabetes or the study.

      The effect of the InsuPad device was studied using the Meal Tolerance Test protocol or the
      daily life setting protocol. In the Meal Tolerance Test protocol subjects consumed a
      standardized liquid meal taken immediately after injection of insulin bolus (0.2 units/kg
      body weight). Each subject went through the same Meal Tolerance Test protocol twice, once
      with the InsuPad device (test conditions) and again without the InsuPad device (control
      conditions) in randomized order. The study started after an overnight fast and stabilization
      period in which the subject glucose level was stabilized between 100-150 mg/dl, using I.V
      glucose solution/oral glucose or intravenous insulin administration if needed. The patient
      remained stable (change of glucose level &lt;20mg/dl) without any intervention or infusion 30
      min prior to the study. Blood glucose measurements were taken from a peripheral venous at
      pre-specified time points. Total follow up time was 5 hours post meal. Safety limits of the
      study were 75 mg/dl as the low limit and 300 mg/dl as the high limit. If the subject's blood
      glucose level was below 75 mg/dl glucose solution was given orally to increase his blood
      glucose level. If subjects blood glucose was above 300 mg/dl iv insulin was given to reduce
      blood glucose level.

      In the daily life setting protocol subjects meeting the inclusion exclusion criteria enrolled
      to the study. Study length was up to 25 months. Up to one month run in period, up to 12
      months with the device (test) and up to 12 months without the device (control). Subjects were
      asked to perform at least 3 blood glucose measurements a day. Subjects were asked to fill
      logbooks with measured blood glucose levels and insulin doses given during the whole study.
      Subjects were asked to report any adverse event during the study. The subjects received a
      tutorial about the device usage and the study procedures. The order of the test and control
      phases was randomly selected.

    <description>In the Meal Tolerance Test protocol - After overnight fast followed by a pre-study stabilization period, the InsuPad device was placed on the abdomen of the subject. The InsuPad device was activated and insulin bolus (0.2 units/kg body weight) was injected right before study start. The injection was given to the subject's abdomen through the injection window of the InsuPad device. Immediately afterwards the subject was asked to drink a standardized liquid meal within 10 minutes. Blood glucose measurements were taken from a peripheral venous line at a pre-determined time points. Total follow up time was 5 hours post meal.
In the daily life setting - Up to 12 months with the device (test). Subjects were asked to perform at least 3 blood glucose measurements during the day.</description>

    <description>The InsuPad device is composed of a disposable heating pad and a reusable control unit. The heating pad is intended for one day use. The user would attach the InsuPad device to a site where insulin can be injected. When there is a need for insulin bolus injection the user would inject the insulin to a location designate for that. The device would start heating the area around the injection site without over heating the insulin. At the end of the day the subject would remove the device, dispose of the disposable unit and put the reusable unit for recharging.</description>
