  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effects of a theoretically driven,
      highly challenging exercise program (balance and strengthening exercises) in reducing fall
      rate, improving balance and reducing fear of falling in persons with Parkinson's disease.

      In this pilot, randomized, cross-over study, 32 participants with Parkinson disease will be
      randomly assigned to either an early start (immediately following enrollment) or late start
      (3 months after enrollment) multifactorial exercise program which will meet 2 times per week
      for 1.5 hours over 3 months. The exercise program will consist of balance and strengthening
      exercises which will be individualized depending on the ability of each participant. Fall
      rate, balance, walking ability, fear of falling, mood, anxiety, and quality of life will be
      measured prior to the start, at 3 months and 6 months after enrollment. Subjects will be
      enrolled for 6-7 months.
