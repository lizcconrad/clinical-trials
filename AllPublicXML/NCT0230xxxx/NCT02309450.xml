      ANRS HC 33 is a pilot study to assess efficacy and safety of a DCV 3DAA therapy with
      Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir and BMS-791325 in HCV genotype 4-infected patients after failure of
      pegylated Interferon-Ribavirin regimen.

      Proportion of patients with cirrhosis will be limited to 50% of all patients included,
      cirrhosis being defined as a METAVIR score of F4 on the liver biopsy or an hepatic impulse
      elastometry ≥ 14 kPa or a Fibrotest® result &gt; 0,75.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is multi-centre, national, Phase 2, open-label, single-arm. The primary
      objective of this study is to assess, in HCV genotype 4-infected patients in failure to prior
      treatment with pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin bitherapy, the rate of sustained
      virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after 12 weeks of treatment with an all-oral combination
      of 3 DAAs in a Fixed-Dose-Combination (Asunaprevir 200 mg, Daclatasvir 30 mg and BMS - 791325
      75 mg) twice a day.

      Estimated enrollment is 60 patients during the enrolment period (9 months).

      Schedule of assessments:

      w4-w8 : screening D0 : Start of anti-HCV tritherapy (Asunaprevir + Daclatasvir + BMS-791325)
      w12: stop tritherapy w24: Sustained virological response SVR12 assessment (12 weeks post
      treatment) w36 : Sustained virological response SVR24 assessment (24 weeks post treatment)

    <description>The primary endpoint is the Sustained Virological Response Rate defined by an undetectable HCV RNA at W24, that is to say 12 weeks after the end of the DCV 3DAA therapy associating Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir and BMS - 791325 (SVR12). In case of premature total or partial interruption of HCV treatment, the primary endpoint will also be assessed at week 24.</description>
