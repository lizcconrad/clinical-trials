  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to identify neural mechanisms underlying the tendency for anxious
      individuals to pay more attention to threatening information than to other types of
      information. A computerized treatment designed to train individuals to reduce their attention
      towards threat will be tested, with a focus on understanding the aspects of brain function
      that predict response to the treatment. This work could ultimately lead to the ability to
      treat anxiety more effectively by directly targeting the aspects of brain function that are
      altered in a given patient.

    <description>Excessive attention to threat is theorized to be a critical contributor to chronic anxiety symptoms and related negative health consequences. Attention Bias Modification, which directly targets this mechanism, is a highly cost-effective intervention with growing empirical support for its potential efficacy in clinically anxious populations.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will:

               1. be between the ages of 18 and 55 years,

               2. score &gt;45 on the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventoryâ€”trait form.

               3. score &gt;=75th percentile on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment
                  Schedule 2.0

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current medication or Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for anxiety or depression;

          2. Failure to meet standard Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) inclusion criteria: those
             who have cardiac pacemakers, neural pacemakers, surgical clips in the brain or blood
             vessels, surgically implanted metal plates, screws or pins, cochlear implants,
             Intrauterine Devices, metal braces, or other metal objects in their body, especially
             in the eye. If the subject has any metal or implants in the body they must be deemed
             safe by the MRI Research Center's safety screening procedure prior to enrollment.
             Dental fillings do not present a problem. Plastic or removable dental appliances do
             not require exclusion. Pregnancy, determined by pregnancy tests on females.

          4. visual disturbance (&lt;20/40 as per the Snellen test, corrective lenses allowed)

          5. &lt;6th grade reading level as per the Wide Range Achievement Test

          6. presence of bipolar, psychotic, autism spectrum, substance dependence, or primary
             depressive disorder

          7. positive urine drug test
