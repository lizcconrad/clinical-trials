  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational pilot study that will describe the safety profile and
      biological effects of combining stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery (SABR) treatment
      (20Gy/1#) and a PD-1 antibody, MK-3475.

      15 patients with oligometastatic breast cancer with at least one lesion considered safe for
      SABR radiotherapy, will be treated with SABR for their oligometatastic disease in addition to
      6 months of MK-3475 treatment (1 cycle every 3 weeks, a total of 8 cycles).

      This investigator driven pilot study will examine the safety and biological effects of
      combining MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) an antibody targeted against the anti-programmed cell death
      1 (PD-1) T cell checkpoint, with SABR therapy for oligometastatic disease. We hypothesise
      that the safety profile of this combination, will be clinically acceptable and well tolerated
      for patients, and that we will observe evidence of systemic immune activation.

    <measure>Safety Profile - Summary of acute and long term adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety profile will be evaluated using CTCAE v4.0 in all patients who have received at least one SABR treatment and one dose of MK-3475. Acute AE are defined as AE's occurring from the time from 1st SABR treatment to 30 days post end of MK-3475 treatment and long term AE are defined as AE's occurring after 30 days post end of MK-3475 treatment.</description>

    <measure>Immunological Effects - Changes in immunological markers within tumor tissue, and immune subsets in peripheral blood over serial time-points, including at time of progression.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be collected (50ml) at baseline (prior to first SABR), prior to the first dose of MK-3475, prior to cycle 2 of MK-3475, at disease progression (if this occurs) and then every 3 months up to two years post end of SABR treatment. These will be analysed for the following (this is a non-exhaustive list):
i. Absolute lymphocyte counts using a blood analyser.
ii. The presence of CD8+ T cells by flow cytometric analysis.
iii. Change in frequency of tumor reactive T cells. These may include markers for HLA-DR, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, PD-1, TIM-3 signifying antigen presentation and experience.</description>

          2. Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer. Oligometastatic lesions

          5. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a
             tumour lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42
             days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Participants for whom newly-obtained
             samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or participant safety concern) may
             submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the study P.I's.

          6. Have a performance status of 0-2 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

             agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of
             treatment.

          9. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose

             denosumab on this study.

         11. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 3 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., less than or equal

             Note: Subjects with less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this
             criterion and may qualify for the study.

             Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

         12. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

             months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).
