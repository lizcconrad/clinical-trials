      Phase 1/2, Prospective, Single Center, Randomized, ActiveControlled, Double-Blind, Age
      De-escalation Study to assess the safety and tolerability of SIILPCV10 administered as a
      single-dose regimen to healthy Gambian pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)-naïve young
      adults and PCV-primed toddlers through 4 weeks post vaccination.

      Each adult and toddler subject will undergo a total of 4 clinic visits. Each infant subject
      will undergo a total of 9 scheduled visits. Blood will be collected from all subjects during
      the screening visit for safety and potential immunological assessments, and 28 days after
      completion of the vaccination schedule for immunological assessments. For adults, the vaccine
      will be given IM into the mid-deltoid muscle of nondominant arm using a 24-gauge needle. For
      toddlers and infants, the vaccine will be given IM into the anterolateral aspect of the left
      thigh. Blood will be collected from adults and toddlers for safety labs at the Day 7
      post-vaccination visit.
