  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EmbryoGen and BlastGen contain the cytokine growth factor Granulocyte-Macrophage
      Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), which has been documented to give significant benefit to
      this difficult group of patients.

      Results showed a highly significant effect of 44% relative improvement in ongoing
      implantation rate (p=0.001) in women who have previously miscarried (Ziebe et al 2013).

      We wish to undertake a randomised Controlled trial to determine if EmbryoGen/BlastGen media
      improves pregnancy outcomes in women with recurrent implantation failure, recurrent
      miscarriage and poor embryo development when compared to standard media.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomised control pilot study will be undertaken for 100 women who have implantation
      failure (â‰¥ 2 embryo transfers without a pregnancy) or at least 1 previous miscarriage and are
      having a further IVF cycle.

      At oocyte retrieval each couple will be randomised using numbered envelopes containing pre
      randomised group allocations by a person uninvolved in the trial to:

        1. BlastGen Group (n=50): culturing their embryos in ORIGIO standard, sequential culture
           mediums for 3 days (EmbryoGen included) then BlastGen media (GM-CSF containing media)
           for remaining 2 days or

        2. Standard Media Group (n=50): culturing their embryos in Cook standard sequential medium
           for 5 days.

      The best single embryo will be transferred on day 5.

      The clinical staff and participating couple will be blinded as to whether BlastGen or
      standard media was used in culture to day 5. Fertility SA embryologists will not be blind as
      to which study group a couple is in and which media is being used. The embryos will be
      cultured using the usual methods and lab facilities by Fertility SA's current embryology
      staff members who will not be blind to the media being used.

      Records on the outcome of the oocyte fertilisation, blastocyst development, implantation rate
      and pregnancy rates will be recorded, as is standard practice. Pregnancy scans will be
      carried out at 7 and 12 weeks. Live birth outcomes and any congenital anomalies will be
      recorded.
