  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implementation of an enhanced recovery pathway after giant ventral hernia repair,
      including preoperative high-dose steroid is examined prospectively and compared with a group
      of historic controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients operated on for a large incisional hernia are treated according to the study
      protocol. Patients are given high-dose glucocorticoid preoperative and the aim is to
      discharge patients at postoperative day 3.

      Morbidity, length of stay, pain, nausea and pulmonary function are among registered outcomes
      compared with a historic control group.
