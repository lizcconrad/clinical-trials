  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase II randomized trial will be initiated to evaluate closure of the perforated tympanic
      membrane as the primary measureable outcome. The goal is to determine the safety and efficacy
      of Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) in the closure of chronic tympanic membrane
      perforations (TMP). If FGF-2 is topically applied for the treatment of chronic TMP in humans,
      it is hypothesized it will be safe, tolerable and effective for use as treatment for tympanic
      membrane perforation. A total of 60 subjects will be recruited.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase II randomized trial will be initiated to evaluate efficacy as the primary measureable
      outcome. Eligible and consented patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to the optimal
      biologic dose (OBD) of FGF-2 or placebo (sterile water).

      Application of the study treatment may occur at the initial Screening Visit (pending all
      eligibility requirements can be confirmed) or at Visit 1 and may be repeated at each follow
      up visit as needed for a maximum of three treatments per treatment arm. These follow up
      visits will occur three weeks (+/- 7 days) from the last treatment application. During these
      visits, the subject's tympanic membrane will be examined, photographed, and additional
      otologic tests will be performed. If the perforation is found to be closed during these
      visits, then the subject will report in 2 months (+/-7 days) for a final study visit.

      If the subject's TMP has not closed after the third and final application of their assigned
      treatment group, then the subject will be crossed over to the other treatment group. Again,
      the subject may be given up to three additional treatments in this new group. The follow up
      visits will follow the same schedule, occurring three weeks (+/- 7 days) from the last
      treatment. The same otologic procedures will be performed as in the previous visits.

      All subjects will report for a final study visit 2 months (+/- 7 days) after their last
      follow up visit when the perforation is determined to be closed or when the subject has
      completed the maximum number of study visits without perforation closure. The study will be
      completed for reporting purposes after all subjects have completed the 2 month (+/- 7 days)
      follow up final visit.
