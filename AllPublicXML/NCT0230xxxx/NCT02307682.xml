    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare RTH258 ophthalmic solution for intravitreal (IVT)
      injection at two dosage levels to aflibercept solution for IVT injection (2 mg) in subjects
      with untreated active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) in the study eye.This study will be conducted in Argentina, Australia,
      Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Peru,
      New Zealand, and US (including Puerto Rico).
