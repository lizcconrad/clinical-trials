    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about how the study drug called galunisertib
      affects the immune system in participants with cancer. The study treatment is expected to
      last about six months for each participant, not including screening or follow-up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a confirmed diagnosis of advanced, refractory solid tumors and tumor progression
             or treatment intolerance to at least 1 prior therapy.

          -  Have measurable disease that is amenable to a radiographic or ultrasound-guided biopsy
             or may be biopsied in the office without radiologic guidance.

          -  Have a performance status of ≤2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             scale.

          -  Have discontinued all disease-modifying therapy for the primary cancer for 28 days
             prior to initiation of study treatment.

          -  Hepatic: bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN), alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤3.0 times ULN. For participants with tumor
             involvement of the liver, AST and ALT equaling

             ≤5.0 times ULN are acceptable. Alkaline phosphatase ≤5.0 times ULN for participants
             with tumor involvement of the bone is acceptable.

          -  Have adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine levels ≤2.0 ULN or
             calculated creatinine clearance &gt;45 mL/min.

          -  Male and female participants with reproductive potential must use an approved
             contraceptive method, if appropriate (for example, intrauterine device, birth control
             pills, or barrier device) during and for 6 months after discontinuation of study
             treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin
             pregnancy test documented within 7 days prior to treatment. Have given written
             informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures.

          -  Are willing and able to comply with study procedures and instructions, including
             completion of diaries.

          -  Must have received at least 1 prior approved immunotherapy or chemotherapy; however,
             not within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug. May have received prior
             radiotherapy for their malignancy.

          -  May have received treatment with an investigational product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or
             medically compatible with this study within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug.

          -  Have moderate or severe cardiac disease:

               -  Have the presence of cardiac disease, including a myocardial infarction within 6
                  months prior to study entry, unstable angina pectoris, New York Heart Association
                  Class III/IV congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled hypertension.

               -  Have documented major electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (not responding to
                  medical treatments) at the investigator's discretion (for example, symptomatic or
                  sustained atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, second- or third-degree
                  atrioventricular block, complete bundle branch block, ventricular hypertrophy, or
                  recent myocardial infarction).

               -  Have major abnormalities documented by echocardiography (ECHO) with Doppler (for
                  example, moderate or severe heart valve function defect and/or left ventricular
                  ejection fraction &lt;50%, evaluation based on the institutional lower limit of
                  normal).

               -  Have predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of
                  the ascending aorta or aortic stress (for example, family history of aneurysms,
                  Marfan-Syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, evidence of damage to the large vessels
                  of the heart documented by computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast).

          -  Are women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder (for example, active infection including
             human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis B virus [HBV]
             [ie, positive hepatitis B surface antigen [+HBsAg]]), or an autoimmune disease.

          -  Have a second primary malignancy or any history in any time frame of a prior
             malignancy.

          -  Are unwilling or unable to participate in, or do not have tissue adequate for
             participation in the biomarker analyses in the study.
