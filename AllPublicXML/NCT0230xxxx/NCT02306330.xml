  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MALDI-TOF MS is capable of directly identifying bacteria and fungi in positive blood
      cultures, which may be beneficial to patient management. Therefore, MALDI-TOF MS is an
      important new technology that is becoming routine in developed countries. It is currently
      unknown whether MALDITOF MS improves diagnostics, costs and patient outcomes in developing
      countries. This study will assess the clinical impact of a MALDITOF MS system (Maldi
      Biotyper, Bruker, Germany) in the resource constrained setting of Vietnam and at what cost.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When an eligible specimen from a patient shows pathogen growth, the pathogen identification
      will be randomized to either MaldiTof or routine diagnostics ('diagnostic pipelines').
      Randomization to MaldiTof or routine diagnostics will be 1:1 with stratification by hospital
      and specimen type (blood vs. other). Isolates grown from all eligible specimens of the same
      patient will be assigned to the same diagnostic pipeline as the first randomized specimen of
      that patient.

      Allocation to diagnostic arm will be assigned by a web based randomization program. When a
      pathogen is isolated from a positive eligible specimen, the laboratory technician will log
      onto the secure randomization program and enter the patient and specimen code. The random
      diagnostic pipeline allocation will then be generated, informed to the laboratory technician
      and logged in the study database. In the case of multiple specimens with pathogen growth for
      a single patient, the unique patient code will trigger the randomization program to generate
      the same diagnostic arm allocation as the previous sample(s).

    <description>Optimal antibiotic treatment is defined as an antibiotic treatment for at least 48 hours since positive culture, targeted to the identified pathogen and later found to cover the organisms antimicrobial resistance profile, while avoiding unnecessary broad spectrum antibiotics (e.g. avoid carbapenems or multiple agents where other agents or single agents would provide sufficient coverage).
