    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial of Unified Safety System (USS) Virginia closed-loop
      versus sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy for hypoglycemia prevention in subjects with type
      1 diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness and/or risk for hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the control system in reducing
      hypoglycemia by comparing, in a randomized study, 24 hour control with USS Virginia versus
      sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy in subjects with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia
      unawareness and/or risk for hypoglycemia. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the
      control system to improve hypoglycemia counterregulation, hypoglycemia awareness, and overall
      glycemic control. To achieve this goal, we will conduct pre- and post-intervention inpatient
      assessments of hypoglycemia counterregulation and symptom awareness. Subjects randomized to
      USS Virginia will participate in two training visits at a monitored outpatient setting for
      the step-wise deployment of the cell phone based Artificial Pancreas (AP) System at home. The
      first training visit includes training on the study pump and AP System followed by 1 week use
      of AP System at home in Pump mode. The second training visit includes additional training on
      USS Virginia+AP System and confirmation of independent use by the subject followed by 4 week
      use of the AP System at home in Closed Loop mode. Subjects randomized to sensor-augmented
      pump therapy will complete 5 weeks of CGM with the home pump.

    <ipd_description>NIH's Data Sharing Policy on sharing research resources for research purposes to the scientific community will be followed. Data will be stored in a Data Archive Database includes CGM-insulin delivery time series, meal content, boluses, &amp; exercise will be deidentified &amp; retrievable only by subject ID number. The data's real value lies in their precise time stamps - each reading is coded by date &amp; time which makes possible the data to be related to the subjects' daily routine. Individual patterns of demographic &amp; insulin treatment parameters leave open a remote possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Data can be made available only under a Data-Sharing Agreement that includes: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes &amp; not to identify participants; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; &amp; (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
