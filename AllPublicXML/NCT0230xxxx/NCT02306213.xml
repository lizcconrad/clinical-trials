  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown an increased incidence of renal replacement therapy after the use
      of Hydroxyethylstarchs (HES) in patients admitted in the intensive care unit. However,
      studies showing detrimental effects of HES have been conducted in mostly non-surgical
      subjects. There are very few studies analyzing the effects of HES on renal function after
      cardiac surgery, a population already at risk of renal dysfunction.
