    <textblock>
      A first in human experimental treatment in which an experimental medicine,Nuc-1031, is used
      in combination with a standard cancer medicine, carboplatin, to treat ovarian cancer which
      reappear after standard cancer treatment. The aim of the trial is to determine safety,
      effectiveness, and clinical activity of this combination treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nuc-1031 and carboplatin combination is a new experimental treatment for ovarian cancer which
      reappear after standard chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the name for drug treatments to kill or
      control the growth of cancer cells. Although there is some evidence from laboratory and
      clinical studies that Nuc-1031 is effective in the treatment of ovarian cancer, it has not
      yet been tested in combination with another chemotherapy drug. So this combination treatment
      is classed as a first in human study(Phase1B). The aim of the study is to investigate whether
      adding Nuc-1031 to carboplatin can improve the benefits of chemotherapy.

      Other purposes are to find out whether Nuc-1031 is safe to give with carboplatin, to identify
      the correct dose of Nuc-1031 when given with carboplatin and establish how effective the
      combination is at treating ovarian cancer. This study is also designed to enable us to find
      out whether Nuc-1031 adds further benefit, over and above that achieved by carboplatin alone,
      when treating ovarian cancer. and carboplatin combination will be given in six cycles. Each
      cycle is 3 weeks long. On first day of first week of each cycle (day1), selected study
      participants will receive one dose of both Nuc-1031 and Carboplatin chemotherapy. Following
      this, the study participant will receive a second dose of Nuc-1031 alone on first day of
      second week (day 8). This schedule will be repeated every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.
