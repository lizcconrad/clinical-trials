  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose escalation study where topotecan will be administered at lower doses
      given more frequently on a prolonged schedule (low dose metronomic; LDM), in combination with
      a fixed dose of pazopanib. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) will be evaluated for LDM topotecan in combination with pazopanib in children with
      recurrent or refractory solid tumours including CNS tumours. Pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies will be conducted to further define the exposure to and activity of
      LDM topotecan in combination with pazopanib.
