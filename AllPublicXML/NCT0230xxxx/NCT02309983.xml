    <textblock>
      For many after spinal cord injury (SCI) there is immobilization, muscle atrophy, bone loss,
      fracture risk during transferring (or falls), and the risk of secondary complications, and
      increase in attendance care and cost. It is important to develop multi dimensional
      rehabilitation strategies for people after SCI to enhance functional recovery towards
      walking, and enhance an increase in muscle and bone to potentially prepare the injured
      nervous system in the event of a cure. Locomotor training (Stand retraining and step re
      training) an activity-based rehabilitative approach generates muscle activity and provides
      weight bearing and joint contact kinetics, even in individuals who are unable to stand or
      step independently. Cross-sectional animal and human SCI studies have demonstrated that
      locomotor training (LT) (stand retraining and step retraining using body weight support
      treadmill training) has improved the capacity to stand independently and walk at faster
      speeds. Neuromuscular stimulation (NMS) or electrical stimulation (ES) training is a
      rehabilitative approach that generates muscle activity, alternating leg extension and flexion
      even in individuals who are unable to stand or step independently. NMS studies for
      individuals after SCI have shown improvements in bone density and muscle strength after
      cycling and resistance training. The main purpose of this study is to address whether stand
      retraining and NMS compared to stand retraining alone or NMS alone will increase neural and
      musculoskeletal gains and provide a greater functional recovery towards independent standing.

      This project will be completed at two sites: Kessler Foundation Research Center (the grant PI
      site) and Frazier Rehabilitation Institute, University of Louisville, Kentucky.

      There will be three groups in this study. Each group will receive 1.25 hr of intervention per
      session, for a total of 60 sessions (3 - 4 x week, 15- 20 weeks). Participants in Group 1
      will receive 1hr of ES while lying down in the chair followed by 15 min of overground
      training. Group 2 will receive standing retraining using BWS followed by 15 minutes of
      overground training. Group 3 will receive standing retraining with ES, followed by 15 min of
      overground training. Participants will complete the study after 20 weeks of training. The
      participant will be able to miss 8 consecutive training sessions before being dropped from
      the study.

      PRIMARY AIMS

      Specific Aim 1: To examine the effectiveness of standing retraining with ES for alterations
      in muscle volume (MV) and BMD in the lower limb:

      Hypothesis 1.1. SRT with ES compared to SRT alone or ES alone will increase muscle volume(MV)
      and muscle cross sectional area(MCSA) and potential muscle torque(PMT) at hip, knee and ankle
      joints (compared to baseline).

      Hypothesis 1.2. SRT with ES compared to SRT alone or ES alone will increase absolute BMD in
      the lower limbs(compared to baseline) Hypothesis 1.3. SRT with ES compared to SRT alone or ES
      alone will increase markers for bone formation and a decrease in markers for bone resorption
      commensurate with the observed increase in BMD (compared to baseline) SECONDARY AIMS Specific
      Aim 2 To examine the effectiveness of standing with ES for improvements in functional outcome
      and alterations in EMG in lower limb.

      Hypothesis 2.1. SRT with ES compared with SRT alone or ES alone will improve functional
      performance(as measured by standing time on the treadmill and overground) Hypothesis 2.2. SRT
      with ES compared to SRT alone and ES alone will experience a greater increase in the
      electromyography (EMG) amplitude for all leg muscles examined (compared to baseline) during
      standing.

      Hypothesis 2.3. LT with ES compared to SRT alone and ES alone will experience significantly
      greater cardiac output (CO) and/or stroke volume SV (compared to baseline).

    <description>Group 1 will receive 1hr of electrical stimulation while lying down followed by 15 min of overground training. Electrical stimulation will be applied through leads and self-adhesive electrodes over muscles of both legs. Two electrodes will be used for each muscle. Electrical stimulation will be induced by using the EMPI, Inc., St. Paul, MN [Respond Select Neuromuscular Stimulation]. There will be 60 sessions/3x week for 20 weeks.</description>

    <description>Group 2 will receive standing retraining with BWS alone on a treadmill without functional electrical stimulation. Locomotor training consists of (step training and stand retraining) on the treadmill, over ground training, and community ambulation. BWS will be given when a subject can not maintain his/her body weight while executing limb locomotion. BWS will be given when a subject can not maintain his/her body weight while executing limb locomotion. The duration of stand retraining sessions will be up to 1 hour or determined by subject's fatigue. There will be 60 sessions/3x week for 20 weeks.</description>
