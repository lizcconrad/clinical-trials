      Study Design: This is a two-part physiological for a device feasibility. Both studies are
      proof of concept descriptive pilot studies.

      The FIRST PART is a study of healthy volunteers and the SECOND PART of patients with
      pulmonary hypertension at routine cardiac catheterization laboratory (CATH-LABORATORY).

      Volunteers and patients will be enrolled sequentially; there is no group randomization.

      Overall hypothesis of this device feasibility study: To test a lightweight and portable
      method of synthesizing therapeutic levels of inhaled nitric oxide from air by electrical
      pulsed discharge.

  <detailed_description>

      Background. Inhaled nitric oxide is routinely used to treat acute pulmonary hypertension in
      infants, children and adults. By 2014 it has been estimate about 500,000 US patients have
      been treated with nitric oxide, with only the rare complication of methemoglobinemia reported
      at high inhaled doses.

      Rationale. The investigators explored novel alternative lightweight and economical methods of
      local nitric oxide production. In particular the investigators synthesized nitric oxide from
      air by an electrical pulsed plasma discharge. After 2 years of study the investigators have
      designed and produced a prototype of a device synthesizing nitric oxide from air with low
      levels of nitrogen dioxide and ozone. After completing experimentation in lambs, the
      investigators now plan to study nitric oxide generators in a proof of concept clinical study.

      Design of the study: The study is comprised of two parts:

        1. HEALTHY volunteer study, and

        2. CATH-LABORATORY study in patients.

      The study will be conducted at low levels of breathing nitric oxide, 25 parts per million of
      nitric oxide, for 20 minutes to comply with the threshold of the Environmental Protection
      Agency (EPA) for daily work exposure.

      The first portion of the study will be carried out in 6 healthy volunteers breathing 25 parts
      per million of nitric oxide. After this first part, the investigators will proceed to the
      second portion of the study and enroll 6 patients with pulmonary hypertension undergoing
      scheduled testing with a nitric oxide-pulmonary vasodilator response (CATH-LABORATORY study).
