      100 subjects who have a family history of pancreatic cancer (PC), or known genetic syndromes
      associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer, will be followed for five years. This
      data will be used to determine the pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesion detection rate
      in High Risk Individuals (HRIs). Subjects may agree to annual imaging and annual biomarkers
      or to biomarkers only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a family history of PC as listed below or who have one of the following
             syndromes: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome - STK11; BRCA 1 and 2; PALB2; ATM; FAMMM / P16;
             HNPCC (Lynch) / MMR genes; Hereditary pancreatitis - PRSS1

          -  Individuals with three or more affected blood relatives (1st, 2nd or 3rd degree)

          -  Individuals with two or more affected blood relatives with PC, with at least one
             affected FDR, should be considered for screening.

          -  Patients with a history of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome should be screened, regardless of
             family history of PC.

          -  Patients with a known p16 (FAMMM syndrome) with one affected 1st or 2nd degree
             relative will be considered for screening.

          -  Patients with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation with one affected 1st or 2nd degree
             relative should be considered for screening.

          -  Patients with a known PALB2 mutation with one affected family member should be
             considered for screening.

          -  Patients with a known Mismatch-repair gene-mutation carriers (Lynch syndrome) with one
             affected family member should be considered for screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not candidates for surgery
