  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VergenixTM STR device is an advanced Soft tissue repair device, made of lyophilized Type
      I rhCollagen and Calcium Chloride that will be mixed with autologous PRP prior to injection
      for the repair of non ruptured tendon injuries (Tendinopathy). Three (3) ml of the mixed
      solution will be injected into the common extensor tendon.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Man or woman aged 18 - 80 years old.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis based on site of pain, pain

             elicited with active extension of the wrist in pronation and elbow

             extension.

          3. Documented ultrasonography diagnosis of common extensor

             tendinosis and possible tear based on abnormal echotexture (tendon

             thickening, anechoic areas, areas of hypoechogencicity, loss of

             fibrillar pattern).

          4. Chronic symptoms (equal or greater than 3 months).

          5. PRTEE questionnaire score of at least 50 out of 100.

          6. For child-bearing potential females, documentation of birth

             control.

          7. Signing informed consent form. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute symptom onset (less than 3 months).

          2. History of acute elbow trauma.

          3. History of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

          4. History of Inflammatory disease

          5. History of Fibromyalgia

          6. The patient has active malignant disease of any kind. A patient who

             has had a malignant disease in the past, was treated and is currently

             disease-free for at least 5 years, may be considered for study entry.

          7. The patient is treated with anti-coagulant medication

          8. The patient previously underwent a surgery for lateral

             epicondylitis.

          9. The patient previously received local injections, including steroids

             within the last 30 days

         10. Signs of other causes for lateral elbow pain (posterior interosseous

             nerve entrapment, osteochondral lesion).

         11. Wounds around the elbow

         12. Likely problems, in the judgment of the investigator, with maintaining follow-up.

         13. Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology and blood

             chemistry lab tests at screening that in the opinion of the

             investigator might interfere with the patient's safety or participation

             in the study.

         14. Known as positive HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

         15. Known history of a significant medical disorder, which in the

             investigator's judgment contraindicates the patient's participation.

         16. Known hypersensitivity and/or allergy to collagen.

         17. Drug or alcohol abuse (by history).

         18. Pregnancy of child-bearing potential females.

         19. Participation in another study within 30 days prior to screening

        visit.
