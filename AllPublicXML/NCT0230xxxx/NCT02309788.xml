      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of ten leading cancer types worldwide and also in Asia,
      but the five-year relative survival rate is relatively quite low1-3. As a common complication
      of HCC, portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) have been reported with an occurrence of 34% ~
      50% in advanced HCC and it is now become an extremely pressing problem for hepatic surgeon.
      Nevertheless, the patients overall survival (OS) varies on their clinical features or liver
      function4. For HCC PVTT treatment, current options are surgical resection, embolization
      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a variety of ablation therapy, biological and gene
      therapy,etc. Among them, the use of radiation therapy is getting more and more attention, and
      it is changing from the past palliative treatment to current curable treatment. From an
      oncologic point of view, a narrow margin &lt;1 cm is not safe and is often associated with
      higher rates of recurrence and shorter patient survival.On the other hand, it is also
      believed that most intrahepatic recurrences arise from multicentric carcinogenesis and are
      distant from the resection margin.To address this issue, the investigators are going to
      conduct a series of retrospective and prospective studies to investigate the effect of
      adjuvant RT for centrally located HCC after narrow margin (&lt;1 cm) hepatectomy on tumor
      recurrence.

        Patients diagnosed with HCC at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University
        Science were considered for enrollment in the study. The diagnostic criteria for HCC used
        in the study were in accordance with the American Association for the Study of Liver
        Diseases' 2005 guidelines. All patients had preoperative serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) levels
        &gt;200 ng/mL or a typical enhancement pattern (arterial enhancement and portal/delayed washed
        out) on dynamic imaging of hepatic mass(es)&gt;2 cm, or cytologic/histologic evidence of HCC

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HCC with no preoperative RT

          -  resectable lesion that could be completely removed, at the same time retaining a

          -  compensated cirrhosis or no cirrhosis; Child-Pugh A

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Patients who had undergone transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) were eligible for
             enrollment in the study, provided this form of therapy ended at least 4 weeks before
