  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of a intervention on a specific health
      prevention/intervention program aimed at caregivers of mild and moderate patients post stroke
      with upper limb apraxia in comparison to a control group with a no specific formation in that
      kind of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Upper limb apraxia after stroke have severe problems to adapt their daily life.

      The upper limb apraxia syndrome affects the performance of skilled movements carried out by
      the upper limbs and provoke that many patients´activities have to be made by their main
      caregiver or carers.

      Caregivers usually have to occupy much time and efforts for caring their familiar or client,
      and it can result in a overload in different areas of the caregiver health.

      Few data are available on the effectiveness of interventions in caregivers that informally
      works with that kind of patients.

      The specific prevention health program is based on improving the awareness of the assistance
      that the caregivers provide, and knowing the process of the information that carer has to
      give to the patient while the patients have their activities made.
