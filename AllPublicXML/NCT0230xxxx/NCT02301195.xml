  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out to learn more about the effects of Therapeutic Horseback
      Riding (THR) for children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This
      treatment is very popular and horseback riding for children and adults with disabilities has
      been used as a form of therapy in the United States for over forty years. However, very
      little research has been done to find out whether or not THR is effective as a therapy for
      children with an ASD. This study is being done to see if THR will improve the agitation
      behaviors, coordination, and communication skills of children and adolescents with an ASD.
      This study is also being done to find out if the horse is necessary for children and
      adolescents with an ASD to improve.

      This study expands previous preliminary equine-assisted intervention research, including the
      authors' 10-week Therapeutic horseback riding (THR) intervention pilot, by evaluating the
      effectiveness of therapeutic horseback riding (THR) on self-regulation, socialization,
      communication, adaptive, and motor behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      Method: One hundred and twenty-seven participants (ages 6-16 years) were randomized by
      nonverbal IQ standard scores (&lt; 85 or &gt; 85) to one of two 10-week small groups: THR
      intervention; or barn activity (BA) control group without horses. Both interventions used
      similar methods, and the fidelity of the THR intervention was monitored. Participants were
      evaluated within one month pre- and post-intervention by raters blind to intervention
      conditions and caregiver questionnaires. Weekly during the intervention, caregivers rated
      participants' behaviors during the preceding week.

             individual with significant riding experience is defined here as one for whom the
             beginner curriculum would not be appropriately challenging), as the curriculum is
