    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of teratoma for which no additional standard surgical or medical therapy
             exists

          -  Patients must have completed at least 1 prior line of chemotherapy for germ cell tumor
             (except patients who present with primary pure teratoma who need not have received any
             previous chemotherapy)

          -  Radiographic progression, defined by RECIST v.1.1, after the last cancer treatment and
             within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, compared with scans within 1 year of enrollment.

          -  Availability of an archival or newly obtained tumor sample (collected at diagnosis or
             progression) with accompanying pathology report

          -  Meaurable or evaluable extra-cranial disease as defined by RECIST v 1.1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignant germ cell tumors with mixed histology such as embryonal carcinoma,
             choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor or seminoma. Note - this refers to the histology at
             the time of enrollment, not the histolgy at the time of initial presentation.

          -  Pathologic evidence of malignant transformation

          -  CNS disease unless radiation therapy and/or surgery has been completed and serial
             evaluation demonstrates stable disease

          -  Prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy

          -  Systemic antineoplastic therapy or any experimental therapy within 3 weeks before the
             first dose of study drug (6 weeks for prior nitrosoureas, bevacizumab, or mitomycin C)

          -  Major surgery ≤ 2 weeks or radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to planned start of study drug
             or patient has not recovered from major side effects.

          -  Requirement for treatment with any of the prohibited medications including strong
             CYP3A inhibitors, strong CYP3A inducers, CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic
             index, and medications with strong risk of QT prolongation

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
