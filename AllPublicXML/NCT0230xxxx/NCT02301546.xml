    <textblock>
      The current study will test the effectiveness of a computerized cognitive (thinking) training
      program on improving thinking and memory in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The
      investigators will also examine how short term changes in thinking abilities (i.e., practice
      effects) can be related to improvement in thinking abilities after the cognitive training
      program.
