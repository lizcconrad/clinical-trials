      The purpose of this study is to assess the humoral immune responses to Takeda's Tetravalent
      Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) administered subcutaneously in a subset of healthy
      participants between 2 and &lt;18 years of age living in dengue endemic countries.

    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate
      (TDV). TDV is being tested to assess how different dosing schedules of the vaccine effect
      immunity to dengue fever in dengue endemic countries. This study will look at the number of
      antibodies to dengue fever formed in people who are administered different dosing schedules
      of TDV.

      The study will randomize approximately 1800 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the four treatment groups in a 1:2:5:1 ratio—which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Group 1 - TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection Days 1 and 91

        -  Group 2 - TDV 0.5 mL SC injection Day 1

        -  Group 3 - TDV 0.5 mL SC injection Days 1 and 365

        -  Placebo (dummy SC) - this is a liquid that looks like the study drug but has no active
           ingredient

      In order to keep the treatment arms undisclosed to the patient and the doctor, participants
      will receive a placebo injection at any study visit where TDV is not being administered (Days
      91 and/or 365).

      Participants will be asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the
      injection site in a diary card for 28 days after each vaccination.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Asia and Latin America. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 18 months. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic
      including a final visit 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
