  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cohorts of Japanese participants will be enrolled and treated prior to cohorts of Caucasian
      participants for the sake of matching. Every effort will be made to match Caucasian and
      Japanese participants on a cohort basis at enrollment. Reasonable effort will be made to
      maintain balance between male and female participants within the cohorts. There will be no
      replacement of participants following randomization.

      Eligible participants will be admitted to the investigational center and after confirming
      their eligibility will be randomized to receive a single dose of 30, 60, or 100 μg/kg
      lipegfilgrastim. There will be 11 visits to the investigational center during the study,
      including a screening visit, 1 inpatient period (through Day 4 post-dose) and 9 ambulatory
      visits.

      Blood samples for PK, PD and immunogenicity analysis will be collected pre-dose and at
      specified time points post-dose. A mandatory blood sample for pharmacogenetics (PGx) will be
      collected from all participants. During the study the following safety assessments will be
      performed: vital signs measurements,physical examinations, record of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, urinalysis, safety ECG recordings, local tolerability (injection site
      reactions), overall tolerability, pregnancy testing, spleen sonography, and concomitant
      medications
