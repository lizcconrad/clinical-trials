      The main purpose of study is to compare the effectiveness of Hypofractionated IMRT boost
      Radiotherapy to Conventional IMRT boost Radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients
      combined with Androgen Deprivation Therapy.

      Additional objectives of the study for high-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer patients
      are as follows:

        1. Analysis of number of circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood as a
           prognostic/predictive factors for survival.

        2. Analysis of miRNA expression levels (100, 141 and 143) in peripheral blood as a
           prognostic and predictive factors.

        3. Evaluation of the usefulness expression of selected proteins (PTEN, SMAD4, Cyclin D1,
           SPP1) as prognostic and predictive factors.

        4. Evaluation of the usefulness of the expression level of antigen-specific T cells, B-and
           NK cells as a prognostic factors.

        5. Evaluation of usefulness of the fiducial markers for localizing the prostate gland
           position during irradiation for the selected control imaging methods (2DkV, CBCT, MVCT).
