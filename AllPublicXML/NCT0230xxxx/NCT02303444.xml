      The purpose of the study is to assess the use of Multikinase Inhibitors (MKIs) in the
      treatment of patients with a progressive differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) refractory to
      radioactive iodine (RAI) who do not have any symptoms.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to compare time to symptomatic progression (TTSP) from
      study entry in asymptomatic patients with RAI-refractory progressive DTC for whom there is a
      decision to initiate MKIs at study entry with that of asymptomatic patients with
      RAI-refractory progressive DTC for whom there is a decision to not initiate MKIs at study
      entry.

    <measure>Duration of each systemic treatment regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the time interval from the day of start of a treatment to the date of permanent discontinuation of a treatment (regardless of the reason for discontinuation including death). It includes interruption or drug holiday.</description>
