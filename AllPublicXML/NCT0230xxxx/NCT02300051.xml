    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is compare three interventions (short-term psychodynamic
      psychotherapeutic group and relapse prevention group therapy vs. treatment as usual, namely,
      psychiatric follow up including prescription of medication vs. both interventions combined)
      to individuals presenting compulsive sexual behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will compare three groups of patients under the three interventions, namely, (1)
      Short-Term Psychodynamic Group Psychotherapy (STPGP) followed by Relapse Prevention Group
      Therapy (RPGT) (n = 48) vs. (2) Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n = 42) vs. (3) both previous
      interventions combined (n = 45).

      The STPGP is a 16 weekly session's group psychotherapy. Each session lasts 90 minutes. Each
      group will consist of around 10 participants. All the groups of STPGP will be conducted by
      the same psychotherapist.

      The RPGT is an eight weekly therapy group. The sessions are structured and will last 90
      minutes.

      The medication used by those who are under TAU will be introduced through psychiatric care.
      Initially three visits will occur at intervals of 30 days and the followings will occur with
      an interval of 60 days. The medication protocol includes serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) or mood stabilizers (topiramate, divalproex sodium,
      oxcarbazepine) or both type of medications combined.

      All patients will be assessed on the outcomes and independent variables in the baseline (time
      0); in the 25th week (time 1); and 34th week (time 2) of treatment.
