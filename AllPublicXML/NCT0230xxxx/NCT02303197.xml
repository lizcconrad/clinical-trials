  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficiency and safety of ChiNing decoction to head and neck cancer
      patients with radioactive stomatitis. Half of participants will receive ChiNing decoction,
      while others will receive recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) spray.

    <textblock>
      This study uses randomized, controlled clinical research methods, through the observation of
      the treatment group (ChiNing decoction orally) and control group (recombinant human epidermal
      growth factor rhEGF spray on oral mucosal surface ) at different time points before and after
      radiotherapy, to evaluate the radiotherapy of acute radiation oral mucosa reaction (RTOG
      grade), quality of life score (EORTCQLQ-H&amp;N35 scale), oral pain (VAS score) and patient body
      weight changes of the two groups. At the same time，this study takes cast-off cells of oral
      mucosal to observe the microscopic characteristics of oral mucosa, and uses the ELISA method
      to detect IL-6 and TNF- alpha content in the saliva before and after radiotherapy.
