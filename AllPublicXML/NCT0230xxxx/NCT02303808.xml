  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to analyze whether the inhalation of hypertonic saline combined with a
      positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device increases the amount of sputum expectorated during
      the chest physiotherapy session ( inhalation + bronchial drainage).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will perform two different arms of treatment in a crossover randomization. Each
      arm of treatment will be applied during 5 consecutive days. The wash-out period will be one
      week. Before starting the trial all patients will do an inhalation formation.

      During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remains unchanged
