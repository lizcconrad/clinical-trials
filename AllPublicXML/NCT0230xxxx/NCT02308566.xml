  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to compare cerebral embolic load in patients undergoing
      surgical aortic valve replacement using either the minimized extracorporeal circulation or
      the conventional extracorporeal circulation technique. The detection of cerebral emboli is
      performed not-invasively by transcranial Doppler detection of high-intensity transient
      signals representing solid or gaseous microembolism in the middle cerebral arteries. The
      investigators hope to get more insight in the mechanism (incl. quantity) of cerebral embolism
      during aortic valve surgery using extracorporeal circulation.

      Background

      The gold standard to treat severe aortic valve stenosis is currently the surgical aortic
      valve replacement (SAVR) using conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC). SAVR, however,
      can be performed also on minimized extracorporeal circulation (MECC), which is characterized
      by reduced priming volume and interfaces between blood and artificial surfaces and blood-air
      interface, respectively. Further technical developments of the MECC system together with
      reports on less induction of the coagulation cascade and activation of inflammatory systemic
      response may account for a reduced incidence of microbubble generation with MECC system.

      Objective

      The aim of the is to investigate the procedural-related incidence of high-intensity transient
      signals (HITS) representing solid or gaseous microembolism reaching the cerebral vessels.

      Methods

      Patients undergoing SAVR are included in the study and randomised to either MECC or CECC
      technique. HITS are continuously bilaterally detected during the entire intraoperative period
      by transcranial Doppler ultrasound.
