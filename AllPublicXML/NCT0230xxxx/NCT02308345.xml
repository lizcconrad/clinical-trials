  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients about to begin chemotherapy receive large amounts of information regarding
      their prognosis, how chemotherapy improves their prognosis, and the usual side effects of the
      chemotherapy during their first visit to the oncologist. Prior studies have documented that
      less than half of this information is retained after the visit, making it difficult for
      patients to participate in their care and difficult for them to enlist the help of their
      social support. The MiVideo project allows the physician to create a custom 5-minute summary
      video summary of a pre-chemotherapy clinic visit and upload it to a secure web site. The
      video will emphasize the major points of the forty-five minute office discussion, allowing
      patients to review the physicians' recommendations and share the information and
      recommendations with others. By providing the patient with this re-cap of their visit, the
      investigators hope to engage them more actively in their cancer treatment. Making the
      information available to friends and family can also help a patient receive both intellectual
      and emotional support during the course of treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is
      improvement of patient care, not research activity.

      Primary Hypothesis: Creating a 5-minute video summarizing information about diagnosis, stage,
      chemotherapy treatment plan, and anticipated side effects for patients starting chemotherapy
      for colon cancer will not significantly lengthen the pre-chemotherapy clinic visit as
      compared to visits that do not include video production.
