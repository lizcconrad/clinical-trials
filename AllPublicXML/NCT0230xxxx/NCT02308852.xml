      Noninvasive brain stimulations (NIBS) will be used in healthy volunteers and in chronic
      stroke patients to improve bimanual activities and motor learning.

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be used to evaluate the mechanisms underlying
      bimanual activities and motor learning in healthy volunteers and in chronic stroke patients.

      A neuro-rehabilitation robot (REA2PLAN, AXINESIS, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) will be used for
      motor learning.

  <detailed_description>

      tDCS will be used in a sham-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over control trial in
      chronic stroke patients with motor deficits. After informed consent and recruitment, patients
      will be randomly (computer method) allocated to real or sham tDCS, that will be applied
      during performance of bimanual activities and/or motor learning. A few
      minutes/hours/days/weeks after completing one trial's arm, the patients will enter the other
      trial's arm (double-blind cross-over design).

      Baseline and follow-up outcomes about bimanual and unimanual motor tasks will be collected.

      For a subset of subjects, motor learning and data acquisition will be performed with a
      neuro-rehabilitation robot (REA2PLAN, AXINESIS, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) .
