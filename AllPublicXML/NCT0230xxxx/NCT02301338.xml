  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of more frequent follow-up (by
      videoconference) of these patients. Videoconference is a method of communication over a
      distance. In this method, the patient will hear the person's voice (like on the telephone)
      and will see that person over video.

      The study will compare more frequent follow-up of patients by videoconferencing to routine
      follow-up of patients. The investigators will compare each type of follow-up to see the
      effect on the number of times patients need to visit emergency rooms or need admission to
      hospitals. The study will also look at the difference between each type of follow-up on
      patients' quality of life and social support thirty days after hospital discharge.

      The study will also measure satisfaction and acceptability of this intervention among those
      who had follow-ups by videoconference.
