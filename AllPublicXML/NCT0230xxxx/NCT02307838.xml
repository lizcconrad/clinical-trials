      This study collected follow-up data on approximately 90% of participants who were randomized
      and received one dose of study drug in FTY720D2201 (D2201). No study drug was given or
      required. Participants were required to be assessed at one or two visits, preferably at the
      original study site, but the option to be interviewed via phone or seen at home was provided.
      Information was gathered also on deceased participants. Assessments were performed only once
      within an 8 week period and included medical history, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Multiple
      Sclerosis Disease Modifying Therapy (MS DMT) history, Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).

      This was a multicenter follow-up study of patients originally enrolled in the Phase 2 D2201
      study. Patients did not receive any protocol specified treatment. The original D2201 study
      sites who agreed to participate in this study were required to locate their patients who were
      randomized in Study D2201 and asked them to return for a 10-year assessment, regardless of
      their current treatment status. Locating the patient may have required the use of search and
      advertising strategies to find those patients currently lost to follow-up, in accordance with
      local privacy legislation. Patients currently being followed within Study FTY720D2399
      (NCT01201356) were asked to participate in Study FTY720D2201E2 and if patients gave consent,
      were enrolled concurrently in both studies.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline from core study (CFTY720D2201 (NCT00333138)), 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It consists of eight functional systems (FS) which are used to derive the EDSS steps (score) ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The functional systems are Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel and Bladder, Cerebral and Other functions. Based on the assessment of each FS, the participant's score is determined between 0 to 10. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Classified as Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Most people who are diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. Participants who were classified as SPMS were assessed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Fuctional Composite (MSFC) Component: Nine Hole Peg Test (9-HPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline from core study, CFTY720D2201 (NCT00333138), 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed immediately by two consecutive trials of the non-dominant hand). The time limit per trial is 300 seconds. The right and left hand scores were the time in seconds it took to insert and remove 9 pegs ((the average scores from the four trials on the 9-HPT (the two trials for each hand are averaged, converted to the reciprocals of the mean times for each hand and then the two reciprocals are averaged)). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in MSFC Component: Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline from core study (CFTY720D2201 (NCT00333138)), 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. The PASAT is the last measure administered at each visit. It is presented on audio compact disc (CD) to control the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The test result is the number of correct sums given (out of 60 possible). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in MSFC Component: Timed 25-foot Walk Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline from core study (CFTY720D2201 (NCT00333138)), 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot (7.62 m) course and is instructed to walk 25 feet (7.62 meter) as quickly as possible, but safely. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task. The test scores were the time in seconds it took to walk the 25 feet. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline from core study (CFTY720D2201 (NCT00333138)), 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>MSFC is a composite measure encompassing information from the nine-hole peg test (arm dimension), timed 25 foot walk (leg dimension) and PASAT. The MSFC composite Z score was calculated as follows: (1) the average scores from the four trials on the 9-HPT (the two trials for each hand were averaged, converted to the reciprocals of the mean times for each hand and then the two reciprocals were averaged); (2) the average scores of two 25-Foot Timed Walk trials; (3) the number correct from the PASAT-3. The MSFC is based on the concept that scores for these three dimensions—arm, leg, and cognitive function are combined to create a single score (the MSFC) that can be used to detect change over time in a group of multiple sclerosis patients. This was done by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC, and averaging them to create an overall composite Z score.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This extension study was a multicenter follow-up study of participants who enrolled in FTY720D2201 (NCT02307838). Although participants in this study did not receive study treatment, the participant flow is based on the treatments receive in FTY720D2201.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 177 participants were enrolled into the study. However, 2 participants were erroneously enrolled into the study because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Therefore, they were not included in any analyses, and as such, the participant flow is based on 175 participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</title>
        <description>EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It consists of eight functional systems (FS) which are used to derive the EDSS steps (score) ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The functional systems are Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel and Bladder, Cerebral and Other functions. Based on the assessment of each FS, the participant's score is determined between 0 to 10. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed immediately by two consecutive trials of the non-dominant hand). The time limit per trial is 300 seconds. The right and left hand scores were the time in seconds it took to insert and remove 9 pegs ((the average scores from the four trials on the 9-HPT (the two trials for each hand are averaged, converted to the reciprocals of the mean times for each hand and then the two reciprocals are averaged)). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. The PASAT is the last measure administered at each visit. It is presented on audio compact disc (CD) to control the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The test result is the number of correct sums given (out of 60 possible). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MSFC Component: Timed 25-foot Walk Test Score</title>
        <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot (7.62 m) course and is instructed to walk 25 feet (7.62 meter) as quickly as possible, but safely. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task. The test scores were the time in seconds it took to walk the 25 feet. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Z Score</title>
        <description>MSFC is a composite measure encompassing information from the nine-hole peg test (arm dimension), timed 25 foot walk (leg dimension) and PASAT. The MSFC composite Z score was calculated as follows: (1) the average scores from the four trials on the 9-HPT (the two trials for each hand were averaged, converted to the reciprocals of the mean times for each hand and then the two reciprocals were averaged); (2) the average scores of two 25-Foot Timed Walk trials; (3) the number correct from the PASAT-3. The MSFC is based on the concept that scores for these three dimensions—arm, leg, and cognitive function are combined to create a single score (the MSFC) that can be used to detect change over time in a group of multiple sclerosis patients. This was done by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC, and averaging them to create an overall composite Z score.</description>
