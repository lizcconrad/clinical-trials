      Eyes of 108 diabetic patients have underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens
      implantation surgery have enrolled. Fifty four eyes have received the conventional
      postoperative care with steroid drop, whereas the other group (54 eyes) have given a
      preoperative diclofenac drop four times daily in addition to steroid drop and continued six
      weeks after surgery. All patients have evaluated by Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      preoperatively and days 1, 30, and 90.The outcome measures including best corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA) and OCT findings were compared in and between both groups.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetic patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy that were candidate for
             phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eyes with clinically significant macular edema based on the ETDRS(Early Treatment
             Diabetic Retinopathy Study) study and/or central macular thickness &gt;260Âµ were not
             included. Neither did we include the eyes with other accompanying diseases affecting
             the macula or eyes with history of previous retinal laser photocoagulation or
             intraocular surgery.

          -  Eyes with severe cataract that preclude performing an acceptable quality optical
             coherence tomography (OCT) were not enrolled either.
