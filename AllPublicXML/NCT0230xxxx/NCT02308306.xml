    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the ABILITY study is to help improve pain diagnostics and treatment by
      developing an implementable clinical computerised decision support system based on individual
      patient characteristics.

      The investigators hypothesize that successful pain control with opioids can be predicted
      before treatment initiation with advanced data analyses of data originating from
      pre-treatment EEG, QST and pain-related catastrophic thinking.

      The primary objective of this study is the identification of markers that can be used to
      individualize treatment recommendations, i.e. to reliably predict the response of pain to
      opioids.

      Markers are selected among the most promising data and machine-learning methods are used for
      the prediction. This includes determining the associations between a battery of selected
      pre-treatment clinical predictive markers and the analgesic effect of opioid treatment in
      opioid naïve chronic pain patients, including indication and responder identification.

      The key secondary objectives are as follows: to investigate pre-treatment clinical predictive
      markers as predictors of opioid treatment efficacy and effectiveness in terms of the
      following:

        -  Pain intensity and unpleasantness

        -  Use of rescue analgesics

        -  Physical functioning

        -  Global improvement and satisfaction with treatment

        Subjects with an insufficiently treated chronic pain condition (with non-opioids ±
        adjuvants), and expected to benefit from the administration of opioids (as necessary) to
        obtain freedom from pain.

          -  Minimum baseline pain intensity ≥ 4 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (over the past
             week).

          -  Maximum baseline pain intensity &lt; 9 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (over the past
             week).

          -  Prescribed opioid treatment (ATC: N02)

          -  Anticipated to stay on prescribed opioid treatment throughout the study, i.e. &gt;14

          -  Subject may be male or female, age &gt;18 years old.

          -  Subject has voluntarily signed and dated the study-specific informed consent form,
             approved by an Independent Ethics Committee, after the nature of the study has been
             explained and the subject has had the opportunity to ask questions. The informed
             consent form must be signed before any study-specific procedures are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a mental incapacity or language barriers precluding adequate understanding of
             study procedures.

          -  Is considered by the site investigator unsuitable to participate in the study for any
             other reason, for instance due to a significant serious underlying condition.

          -  Recently received opioids on a daily basis (within the last 10 weeks).

          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse, according to the site investigator's medical
             judgement.

          -  Is anticipated to undergo a painful procedure(s) (e.g. surgery) during the study,
             which can interfere with the experience of the chronic pain condition for which the
