  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raltegravir is the first marketed strand-transfer inhibitor of HIV-1 that was FDA approved in
      2007. It is currently one of the preferred treatment regimens for HIV by the Department of
      Health and Human Services. It has become a widely used antiretroviral therapy option for HIV
      infected patients. It provides good tolerability and a favorable lipid profile for patients
      when compared to some other antiretroviral treatment options. Little data is reported about
      efficacy in a minority patient population. Moreover, data in an indigent minority population
      in the United States has not been aggregated before. Therefore this study will investigate
      the efficacy of raltegravir in minority women residing in Houston, TX who are HIV infected.
