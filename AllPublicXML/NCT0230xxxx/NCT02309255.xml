    <textblock>
      The NOR-COR study is a cross-sectional, observational study designed to explore a large
      number of cardiovascular, inflammatory, genetic, behavioral, and psychosocial factors
      (including anxiety, depression, quality of life) in 1369 patients with established coronary
      heart disease (CHD) hospitalized in the Sections for Cardiology at the hospitals in Drammen
      (n=722) and Vestfold (n=647). Study data from an extensive questionnaire, clinical and
      laboratory data, and sputum/saliva for genetic analyses will be collected.

      The main overall aim of the NOR-COR study is to develop new strategies to improve secondary
      prevention for underserved high risk patient-groups with CHD. The first study phase aims to
      collect information necessary to develop empirically based future secondary coronary
      prevention interventions. In a genetic sub-project markers associated with CHD and
      personality type will be explored.

      The study will evaluate current secondary preventive programs and explore the mechanisms that
      link behavioral, psychosocial, inflammatory, and genetic factors to poor prognosis. The study
      will in short term provide new knowledge potentially useful for increasing participation in
      current cardiac rehabilitation/secondary preventive programs. For a longer perspective these
      associations may be useful for design of new intervention programs to selected high risk
      patient groups whom may be in need of programs with different content and/or of longer
      duration than those currently being applied.

        Inclusion criteria:

        All patients aged 18-80 years with first or recurrent diagnosis or treatments for CHD: a)
        acute myocardial infarction [ICD-10; I21], b) coronary artery by-pass graft operation
        (CABG), or c) elective or emergency PCI [ICD-10; I25]) have been identified from hospital
        patient discharge lists (diagnostic lists) by searching chronologically after last
        admission the past three years. In patients with recurrent diagnosis the last event will
        define the event.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairment that would invalidate assessment including all patients living at
             nursing home and psychosis.

          -  Short life expectancy (i.e. &lt;1 year) due to terminal heart (NYHA class 4), lung
             (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease GOLD 4)-, liver- or kidney disease (chronic
             kidney disease stage 5), malignant disease, or other reason.

          -  Not able to understand and write the Norwegian language or refuse to give written
             informed consent to study participation.
