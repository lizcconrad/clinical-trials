  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single-site trial to evaluate the drug release, using
      scintigraphic images and mesalazine plasma levels (PK) in healthy subjects and patients with
      mildly active UC. Overall, nine [9] subjects per prototype coating (a total of 18) will be
      evaluated. Four [4] healthy subjects and five [5] patients will be administered one [1]
      radio-labelled tablet of either formulation D or formulation E, respectively.

      Amendment: Overall, nine [9] subjects/patients will be evaluated. Four [4] healthy subjects
      and five [5] patients will be administered one [1] radio-labelled tablet of this new third
      improved formulation H.

      In order to keep the number of patients low, recruitment of patients will be stopped when
      obtaining at least 3 patients with evaluable scintigraphic images. Healthy volunteers will
      then be recruited to achieve a full set of participants (n=9 per Arm).
