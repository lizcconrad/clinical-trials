      The device to be tested (fireflyTM) stimulates the common peroneal nerve and causes the foot
      to twitch, and has been shown to increase blood flow. The device is also indicated for the
      treatment of oedema. In this study the investigators intend to assess the use of the device
      as an adjunctive therapy for people recovering from grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains.
