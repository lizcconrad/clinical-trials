  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tipepidine (3-[di-2-thienylmethylene]-1-methylpiperidine) has been used solely as a
      nonnarcotic antitussive in Japan since 1959. The safety of tipepidine in children and adults
      has already been established. It is reported that tipepidine inhibits G-protein-coupled
      inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK)-channel currents. The inhibition of GIRK channels by
      tipepidine is expected to modulate the level of monoamines in the brain. We put forward the
      hypothesis that tipepidine can improve attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      symptoms by modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission through the inhibition of GIRK
      channels. The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to confirm whether
      treatment with tipepidine can improve symptoms in pediatric patients with ADHD.

    <measure>The ADHD Rating Scale IV Japanese Version (ADHD-RS-IV-J) by physician.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV-J at 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD Rating Scale-IV obtains parent ratings regarding the frequency of each ADHD symptom based on DSM-IV criteria. The ADHD Rating Scale-IV is completed independently by the parent and scored by a clinician. The scale consists of 2 subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items).</description>

    <description>The DN-CAS is an assessment battery designed to evaluate cognitive processing. It was developed to integrate theoretical and applied areas of psychological knowledge using cognitive processing theory and tests designed to measure—Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive Processing (PASS)—in individuals ages 5-17. This assessment facilitates mental health professionals in the identification of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, learning disabilities, Mental Retardation, and giftedness.</description>
