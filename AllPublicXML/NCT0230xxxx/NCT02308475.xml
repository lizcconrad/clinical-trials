  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the ability of a novel 3rd generation dual-source CT system to demonstrate
      myocardial perfusion in a cohort of patients presenting to the Chest Pain Center with acute
      chest pain.

      The investigators will assess the latest generation of CT scanner for heart disease
      detection. On this new machine the investigators will analyse the ability of the machine to
      show the delivery of blood to the heart muscle. Results will be compared with the results
      from the gold standard test for myocardial perfusion imaging, which is an imaging test that
      shows the blood supply to the heart muscle. Further analyses will record the amount of
      radiation, which is how the CT machine acquires images, and compare the amount of radiation
      necessary to produce images to previous CT systems. With this new CT system there should be
      reductions in the amount of radiation dose compared to previous systems.
