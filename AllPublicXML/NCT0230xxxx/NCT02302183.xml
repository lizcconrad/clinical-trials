      The aim of the study is to assess the use feasibility of the FreeO2 system so as to deliver
      automatically oxygen in infants and children admitted at hospital for hypoxemic acute
      respiratory distress.

      In healthy volunteers adults, FreeO2 system provided a better control of the oxygen
      saturation in function of designed target, reducing the desaturation time and hyperoxia. Our
      hypothesis is that FreeO2 system use is feasible in infants and children with hypoxemic acute
      respiratory distress. We think FreeO2 will provide a better control of the oxygen saturation,
      a faster oxygen weaning than classical way (Rotameter). In addition, FreeO2 could reduce the
      number of intervention by nurses.
