      Background Subanesthetics concentrations of lidocaine are able to produce a differential
      block of the ectopic discharges, but not propagation of impulses, suppressing differentially
      the associated neuropathic pain symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      differences between the analgesic effects of lidocaine 0.5% and a control group of lidocaine
      0.1% on several neuroma related pain modalities.

      Methods Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain due to painful neuromas caused by nerve injury
      participated in this randomized, double-blind experiment. The patterns of sensory changes
      were compared before and after injection of 1 ml lidocaine 0.5% and 0.1% close to the
      neuroma, the sessions being 1-2 weeks apart. Spontaneous and evoked pains were assessed using
      a visual analogue scale (VAS), quantitative and qualitative sensory testing.

      Patients were recruited by using a postal follow up questionnaire . The number of enrolled
      subjects in this study- 16 patients, Study design

        -  The patients visited the Pain Clinic twice.

        -  The same investigator (AM) performed all study procedure assessments.

        -  Neuroma was localized by Tinel`s sign 14 and when possible (7 patients out of 16), the
           localization of a neuroma was verified by ultrasound.

      Administration of study drug The patients were randomized by a computer generated random list
      to receive either 1ml lidocaine 0.5% (A) or 1 ml 0.1% (B-control) injected perineuromally.

      Pain assessments Duration of the present pain condition was recorded. The patients were asked
      to rate the mean, maximum, minimum pain intensity of their spontaneous and evoked pain in the
      week prior to both visits. The pain score was measured from baseline until 60 min after
      injection. Assessments of pain were done post injection at 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, and at 5-min
      intervals for the first 30-min post injection and then every 10-min to 1 hr post injection.
      The assessments of pain were performed between the limbs in the following order: spontaneous
      pain, then assessment of dynamic mechanical allodynia and then pinprick hyperalgesia.

      Spontaneous pain Evaluation of sensory function was performed in the affected limb using
      bedside examination according to EFNS (European Federation of Neurological
      Societies)guidelines: light touch, pinprick sense, warmth (40°) and cold (25°) temperature
      stimuli were tested.

          -  18 years or older,

          -  with a history of persistent spontaneous and/or evoked pain (by e.g. touch, movement),

          -  who scored an average daily pain intensity of at least 4 on a 0-10 point numerical
             pain scale (NRS) interfering with daily activities and who had pain at least 3 months
             duration.

          -  They all had neuromas after upper extremity surgery or other trauma affecting the
             radial, ulnar, median or digital nerves and were eligible to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with other conditions that might confound assessment of pain attributed to
