  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study in patients with continuous flow left ventricular assist device (cfLVAD) to proof
      the feasibility of a specific individual training at home aimed to increase pulse pressure
      above a predefined threshold which might attenuate the loss of arterial wall thickness.

      Hypothesis:

      Increasing daily physical activity near to normal (&gt; 10.000 steps per day) with a pre-defined
      level of pulse pressure (intensity) is a realizable and feasible approach to investigate
      changes in arterial wall thickness and cardio-respiratory capacity in cfLVAD patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study 3 cfLVAD patients with low pulse pressure during work package 1
      using two different exercises, treadmill and bicycle. Walking and cycling present the most
      commonly used physical activities which are applicable to most individuals on a daily basis.
      The investigators aim to demonstrate that individual changes of pulse pressure during these
      types of exercise can be assessed in cfLVAD patients.

      In a feasibility study (work package 2) the investigator will enroll 6 cfLVAD patients to
      perform home-based physical activity programs including walking a defined number of steps per
      day with a predefined speed and cycling with a predefined power [watt] on a bicycle
      ergometer. The performance of the patients will be monitored over seven days using a wearable
      activity device.

    <intervention_name>Daily physical activity</intervention_name>
    <description>A combination of walking (&gt; 10.000 steps per day) and cycling on a stationary bicycle at home at an individual intensity. For the activity walking patients need to walk at a certain speed (e.g. 3 km/h) in order to be in the range of pulsatility as obtained from their pre-training treadmill test. For cycling a defined power in watt and duration will be given to each patient as defined from the pre-training cycling test.</description>
