  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study intended to evaluate a non-invasive device that uses light to measure the
      amount of oxygen in the muscles of injured and non-injured legs in specific situations. The
      name of this technology is NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy). The goal of this study is to
      collect the information necessary to understand the use of the NIRS monitoring system to
      diagnose and direct treatment decisions in case of complications sometimes experienced in
      traumatic tibia fracture, such as excessive swelling called acute compartment syndrome (ACS).

      This study seeks to further develop the use of NIRS technology in the diagnosis of acute
      compartment syndrome. NIRS values normally increase in traumatized legs compared to the
      contralateral uninjured leg or forearm, indicative of a hyperemic response. The investigators
      hopes to build upon the current knowledge and verify the ability to accurately detect ACS
      using two easily identified and accessible leg compartments, the anterior and superficial
      posterior utilizing the Nonin 7600 oximeter with the Sensor Model 8004CV. Additionally, since
      this device was originally designed with brain tissue in mind, the NIRS device will collect
      vital engineering data that will be used to validate the algorithm used to produce the
      oxygenation values in injured muscle tissue.
