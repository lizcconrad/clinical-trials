  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother to child transmission(MTCT) is the main route of hepatitis B virus(HBV)
      transmission.High HBV DNA level of pregnant women is the main risk factor of MTCT. Many
      literatures demonstrate that using nucleoside (acid) analogs in late pregnancy can
      significantly reduce HBV DNA level and effectively blocking MTCT. Therefore, treatment
      guidelines of hepatitis B in Europe and the Asia Pacific region clearly pointed out:
      Nucleoside (acid) analogs can be used in pregnant women after 28 weeks of gestation for
      blocking MTCT in mothers with high HBV DNA level. At present, the drugs used in late
      pregnancy including lamivudine (LAM) ,telbivudine(LdT) and tenofovir(TDF).

      The safety of nucleoside (acid) analogues used in late pregnancy on children is not clear.In
      most of the related researches,the observation termination was 7-12 months after birth, and
      most were concentrated on the blocking effect of MTCT.The long-term impact of Nucleoside
      (acid) analogues on children's development has not been reported in the literatures. The aim
      of this study is to make clear of the effect of nucleoside (acid) analogues used in late
      pregnancy on long-term impact of children's development.

      The one year old children born in Beijing Ditan hospital and whose mothers had taken LAM,LdT
      or TDF during late pregnancy will be enrolled as study group, and eligible children whose
      mothers untreated will be enrolled as control group. The children's height, weight,
      nutritional status, developmental quotient and immune response to hepatitis B vaccine etc
      will be evaluated at baseline and at 3 years old. By comparing the children's development in
      different groups as well as in self-control of different ages, we will discuss the effect of
      Nucleoside (acid) analogues on children's long-term development.
