  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate whether a passive leg raising test to
      guide fluid therapy of patients with septic shock can reduce fluid balance and weight gain.
      Patients will be treated according to an algorithm in which the indexed stroke volume (stroke
      volume related to body surface area) and mean arterial pressure will guide the timing and
      amount of fluid and the use of inotropic and vasoactive support. Patients will be randomized
      to either an intervention group in which a passive leg raising test will be made prior to any
      decision for fluid administration or to a control group where this test is not performed and
      fluid administration is carried out according to standard of care at the department.

      Hypothesis: A passive leg raising test, will reduce weight gain by day 3 by 30%.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was stopped because of futility due to unexpected low weight gain in both groups.

        arterial femoral/axillary line. Elevated ICP. Patients who have had a femoral amputation.
        Elevated intraabdominal pressure&gt;20 cm H2O.

        Suspension criteria: The patient has developed pulmonary oedema during PLR test. Life
        threatening bleeding.

        Serious adverse events:

        Trombosis in arteria femoralis. Death during the study period.
