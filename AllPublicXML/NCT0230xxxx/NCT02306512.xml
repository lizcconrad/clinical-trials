  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if immunofluorescence (IF) can effectively identify
      features of malignant melanoma in situ, on sun-damaged skin, in the setting of Mohs
      Micrographic Surgery.

      The aim of this study is to

        1. Determine the feasibility of using melanocytic markers such as Melanoma antigen
           recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) with fluorescence to clear surgical margins when
           compared to conventional MART-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the setting of MMS for LM
           (lentigo maligna type melanoma in situ).

        2. Compare the use of a cocktail of immunofluorescent markers such as, but not limited to,
           Sex-determining Region Y (SRY)-box 10 (SOX10), human melanoma black 45 (HMB-45), and
           Kiel-67 (Ki-67) to sections only stained with fluorescent MART-1 alone.

        3. Explore the value of using other combinations of immunofluorescent markers such as S-100
           with Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF), Nestin with Ki-67, and
           HMB-45 with Lamin.

    <description>Samples removed with MMS within the first 3 mm margin from the tumor will be the first section. They will be processed as a conventional H&amp;E frozen section and section stained with IHC MART-1. Samples removed with MMS within 3-6 mm from tumor margin will be the second section. They will be processed with fluorescent MART-1 antibodies. Based on the pre-defined characteristics MMS surgeon will evaluate each MART-1 immunofluorescent section as &quot;no evident melanoma&quot; or &quot;possible melanoma&quot; or &quot;present melanoma&quot;. Dermatopathologist will secondarily review each section scoring them in the same manner. If standard H&amp;E, IHC, or immunofluorescence is recorded as &quot;present melanoma&quot; or &quot;possible melanoma&quot; a third section from 6-9mm will have the same procedure described before.</description>

    <description>In the second arm of the study, assuming that immunofluorescence with MART-1 proves to be superior or at least equivocal to regular MART-1 IHC, the same method will be applied, but the control sections will be stained with fluorescent MART-1 antibodies and compared to a section stained with a cocktail of fluorescent melanocytic antibodies.</description>

    <description>The fluorescent primary antibodies may include HMB-45, SOX10, Ki-67 and MART-1. However other markers will be considered to make the most visually remarkable cocktail; these may include S-100, MiTF, lamin and nestin. Primary antibodies will be tagged with secondary antibodies labeled with fluorescent signals. A fluorescent organelle stain and/or 4',6-diamidine-2-phenylindol (DAPI) may also be used to enhance cellular architecture.</description>
