      Background: Despite considerable progress in the field of assisted reproductive technology
      (ART) maximum pregnancy rates generally do not exceed 30%. Furthermore, substantial
      differences in pregnancy rates are seen between women starting ART from seemingly similar
      clinical starting points and information on pregnancy/neonatal complications after ART is
      limited. For physicians and patients it would be extremely valuable if tools could be
      developed through which individualised chances of live birth and the development of
      pregnancy/neonatal complications can be calculated. In addition, there is increasing
      knowledge about health risks associated with subfertility and in particular with polycystic
      ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and premature ovarian failure (POF). An important void in research to
      date is the absence of a control group to check important new findings.

      Objectives: The study protocol aims to form a cohort of normo-ovulatory women with a regular
      indication for ART which can aid the investigators principle lines of research:

        1. To study initial predictors of ovarian response to stimulation for IVF

        2. To study predictors of chances for live birth after repeated IVF cycles

        3. To assess the role for vascular health in the probabilities of success in ART treatment

        4. To study predictors for pregnancy and neonatal complications

        5. To form a control group for cycle disturbance studies

      Study design: In this part of the protocol, serum and material for DNA analysis will be
      collected by asking patients to have 20 ml of blood drawn during a routine blood withdrawal.
      This blood will be stored in the Biobank of the UMC Utrecht at -80 C.

      Study population: All women starting ART will be asked to participate.

      Nature and extent of the burden and benefits associated with participation: There are no
      benefits or risks for the study patient as blood is withdrawn during a routine venapuncture
      and results will not be used for clinical practice.

      The aim of this protocol is to collect serum and genotype from normo-ovulatory women with a
      regular indication for IVF/ICSI that can aid further research into the investigators
      principle lines of research which include improving performance ART treatment , limiting
      pregnancy complications, and improving offspring health.
