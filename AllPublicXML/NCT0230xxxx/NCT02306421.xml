      Simplified Milligan-Morgan is a surgical option which was improved and developed by Professor
      He,well-known traditional Chinese doctor from Hunan province,based on Milligan-Morgan.RPH is
      a new therapy for hemorrhoid following the improvement of rubber band ligation.RPH
      +Simplified Milligan-Morgan is one of important means of modern surgery.The operation method
      was improved and developed on the basis of Chinese medicine traditional loop ligature and it
      also embodies uniqueness and advantage of the treatment of mixed hemorrhoids combined
      traditional Chinese and Western Medicine.The study intends to compare five surgery ways
      through 3000 cases of patients with mixed hemorrhoid from 12 hospitals,observing the efficacy
      and safety of various operative methods.Exploration of RPH + Simplified Milligan-Morgan
      operation indication, contraindication, operation steps and key points, and the operation
      complications and sequelae and treatment etc provide evidence of evidence-based medicine for
      Clinical application.

      complications and sequelae and treatment etc provide evidence of evidence-based medicine for
      Clinical application.

      Diagnosis of all mixed hemorrhoids included in this study were performed according to&quot;TCM
      anorectal diseases treatment guidelines&quot; (2012 Edition) issued and implemented by the China
      Association of traditional Chinese Medicine .In all cases, the sub center for the unit,
      stratified by gender, age and disease.In every layer all cases were divided into 5 groups
      with random number table.Take balance check when test cases reach 80% of a predetermined
      number .If unbalanced index is larger , the following cases should be assigned according to
      the principle of the imbalance index reduction.All the cases were assigned to five groups in
      accordance with experiment design methods of random, contrast ,balance, parallel, and
      multicenter.Each sub center, each test group has 50 patients.

      All the cases involved conducted corresponding preoperative examination and evaluation,
      respectively using 5 kinds of predetermined operation after grouping.Patients are in strict
      accordance with the &quot;gynecology of traditional Chinese medicine&quot; (Second Edition) for
      perioperative treatment in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative .

      Observation indexes of this study include:General observation index,effective observation
      index,Safety observation index and severe adverse events.All the data use Excel to establish
      the data set ,analyzed by SPSS21.0.

    <description>RPH is a new therapy for hemorrhoid following the improvement of rubber band ligation. The treatment principle is: shrinkage of mucous membrane after the ligation, lift of anal cushion, the local inflammatory response resulting in adhesion of mucosa and submucosa and shallow muscle layer, anal cushion fixing to a higher position, at the same time by using the elastic contraction of automatic elastic line partly blocking blood supply of Internal hemorrhoids or reducing venous stasis, decreasing congestion hypertrophy of hemorrhoids. Simplified Milligan-Morgan is a surgical option which was improved and developed by Professor He,well-known traditional Chinese doctor from Hunan province, based on Milligan-Morgan in 1971.The operation method is simple, the operation time is shortened.</description>

    <description>According to anal cushion down theory of the formation of hemorrhoids, the Italy scholar Longo pioneered a new method for the treatment of circular prolapsed internal hemorrhoids In 1998.Its principle is resection of lower rectal mucosa and submucosa of the intestinal wall tissue in the ring above the hemorrhoids through surgical staples,anastomosis of the proximal and distal mucosa , lifting and fixing down anal cushion, recovering to the normal anatomical position.Simplified Milligan-Morgan is a surgical option which was improved and developed by Professor He,well-known traditional Chinese doctor from Hunan province, based on Milligan-Morgan in 1971.The operation method is simple, the operation time is shortened.</description>
