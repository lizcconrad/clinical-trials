      The SINNR study is a pilot, observational, open label study. It will evaluate the virologic
      efficacy (viral load &lt;50 copies/mL), safety, and immunologic response of STRIBILD
      administered for 48 weeks to HIV-infected current or recent illicit drug users.

      Approximately 30 HIV-infected current or recent illicit drug users (â‰¥19y.o.,&lt;70y.o.) from
      Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre and Regina General Hospital, University of Saskatchewan
      will be taking an oral 1 STRIBILD tablet once a day for 48 weeks.

      Additionally, adherence to STRIBILD over 48 weeks and quality of life will be measured in
      this population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is at least 19 years of age and less than 70 years of age infected with
             HIV and requiring antiretroviral therapy on medical grounds and who has acquired HIV
             infection through illicit drug use.

          2. Participant has documented resistance to NNRTIs, with the presence of one or more
             primary resistance mutations (Stanford database), on current or previous therapy.

          3. The primary care provider decides to prescribe STRIBILD.

          4. Participant has no ongoing issues that would lead to significant non-compliance with
             the study procedures even in the presence of optimal adherence support structures.

          5. Participant is able to read and write in the language of the questionnaires and give
             informed consent.

          6. Participant must not be taking any medication that could interact with STRIBILD.

          7. If female, participant must have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use, for the
             duration of the study, a method of birth control that has a history of proven
             reliability as judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has previous exposure to STRIBILD.

          2. Participant has documented resistance to any of the components of STRIBILD.

          3. Participant is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          4. Participant has a contraindication to the use of STRIBILD for any reason.

          5. Participant has active hepatitis B (HbsAg positive).

          6. Participant has any of the following abnormal laboratory test results at screening:

             Hemoglobin less than 10.0 g/dL, Absolute neutrophil count less than 750 cells/mL,
             Platelet count less than 50,000/mL, ALT or AST less than 5x Upper Limit of Normal
             (ULN), Creatinine less than 1.5 x ULN.

          7. Participant, in the opinion of the principal investigator, is unlikely to comply with
             the study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.
