  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease involving the skin, the joints and the vascular
      compartment. The mechanisms linking inflammation in the skin and joints and in the vascular
      walls are poorly understood. One hypothesis for the increase in vascular inflammation
      observed in patients with psoriasis involves circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Patients
      with psoriasis have an increase in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),
      Interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-22, IL-6 as well as a the chemokine S100A913. It is possible that
      one of those cytokines/chemokine induces vascular inflammation in the vascular compartment.
      The purpose of this cross sectional retrospective study is to highlight the correlation
      between vascular wall inflammation using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose - Positron Emission
      Tomography (FDG-PET) fluorodeoxyglucose technology and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine.

      Baseline frozen serum samples will be identified from the 107 enrolled Inno-6025 (Abbvie
      A13-935) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01722214) patients who also underwent a
      pre-adalimumab FDG-PET scan for the study. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in these
      samples will be measured; IL-17 and IL-22 using the Singulex immunoassay platform, and
      S100A9, IL-6 and TNF alpha using multiplex ELISA. Vascular inflammation will be measured as
      the target to background ratio (TBR) in the ascending aorta using PET-scan technology.
      Correlation analyses will be performed between serum levels of cytokines and a chemokine and
      vascular inflammation.
