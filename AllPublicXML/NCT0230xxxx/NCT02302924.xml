  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standardized method for evaluating the symptoms of influenza. A standardized
      instrument for measuring influenza symptoms, with appropriate scientifically derived content
      and construct validity would have value for public health in terms of use as a validated
      outcome measure in interventions to treat or prevent influenza. The instrument also could
      serve as part of an overall measure of severity of illness in influenza. Previous efforts in
      participant reported outcomes (PRO) for influenza (i.e. Flu-PRO Stage I and Stage II) focused
      on the elicitation and evaluation of items for inclusion in the instrument. The overarching
      objective of this protocol - Flu-PRO Stage III - is to conduct instrument validation to
      evaluate item properties and, if need be, reduce the number of items, and quantitatively
      validate the performance of the final measure.

      The overarching purpose of this study is to develop a single, standardized measurement scale
      of participant influenza symptoms for use in clinical studies involving adult and pediatric
      participants. The development of an instrument for participant reported outcomes of influenza
      was composed of three stages, as described below:

      Stage I. Elicitation interviews in a group of volunteers with laboratory-confirmed influenza
      to inform the development of the instrument, including its content and structure (item
      phrasing, length, response options, recall).

      Stage II. Evaluative interviews with a second set of volunteers with laboratory-confirmed
      influenza to assess comprehension and interpretability of the instrument and draft item pool
      from the respondent's perspective.

      Stage III. Item reduction and instrument validation in a third set of volunteers to evaluate
      item properties and quantitatively validate the performance of the final measure.

      This protocol will describe the rationale, design, data collection procedures, and analysis
      methods for Stage III - Item Reduction and Instrument Validation.

      After obtaining informed consent, an oral/nasal swab or wash to confirm or rule out an
      influenza etiology will be collected at baseline if the participant does not already have
      documented laboratory confirmation of influenza.

        The targeted sample population will be recruited from the United States. Participants at
        the IDCRP sites will be both male and female military health care beneficiaries age 18
        years and older presenting with the diagnosis of influenza or with influenza-like symptoms
        suggestive of infection.
