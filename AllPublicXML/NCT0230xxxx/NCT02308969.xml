  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess the neuronal correlates of alterations in waking
      consciousness pharmacologically induced by a 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)2A receptor agonist in
      healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

    <textblock>
      Functional neuroimaging may be useful in the diagnosis and characterization of early
      schizophrenia. However, little is known about how the subjectively experienced alterations in
      consciousness and perception are related with objective neuroimaging measures. The present
      study explores the association of subjective alterations and objective imaging findings and
      will inform us on the neuronal correlates of psychotic states and whether subjective
      alterations in perception translate into neuronal activation patterns that can be objectively
      measured in a brain scanner. Therefore, alterations in consciousness will be assessed in 20
      healthy subjects using a random order 2-period (normal and altered state of consciousness)
      cross-over design. Alterations in consciousness will be induced by the hallucinogenic
      5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)2A receptor agonist (5-HT2A) receptor agonist lysergic acid
      diethylamide (LSD).
