    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is the development and testing of a brief
      cross-indication instrument (screening) for use in the approval process of medical
      rehabilitation services. In addition to the empirical foundation, this generic instrument
      should have a high level of acceptance of both applicants and payers of rehabilitation
      services. Furthermore, an everyday and economic use for the routine application process for
      medical rehabilitation services at the German statutory pension insurance scheme should be
      provided. In the first study phase, a long instrument was tested with a sample of
      rehabilitees that received approval of medical rehabilitation services. This assessment
      including the measurement of rehabilitation-related somatic, psychological and social
      impairments was first tested for its psychometric properties and then reduced to a short
      instrument (screening) using quantitative methods. In the second study phase, the
      then-existing screening will be part of the application documents for medical rehabilitation
      services to assess its management properties and practicability in everyday use of the German
      statutory pension insurance scheme.
