  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid with analgesic and anti-emetic effects [1-3].
      Perioperative single-dose dexamethasone therapy has been used for several purposes: to reduce
      post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pain and sore throat. There are also some reports
      on beneficial effects of less cardiac arrhythmia, improved appetite and less edema from
      glucocorticoids. Preoperative small dose of dexamethasone was reported to prevent reversal
      laryngeal nerve injury and improve voice quality after thyroid surgery. While accepted wildly
      in clinical anesthesia practice, the immune-press related potential risks of side effects
      associated with dexamethasone, such as delayed wound healing, infection, as well as effects
      on blood sugar, make the use of perioperative single dose of glucocorticoid controversial.
      The effect of perioperative dexamethasone on wound healing varied with different types of
      surgery. The present study will observe the effect of dexamethasone on the safety of thyroid
      surgery.

      Patients who has the thyroid surgery for their thyroid cancer will be randomly allocated into
      two groups, either dexamethasone group or saline group. In the dexamethasone group, patients
      will receive 5mg dexamethasone iv right after general anesthesia induction while in the
      saline group, patients will have 1ml saline iv. The drainage fluid will be collected at 6
      hours after surgery and on every morning after operation till the drainage tube is taken out.
      The total amount of drainage fluid and blood stain area in dressing will be collected and
      calculated after the operation. The C-reaction protein is checked in drainage fluid and in
      blood after operation. Besides, the pain scores of incision pain and throat pain will be
      evaluated. Postoperative nausea and vomit will be checked as well.
