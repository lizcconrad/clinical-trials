  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib is FDA approved as a second line and beyond treatment for metastatic soft tissue
      sarcoma. There is a population of elderly and debilitated soft tissue sarcoma patients that
      are not fit for standard first line chemotherapy that is doxorubicin based. As pazopanib is
      well tolerated with minimal side effects, the investigators propose a phase II study to
      evaluate pazopanib as a first-line agent in patients with non-resectable or metastatic
      disease who are not candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy.

CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may affect absorption of
             pazopanib, including (but not limited to) malabsorption syndrome or major resection of

          -  Known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that
             increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. Note: lesions infiltrating major pulmonary
             vessels (contiguous tumor and vessels) are excluded; however, the presence of a tumor
             that is touching but not infiltrating (abutting) the vessels is acceptable (CT with
             contrast is strongly recommended to evaluate such lesions). Large protruding
             endobronchial lesions in the mail or lobar bronchi are excluded; however,
             endobronchial lesions in the segmented bronchi are allowed. Lesions extensively
             infiltrating the main or lobar bronchi are excluded; however, minor infiltrations in
             the wall of thee bronchi are allowed.

          -  Recent hemoptysis (≥ ½ teaspoon of red blood within 8 weeks before first dose of
             pazopanib).

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
