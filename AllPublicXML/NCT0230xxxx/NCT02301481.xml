  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized phase II study is designed to evaluate weather neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy is superior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with both followed by surgery and
      postoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.

    <measure>Pathological response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological response were classiﬁed into three grades.Grade I signiﬁes that there is little shrinkage in the tumor; only mild regression in the tumor cells is observed under themicroscope. Grade II shows gross reduction in size of the tumor and marked regression in the cancer cells microscopically, yet viable nests of cancer tissue are still visible. Grade III implies complete or almost total resolution of the tumor on exploration, and disappearance of the tumor tissue microscopically; only remnants of degenerated cancer cells can be seen (so-called ghost cancer cells).</description>
