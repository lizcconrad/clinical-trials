  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In North America, the number of new cases of prostate cancer increases every year. Many
      efforts have been made to develop more efficient and safer curative treatments for high risk
      prostate cancer patients.

      This phase III clinical trial is designed to compare the safety of a standard pelvic external
      beam radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with a high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) boost
      (direct insertion of radiation source over a period of minutes via flexible needles
      temporarily inserted in the prostate) to a shorter course of hypofractionated dose escalation
      radiotherapy (larger radiation dose per daily treatment) in patients with high risk prostate
      cancer.

      The investigators plan to recruit 296 patients across Quebec who will be randomized in either
      treatment plan.

      In North America, the number of new cases of prostate cancer increases every year. To this
      day, the standard curative treatment for high risk prostate cancer patients is external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with hormonal manipulation (Luteinizing hormone-releasing
      hormone LHRH agonists such as Eligard) to lower levels of testosterone to slow down or even
      stop the growth of prostate cancer. It has been recently demonstrated that combination of
      high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) boost (direct insertion of radiation source in the
      prostate for killing the tumor) to EBRT could be an effective treatment for prostate cancer
      patients. On the other hand, other recent studies have suggested that dose escalation and
      hypofractionated radiation delivery (larger radiation dose per daily treatment) can be more
      efficient than standard fractionation in prostate cancer patients.

      This phase III clinical trial is designed to compare the safety of a conventional pelvic EBRT
      combined with a HDRB boost (i.e. 46 Gy in 23 fractions followed by a 15-Gy HDRB boost) to a
      shorter course of hypofractionated dose escalation radiotherapy (i.e. 68 Gy in 25 fractions)
      in patients with high risk prostate cancer. The patients will be randomized to either of the
      two different courses of treatment. All the patients will be also treated with hormonal
      therapy for a total duration of 28 months (2 months before radiation therapy (RT), 2 months
      during RT and for 24 months after RT). The patients will undergo different test before the
      treatment, such as bone scan, blood test, CT scan and bone density. The patient's follow-up
      will be the first month after start of RT, every 4 months for the first 2 years, then every 6
      months the third year and then annually for 10 years. On every visit, the patient will
      undergo digital rectal examination (DRE) as well as evaluation of testosterone and prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) levels.

      The safety of the new course of radiation therapy will be evaluated by the acute (at and
      before 90 days) and delayed toxicities (at 90 days, at 180 days and after) measured by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4). We will also determine Biochemical
      Failure Free Survival, Distant Metastasis Free Survival, Disease Specific Survival, Overall
      Survival and the Health-related Quality of Life using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index
      Composite (EPIC). We will also monitor the development of gastrointestinal and genitourinary
      toxicities and establish the predictive value of PTEN deletion and TMPRSS2ETS fusion (genetic
      markers to predict the nature and progression of prostate tumors).

      This study will be conducted through the Genitourinary Radiation Oncology Group of Quebec
      (GROUQ) in 12 selected radiation oncology centers. We plan to recruit 296 patients across
      Quebec and the recruitment should be completed within 24 months of activation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate diagnosed within 6 months
             prior to randomization, (if longer than 6 months, needs to be approved by the PI).

          -  Clinical stage including at least one of the following: T3 or T4, Gleason Score &gt; 8,
             and/ or Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &gt; 20 (ng/ml or μg/L).

          -  Pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes must be negative on CT scan or MRI of the abdomen
             and pelvis performed within 12 (recommended time limit, may exceed in certain cases)
             weeks prior to randomization. For patients who have started androgen suppression prior
             to randomization, CT or MRI may be done after start of therapy, provided it is done no
             more than 28 days following start of androgen suppression therapy (any lymph node
             appearing &gt; 1.5 cm on CT or MRI must be histologically negative by either needle
             aspirate or lymph node dissection performed within 12 weeks prior to randomization).

          -  Investigations, including chest x-ray (CXR is recommended and not mandatory) CT scan
             and bone scan (with radiographs of suspicious areas) have been performed within 12
             weeks (recommended time limit) prior to randomization and are negative for metastases.
             For patients who have started androgen suppression prior to randomization, bone scan
             may be done up to and including 28 days after the commencement of therapy.

          -  Patients will have had a PSA test done at the time of diagnosis. This PSA test could
             be repeated within 28 days prior to randomization. The PSA value used to confirm high
             risk disease and the value to be entered on the eligibility checklist must be the
             higher of these two values. These criteria will be the same regardless of whether or
             not the patient has initiated hormone therapy prior to randomization.

          -  The patient may have received prior androgen suppression therapy provided that
             androgen suppression therapy commenced no more than 28 days prior to randomization.

          -  The patient must not have received any cytotoxic anticancer therapy for prostate
             cancer prior to randomization. Patients may have received treatment with a
             5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (e.g. Finasteride) for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH),
             which must have been discontinued prior to the randomization.

          -  ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.

          -  Hematology and Biochemistry: Laboratory requirements have been done within 28-42 days

             platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L, serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: non-melanoma skin cancer; or
             other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for &gt; 5 years.

          -  The presence of small-cell or transitional-cell carcinoma in the biopsy specimen.

          -  Patients who had previous chemotherapy for carcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Patients who had prior surgical treatment for carcinoma of the prostate apart from
             trans-urethral resection, including bilateral orchiectomy.

          -  Patients with any contraindication to pelvic radiotherapy: including, but not limited
             to, previous pelvic radiotherapy. Inflammatory bowel disease (at the discretion of the
             treating oncologist) or severe bladder irritability.

          -  Patients with serious non malignant disease resulting in a life expectancy less than 3
             years.

          -  Other serious illness, psychiatric or medical condition that would not permit the
             patient to be managed according to the protocol including active uncontrolled
             infection and significant cardiac dysfunction. Patients with medical conditions that
             would contraindicate the treatment regimen outlined in the protocol [e.g. intake of
             study drugs].

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any protocol-indicated study medications.

          -  Presence of bilateral hip replacement prostheses.

          -  Patients with history of severe congestive heart failure will not be eligible.

          -  Patients with congenital long QT syndrome or patients taking Class IA, Class III or
             Class IC anti-arrhythmic medications will require a cardiologist's evaluation prior to
             eligibility assessment. Patients with cardiovascular diseases can be included as long
             as the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risk of
             cardiovascular events.
