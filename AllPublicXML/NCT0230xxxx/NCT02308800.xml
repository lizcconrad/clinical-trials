    <textblock>
      The investigators plan a randomized clinical trial of 150 patients with infected
      diabetes-related lower extremity wounds to compare the clinical and economic effectiveness of
      negative pressure wound therapy with continuous irrigation and negative pressure wound
      therapy without irrigation.

      The investigators will enroll 150 patients from two centers: The University of Texas
      Southwestern University Hospital and Parkland Hospital. The investigators will screen and
      enroll patients with wounds in the inpatient setting. Patients will randomized to receive
      traditional NPWT or NPWT with continuous irrigation while they are hospitalized. The average
      hospitalization for patents that receive NPWT is 13.3 days. Patients that do not have their
      wound surgically closed during hospitalization will be discharged with negative pressure
      wound therapy without irrigation for up to a total of four weeks of therapy. After discharge
      from the hospital, subjects will be seen twice weekly by home health, and the investigators
      will evaluate subjects in clinic every 7 days (±7 days) for a total of 16-week period or
      until the wound heals.

      Screening Procedures

        -  Review and sign the Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization

        -  The study doctor will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria

        -  Demographics (such as age, gender, race or ethnicity)

        -  Sitting blood pressure and pulse at admission

        -  Collection of Height and weight at admission

        -  Collection of the medical and surgical history

        -  Collection of the history of the wound

        -  Wound assessment(s) - wound etiology, wound history, location of study wound and
           infection assessment

        -  Hyperspectral imaging within 30 days of screening

        -  Vascular/Neurological evaluation - we will do various tests and measurements to assess
           the sensation (feeling) and circulation (blood flow) in the subject's feet and lower
           legs. To assess the sensation, we will do a monofilament sensory test and a vibration
           threshold perception test on the study foot. We will calculate the neuropathy disability
           score of both feet. To assess circulation, we will record Skin Perfusion Pressures in
           the study foot using a Sensilase System (Vasamed, Eden Prairie, MN) within 30 days of
           screening. We will calculate the ankle brachial index (ABI) at screening and collect
           available arterial doppler data from the medical record within 6 months of screening.
           None of these tests are invasive (using needles), uncomfortable or have risks greater
           than standard care.

        -  Results of standard-of-care laboratory tests including a white blood cell count, blood
           chemistry (tests to see how well organs, such as the liver and kidneys are working),
           glycated hemoglobin, albumin, prealbumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive
           protein and blood glucose. Results of a serum pregnancy test (standard care for women of
           child-bearing potential as part of pre-op labs) will also be collected. Collection of a
           list of the subject's current antibiotics

        -  We will provide the SF-36 Questionnaire and other patient-reported outcomes
           questionnaires and collect them while subjects are inpatient.

      This visit will last about 2 hours.

      If you qualify for the study, you will participate in the following procedures:

      Group Assignment

      If the researchers believe the subject can take part in this study, s/he will be assigned
      randomly (like a flip of a coin) to receive one of the following therapies:

        -  Negative Pressure Wound Therapy with Irrigation

        -  Negative Pressure Wound Therapy without Irrigation

      The group is assigned randomly (like flipping a coin). The sponsor or researchers do not know
      in advance what group assignment each subject will receive. Neither the subject nor the
      researchers will be allowed to choose which group s/he is assigned to.

      Study Intervention

      The subject will receive either:

        -  Quantum™+Simultaneous Irrigation (NPWTi) - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy with
           Prontosan®, or

        -  Quantum™(NPWT) -Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (without Prontosan®)

      Assigned therapy will continue in the hospital until the physician determines that the wound
      is ready for closure. If the subject's wound is healing, study therapy will be discontinued
      and standard dressings will be applied. If surgical closure is needed, the subject will
      return to the Operating Room for a procedure to close the wound.

      If the wound is not ready for closure during the hospital stay, subjects will continue NPWT
      at home. NPWT at home will be without irrigation.

      Procedures and Evaluations during the Research The study therapy will only be given while the
      subject is in the hospital. If the subject's wound is not ready for closure during the
      hospital stay, the subject will continue NPWT at home. NPWT at home will be without
      irrigation. Once the therapy is stopped s/he will continue to be followed by the study
      doctor. After the subject is released from the hospital s/he will need to see the study
      doctor during regular post-operative visits. The study doctor will continue to check the
      wound. If the wound closes, s/he will see the study doctor 30 days later to have the closed
      wound checked.

      Day of First Surgery:

        -  3D images after the surgery with eKare Insight device

        -  Tissue and bone samples - the doctor will take 2 small samples of tissue from the
           subject's wound before debridement (removal of dead or unhealthy tissue), and after
           debridement (clean margins) and 1 sample of bone before debridement in case of bone
           infection, and these tissue samples will be kept and tested for the amount and type of
           bacteria that are present (qPCR analysis/laboratory analysis).

        -  Wound measurements after the surgery

        -  The study doctor will decide if the subject still qualifies to be in the study

        -  Randomization (like flipping a coin) to either Quantum™ NPWT with Irrigation or Quantum™
           NPWT without Irrigation

        -  Placement of therapy on the wound

        -  Collection of current antibiotics

        -  Collection of adverse event information

      Daily Treatments (while in the hospital):

        -  Collection of current antibiotics

        -  Collection of adverse event information

      This will take about 15 minutes.

      Additional Surgery (if needed to remove dead tissue or to close the wound):

        -  Tissue sample - the doctor will take 2 small samples of tissue from the subject's wound
           after debridement (clean margin), and these tissue samples will be kept and tested for
           the amount and type of bacteria that are present (qPCR analysis/laboratory analysis)

        -  3D images of the wound after the surgery/debridement at bedside with eKare Insight
           device if the wound is still open

        -  Wound measurements after the surgery/debridement at bedside

        -  Wound closure or placement of therapy on the wound

        -  Collect current antibiotics

        -  Collect adverse event information

      If the subject's wound is not closed upon hospital discharge, NPWT will continue at home
      without irrigation.

      Home Health Visits If the subject continues to receive NPWT after hospital discharge, the
      subject will be seen twice weekly by a home health nurse for dressing changes. The home
      health nurse will collect sitting blood pressure and pulse rate. Amount, type and character
      of drainage will be documented, as well as any adverse events and changes to concomitant
      medications. Offloading will be reapplied after dressing changes.

      Follow-Up Visits per standard of care (after therapy has stopped):

        -  Dressing change / removal / Offloading

        -  Wound measurements and infection assessment

        -  Results of standard-of-care laboratory tests including a white blood cell count, blood
           chemistry (tests to see how well organs, such as the liver and kidneys are working),
           glycated hemoglobin, albumin, prealbumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive
           protein and blood glucose.

        -  3D image of the wound with eKare device (if indicated, if the wound is still open)

        -  Collection of current antibiotics

        -  Collection of adverse event information

      These visits will take about 30 minutes.

      End of Study - Wound Closure Follow-up Visit (30 days +/-7 days after your wound closes, if
      it closes within 12 weeks from Day of first surgery) or Week 16:

        -  Closed wound assessment

        -  For subjects whose wound has not closed:

           3D images of the wound with eKare device Return to standard care

        -  Collection of current antibiotics

        -  Collection of adverse event information

        -  SF-36 Questionnaire and other patient-reported outcomes questionnaires

      This visit will take about 30 minutes.
