    <textblock>
      This study attempts to clarify the pathophysiology of haemostasis and haematopoiesis in
      relation to the evidence of sepsis in liver disease, and compares the accuracy of various
      available laboratory tests in assessment of these patients. Further research is needed for
      proper understanding of the influence of sepsis on coagulation disorders in ACLF (Acute on
      Chronic Liver Failure) patients in particular, to correctly identify the type and optimal
      quantity of blood product requirement in at risk patients.

      Thromboelastography (TEG) /Sonoclot have been proposed as a superior tool to rapidly diagnose
      and help guide resuscitation with blood products. Secondly, the study of derangement in
      coagulopathy after the onset of sepsis is of paramount importance because of increased
      mortality after the onset of sepsis. In the present study, patients with ACLF (Acute on
      Chronic Liver Failure) without evidence of sepsis on admission will be included in the study
      cohort, and will undergo a baseline diagnostic workup as described. They will be followed for
      development of any signs of infection after hospitalization. Then the effect of sepsis on
      their coagulation and haematopoietic cellular responses will be assessed. Thus the effect of
      sepsis on the progression and outcome of patients with ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver Failure)
      will be studied.
