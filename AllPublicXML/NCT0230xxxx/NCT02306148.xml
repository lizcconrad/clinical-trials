  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the effects of a training protocol for the
      foot and ankle complex on the prevalence of running related injuries on long distance
      runners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a web software as a follow up tool, subjects can be scanned for injuries and have them
      confirmed by a physician, determining the injuries prevalence in one year.

      Through force platform and infrared cameras, the kinematics and kinetics during gait will
      allow assessment of joint moments, power during propulsion, ankle and knee range of motion.

      The hypothesis is that a strengthening program for foot and ankle muscles can alter the
      prevalence of lower limbs injuries on long distance runners, lowering the harmful forces that
      these segments receive. The participants will be randomly assigned into control group
      (placebo intervention) or into intervention group, that will receive an 8 weeks strengthening
      intervention, twice a week with the supervision of a physiotherapist and three times a week
      being remotely supervised by a software at home, for 30 minutes each session. This will aim
      for increasing foot and ankle range of movement and muscle strength.

      Every exercise has its own progression depending on the subjects execution, increasing in
      intensity and difficulty.
