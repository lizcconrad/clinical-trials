  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is the prospective data collection of a new device used for
      trochanteric fractures of the femur. It should be answered how the newly developed implant
      called Trochanteric Fixation Nailing with anti-rotation feature (TFNA) is performing
      clinically and radiological in terms of intra- and postoperative complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In comparison to previous implants, the TFNA has been improved substantially. Therefore the
      purpose of this focused registry is to investigate how the newly developed implant called
      Trochanteric Fixation Nailing with anti-rotation feature (TFNA) is performing clinically and
      radiologically in terms of surgical technique, intra- and postoperative complications and
      short term outcome.

      All investigated procedures are part of the standard of care treatment. Only the parker
      mobility score is study-specific. All patients included are followed up from the time point
      of enrollment until three months after surgery.
