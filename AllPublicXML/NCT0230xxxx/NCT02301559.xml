  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea is the result of hypercontractility and uterine vascular ischemia is the
      most common gynecologic complaints in young women. According to the intensity of symptoms may
      impair daily living, work and leisure activities. Pilates brings the concept of moving the
      body for the recovery, maintenance and promotion of health through exercises that stimulate
      circulation, improving physical conditioning, flexibility and proper postural alignment, and
      promote improvement in the levels of body awareness, coordination and muscle control. In this
      sense, the objective is to investigate the effects of pilates in the symptomatology of
      primary dysmenorrhea. This is a study to be developed with students of Physical Therapy from
      the State University of Piauí-UESPI presenting with primary dysmenorrhea compatible clinical
      picture. A questionnaire will be used for research. The students with the framework of
      dysmenorrhea that meet the inclusion criteria will be assessed for anthropometric parameters,
      pain, flexibility, indirect assessment of contraction of transversus abdominis and quality of
      life before and after the treatment protocol using the pilates method, often 3 weekly
      meetings, totaling 20 sessions.
