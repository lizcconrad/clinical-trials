  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial network clinical study will be an inception cohort study in children with new
      onset IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) rigorously phenotyped and prospectively followed.
      Focusing on a prospective, inception cohort of Canadian children of widely varied racial
      origins provides a unique opportunity to explore environmental risk factors early in life and
      close in time to disease onset, their influence on the host microbiome, and in the context of
      genetic susceptibility. In keeping with current treatment targets, assessed outcomes will
      include not only symptom resolution and growth, but also intestinal healing. Anticipated
      variation between network sites in choices of evidence-based therapies, even among
      phenotypically similar sub-types of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, will allow
      comparisons outcomes with disparate treatments, aiming to identify best practice and to
      institute processes for continual improvement in care nationally.

      The National Coordinating Centre has established and maintains an encrypted Network Website
      that will serve as the central portal for all Network communication and data transfer. All
      data related to the Network is stored within a single secure data repository facility which
      incorporates a state-of-the-art bio-repository sample tracking system, as well as facility
      for the secure and rapid transmission of very large data files across the network. The
      National Coordinating Centre is responsible for data-integrity and completeness and ensures
      accountability by sites for full and timely data completeness.

      The National Coordinating Centre has developed and supports systems for collecting and
      recording data and encourages 'real-time' data abstraction and direct data entry. The Network
      is utilizing the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) application as its primary
      data-collection platform. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data
      capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry;
      2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export
      procedures for seamless data download to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for
      importing data from external sources.

      Within the data collection platform, numerous 'real-time' and 'post hoc' data check
      procedures will be implemented. Statistics concerning 'data-integrity' will be reported to
      the Executive Committee on a regular and frequent basis. The National Coordinating Centre
      will conduct site-specific staff training at the initiation of the study, when new staff are
      employed, and when any new tools or significant study procedures are added to the protocol.
      Site-monitoring visits will occur following start-up and at least annually for all sites to
      ensure adherence to the protocols, and Good Clinical Practice and other applicable regulatory
      requirements. Site visits will be performed by the Network's Study Manager.

      The Network is utilizing the secure data repository facility hosted by the SickKids Research
      Institute's Department of IT (Information Technology). This unit, managed by the Director of
      Research Information Technology, and complies with all current regulatory and Good Clinical
      Practice mandates regarding security, identification and segregation of data.

      The Network's success will be as much dependent on its ability to re-distribute data, as its
      ability to efficiently and accurately collect it. In order to achieve the Network's goals
      related to improving care and informing clinical practice, it is imperative that the
      Network's raw data set can be rapidly re-formatted and re-presented to first inform and then
      report on (patient focused) clinical and quality indicators at both site and network levels.
      As such, systems for data distribution are being developed that allow feedback to
      participating sites via the Network's Web-portal regarding clinical demographics and care at
      Network, Site, and Subject level.

      The Network is utilizing the &quot;Inflammatory Bowel Disease Biobank&quot; already established at the
      Hospital for Sick Children, that currently holds biological samples from over 1100 individual
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients including DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (Ribonucleic
      acid), stool and biopsy samples. This Biobank already successfully collects, processes and
      stores prevalent patient DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) samples and tissue from many Canadian
      network sites in conjunction with the NEOPICS (interNational Early Onset Paediatric
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study) consortium's efforts to understand the genetic basis
      of very early onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease (www.NEOPICS.org;).

      The study utilizes the electronic subject and sample identification methodology which has
      already been developed, tested, and implemented at the &quot;Inflammatory Bowel Disease Biobank&quot;
      by the National Coordinating Centre Director. In the first instance, all study subjects are
      assigned a unique Participation Identifier that is site specific. The &quot;Subject ID&quot; is a
      combination of the Study ID (2 letters), a site identifier (2 digits), and a serial accession
      number (3 digits). Each site assigns their site-specific subject IDs in a sequential fashion
      as participants are enrolled.

      Samples may be stored indefinitely so that, as additional genes, biomarkers, and microbes are
      discovered, their role in intestinal disease can be assessed. The importance of these samples
      increase over time as outcomes of intestinal disease and treatment may be tracked. As
      required in future, research studies proposing to use biobank data and/or samples will be
      submitted to a study committee and the REB (Research Ethics Board) for approval.

      Participants will be advised during the consent process that, as with any research study,
      they may withdraw at any time by informing a study team member verbally or in writing. A
      withdrawal request may be for all stored samples to be withdrawn, or it may be a request for
      no additional samples to be collected (though already stored specimens may be retained).
      Should either event occur, the study team member will immediately notify the coordinator of
      the nature of the withdrawal request. A note will be added to the study file recording the
      participant's decision to withdraw and, if requested, his/her sample(s) will be destroyed. In
      cases where the participant chooses to have his/her stored sample(s) destroyed, the consent
      form will be marked &quot;withdrawn&quot;, a copy offered to the participant, and the original consent
      retained on file at SickKids.

      Sample Size and Power Considerations The study's sample size is arbitrarily fixed given the
      national incidence rate, duration of recruitment, and selection of participating sites. Based
      on reported inception case numbers, and likely engagement success, we anticipate recruiting
      approximately 400 to 500 patients per year. Thus 1,200 to 1,500 subjects will have at least
      18 months of follow-up data within the 5 year grant period. By the end of year 4 we would
      anticipate between 800 and 1000 subjects have 18-month outcomes, reducing to 400 or 500 by
      the 3 year mark. The primary analysis, within each of the described strata will be a test of
      proportions, presented as a Relative Risk. Current figures would suggest 60% of the study
      cohort will have Crohn's disease (CD), and of those 20% L1, 20% L2, 50% L3, and 10% isolated
      L4b. Approximately 20% of CD patients are exposed to anti-TNF within 12 months. Information
      from ongoing studies suggest at least 60% of patients are in a sustained clinical remission
      by 12 months. The minimum RR (effect size) we will be able to demonstrate in any analysis
      based on the network cohort, and the confidence (power) we can have in that estimation, will
      depend on the number of exposed subjects (cases) within the strata of interest and the
      anticipated outcome frequency in the unexposed subjects.

      Environmental Exposure Assessment We are systematically assessing environmental factors that
      have previously been associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the literature and factors
      that are hypothesized to be associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease based on knowledge of
      pathophysiology. All patients will complete the comprehensive questionnaire around the time
      of diagnosis, and a modified questionnaire at 6 months, 12 months and then annually. The
      questionnaires will be internet-based and completed by the patient with parental assistance
      either at home or in the clinic.

      The development of the environmental questionnaires will be based on the NIH-funded (National
      Institute of Health) PhenX toolkit. The PhenX toolkit has several key advantages: 1) it
      allows for standardized comparison across studies; 2) its wide selection of environmental
      risk factors spanning over 20 research domains; 3) each exposure was developed through
      consensus by experts in the field; 4) variables are high quality, well established, and
      validated; and 5) PhenX toolkit is free and publicly available, which will allow other
      centers to replicate our findings. We are utilizing the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method
      (RAND Corporation/University of California Los Angeles) to modify questions in the PhenX
      toolkit, so that our environmental questionnaire is specific for children with Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease. A group of experts in pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease and environmental
      exposure assessment are taking an evidence-based iterative approach to evaluate the PhenX
      toolkit to determine the appropriateness of environmental exposures and to define the
      specific questions for children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

      Dietary Exposure Assessment We are using a combination of quantitative dietary assessment
      utilizing the food frequency questionnaire, FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire), (modified for
      the age of population studied) and a qualitative dietary assessment using the modified
      Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEIC-2009). This approach allows us to test the hypothesis
      that high caloric intake from processed and prepared foods with low glycemic index and high
      fat content have a facilitative effect on the development of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
      Moreover, it allows us to examine diet-diet interactions, diet-gene interactions, and
      diet-microbiome interactions.

      We will assess the effect of environmental exposures on the following outcomes: type,
      location and extent of disease at diagnosis (2); disease severity at diagnosis, and
      subsequent clinical disease course. Disease course will be followed and ultimately classified
      as 'severe', 'indolent', 'continuous sustained clinical remission'. Time to sentinel events
      (such as surgery, commencement of anti-TNF therapy (anti-tumour necrosis factor), development
      of complicating disease behaviour) will also be recorded. We will examine the univariate
      effect of the listed environmental exposures including breastfeeding, antibiotic use, and
      passive smoking exposure on both the baseline phenotype and the subsequent disease course
      strata. Logistic regression models will be constructed to evaluate the potential effect of
      ethnicity (eg. South Asian versus Caucasian) after adjusting for environmental exposures. CD
      (Crohn's Disease) and UC (Ulcerative Colitis) will be studied separately. Risk estimates will
      be expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. For sentinel events within 18
      months of diagnosis we will apply semiparametric and nonparametric methods of survival
      analysis, including Cox regression models, to assess firstly the effect of various
      environmental factors stratified by ethnicity, as well as the association of race/ancestry
      after adjusting for environmental risk factors. The potential effect modification of South
      Asian ancestry on Inflammatory Bowel Disease prognosis will be formally assessed. Finally, a
      paired comparison will be attempted examining the effect of a change in exposure status on
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease disease course.

      FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) content validity and reproducibility will be assessed
      using Pearson correlation coefficients for normally distributed data and Spearman rank
      correlation coefficients where the data are not normally distributed. Caloric intake, dietary
      quality and specific dietary components such as fats/specific fatty acids, sugars, vitamin D
      and antioxidants will be divided into age and gender-specific quartiles from the distribution
      across Inflammatory Bowel Disease cases, based on phenotype (Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's
      Disease) and disease severity (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI).) Logistic regression models will be
      developed, adjusting for age at recruitment, gender, ethnicity and additional environmental
      exposures (mutually adjusted for in analyses but updated in accordance with the additional
      data obtained through review of environmental exposure e.g. smoking status, appendectomy,
      tonsillectomy, usage of oral contraceptives, antibiotic use). Risk estimates will be
      expressed as odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for Crohn's
      Disease and Ulcerative Colitis separately, as well as for Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      combined.

      The National Coordinating Centre Team and Organizational Structure The Network's National
      Coordinating Centre is housed at The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto. It's
      core staff consists of its Director, the Network's Project Manager, a Research Co-ordinator
      and an administrative general assistant, along with the Bio-Repository's Laboratory Manager
      and Assistant. The network is supported by a suitably qualified and experienced
      Administrative Coordinator. Information Technology infrastructure and support will be
      provided by the SickKids Research Institute's Research IT Department. Additional 'ad-hoc'
      resources related to IT development/support, legal counsel, bio-statistical assistance will
      be available to the centre as required via the resources of the SickKids Research Institute.

      NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE The strategic planning and operations of the
      network (including protocol development, finances, development of partnerships) will be
      overseen by the Network Management Committee. The Network Management Committee will give
      direction and oversight to the Clinical Site Directors. Based on lessons learned from other
      networks, teleconferences involving site clinical directors and research coordinators will be
      held regularly (q 2 weekly) to review progress and data. All clinical site directors are
      included as co-applicants (if not principal applicants) on the grant, and will be
      individually engaged in working groups. The Director of the National Coordinating Centre will
      report directly to the Network's Executive Steering Committee, and is responsible for
      overseeing all functions of the National Coordinating Centre. National Coordinating Centre
      functions will be informed by the Network's Phenotyping Committee, Ancillary Studies/Data
      Access Committee, and IT Innovations Committee. The Ethics committee will ensure that Ethical
      standards are met. The Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (S/TAC) includes Network PIs
      with biomedical, population health and health services research expertise. These will be
      responsible for development of, respectively, standard operating procedures for biologic
      specimen handling and storage, design and approval of translational research initiatives;
      environmental questionnaires and establishment of linkage to provincial administrative
      databases. The Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee in conjunction with the Network
      Management Committee will develop Terms of Agreement for use of biospecimens and data for
      ancillary research, and for publications. The Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee will
      meet twice yearly with the Network Management Committee.
