  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change from baseline in the erectile
      function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) scores in patients
      receiving 4 weekly treatments of shockwave therapy versus those receiving a sham treatment.
      The change will be evaluated at 3 months after the end of a sequence of 4 weekly treatments.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To evaluate erectile function (EF) categorical improvement in patients receiving 4 weekly
      treatments of shockwave therapy versus those receiving a sham treatment, at 3 months after a
      first sequence of treatment.

      B. To compare improvements in erectile function between 4 weeks of phosphodiesterase type 5
      inhibitor (PDE5i) use and 4 weekly treatments of shockwave therapy (&quot;within patient&quot; effect).

      C. To compare improvements in erectile function between 4 weeks of PDE5 inhibitor use and 4
      weekly treatments of sham shock wave therapy (&quot;within patient&quot; effect).

      D. To evaluate the effect of a 2nd sequence of 4-8 weekly shock wave treatments 3 months
      after this second sequence.

      E. To evaluate treatment effects (the same comparisons as in objectives A, B, C, D) on other
      validated measure of EF (question 2 of the sexual encounter profile (SEP2), question 3 of the
      sexual encounter profile (SEP3), Global Assessment Question (GAQ), Erection Hardness Scale
      (EHS)), and the remaining domains of the IIEF score (orgasmic function, sexual desire,
      intercourse satisfaction, overall satisfaction), as well as the total IIEF score.

      F. To evaluate treatment tolerance and potential adverse events. G. To compare changes in EF
      measures over time for a follow-up period of 12 months following the second sequence of 4
      weekly shock wave treatments.

      H. To compare the effect of a sequence of 4 weekly shock wave treatments versus 8 biweekly
      shock wave treatments 3 months after the treatment (&quot;within patient&quot; effect).

             month during this period

             treatment for an additional month.

          -  Patient is available for a follow up of 19 months (at time of pre-inclusion and then
             17 months at time of inclusion)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is participating in another interventional study

          -  Within the past three months, the patient has participated in another interventional
             study

          -  Untreated testosterone deficiency

          -  Neurological disease affecting the central nervous system

          -  Untreated psychiatric disease, or psychiatric disease that may compromise study
             participation

          -  Anatomical malformation of the penis considered by the investigator as being able to
             prevent vaginal penetration

          -  Chronic haematological pathology associated with risk of haemorrhage

          -  Oral or injectable antiandrogen treatment

          -  The patient is taking blood thinners AND/OR has an International Normalized Ratio &gt;3

          -  Known allergy to treatments used in the study (e.g. Cialis, gel)

        Exclusion criteria: The patient has contraindications for Cialis as mentioned in the SPC,
        re-given here :

          -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section
             6.1 of the SPC.

          -  In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of
             nitrates. This is thought to result from the combined effects of nitrates and
             tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. Therefore, administration of CIALIS to
             patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated. (see section
             4.5 of the SPC).

          -  CIALIS, must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is
             inadvisable. Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity
             in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

          -  The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in
             clinical trials and the use of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:

          -  patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,

          -  patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,

          -  patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last
             6 months,

          -  patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (&lt; 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled

          -  uncontrolled hypertension,

          -  patients with a stroke within the last 6 months.

          -  CIALIS is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of
             non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this
             episode was in connection or not with previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section
             4.4 of the SPC).
