  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Lactitol and Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus
      Biphidus) administered orally is an effective strategy of intestinal decolonization of
      Enterobacter produced OXA-48-type carbapenemase.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Lactitol and Probiotics for
      the intestinal decolonization of people who carried Klebsiella pneumoniae produced
      OXA-48-type Carbapenemase.
