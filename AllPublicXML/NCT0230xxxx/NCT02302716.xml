    <measure>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ITSQ is a validated instrument containing 22 items that assess treatment satisfaction for participants with diabetes and on insulin. Items divided into 5 domains of satisfaction: Inconvenience of Regimen [(IR) 5 items: domain scores range (DSR) 5-35], Lifestyle Flexibility [(LF) 3 items: DSR 3-21], Glycemic Control [(GC) 3 items: DSR 3-21], Hypoglycemic Control [(HC) 5 items: DSR 5-35], Insulin Delivery Device [(IDD) 6 items: DSR 6-42]. All items measured on a 7-point scale: 1 (no bother at all) to 7 (a tremendous bother), with lower scores reflecting better outcomes. ITSQ Total Overall Raw Scores range from 22-154. Both raw domain and overall scores are transformed on a scale of 0-100, where transformed score=100*[(7-mean raw score)/6]. Higher scores indicate better treatment satisfaction. LS means was determined by MMRM with baseline of response, baseline HbA1c, country, sulfonylurea use, basal insulin status at study entry, visit, treatment and visit*treatment in the model.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Hypoglycemic Events Adjusted Per 1 Year</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Endpoint [up to 24 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of hypoglycemic events were analyzed at baseline, titration, maintenance, and overall study periods and at endpoint using the Wilcoxon test. In addition, a negative binomial model was used as a sensitivity analysis. A hypoglycemic event is defined as any time a participant has a blood glucose (BG) level of ≤70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) even if the event was not associated with signs, symptoms, or treatment consistent with current guidelines (American Diabetes Association 2005). Nocturnal hypoglycemia is defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurs between bedtime and waking. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as a hypoglycemic event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagons, or other resuscitative actions. Severe Hypoglycemic events may or may not have a reported BG ≤70 mg/dL. These events may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hypoglycemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint [up to 24 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants (with at least 1 hypoglycemic event (total, severe, nocturnal, and others) or incidence during the study was analyzed using Fisher's exact test. A hypoglycemic event is defined as any time a participant has a blood glucose (BG) level of ≤70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) even if the event was not associated with signs, symptoms, or treatment consistent with current guidelines (American Diabetes Association 2005). Nocturnal hypoglycemia is defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurs between bedtime and waking. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as a hypoglycemic event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagons, or other resuscitative actions. Severe Hypoglycemic events may or may not have a reported BG ≤70 mg/dL. These events may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma.</description>

          <description>Insulin naive participants started on 10 units (U) LY2963016 given subcutaneously (SC) once a day (QD) for 24 weeks. Participants entering the study on LANTUS®, insulin detemir or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) QD were started at the same dose SC. Participants entering on insulin detemir or NPH twice a day (BID) were started at 80% of the total daily dose SC. Participants-driven titration was followed to include the addition of 1 U/day until the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level reaches ≤100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). Participants were allowed to continue oral antihyperglycemic medication (OAM).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</title>
        <description>HbA1c is the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A. HbA1c is measured primarily to identify average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time.
Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with baseline of response, treatment (LY2963016, LANTUS), pooled country, basal insulin at entry (yes/no), sulfonylurea (SU) use (yes/no), visit, treatment and visit*treatment in the model.</description>

        <description>Fasting blood glucose (FBG) is a test to determine how much glucose (sugar) is in a blood sample after an overnight fast. Intra-Participant FBG variability was calculated based on the standard deviation (SD) of the morning pre-meal BG value. Least Squares (LS) means was determined by mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) methodology with baseline HbA1c, country, sulfonylurea use, basal insulin status at study entry, visit, treatment and visit*treatment in the model.</description>

        <title>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) Score</title>
        <description>ITSQ is a validated instrument containing 22 items that assess treatment satisfaction for participants with diabetes and on insulin. Items divided into 5 domains of satisfaction: Inconvenience of Regimen [(IR) 5 items: domain scores range (DSR) 5-35], Lifestyle Flexibility [(LF) 3 items: DSR 3-21], Glycemic Control [(GC) 3 items: DSR 3-21], Hypoglycemic Control [(HC) 5 items: DSR 5-35], Insulin Delivery Device [(IDD) 6 items: DSR 6-42]. All items measured on a 7-point scale: 1 (no bother at all) to 7 (a tremendous bother), with lower scores reflecting better outcomes. ITSQ Total Overall Raw Scores range from 22-154. Both raw domain and overall scores are transformed on a scale of 0-100, where transformed score=100*[(7-mean raw score)/6]. Higher scores indicate better treatment satisfaction. LS means was determined by MMRM with baseline of response, baseline HbA1c, country, sulfonylurea use, basal insulin status at study entry, visit, treatment and visit*treatment in the model.</description>

          <title>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) Score</title>
          <description>ITSQ is a validated instrument containing 22 items that assess treatment satisfaction for participants with diabetes and on insulin. Items divided into 5 domains of satisfaction: Inconvenience of Regimen [(IR) 5 items: domain scores range (DSR) 5-35], Lifestyle Flexibility [(LF) 3 items: DSR 3-21], Glycemic Control [(GC) 3 items: DSR 3-21], Hypoglycemic Control [(HC) 5 items: DSR 5-35], Insulin Delivery Device [(IDD) 6 items: DSR 6-42]. All items measured on a 7-point scale: 1 (no bother at all) to 7 (a tremendous bother), with lower scores reflecting better outcomes. ITSQ Total Overall Raw Scores range from 22-154. Both raw domain and overall scores are transformed on a scale of 0-100, where transformed score=100*[(7-mean raw score)/6]. Higher scores indicate better treatment satisfaction. LS means was determined by MMRM with baseline of response, baseline HbA1c, country, sulfonylurea use, basal insulin status at study entry, visit, treatment and visit*treatment in the model.</description>

        <title>Rate of Hypoglycemic Events Adjusted Per 1 Year</title>
        <description>The rate of hypoglycemic events were analyzed at baseline, titration, maintenance, and overall study periods and at endpoint using the Wilcoxon test. In addition, a negative binomial model was used as a sensitivity analysis. A hypoglycemic event is defined as any time a participant has a blood glucose (BG) level of ≤70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) even if the event was not associated with signs, symptoms, or treatment consistent with current guidelines (American Diabetes Association 2005). Nocturnal hypoglycemia is defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurs between bedtime and waking. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as a hypoglycemic event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagons, or other resuscitative actions. Severe Hypoglycemic events may or may not have a reported BG ≤70 mg/dL. These events may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma.</description>
