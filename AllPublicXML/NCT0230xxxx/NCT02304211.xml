      The purpose of this protocol is to demonstrate that intra-arterial administration of a drug
      can generate information in a manner that faithfully mimics effects of systemic
      administration but with little or no systemic effects.

      IAM is a novel approach combining the methodologies and techniques of 'microdosing' and
      'intra-arterial drug delivery' to test new drugs in targeted organs or tissues. The main
      feature of this approach is that when a microdose (defined as 1/100th of the total body
      minimal pharmacological dose) is given into a body area 1/100th of the total body mass - a
      temporary pharmacological concentration is generated in that area that may be sufficient to
      generate and detect a biomarker relevant to the drug's safety and efficacy. The drug then
      returns systemically and is diluted to become a subpharmacological microdose. The
      significance of the approach is in the ability to obtain information on novel drugs in humans
      in a safe manner.

      Insulin will be administered into the radial artery and compared with systemic
      administration. The effects on the ipsilateral hand will be compared with systemic effects
      and effects on the contralateral hand. The outcomes will be insulin pharmacokinetics, glucose
      and potassium levels, and 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake as measured with Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.
