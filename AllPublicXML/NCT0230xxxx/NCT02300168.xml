    <textblock>
      The aim of the current observational study is to better assess the relationships between
      neuromuscular blockade and multiple surgical outcomes in patients undergoing elective
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Performing bariatric surgery as a short-stay procedure is an ongoing trend in many centers
      around the world. For morbidly obese (MO) patients, the anesthetic approach is based on
      choosing drugs that have the least potential for accumulation. This allows a more rapid and
      clear-headed recovery and contributes to reduced duration of perioperative time. However,
      when neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is required during surgery, complete recovery is a major
      factor that may prevent from a rapid fast-track discharge.

      In Canada, reversal of NMB is achieved by using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors,
      mostly neostigmine, which must be administered after a certain level of spontaneous recovery
      in order to ensure a complete reversal. This elongates the time spent in the operating room
      (OR), and prevent therefore from a fast track surgery procedure. On the other hand, in an
      effort to shorten the time spent in the OR, AChE inhibitors may sometime be administered too
      early before spontaneous recovery, and post-operative residual curarization (PORC) may then
      be observed. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), PORC may be particularly problematic,
      because of the possible occurrence of critical respiratory events (CREs). This in turn is
      also associated with significant delayed discharges.

      Because of the aforementioned inconveniences, Canadian anesthesiologists are reluctant to
      induce deep NMB. Consequently, intra-abdominal pressure remain non optimal during the
      surgery, which do not facilitate the surgeons work, in addition to increase perioperative
      time. This problem is particularly frequent in cases of bariatric surgeries.

      The current study will explore this question from the perspective of the surgeon satisfaction
      and the patient quality of recovery.
