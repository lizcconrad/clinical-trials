  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the best ways to assess how people are affected by
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The study will assess walking speed, muscle strength, muscle
      size, myotonia, heart rhythm, mental efficiency, and overall health. Participants will
      complete questionnaires to record their ideas about how they are affected by DM1. The study
      will evaluate people with DM1 over 1 year to determine how the condition changes over time.
      The study will identify biomarkers of DM1. Biomarkers are laboratory measurements that show
      the effects of DM1 on a person's muscle tissue or blood. Biomarkers are needed in future
      studies to determine how DM1 may respond to treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the study will come to the study site for 3 study visits. Each visit will
      take most of the day. Each visit will include a series of evaluations to determine how the
      person is affected by myotonic dystrophy. The results from the initial study visit will be
      compared to the second study visit after 3 months and the third study visit after 1 year. A
      small needle biopsy of a leg muscle will be performed at the first and second study visits
      (but not at the third visit). After the second study visit, participants will be asked to
      make a phone call every day for 30 days to report their symptoms and muscle strength (grip
      strength).

      Blood samples will be used for routine laboratory testing, such as tests of blood cells,
      chemistry, and ability to form blood clots. Blood samples will be used for genetic testing
      (DNA testing) and to identify biomarkers. Needle muscle biopsies will be obtained from the
      tibialis anterior, a muscle in the front of the leg, next to the shin.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Approximately 100 adult patients (18 to 70 years old, inclusive) with DM1 will be enrolled
        at 6 centers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed informed
             consent and authorization to use protected health information in accordance with
             national and local patient privacy regulations.

          -  Men and women, 18 to 70 years old, inclusive; body mass index ≤33.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of DM1 based on research criteria or prior genetic testing with
             confirmation of CTG repeat length ≥70. A genetic test confirming DM1 is not required
             for entry. A DNA sample will be obtained from all subjects for DM1 genetic testing. If
             this test does not show an expanded repeat in the DM1 gene the subject will be
             withdrawn from the study.
