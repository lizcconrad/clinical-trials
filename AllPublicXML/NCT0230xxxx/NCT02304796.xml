  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current pilot study will examine and compare the effectiveness of two group
      psychotherapies for mixed anxiety disorders: 1. unified cognitive-behavioral protocol,
      adapted to a group format. 2. combined cognitive-behavioral and dance/movement therapy.

      In addition, change in proposed mechanism in each therapy will be examined, along with their
      association with change in outcome measures during therapy.

      The current pilot study will examine and compare the effectiveness of two group
      psychotherapies for mixed anxiety disorders: 1. unified cognitive-behavioral protocol,
      adapted to a group format. 2. combined cognitive-behavioral and dance/movement therapy.

      24 patients will be randomized to 1 of the two treatment arms and treated with 20 weekly
      1.5-2 hours therapy sessions. Independent evaluator and self-reports measures will be
      collected at intake, pre-treatment, session by session, post-treatment and and follow-up.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Both groups will show effectiveness, as revealed by reduction in anxiety severity and
           increase in valued living.

        2. Changes in process measures (proposed mechanism of change - emotion regulation, working
           alliance, fear of bodily sensations, bodily/movement awareness) will be predictive of
           change in outcome measures (anxiety severity and valued living).

        3. Changes in bodily/movement awareness will be more predictive of change in outcome
           measures in the CBT-DMT group than in the unified protocol group.
