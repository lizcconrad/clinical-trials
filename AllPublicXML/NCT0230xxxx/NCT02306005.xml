      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of insulin therapy in patients with newly
      diagnosed type 1 diabetes on quantitative and qualitative changes of plasma lipoproteins,
      with particular emphasis on HDL metabolism, and analysis of the factors determining the
      effect of insulin therapy on lipid profile.The study is planned to cover a minimum of 100
      people with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and lead prospective observation of this group
      (for a minimum of 5-10 years). Patients will be assessed: during the first hospitalization in
      the moment of diagnosis (prior to introduction of insulin treatment), after 3 weeks, after 6
      months and after 12 months of insulin therapy. Further observations planned in the annual
      intervals. In addition, the study group will be under constant monitoring of metabolic
      evaluation every three months in the Outpatient Clinic.

      During each follow-up will be assessed parameters evaluating the metabolism of plasma
      lipoprotein fractions and subfractions of HDL:

        1. The concentration of apolipoprotein: including A-I, A-II, A-IV, C (II and III), D and E

        2. Electrophoresis of plasma lipoproteins

        3. Electrophoresis of HDL

        4. The activity of enzymes: acyltransferase lecithin: cholesterol (LCAT) and plasma
           lipoprotein lipase Moreover, evaluation of factors which may potentially modify the
           relation between insulin therapy and lipoproteins will be assessed

             1. Anthropometric data and markers of insulin resistance (such as BMI, waist-hip
                ratio, the estimated rate of glucose distribution, VAI index, body fat, blood
                pressure),

             2. Metabolic management of diabetes,,

             3. Protein glycation end products

             4. The concentration of plasma adipokines.

      Expected impact of the research project on the development of science, civilization and
      society The obtained results allow to assess the impact of exogenous insulin on quantitative
      and qualitative changes and metabolism of lipoproteins in the serum of patients with type 1
      diabetes. Understanding the etiopathogenesis of this phenomenon and the factors affecting it
      seem to be very important in the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes, where insulin is
      the treatment of choice and dosage adjustment appears to be extremely important. Remains
      unknown whether the changes in the lipoprotein profile result from the beginning of insulin
      therapy or other factors influence it. Selecting a group of patients with less favorable
      lipoprotein profile may allow better metabolic control, and thus will affect the quality and
      length of life of our patients. These studies will assess the impact of our therapeutic
      actions on the diagnosis of the disease on long-term consequences, such as the development of
      chronic complications.
