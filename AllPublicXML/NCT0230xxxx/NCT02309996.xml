  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supervisors of injured workers play a key role in preventing prolonged work absences.
      Providing supervisors with tools to improve their response to musculoskeletal and other
      workplace injuries or illnesses may improve worker health and disability outcomes.

      The primary objective of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of the
      supervisor training program, the SMART Supervisor Training Program, on reducing the total
      duration of workers' lost-time claims. The secondary objectives are 1) to determine the
      effectiveness of the training program on reducing the cumulative incidence of workers'
      lost-time injuries and sick leave days; 2) to determine if implementation of the training
      program is associated with improvements in hypothesized mediating variables, such as
      attitudes toward job accommodations, response to workplace injury, and communication with
      employees and healthcare providers; 3) to investigate the implementation of the training
      program by conducting a process evaluation.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. the duration of lost-time claims for workers working under supervisors receiving the
           training program will be shorter than the duration of lost-time claims for workers with
           supervisors in the control group;

        2. the cumulative incidence of lost-time injuries and sick leave days will be lower in the
           group receiving the training program compared to the control group;

        3. the training program will be associated with increased knowledge, response,
           communication and changed attitudes towards workplace accommodation.

      This research is of significance to North American employers and compensation systems because
      there is a lack of knowledge about the usefulness of supervisor training to prevent or reduce
      work disability. It also has important implications for guiding employer policies and
      practices, and for identifying circumstances where supervisor training should be a priority.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centred, cluster randomized, controlled, single-blinded, fixed sample
      trial.

      The project will involve several large Canadian and American employers. Participating work
      units within the organizations will be randomly assigned to either the training program
      (intervention group) or not (control group). Randomizing geographically separate work units
      works best to prevent contamination of supervisors selected to be the control group. However,
      the employer will decide what constitutes a work unit (e.g., separate building, division,
      etc.). The work units will be pair-matched into clusters based on number of employees, gender
      proportions, and work tasks as best as possible. A total of 86 work units (43 work unit
      pairs) including approximately 350 supervisors is required to achieve the primary objective,
      with fewer work units and supervisors required to achieve the secondary objectives. Within
      each cluster, one work unit will receive the training program and the other will act as the
      control. All supervisors within those work units randomized to receive the intervention will
      attend a four-hour supervisor training session. Before training is administered to the
      randomly assigned work units, all supervisors (intervention group and control group) will
      receive an email with an attached information pamphlet about principles for successful return
      to work. The purpose of the information pamphlet is to minimize the Hawthorne Effect, whereby
      subjects change their behaviour in response to the knowledge that they are being studied or
      monitored.

      The work disability outcomes (duration of lost-time injuries in days, and cumulative
      incidence of lost-time injuries and sick leave days) will be determined from workplace
      records, and outcomes data will be extracted and analyzed at the level of the work unit.
      Since the intervention is a training program, it is impossible to blind the participating
      supervisors. However, the data extractor and individuals working in each employer's
      Occupational Health &amp; Safety Department will be blinded to the results of the work unit
      randomization and no other workers will be informed if the supervisors in their work unit
      received the training program or not.

      To collect information about the hypothesized mediating variables, consenting supervisors
      will be asked to complete three online questionnaires: baseline and two follow-up
      questionnaires (three and six months post-randomization). The baseline and follow-up
      questionnaires will also collect information on potential moderating and confounding factors
      including workplace safety culture, supervisor autonomy, corporate disability management,
      leadership style, workplace social capital, and workers' physical work demands, supervisor
      demographics, and characteristics of supervised workers (e.g., number, gender proportions,
      unionization status). Analysis of the mediating variables will be conducted at the level of
      the work unit. Data for the process evaluation will be obtained from a brief exit training
      program evaluation survey distributed to participants in the intervention group as well as
      the three and six month follow-up questionnaires.

      This is a pragmatic, intent-to-treat trail, so participants will be analyzed according to the
      group they were randomly assigned to. However, the investigators will also obtain information
      about supervisor transfers among work units (and the direction of the transfers) for the one
      year period post-randomization to understand how such transfers may have influenced the
      results.

    <measure>Supervisor's Role in Rehabilitation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument asks supervisors to rank their self-efficacy to engage in all of the rehabilitation tasks associated with vocational rehabilitation. The survey uses a series of Likert scales, using response categories which classify each rehabilitation task as either being: &quot;very difficult to do&quot;; &quot;hard to do&quot;; &quot;easy to do&quot;; or &quot;very simple to do&quot;. This scale is seen as a continuum of supervisor ability, and a measure of their self-rated capacity to engage in vocational rehabilitation at their own workplaces. The reliability estimate for the use of this rating scale is acceptable (Cronbach alpha = 0.89) and Rasch analysis supports the premise that all 20 rehabilitation items being estimated are unidimensional.

    <measure>Behaviour Measure for Supervisors to Support Return to Work (SSRW) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SSRW was developed using supervisor and employee populations and there is a version for supervisors and a version for employers. The 42 items in the scale are related to supervisor behaviours during an employee's absence from work and subsequent return to work. The measure consists of four sub-scales: communication and support during sick leave, inclusive behaviour upon initial return, negative behaviours and general proactive support following return to work. A total score is obtained by summing the responses, with a higher score indicating more supportive behaviours. The measure has good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. The SSRW will be included in the 6-month follow-up questionnaire only.

    <measure>Supervisor Support Scale from the &quot;Readiness for RTW Study&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The supervisor support scale was designed to assess the relations between injured workers and supervisors. This scale is based on items from a previously used questionnaire and also includes items developed by a clinical psychologist, organizational psychologist, psychometrist, and a graduate student in community health. Although this scale was originally developed for response by injured workers, we modified the 8-item scale for supervisor response. We will average all responses not indicating &quot;Don't Know&quot; to determine a supervisor support score from 1 to 4 where higher scores indicate better supervisor interaction.

    <measure>Supervisory Behavior Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>The supervisory behaviour scale was designed to assess positive supervisory behaviour regarding communication with the employee, promotion of gradual return to work, and consultation with other professionals. The scale includes 7 statements about interactions between supervisors and injured workers and asks supervisors to indicate how much they agree or disagree with each statement. Responses to all statements will be summed and will result in a final score between 7 and 35 where lower scores indicate positive supervisor behaviour.

    <measure>Supervisor and Healthcare Provider Interactions questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Communication with healthcare providers will be measured with a questionnaire assessing supervisors' interactions with healthcare providers developed specifically for the mixed-methods study. The five questions were selected from existing publications as we could not find an existing scale appropriate for our needs through the literature review. Three constructs will be measured from these questions including healthcare communication (i.e., do you communicate with providers?), healthcare beliefs (i.e., does the supervisor believe the provider understands the nature of the job?), and healthcare information (i.e., how often does a provider help you return a worker to work?). The scale has good face validity and reliability in the supervisor population as determined from our previous project.</description>

    <description>All supervisors from work units randomized to the intervention will receive a supervisor training program, the Supervisor/Manager Accommodation Recognition &amp; Training (SMART) Program. This training program is modeled on a program developed by Shaw and colleagues of the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (LMRIS). The aim of the training program is to prevent/reduce work disability by improving supervisor communication, response to workplace injury, and problem solving mechanisms. The training program is designed to be administered by two facilitators to groups of 10 to 12 supervisors, during one 4-hour session or two 2-hour sessions. The training program delivery mode includes PowerPoint presentation with supplementary audio or video segments, case studies, and group discussion.</description>
