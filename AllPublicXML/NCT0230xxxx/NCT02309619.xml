  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer (EC) is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer
      deaths worldwide. Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is regarded as a safe and effective
      management for resectable EC. Gastric tube is considered to be an ideal substitute for the
      resected esophagus and can be lifted to the neck for anastomosis through two different paths
      — Trans-substernal and trans-esophageal bed routes. However, the differences of operative
      outcomes between the two paths have not been systematically described. In this study,
      clinical outcomes including intra- and post-operative status, morbidity and complications,
      nutrition status, as well as quality of life after surgery will be evaluated, and differences
      between the trans-substernal and trans-esophageal bed groups will be compared. The study
      might help to individualization treatment for EC.

      1. Patients with esophageal cancer (EC) will be histologically proved by endoscopic biopsy,
           and staged by thoracicoabdominal computed tomography (CT), endoluminal ultrasonography
           and positron emission tomography (PET) before surgery. The other crucial test including
           barium meal, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, cardiac
           ultrasonography, electrocardiogram and treadmill test, as well as blood biochemistry
           examinations will also be accomplished preoperatively.

        2. Patients who meet clinical criteria will be asked to sign a consent form, and divided
           randomly into two groups — trans-substernal group and trans-esophageal bed group.
           Patients in both groups will undergo a minimally invasive esophagectomy which consist of
           4 steps: (1) thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization followed by mediastinal
           lymphadenectomy; (2) laparoscopic gastric mobilization followed by abdominal
           lymphadenectomy and gastric tube construction; (3) cervical esophageal mobilization and
           transection; (4) lifting of the gastric tube to the neck for gastro-esophageal
           anastomosis through trans-substernal or trans-esophageal bed path. The operative
           procedure of the two groups is similar except step 4.

        3. Patients in both groups will be followed-up regularly. Intra- and post-operative status,
           morbidity and complications, nutrition status, as well as quality of life after surgery
           will be evaluated, and differences between the trans-substernal and trans-esophageal bed
           groups will be compared.
