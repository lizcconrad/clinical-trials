  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of early mobilization versus traditional
      immobilization rehabilitation programs after surgical Achilles tendon repair on the
      mechanical (torque-angle and torque-velocity relationships) and electrical (neuromuscular
      activation) properties of the plantar- and dorsiflexor muscles, gastrocnemius medialis
      morphology (muscle architecture), functional performance, and the mechanical and material
      properties (force-elongation and stress-strain relationships) of the injured and uninjured
      Achilles tendon.

      The hypothesis is that the early mobilization could reduce the deleterious effects of the
      joint immobilization and improve the tendon healing.

    <textblock>
      Participants were allocated into one of two intervention groups (traditional immobilization
      or early mobilization).

      Traditional immobilization group (45 days of plaster cast immobilization; after the
      immobilization period, subjects received instructions on how to perform a home-based exercise
      program)

      Early mobilization (six weeks of physical therapy program; three times per week; one to two
      hours of exercises for regaining range of motion and muscular endurance)

      Control group (subjects had no history of lower limb injury, and were matched in age and
      anthropometric measurements to subjects that performed physical rehabilitation and to
      subjects that remained immobilized.

    <description>After surgery subjects were immobilized in a plaster cast, with the ankle positioned in gravitational equinus; weight bearing was not allowed. Two weeks post-operatively, the cast was removed and the patient was immobilized with a new plaster cast, with the ankle in the same position. Four weeks post-operatively, the ankle was plastered in neutral position (i.e. with the sole of the foot perpendicular to the shank), and weight bearing was encouraged. Six weeks post-operatively, the plaster cast was removed
The home exercise program consisted of active exercises and stretches to improve ankle range of motion, and resistance and balance exercises</description>
