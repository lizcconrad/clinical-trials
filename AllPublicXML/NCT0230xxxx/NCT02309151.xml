  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this prospective, randomized pilot study is to investigate whether acute
      coronary angiography (within 120 minutes) with a predefined strategy for revascularization,
      is safe to implement in patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest. The primary question at
      issue is whether early angiography (within 120 minutes) with a predefined strategy for
      revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is safe to carry out in this
      group of patients. The patients randomized to acute coronary angiography will be compared
      with a control group who will be treated according to standard practice with coronary
      angiography with possible subsequent intervention according to the current routine, which
      usually does not occur within the first three days after cardiac arrest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open prospective randomized multicenter study with a registry follow up where
      out of hospital cardiac arrest without ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in ECG will
      be randomized to direct coronary angiography with possible intervention or the usual care
      without acute coronary angiography. The study will include 120 patients in total , of which
      80 patients without STEMI and 40 patients with STEMI after successful resuscitation after
      cardiac arrest. Randomization takes place immediately after ECG is taken in conjunction with
      the first medical contact. First ECG can be taken to the emergency room if the prehospital
      situation for various reasons do not permit or enable ECG recording. Randomization will then
      occur in the emergency room. Coronary angiography should be done within 120 minutes from
      first medical contact in the treatment group. Randomization will be done via a web based
      module.The group without STEMI whom will not be randomized to acute coronary angiography will
      be treated according to standard practice where coronary angiography with possible following
      intervention is up to the competent cardiologist.The strategy is avoid coronary angiography
      during the first 3 days unless urgent indication occurs during the care process such as
      renewed chest pain, renewed STEMI circulatory instability or cardiogenic shock. This is also
      the standard method currently practiced in Swedish and international hospitals. The group
      with STEMI on the first ECG is logged and followed, and the patients in this group are
      studied separately in order to describe and evaluate the frequency of acute intervention in
      this group and look at the survival data compared with the study population and against an
      unselected STEMI material without cardiac arrest.
