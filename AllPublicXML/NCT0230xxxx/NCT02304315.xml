  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept study for GC1102 to demonstrate preventing the recurrence of
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection following liver transplantation and a dose-finding study to
      determine its optional dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GC1102 is a new recombinant hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) from Chinese Hamster Ovary
      (CHO) cells. It is a monoclonal antibody and has high affinity and avidity to hepatitis B
      surface antigen and several advantages compared to HBIg derived from blood plasma of human
      donors. Forty volunteers will participate in the study, receive 24-week treatment with low
      dose (50,000IU) of GC1102 or with high dose (80,000IU) and be followed up till 28 weeks.
