    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with third and fourth degree obstetric
      lacerations benefit from a short course of pelvic floor physical therapy in the immediate
      postpartum period.

      The proposed study is a prospective, randomized pilot trial. We aim to answer the question:
      do patients with third and fourth degree obstetric lacerations benefit from a short course
      pelvic floor physical therapy in the immediate postpartum period?

      Forty patients experiencing third or fourth degree obstetric laceration at either BIDMC or
      Mount Auburn Hospital will be identified and randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Half of the patients
      will receive a 10-12 week course of pelvic floor physical therapy at Marathon PT to begin one
      to two weeks postpartum. Those assigned to the control will not receive pelvic floor physical
      therapy which is the current standard of care. They will also agree not to seek pelvic floor
      physical therapy during until at least 14 weeks postpartum without discussing with study
      investigators. At 14 weeks postpartum they will be offered pelvic floor physical therapy. At
      1-2 weeks postpartum, 6-8 weeks postpartum, and 12-14 weeks postpartum, all study subjects
      will complete the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire - 7 (PFIQ-7), the Pelvic Floor Distress
      Inventory - 20 (PFDI-20), the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Patient Global
      Impression of Severity (PGI-S) Scale and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)
      Scale all of which are validated surveys. Surveys will be completed online via REDCap using
      computers at Marathon PT for treatment group subjects and at home or in a location of their
      choosing for control subjects. Control patients will be given the option of beginning pelvic
      floor PT after 14 weeks postpartum. Should they decide to pursue pelvic floor PT at that
      time, they will have the option to continue to fill out periodic surveys via REDCap, but will
      not be required to do so.
