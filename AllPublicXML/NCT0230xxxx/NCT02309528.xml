  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few educational intervention clinical trials have been conducted among those at risk for or
      with early chronic kidney disease. To the investigators' knowledge none have used digital
      storytelling as a means to deliver the educational message and have been conducted among
      American Indians, a group with high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney
      disease.

      The aims of the research project are to:

        1. Quantify levels of chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American
           Indians.

        2. Determine the effectiveness of a culturally tailored health presentation with
           computerized digital stories made by American Indians for improving chronic kidney
           disease knowledge and factors thought to be preventative of chronic kidney disease or
           its progression at baseline and follow-up in a pilot educational clinical intervention
           trial.
