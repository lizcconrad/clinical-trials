  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drainage of perianal abscesses is a well established treatment. Traditionally its been done
      in general anesthesia after the swelling has been localised its been drained with a knife.
      After surgical intervention complications can occur with recidivism, chronic fistulas that go
      from the anal to the skin and sometimes the anal sphincter is damaged which can cause
      problems with incontinence.

      Through ultrasound the abscess is opened under more controlled forms with a better visual
      overview. This is a new technique that has not been tested in larger studies. The aim with
      ultrasound-drainage as with traditional incision to drain the abscess so that the infected
      area can heal.

      The hypothesis is a reduction of recurrences and formation of fistulas with the use of 3D
      ultrasonography.

      The individual patient is informed about the condition and if meets criteria is offered to
      take part in the study. Written information and informed consent always noted. Questions
      about the patients general medical condition is noted and if the person has had problems with
      perianal abscesses before.
