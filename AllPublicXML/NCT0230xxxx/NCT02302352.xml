  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease with unknown etiology, which affects
      especially the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, heart and kidneys. Immunological abnormalities
      characterized by innate and acquired immune disturbances are associated with the disease
      development. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal symptoms, nutritional status and innate and acquired immune responses, by
      means of the evaluation of IgA, Treg and Th1, Th2, and Th17 T helper subtypes levels in
      patients with SSc. In addition the levels of CD4+ T helper Th1, Th2 and Th17 subtypes and
      Treg levels will be compared to a healthy control group.

    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease, which affects the gastrointestinal
      tract, lungs, heart and kidneys. A shift in the balance between T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2
      subtypes and between regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th17 cells levels, as well as intestinal
      microbiota abnormalities may be present in SSc. These abnormalities can stimulate
      inflammatory response, and cause intestinal epithelial damage. The use of oral probiotics for
      microbiome or immune response modulation can be attractive especially in autoimmune diseases.
      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics in gastrointestinal symptoms,
      nutritional status and innate and acquired immune responses, by means of the evaluation of
      IgA, Treg and Th1, Th2, and Th17 T helper subtypes levels in patients with SSc. In addition
      the levels of CD4+ T helper Th1, Th2 and Th17 subtypes and Treg levels will be compared to a
      healthy control group. Patients and methods: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
      clinical trial, with 76 SSc patients will be performed. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive oral probiotics once a day or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be
      changes in the gastrointestinal symptoms between baseline and week 8. Clinical evaluation,
      scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (sHAQ), food intake record, anthropometry
      assessment and laboratory evaluation will be performed at baseline (T0), at week 4 (T1) and
      week 8 (T2). C-reactive protein (CRP) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) serum levels assessment will
      be performed at each visit. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and Tregs
      (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+CD127low), and Th1, Th2 e Th17 CD4+ T cell subsets levels will be evaluated
      using flow cytometer at each visit in SSc patients and also in 50 healthy subjetcs.
