  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a cohort of pregnant women with severe mental
      disorder and to identify biological and psycho-social transmission mechanisms involved in the
      development of 'risk' and 'resilience' in the offspring. It is assumed that both 'resilient'
      and 'risk' development in offspring are caused by a complex interaction between multiple
      biological, psychological and social factors. The project focuses specifically on exploring
      the impact of physiological stress-sensitivity, attachment, care-giving and the familial and
      social context for care-giving. Previous studies support these factors as important for the
      development of these infants, but systematic research using a prospective design is needed to
      strengthen evidence and elucidate the importance of these factors in more detail. The
      interaction over time of physiological stress-sensitivity, attachment, care-giving and the
      familial and social context for care-giving are evaluated in terms of the evolution of very
      early indicators of developmental risk and resilience in infants with a known highly
      increased risk for developing a mental disorder.The findings of the study may potentially
      lead to more specific targets for preventive interventions, which can improve developmental
      outcome for these infants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant attachment as measured by Strange Situation Procedure (Ainsworth et al. 1978)</measure>
    <time_frame>At infant 52 weeks of age</time_frame>
    <description>Strange Situation Procedure is a structured observation. The infant is videotaped in a playroom during a series of eight structured 3-min episodes involving the baby, the mother, and a female stranger. During the observation the mother leaves and rejoins the infant twice, first leaving the infant with the female stranger, then leaving the infant alone to be rejoined by the stranger. The procedure is designed to be mildly stressful in order to increase the intensity of activation of the infant's attachment behavior. Videotapes are coded for four attachment classifications: secure, avoidant, ambivalent-resistant/dependent and disorganised.</description>

    <description>NNNS is a 30-minute, 128-item assessment of neurologic, behavioural, and stress/abstinence signs that evaluates the full range of infant neurobehavior. It has 12 summary scales: habituation, attention, arousal, regulation, number of handling procedures, quality of movement, excitability, lethargy, number of non-optimal reflexes, number of asymmetric reflexes, hypertonicity, and hypotonicity and an additional stress/abstinence scale.</description>

    <time_frame>1-7 days, 4 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CIB is a global measure that looks at parent-child and dyadic affective states and interactive styles. Independent behavioral codes are aggregated into eight higher order constructs: The three child constructs are engagement involvement, withdrawal, and compliance; and the two dyadic constructs are dyadic reciprocity and dyadic negative states.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline before birth of the child and at 1-7 days, 4, 16 and 52 weeks of infant age.</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS, MADRS and BRMRS are rating scales based on a semistructured interview. PANSS 5-factor model assesses the presence or absence of positive, negative, disorganisation, excitement and emotional distress symptoms (van der Gaag et al., 2006). MADRS assesses the presence and severity of 10 core symptoms of depression. BRMRS assesses the presence and severity of 11 core symptoms of hypomania/mania</description>
