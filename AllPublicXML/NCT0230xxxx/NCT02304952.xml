  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study the effects related to function and pain during eccentric exercise and
      surgery with radiofrequency microtenotomy as post-surgical rehabilitation, compared with only
      eccentric exercise, in patients with lateral epicondylalgia unilaterally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of those affected by lateral epicondylalgia will 90% be free of symptoms within 8 months to 2
      years with conservative treatment. In this study surgical radiofrequency microtenotomy and
      eccentric exercise for chronic (more than two year) lateral epicondylalgia that is
      unilaterally will be used as treatment. Patients is randomized to a group with eccentric
      exercise or a group with surgical radiofrequency microtenotomy and postoperatively eccentric
      exercise. Home based eccentric exercise program is instructed by a physical therapist and is
      performed for three months. Women start with 0.5 kg and men 1.0 kg weight, they perform 3
      sets with 5 reps once a day and register pain and exercise in a diary. Function, pain and
      quality of life will be followed and are carried out after 6 weeks and after 3, 6 and 12
      months. The surgery and eccentric exercise is instructed and followed at the investigators
      clinic.

    <description>For the minimally invasive surgery will Arthrocare Topaz MicroDebrider device be used. A small incision will be made and the tip of the device is placed on surface of the tendon to structure and activated for 0.5 second, at 5 mm distance intervals on the tendon creating a grid-like pattern.</description>
