    <description>The minimum-exposure yoga package, this intervention included 45-minutes of contact time with a trained yoga professional. In Week 1, this session included a 30-minute introductory session focussing on pranayama (breathing techniques), as well as a brief introduction to available community-based and online yoga to encourage a safe home-based practice (15-minutes). Financial subsidy, compensation or special promotion of any particular yoga was not provided. Participants were invited to stay for a social discussion following the yoga class.</description>

    <description>The medium-exposure yoga package, this intervention included the components of Group A, with an additional 30-minute orientation and safety training of how to practice yoga dhyana (meditation techniques) and asana (physical postures) in Week 1. Participants were then invited to stay and ask questions following the yoga class. A pre-paid online yoga membership to http://www.myyogaonline.com was offered for the duration of the study (Weeks 1 to 4). In addition to this, one 120-minute workshop to further develop yoga pranayama, dhyana and asana training was administered by an expert instructor during Week 2 or 3.</description>

Participants were invited to stay and ask questions following the yoga class. As in Group B, a pre-paid online yoga membership to http://www.myyogaonline.com was also provided for the duration of the study (Weeks 1 to 4). Participants were then invited to attend three 60-minute yoga group classes led by an expert yoga instructor per week (Weeks 1 to 4).

          <description>The minimum-exposure yoga package, this intervention included 45-minutes of contact time with a trained yoga professional. This session included a 30-minute introductory session focussing on pranayama (breathing techniques), as well as a brief introduction to available community-based and online yoga to encourage a safe home-based practice (15-minutes). Financial subsidy, compensation or special promotion of any particular yoga was not provided. Participants were invited to stay for a social discussion following the yoga class.

          <description>The medium-exposure yoga package, this intervention includes the components of Group A, with an additional 30-minute orientation and safety training of how to practice yoga dhyana (meditation techniques) and asana (physical postures) in week one. Participants were invited to stay and ask questions following the yoga class. A pre-paid online yoga membership to http://www.myyogaonline.com was offered for the duration of the study. In addition to this, one 120-minute workshop to further develop yoga pranayama, dhyana and asana training was administered by an expert instructor during week 2 or 3.

Participants were invited to stay and ask questions following the yoga class. As in Group B, a pre-paid online yoga membership to http://www.myyogaonline.com was also provided for the duration of the study. Participants were then invited to attend three 60-minute yoga group classes led by an expert yoga instructor per week (weeks 1 to 4). These yoga sessions were held in a clinical setting in proximity to their treatment location and delivered at no cost to the patient.
