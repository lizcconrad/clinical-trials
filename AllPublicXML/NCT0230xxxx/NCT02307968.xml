    <textblock>
      To observe the patient's preference, pain perception, and usability between inner and outer
      upper thigh for insulin therapy. To add another injection site for insulin therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common injection site is the abdomen (or stomach). The back of the upper arms, the
      upper buttocks or hips, and the outer side of the thighs are also used. These sites are the
      best to inject into for two reasons: They have a layer of fat just below the skin to absorb
      the insulin, but not many nerves - which means that injecting there will be more comfortable
      than injecting in other parts of your body. But while the needle for insulin therapy is
      becoming shorter, it is possible to inject insulin at the inner thigh site.
