  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pneumatic tourniquet is often used during total knee arthroplasty. However, its effect on
      postoperative outcomes as soft tissue damage resulting in delayed recovery remains unclear.
      The purpose of the present study was to compare tourniquet use versus non-tourniquet use
      during total knee arthroplasty for short-term functional recovery.

      In a prospective cohort design, consecutive series of patients who underwent primary
      unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the Bergman Clinic, the Netherlands were
      investigated. Patients scheduled for primary TKA due to osteoarthritis, age between 50 and 75
      years and with Dutch language proficiency were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria
      were inflammatory arthritis, severe cardiac complaints, severe pulmonary disorders, Body Mass
      Index (BMI) &gt;35, severe coagulation disorders or hospitalization in the previous two months
      before surgery. Each patient included in the study signed informed consent. The research
      protocol was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee VCMO in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands,
      registration number W13.022.
