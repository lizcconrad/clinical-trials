      Primary Objective: To determine if 36 months of peanut SLIT as an early intervention in
      subjects ages 1 to 4 years induces clinical desensitization. The primary outcome of this
      objective will be a statistically significant difference in challenge scores between the
      treatment group versus the placebo group during DBPCFC (Double blind placebo controlled food
      challenge) performed after 36 months of peanut SLIT (desensitization). A secondary outcome of
      this objective will be a statistically significant difference in the challenge score of the
      treatment group versus the placebo group during the DBPCFC performed 3 months after
      discontinuing therapy (tolerance). Challenge scores are measured by the amount of peanut
      protein participants are able to ingest successfully without symptoms of an allergic
      reaction. [Time Frame: Baseline, 39 months]

      Secondary Objective: To examine the change in immune parameters associated with peanut SLIT
      and the development of clinical tolerance. Through this objective, the investigators will
      seek to understand the molecular processes by which SLIT affects the immune system through
      evaluation of immune mechanisms in relationship to clinical findings of desensitization and
      tolerance. The investigators will delineate the impact of peanut SLIT on the subsequent
      cellular and humoral responses to peanut protein: 1) peanut specific IgE, IgG, and IgG4
      response, 2) peanut specific basophil activation, 3) mast cell responses through skin prick
      testing, and 4) specific T-cell cytokine responses and T regulatory cell (TReg) activation.
      The investigators anticipate that the effect of peanut SLIT will occur by induction of TRegs,
      conversion of T cells from an allergic (TH2) to a non-allergic (TH1) lymphocyte response
      (measured by cytokines, antibody levels, and skin prick test size), a change in
      peanut-specific basophil activation, or through a combination of the above.

    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies; most children develop this allergy
      early in life, do not outgrow it and are at risk for severe and life-ending anaphylactic
      reactions. There is a critical need for a proactive treatment for peanut allergy and the
      investigators along with others are developing specific types of immunotherapy that will act
      as disease-modifying therapies.

      This SLIT study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome of
      this objective will be a statistically significant difference in challenge scores between the
      treatment group versus the placebo group during DBPCFC performed after 36 months of peanut
      SLIT (desensitization). A secondary outcome of this objective will be a statistically
      significant difference in the challenge score of the treatment group versus the placebo group
      during the DBPCFC performed 3 months after discontinuing therapy (tolerance).

      Upon enrollment into the study, all subjects will undergo a qualifying entry DBPCFC with
      peanut protein to confirm the diagnosis of peanut allergy and establish a baseline threshold
      level. Following a positive DBPCFC, each subject will be randomized 1:1 to receive peanut
      SLIT therapy versus placebo for a duration of 36 months. DBPCFC will be repeated for both
      active and placebo subjects at 36 months to assess desensitization and at 39 months to assess
      tolerance.

      Outcome variables of interest include peanut specific IgE, IgG, and IgG4, basophil
      activation, mast cell responses through skin prick testing, and specific T-cell cytokine
      responses and T regulatory cell (TReg) activation.

    <description>The primary outcome is to detect a statistically significant difference in reaction thresholds to peanut between the treatment group versus the placebo group during DBPCFC (Double blind placebo controlled food challenge) performed after 36 months of peanut SLIT (desensitization). A secondary outcome of this objective is to detect a statistically significant difference between reaction thresholds to peanut of the treatment group versus the placebo group during the DBPCFC performed 3 months after discontinuing therapy (tolerance). Challenge scores are measured by the amount of peanut protein participants are able to ingest successfully without symptoms of an allergic reaction. The difference is measured through utilization of an extreme value hazard function.</description>
