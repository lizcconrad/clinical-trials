      The proposed study uses a recent policy change in Ohio as a natural experiment to assess
      outcomes and experiences of children who qualify for Medicaid under the Aged, Blind, Disabled
      category and their caregivers in an ACO model of care compared to their previous outcomes and
      experiences in a traditional fee-for-service model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with disabilities have complex healthcare needs requiring multiple providers in
      multiple locations. The lack of coordinated care for this vulnerable population leads to
      poorer outcomes, higher costs, and increased stress and time demands for patients and their
      caregivers. Traditionally, under arrangements known as fee-for-service, there have been no
      financial incentives for providers to coordinate care; however, the Affordable Care Act is
      changing that. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are groups of healthcare providers that
      organize in new ways to take responsibility for the care of a defined population. ACOs share
      in any savings associated with improved quality and efficiency of the care they provide.
      Although most ACOs currently do not cover children with disabilities, many are considering
      adding these to the populations they serve. Yet we know little about effectiveness of the
      care coordination strategies they employ on children with disabilities.

      The goal of this research is to assess care coordination for and patient-centered outcomes of
      children with disabilities (who qualify for Medicaid under the Aged, Blind, Disabled category
      (ABD) under an ACO as compared with traditional fee-for-service plans. We will use a recent
      policy change in Ohio that mandates children with disabilities move from traditional
      fee-for-service Medicaid plans into managed care arrangements such as ACOs. This mandate
      resulted in 8,000 disabled children automatically becoming part of the nation's largest
      pediatric ACO.

      We will use multiple methods, including focus groups, interviews, a survey, medical record
      data, and Medicare claims, to compare patient experiences and care under the ACO with
      experiences and care under the previous fee-for-service model. What impact will this research
      have? Our research will inform ACOs about the relative benefits and challenges of
      coordinating care and improving the health outcomes of children with disabilities and will
      help those organizations determine whether or not they can adequately serve the needs of this
      population. In addition, the findings will provide patients and caregivers with valuable
      information that can help them make decisions when faced with an increasingly common
      scenario, for example: &quot;The parents of a child with cerebral palsy receive a letter from
      their state Medicaid program that children are being enrolled in an 'accountable care
      organization.' How certain can they be that their child's care will be improved? What are the
      problems that might occur?&quot; We will engage patients, their caregivers, and health system
      stakeholders throughout the research process. Patient advocates have been involved in the
      design of our study. A patient advisory panel comprised of caregivers and advocates of
      disabled children will guide our project by providing advice at quarterly meetings. In
      addition, we will collect data from more than 2,800 patient voices through direct study
      participation.
