  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SPECTAbrain protocol describes a structure for screening patients with brain tumors to
      efficiently allocate eligible patients in relevant therapeutic biomarker-driven clinical
      trials. Efficiency is promoted through the creation of a clinical database of brain tumor
      patients and the respective human biological material biobank for molecular characterization.
      The main objectives are to:

        -  Allocate patients to clinical trials according to the clinical characteristics and
           molecular profile of their tumor;

        -  Identify or validate new molecularly defined subgroups of tumors;

        -  Investigate the prevalence of novel biomarkers to plan future clinical trials;

        -  Enable exploratory/future research;

        -  Facilitate establishment of quality-assured and validated tests for Central Nervous
           System (CNS) tumor biomarkers;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed newly diagnosed primary CNS tumors, with a focus on diffuse
             gliomas of grades II, III and IV, meningiomas from patients who are candidates for
             pharmacotherapy, and rare CNS tumors;

          -  Availability of adequate Human Biological Material (HBM): FFPE tissue sample from the
             primary and/or recurrent tumor and/or metastasis, obtained at the time of surgery or
             biopsy; minimal amount requested is detailed in the HBM guidelines. Inclusion of
             samples taken at any recurrence diagnosed during follow-up is strongly encouraged but
             optional;

          -  At least three months life expectancy;

          -  Written informed consent according to ICH/GCP and national/local regulations;

          -  Absence of exclusion criteria, such as active hepatitis B/C or HIV, second
             malignancies, severe organ dysfunction, or other comorbidities that will prevent
             inclusion into clinical trials.
