  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' overall objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of peer-to-peer support
      programs in preventing the necessity of acute health care and nursing home services for older
      adult populations and in promoting their health and wellness. The investigators' Specific
      Aims are:

        1. To compare the effectiveness of peer-to-peer community support in preventing
           hospitalization, emergency department (ED) use, and nursing home placement in an at-risk
           older adult population relative to standard community services.

        2. To compare the effect of peer-to-peer community support on intermediary measures of
           health and wellness such as self-rated health, depression, and anxiety relative to
           standard community services.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will accomplish the aims by conducting a longitudinal
      comparative-effectiveness study in which at-risk older adult study participants in three
      communities across the US are followed for 12-months. Using a quasi-experimental design,
      investigators will compare outcomes in those receiving peer-to-peer community support to
      those receiving standard community services.

      At all three sites investigators will include 120 older adults in the peer-to-peer support
      group and 120 in the standard community services group for a total intervention group size of
      360 (120 from each site) and 360 in the control group (120 from each site).

      Study Outcomes &amp; Measures To meet the first two aims investigators will (1) compare
      annualized rates of hospitalization, ED use, and nursing home placement and (2) examine the
      changes in self-reported health, depression, anxiety, and other measures of well-being in the
      group receiving peer-to-peer support compared to the group receiving standard community
      services from baseline to the end of study enrolment. The investigators describe each of our
      outcomes and additional study measures in detail below. Measures have been translated and
      used in Spanish and have been shown to be valid or have high reliability in Spanish

    <description>All three data collection sites run peer-to-peer community support programs. Core program elements include the same program objective, standard definition of who qualifies for peer-to-peer support, the mechanism by which older adults are referred for consideration for peer-support, core elements of training programs for the older adults who volunteer to provide the peer support, and monthly in-service trainings for all volunteers once trained, weekly hours that volunteers spend providing support, and provision of small stipends for volunteers.As they find their role very rewarding, there is very little peer turn-over; the vast majority of peers volunteer for years in this role, until they themselves start requiring services.</description>
