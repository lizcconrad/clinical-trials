      The purpose of this clinical trial is to collect imaging data on embryos followed to
      blastocyst stage (Day 5-6) for ongoing development and validation of the Eeva System.

      Primary Objectives Include:

      To collect imaging data on embryos followed to blastocyst stage (Day 5-6)

      Secondary Objectives Include:

      To collect enrollment data: demographics, IVF and pregnancy history To collect Day 3, Day 5
      and Day 6 embryo morphology data To collect pregnancy test and outcome data To collect
      pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) data (if applicable) To collect Frozen Embryo
      Transfer (FET) data (if applicable)

    <description>The Eeva System is indicated to provide adjunctive information on events occurring during the first two days of development that may predict further development to the blastocyst stage on Day 5 of development. This adjunctive information aids in the selection of embryo(s) for transfer on Day 3 when, following morphological assessment on Day 3, there are multiple embryos deemed suitable for transfer or freezing.</description>
