  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for a Treatment Use Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) of INTERCEPT PCs is
      to address current gaps in platelet transfusion safety in selected geographic regions. The
      objective is to provide access to INTERCEPT PCs for patients who might be at risk of
      transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI) due to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus
      (DENV) in regions in which a substantial proportion of the population has been infected or is
      at risk of infection by these pathogens (Petersen 2014); and the risk of asymptomatic
      infection among qualified blood donors is recognized (Stramer 2012, Adda 2014).

      The study is designed as a prospective, open label, multi-center, observational study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of INTERCEPT platelet components.

      Upon written informed consent, patients will be transfused with study PCs according to local
      practices. Each patient will be supported with platelets as clinically indicated in a manner
      that is consistent with the local standard of care. The study will be conducted in two
      phases. During the pilot phase, patients will sign informed consent to have study data
      collected following transfusion with conventional PCs. The objective of the pilot phase is to
      evaluate study logistics and data collection methods. During the INTERCEPT Treatment Use
      phase, patients will sign informed consent to receive INTERCEPT PCs, provide blood samples,
      and collect study data (demographics, transfusion data, and safety data).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a serious disease expected to require or requiring a transfusion of
             platelet component(s)

          -  Patient population as defined by each Investigator and their institutional review
             board (IRB).

          -  Patient provides written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Documented allergy to psoralens

          -  Neonatal patients treated with phototherapy devices that emit wavelengths less than
             425 nm due to the potential for erythema resulting from interaction between
             ultraviolet light and amotosalen.

          -  Pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy (due to possibility the neonate
             may need bilirubin light treatment after birth).
