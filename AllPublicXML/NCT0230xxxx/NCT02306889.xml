      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, crossover bioequivalence study comparing a single oral dose of fenofibrate
      capsules, USP 130 mg, of Ohm Laboratories Inc. USA (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceutical
      Inc.) with Antara速 (fenofibrate) Capsules 130 mg of Oscient Pharmaceuticals Corporation USA,

      The subjects were subjected to breath test for alcohol and test for drugs of abuse (opioids
      and cannabinoids) in urine prior to admission in each period.

      All subjects fasted overnight for at least 10 hours before the morning dose and for 4 hours
      post-dose during each period of the study. A single oral dose of either test (T) or reference
      (R) was administered with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature under supervision
      of trained study personnel. Both test and reference products were administered to all the
      study subjects, one in each period (except subject numbers 17, 27 and 42).

      Blood samples were collected at Predose (duplicate) and at 1.000, 2.000, 2.500, 3.000, 3.500,
      4.000, 4.500, 5.000, 5.500, 6.000, 6.500, 7.000, 7.500, 8.000, 8.500, 9.000, 10.000, 11.000,
      12.000, 16.000, 24.000, 36.000, 48.000, 72.000 and 96.000 hours post dose, in pre-chilled
      vacutainers, under low light condition, in each period from all completed subjects. The
      pre-dose blood samples in each period were collected in duplicate (2 x 5 mL), within a period
      of 1.5 hour before dosing.

      The actual end time of collection of each blood sample was recorded. During the course of the
      study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical examination, medical history and
      clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical parameters, serology and urine
      analysis at screening). Adverse event monitoring was done throughout the study. Laboratory
      parameters of hematology and biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.
