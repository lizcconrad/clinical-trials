      To evaluate Ranibizumab as prophylaxis against the conversion to neovascular Age-Related
      Macular Degeneration
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, randomized study of intravitreally administered
      ranibizumab 0.5 mg in subjects with unilateral neovascular AMD in which the fellow (study)
      eye is at high-risk for also developing conversion to neovascular AMD.

      The Study will determine the efficacy of a quarterly injection of Ranibizumab to prevent the
      conversion of dry age-related macular degeneration to neovascular AMD in high risk eyes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults over 50 years old

          -  Able to sign informed consent and comply with the study protocol for the duration of
             the two years.

          -  Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in one eye (study eye) •At time of
             enrollment, fellow non-study eye must have recently diagnosed (not more than 2 years
             prior to enrollment), angiographically documented, previously untreated prior to
             diagnosis, CNV lesion (i.e., leakage on fluorescein angiography AND subretinal,
             intraretinal, or sub-RPE fluid on OCT) secondary to age-related macular degeneration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with verteporfin PDT, Macugen®, Lucentis®, intravitreal Avastin®,
             intravitreal Eylea®, thermal laser, external beam radiation or other AMD therapy in
             the study eye.

          -  History of macular hole in study eye.

          -  History of vitrectomy in study eye.

          -  Lens extraction or implantation within the last 3 months.

          -  Capsulotomy within the last 1 month.

          -  Lens or other media opacity that would preclude good fundus photography or angiography
             within the next 2 years.

          -  Nevus &gt; 2 disc areas within 3000 microns of the foveal center or with fluid or leakage
             on fluorescein angiography.

          -  Macular edema or signs of diabetic retinopathy more severe than 10 red dots
             (microaneurysms or blot hemorrhages).

          -  Retinal changes related to high myopia and no myopic correction greater than 8.00
             diopters spherical equivalent [sphere + ½ cylinder].

          -  Any progressive ocular disease that would affect visual acuity within the next 2
             years.

          -  Previous participation in any studies of investigational drugs likely to have ocular
             effects within 30 days preceding the initial study treatment.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic anti-VEGF agents.

          -  Active or recent (within 4 weeks) intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in
             the study eye.

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye.

          -  For subjects who have undergone prior refractive or cataract surgery in the study eye,
             the preoperative refractive error in the study eye cannot exceed 8 diopters of myopia.

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure &gt; 25 mmHg)
             despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication).

          -  Patients who are unable to be photographed to document CNV due to known allergy to
             fluorescein dye, lack of venous access or cataract obscuring the CNV.

          -  Patients with other ocular diseases that can compromise the visual acuity of the study
             eye such as amblyopia and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

          -  Current treatment for active systemic infection.

          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases such as cardiovascular
             disease, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal
             disorders.

          -  History of recurrent significant infections or bacterial infections.

          -  Inability to comply with study or follow-up procedures.

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation Premenopausal women not using
             adequate contraception. The following are considered effective means of contraception:
             surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier contraception with
             either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel, an IUD, or
             contraceptive hormone implant or patch.

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated

          -  Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial
