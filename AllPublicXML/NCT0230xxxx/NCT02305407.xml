  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) are reported to suffer from considerable
      impairment of executive function/attention. Although reduced cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) in
      frontal areas has been detected by perfusion MRI and then confirmed to be associated with
      executive dysfunction in adult MMD, the structural and functional changes is still unclear
      with progression of executive dysfunction. Furthermore, it is very important to study the
      association between the neurocognitive and radiological improvement after surgical
      revascularization, so as to help detecting cerebral regions which are involved in executive
      deterioration or improvement after surgery. Then the investigators can determine whether
      these regions can be used as indicators to decide rational therapeutic schedule and timing of
      adult MMD with executive dysfunction.

      Thus the aim of this study is to primarily find out the neuropsychological and radiological
      correlates in adult MMD, and then to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of surgical
      revascularization in prevention of executive dysfunction in adult MMD.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies of adult moyamoya disease (MMD) have revealed that vascular cognitive
      impairment (VCI) is the consequence of ischemic damage to dynamic factors such as cerebral
      hypoperfusion, rather than to cerebral gray matter. However, it is still unclear which
      regions are affected by MMD and how these regions respond to the progressive cognitive
      decline. In other way, the investigators need to detect spatial patterns in the brain
      activity of MMD in order to understand its pathophysiological nature.

      Surgical revascularization has been accepted as the only effective form of treatment in
      preventing future ischemic episodes. However, its effectiveness in cognitive protection is
      still unknown. Thus, the investigators determine to quantitatively evaluate cognitive and
      radiological outcomes in adult MMD postoperatively and during follow-ups.
