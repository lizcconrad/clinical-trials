      Phase I/II, Open-labeled, Prospective, Multi-center study of a Pretargeted Radioimmunotherapy
      in metastatic colorectal cancer with ractionated injections of TF2 plus 90Y-IMP288
      (RITCOLON).

    <textblock>
      This study investigates a pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (pRAIT) with the
      anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) TF2 bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsMAb) and the
      90Y-IMP288 radio-labeled peptide.

      TF2 will be given once a week for 3 successive weeks at 75 mg/m2 per dose. IMP288 will be
      given 3 times, 1 day after each TF2 injection. IMP288 will be radio-labeled with 111In
      (imaging) for the first injection and then 90Y (therapy) for the 2 subsequent injections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Metastatic colorectal cancer and failure to standard therapies (5-fluorouracil,
             irinotecan, oxaliplatin, anti-vascular endothelium growth factor, anti-epidermal
             growth factors in patients with RAS wild type tumors). A previous line with

          4. Given signed, written informed consent

          5. Existence of at least one measurable tumor lesion by CT or MRI at the time of
             treatment, but no single lesion ≥ 8 cm in diameter.

          6. At least 4 weeks recovery period after any major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy,
             and total recovery from any acute toxicities associated with these prior treatments.

             the cervix are eligible, while patients with other prior malignancies must have had at
             least a 3-year disease-free interval.

         10. Patients who received a treatment containing a nitrosourea compound will not be
             enrolled for at least 6 weeks after the end of that treatment.

         11. Known hypersensitivity to murine antibodies or proteins

         12. Immunization against TF2 for patients who has already received injection of TF2
