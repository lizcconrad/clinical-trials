    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter, non-comparative, phase IV study of panitumumab
      monotherapy in Indian subjects with previously treated, wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
      oncogene homolog (KRAS) and wild-type Neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral (v-ras) oncogene
      homolog (NRAS), metastatic colorectal cancer. This study is designed to fulfil the
      requirement of the Indian regulatory authority to characterize the safety and tolerability of
      panitumumab when administered to Indian subjects with wild-type KRAS and wild-type NRAS
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Approximately 58 Indian subjects with previously treated
      wild-type KRAS and wild-type NRAS, metastatic colorectal cancer will be enrolled in order to
      achieve the target enrollment of 50 evaluable subjects who have received at least one dose of
      panitumumab. Subjects will receive panitumumab 6 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously
      every 14 days until disease progression, intolerability, withdrawal of consent, or death. All
      subjects will be followed at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the last administration of
      panitumumab, unless the treatment was discontinued due to withdrawal of consent or death of
      the subject.
