      Background: Getting ready for a colonoscopy is difficult and involves a lot of steps. The
      information given to patients is very important to adherence to treatment. The investigators
      have created a novel smart phone application (SPA) aimed to increased bowel preparation
      quality and patient satisfaction, using different educational tools.

      Methods: The investigators have performed a prospective, endoscopist-blinded, randomized,
      controlled trial. The investigators have enrolled 260 outpatients owners of a smartphone.
      Patients were randomly allocated to two different protocols: instructions provided by SPA
      (SPA group; n=108) or written instructions with visual aids (control group; n=152). All
      procedures were performed in afternoon time and patients received the same purgative regimen
      (2-L PEG solution plus ascorbic acid), in a full-dose same-day regimen. The day before
      colonoscopy (Baseline), patients initiated low fiber diet. The study was designed to detect
      an improvement in quality of bowel preparation using the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS)
      scale. The effect of protocol on patient satisfaction was assessed with a specific
      questionnaire at time of the colonoscopy.

    <measure>Bowel Preparation Was Evaluated Using the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). The Scale Was the Primary Outcome Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of bowel cleansing is evaluated after colonoscopy (Day 1). Baseline the patients initiated low fiber diet in the 24 hours prior to colonoscopy. The HCS uses a 5-point qualitative scale in 5 separate colon segments. HCS is the sum of 5 segments, ranging from 0 (worst possible outcome) to 20 (best possible outcome). Global score assesses the quality of bowel cleansing: Successful (A or B) / unsuccessful (C or D). A: All segments scored 3 or 4; B: One or more segments scored 2; C: One or more segments scored 1; and D: One or more segments scored 0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Were Assessed With a Specific Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction were assessed with a specific questionnaire before colonoscopy. Patients were asked if they used the application and their satisfaction with the app. Again, the endoscopist was blinded to the answers. The items read as follows: (1) &quot;Do you have experience with a previous colonoscopy?&quot;; (2) &quot;Have you used the phone application?&quot;; (3) &quot;How easy was the preparation for colonoscopy?&quot;; (4) &quot;Which is your level of satisfaction with the bowel preparation?&quot;; (5) &quot;Would you like to repeat the same preparation in the future?&quot;; (6) &quot;Did you have any difficulty with the preparation?&quot;. Patient responses to the questionnaire were categorical (yes or no; questions 1, 2, 5, and 6) or numerical scale answers (0 to 10), from very difficult or very bad (0 or close to 0) to very easy or very good (10 or close to 10) (items 3 and 4).</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to SPA group were instructed on how to free-download the application onto their smartphone. Each patient enters the date and time of his colonoscopy and timed alerts appeared on the phone to alert the patient of the next step in bowel preparation. In addition to the alerts, the app assists in bowel preparation by explaining the procedure, providing tips, examples of low fiber diet, and displaying pictures of preparation quality and educational video to explain how to prepare the purgative solution.Finally, the patient can obtain a checklist to confirm all steps.</description>

        <title>Patient Satisfaction Were Assessed With a Specific Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Patient satisfaction were assessed with a specific questionnaire before colonoscopy. Patients were asked if they used the application and their satisfaction with the app. Again, the endoscopist was blinded to the answers. The items read as follows: (1) “Do you have experience with a previous colonoscopy?”; (2) “Have you used the phone application?”; (3) “How easy was the preparation for colonoscopy?”; (4) “Which is your level of satisfaction with the bowel preparation?”; (5) “Would you like to repeat the same preparation in the future?”; (6) “Did you have any difficulty with the preparation?”. Patient responses to the questionnaire were categorical (yes or no; questions 1, 2, 5, and 6) or numerical scale answers (0 to 10), from very difficult or very bad (0 or close to 0) to very easy or very good (10 or close to 10) (items 3 and 4).</description>

            <description>Patients assigned to SPA group were instructed on how to free-download the application onto their smartphone. Each patient enters the date and time of his colonoscopy and timed alerts appeared on the phone to alert the patient of the next step in bowel preparation. In addition to the alerts, the app assists in bowel preparation by explaining the procedure, providing tips, examples of low fiber diet, and displaying pictures of preparation quality and educational video to explain how to prepare the purgative solution.Finally, the patient can obtain a checklist to confirm all steps.
