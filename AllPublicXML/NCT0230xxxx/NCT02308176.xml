      INTRODUCTION: Obesity is the most common metabolic problem and its genesis and maintenance
      there is always a positive energy balance, with less energy expenditure than that obtained
      from the intake. Low physical activity is often an important factor in this lower spending.
      Medical advice is useful for determining changes in the habits of life of patients, however,
      the changes produced by the council do not last over time, so it would be necessary to
      establish enforcement mechanisms as with mobile technology, because it could improve the
      adhesion of obese patients to therapy. OBJECTIVE: Primary: To evaluate the effectiveness of
      an app as an adjunct to medical advice to promote healthy living habits (sport and diet) to
      lose weight in a population of obese or overweight adult patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Open
      randomized controlled clinical trial with clinical practice (health advice for physical
      activity and sport). STUDY POPULATION: Obese or overweight adults patients of Araba aged
      between 18-45 years who be in Contemplation stage with smartphone. Variables: Primary
      endpoint: Weight (kg); Secondary variables: BMI (kg/cm2); blood pressure (mm Hg); heart rate;
      Plasma cholesterol (mg / dl); HbA1c; score on the satisfaction questionnaire; index of
      physical exercise (IPAQ) (METs); quitting tobacco (yes / no); Waist circumference (cm).
      Statistical analysis: The primary endpoint (weight reduction) will be evaluated by covariance
      analysis adjusting by baseline weight, and other confounding variables (sex, age, level of
      education..) Simple size: 48 patients by arm plus 20% to cover losses to follow.
