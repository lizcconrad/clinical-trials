    <textblock>
      This Phase I, open label, study will investigate the effects of VentriGel injection in
      patients who have experienced a first, large ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
      treated by PCI within the past 3 years and have evidence of left ventricular remodeling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the safety and feasibility of VentriGel delivered trans-endocardially to subjects
      with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 25 to 45% secondary to MI. Secondary endpoints
      will look at efficacy variables of ESV, EDV, EF, scar mass.
