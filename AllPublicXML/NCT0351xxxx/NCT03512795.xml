  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of HIV resistance to antiretrovirals (Sanger sequencing on RNA) is difficult
      when the viral load is undetectable or during therapeutic breaks. In these situations, the
      high throughput sequencing (SHD) can be done on proviral DNA in order to characterize
      resistant variants with improved specificity.

      This study is a cross-sectional study which will require only one additional tube which can
      be taken during a routine check-up as part of the usual follow-up of the individuals
      included.
