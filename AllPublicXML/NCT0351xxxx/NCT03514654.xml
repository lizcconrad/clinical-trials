  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes women have more than one breast cancer in the same breast at the same time. These
      women are usually offered a mastectomy (removal of that breast) and breast reconstruction. It
      may be possible to treat these patients by removing each cancer using breast-saving surgery
      (lumpectomies), used for women with only one breast cancer. Databases show that women who had
      lumpectomies did well, but they may have been healthier before the surgery than those who had
      a mastectomy. The investigators need to be sure that lumpectomy is effective, safe, and
      acceptable for this patient group before making it universally available.

      The investigators will run a small study to evaluate whether a sufficient number of eligible
      patients can be identified and are willing to accept randomisation of the interventions in
      question. Recruitment and compliance rates of which will inform the feasibility and design of
      a larger trial. This will comprise a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in women with
      Multiple Ipsilateral Breast cancer (MIBC) requiring surgery. Participants will receive either
      Therapeutic Mammoplasty (TM) following excision of each cancer focus or mastectomy (+/-
      reconstruction). Patients will be randomised (1:1) into either intervention or control
      group.Therapeutic mammoplasty is an operation to remove breast cancer(s) whilst also
      significantly reducing the size of the breast. Therapeutic mammoplasty can be used to remove
      more than one cancer in the breast using separate lumpectomies. Both skin and breast tissue
      are removed, leaving scars similar to those seen after a standard breast reduction. Each
      patient is followed up for 12 months post treatment with a total of 50 patients recruited.
      Timings of the follow-up visits are aligned with standard of care practice for this patient
      population with quality of life questionnaires and clinical photographs completed before and
      after surgery. Twenty women will also be invited to an optional semi-structured interview at
      twelve months.
