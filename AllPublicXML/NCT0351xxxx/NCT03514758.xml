  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methodical evaluation of novel sound changing principles in CE-labelled Sonova brand
      hearing instruments (e.g. Phonak hearing instruments) is intended to be conducted on hearing
      impaired participants. These sound changing principles are enabled by respective hearing
      instrument technologies and hearing instrument algorithms. The aim of the study is to
      investigate and assess strengths and weaknesses of these novel sound changing principles in
      terms of hearing performance to determine their application in hearing instruments (Phase of
      development). Both, objective laboratory measurements as well as subjective evaluations in
      real life environment will be carried out. This will be a controlled, single blinded and
      randomised active comparator clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at the
      University Hospital of Zürich.
