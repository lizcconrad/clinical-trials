  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unemployment rate is quite high among adults with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      Inadequate transition planning during high school and gaps between vocational needs and
      availability of evidence-based services help explain the struggles of transition-age youth at
      obtaining employment. There is a paucity of research on developing and evaluating services to
      support the transition to the work force after graduating from high school. The lack of
      available resources to support transition-age youth with an ASD speaks to the need to develop
      interventions that ameliorate obstacles to employment and help support the transition to the
      work force. Due to the social deficits characterizing ASD innovative interventions could
      target preparing job interview skills for students facing the transition to employment as the
      job interview is a critical gateway to securing a job offer. Thus, the overarching goal of
      this study is to modify an existing virtual reality job interview skills training program for
      use in high school students with ASD and to test the feasibility and effectiveness of
      conducting this intervention in a high school setting via a small controlled trial. Thus,
      study's first aim is to modify the existing 'Virtual Reality Job Interview Training' program
      to meet the specific needs of high school seniors with ASD. This will accomplish this by
      conducting in depth interviews with high school students with ASD and their vocational
      counselors to solicit feedback to modify the current training's learning goals, content,
      usability, and simulated interview scripts to meet the specific needs of transition age
      youth. An expert panel will determine the final modifications to the training program based
      on the results of the qualitative data analysis and their own views of the program. Second
      aim of the study is to conduct a pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
      portability, fidelity and preliminary effectiveness of the modified intervention in a
      randomized controlled trial. This study will also explore potential mechanisms for
      effectiveness and collect pilot implementation data.
