  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of obesity is based on a multidisciplinary approach and justifies the use of
      surgery in patients with the most severe forms. Surgery for obesity or bariatric surgery
      generally allows rapid and significant weight loss however it is associated with significant
      risks, and its long-term results remain heterogeneous and unpredictable. Long-term data will
      clarify the role of different types of bariatric surgery in surgical strategy, improve
      patient information and identify predictors of failure in order to provide personalised and
      tailored surgery for each candidate .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is insufficient data to determine the persistence over time of the positive
      results of bariatric surgery on weight loss. Moreover, there is no consensus or criteria for
      choosing one surgical weight loss procedure over another. The best choice for one patient may
      not be the most appropriate for another.

      The results of this project will allow to better select obese patients likely to benefit from
      bariatric surgery, and to further personalise the management of severe obesity.

        The project relies on the network of Specialised Centres for the Management of Severe
        Obesity (Lille, Arras, Boulogne, Valenciennes).

        Patients with severe obesity who underwent bariatric surgery 5 years ago will be included
        in each of the centre, during the usual multidisciplinary care visit.
