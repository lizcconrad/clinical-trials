  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab when given with glycosylated recombinant
      human interleukin-7 (CYT107) works in treating participants with urothelial carcinoma that
      has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes, cannot be removed by surgery, or has spread to
      other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. CYT107 is a biological product naturally made by
      the body that may stimulate the immune system to destroy tumor cells. Giving atezolizumab and
      CYT107 may work better in treating participants with locally advanced, inoperable, or
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of the investigational treatment combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of the investigational treatment combination.

      II. The clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response
      (DOR), as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and
      immune-related (ir) RECIST, and overall survival (OS).

      III. The CBR, PFS, DOR, and OS in all patients and patients stratified by PD-L1 expression
      levels in the tumor microenvironment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immune correlates of the clinical activity of the investigational
      treatment combination.

      II. Explore the effect of the investigational treatment combination on the number and
      phenotype of tumor-specific T cells in the peripheral blood.

      III. Investigate for evidence that the investigational treatment combination increases the
      exposure of bladder cancer-specific antigens (e.g., cancer/testis antigens or neoantigens).

      IV. Investigate changes in tumor microenvironment that correlate with response or provide
      information on potential actionable causes for lack of clinical benefit.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP 1: Participants receive CYT107 intramuscularly (IM) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and
      atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1. Following cycle 1,
      participants receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses with atezolizumab
      repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP 2: Participants receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every
      12 weeks for up to 2 years.

          -  Patients who have had a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before initiation of
             study treatment or anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required
