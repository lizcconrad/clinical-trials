  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older persons are at riskt for falls and fractures. After hip surgery they are normally
      treated with physical or occupational therapy. The additional use of computer based exercise
      games for training and the acceptance of such a technology are unclear. Thus, we plant to
      assess the above outcome ins an observational pilot study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls and fall-associated fractures have a big medical burden on our societies. Older persons
      who suffer from a fall that leads to a trauma and fracture often loose functional capacity.
      They may have prolonged mobility problems and are at risk for long-term care or nursing home
      institutionalization. To date, measures to prevent such negative outcomes are early
      mobilization and functional physical or occupational therapy immediately following orthopedic
      surgery. In addition, patients usually are asked to train at home after hospital discharge.
      This can be achieved by a home training program or by ambulatory physical therapy. Recent
      technological development has introduced computerized training and gaming platforms into
      geriatric rehabilitation settings and home exercise training. Games that have been developed
      for a younger population have now been adapted to the needs of older persons. A recent
      systematic review has demonstrated that such platforms. for example Wii significantly improve
      balance and therefore have the potential to prevent falls]. However to date such platforms
      have not been evaluated in a defined geriatric hospital patient population (e.g. after a hip
      fracture) as an adjunct to in-hospital physical therapy. Thus, such platforms could be
      offered as an additional training opportunity.

    <description>Patients who are willing to use the computer game and who have given written informed consent shall have three instruction sessions by a physiotherapist instructor. They will then asked to use the platform at least 3 times per week at their own discretion. The platform will be installed in the patient room, alternatively in a defined training room. The patient will be free to choose the time and duration of the gaming. This allows the patients to select times that do not interfere with their usual therapy schedule or visits (e.g. evening or weekends). Prior to discharge compliance with the platform will be monitored by analyzing the gaming data of each patient.</description>
