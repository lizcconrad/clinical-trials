    <textblock>
      A retrospective study was performed on 8 eyes of 8 patients who underwent amniotic membrane
      graft after diffuse conjunctival squamous cell neoplasia excision followed by topical
      mitomycin C 0.04% eye drop between March 2014 and January 2018.

    <textblock>
      Surgical excision of the conjunctival tumour without safety margins. A superficial
      keratectomy was performed for corneal lesion then double freeze-thaw cryotherapy was applied
      to limbal edge and conjunctival margins.The amniotic membrane graft was secure and attached
      to the sclera and conjunctiva using ﬁbrin glue.Topical mitomycin C 0.04%eye drop was
      prescribed 4 times daily per treatment cycle (1 cycle=1 week on 1 week off).
