  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass, including anastomosis of the superficial temporal
      artery to the middle cerebral artery and indirect bypass, can help prevent further ischaemic
      attacks in patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD). However, there is no established standard
      for the selection of the recipient vessels. In most situations, surgeons choose the recipient
      vessels with their own experiences. Intraoperative Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography using
      Flow800 software and multimodal neuronavigation can be used to assess the real-time cerebral
      blood flow velocity and perfusion of local brain tissue for better selection of the recipient
      vessels. Thus the aim of this study is to to determine whether direct bypass surgery combined
      with multimodal neuronavigation is superior to traditional direct bypass procedure alone in
      adult ischemic MMD patients.

    <textblock>
      There are no effective medical therapies for moyamoya disease. Through the provision of
      collateral pathways, surgical revascularisation is the most successful therapy to improve
      cerebral haemodynamics, and to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke. Surgical procedures for
      moyamoya disease can be classified into three categories: direct bypass, indirect bypass, and
      combined bypass. Although surgeons have their own experience choosing the recipient
      vessels,no standard has been established based on a worldwide consensus.

      Intraoperative ICG angiography using Flow800 software and multimodal neuronavigation
      (structure combined with perfusion MRI sequence) can be used to assess the real-time cerebral
      blood flow velocity and perfusion of local brain tissue, which is contribute to choose a
      recipient vessels with relative low cerebral blood flow velocity and perfusion.

      Therefore,the PBM study in our institution is designed to compare the direct bypass surgery
      with multimodal neuronavigation with traditional direct bypass procedure alone in preventing
      any ischemic event afterwards after cerebral revascularization surgery in adult ischemic MMD
      patients.

    <description>With the brain cortex exposed after craniotomy, an initial ICG fluorescence angiography will be performed. ICG fluorescence angiography using Flow800 software to determine blood flow velocity and cortical perfusion in different candidate receptors. And electromagnetic neuronavigation system is used to evaluate the cerebral flow under different candidate recipient vessels. The treatment planning station will be situated based on the multimodal neuronavigation data. The vessel was chose as the receptor with lower flow velocity and lower cerebral perfusion area to perform anastomosis. Then a direct bypass surgery will be performed just like in the empirical direct bypass surgery group.</description>
