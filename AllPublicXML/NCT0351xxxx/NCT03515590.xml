  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the changes in blood lipids and feelings of satiety
      after consumption of oil-in-water emulsions in which the droplets are in either the liquid or
      solid (i.e. crystalline) states.

    <textblock>
      A double blinded randomized cross-over acute meal study will be carried out in which 15
      healthy male participants will attend two study visits, separated by at least one week. On
      each study visit, fasted participants will consume either the solid or the liquid emulsion,
      in a randomized order. Both emulsions tested will have the exact same composition only
      differing in the physical state of the lipid emulsions, in order to isolate the impact of
      physical state, specifically, on metabolic response. Postprandial lipemia and satiety will be
      measured for 6 hours after consumption of the test beverage. The study meals will include
      crushed acetominophen, the appearance of which will be measured in plasma as a measure of
      liquid content gastric emptying. Participants will be asked to maintain their usual lifestyle
      habits throughout the study, with some changes in the 48 hour period leading up to each of
      the two visits.

    <description>This will be a 500 mL beverage emulsion in which the droplets are crystalline. It will have identical composition to the other intervention, i.e. in one the lipid droplets are solid (i.e. crystallized) and the other in which they remain liquid will be introduced at least 7 days apart. The differences in physical state will be achieved simply by changing the temperatures the emulsions are held at. The emulsion will contain 10 % of the lipid palm stearin with 0.4% of the emulsifier sorbitan monostearate (Span60).</description>
