  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate haemodialysis treatment using a medium cut-off dialysis
      membrane (Theranova) compared with on-line haemodiafiltration treatment with respect to
      markers of endothelial health (plasma endothelial microvesicle levels, pro-inflammatory and
      pro-coagulant markers).

      This study will also compare the 2 treatment modalities with respect to several other outcome
      measures including patient-reported outcome measures, haemodynamic parameters and advanced
      glycation end-products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, methods of improving outcomes for haemodialysis patients have focused on improving
      small molecule clearance (urea); however, the benefits do not appear to be linear and
      increasing Kt/V above 1.3 shows no benefit. Current dialysis therapies are unable to provide
      effective clearance of larger &quot;middle molecules&quot; (between 20kDa and 60kDa) and retention of
      these molecules may be linked to poor outcomes in haemodialysis patients.

      Medium cut-off (MCO) dialysis membranes have been recently developed to address this area of
      unmet need and provide an enhanced clearance of some larger middle molecules when compared
      with high flux haemodialysis (HFHD) and even high volume haemodiafiltration (HDF). The
      clinical benefit of this therapy is yet to be defined.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of HDx therapy (expanded haemodialysis
      therapy through the use of a MCO haemodialysis membrane- Theranova) on vascular endothelial
      and inflammatory biomarkers compared with high volume HDF therapy. Through the use of
      endothelial microvesicles (EMV) as a marker of vascular endothelial health, which strongly
      correlate with cardiovascular outcomes in end-stage real disease (ESRD) patients, this pilot
      study will take the first steps into exploring whether HDx treatment provides clinical
      benefits in addition to its simplicity of implementation. Additionally, other important
      parameters, such as dialysis recovery time, patient-reported outcome measures and volume
      management will also be explored and compared with high volume HDF.
