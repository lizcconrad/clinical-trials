  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease, stroke and TBI are frequently observed brain disorders, causing
      significant morbidity. For none of these disorders, there are in vivo diagnostic biomarkers
      available that allow determination of disease burden, patient-specific prognosis and therapy
      follow-up. However, they all share a similar mechanism that may cause accumulation of tau
      oligomers in the brain, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive and/or behavioral impairment.
      Until recently, the only way to quantify synaptic density and tau deposition was using
      post-mortem immunohistochemistry. Now, in vivo Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of
      synaptic density has become possible trough development of 11C-UCB-J, a levetiracetam-based
      radioligand, expressing high affinity and specificity for SV2A. Furthermore, the novel
      radioligand 18F-MK-6240, specifically targeting tau deposits, was clinically implemented in
      our center. Through PET-MR, we can visualize the cascade of tau deposition, synaptic loss and
      degeneration of grey and white matter and relate these pathologic features to cognitive and
      behavioral deterioration. The goal of the study is to: 1) measure tau deposition and loss of
      synaptic density in these conditions as a potential measure for disease load 2) determination
      of the mid-term (2 years) monitoring capacity of combined functional-structural PET-MR
      imaging 3) relate progression of the imaging markers to cognitive and/or behavioral decline
      and 4) determination of the optimal combination of PET-MR metrics for early identification
      and risk-stratification of cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction in de novo patients.
