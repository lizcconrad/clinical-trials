  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the utility of biomarker-based triage for study participants with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without prior systemic therapy. Study
      participants within groups defined by a biomarker-based classifier (gene expression profile
      [GEP] and tumor mutational burden [TMB]) will be randomized to receive pembrolizumab in
      combination with MK-4280 or lenvatinib. The primary hypotheses are as follows: In
      participants receiving pembrolizumab in combination with either MK-4280 or lenvatinib, the
      Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be 1) greater than 5% among participants with low GEP and
      low TMB, 2) greater than 20% among participants with low GEP and high TMB, 3) greater than
      20% among participants with high GEP and low TMB, and 4) greater than 45% among participants
      with high GEP and high TMB.

    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters [SOD] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by local site.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by local site.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants in each treatment arm experiencing an AE will be reported.</description>
