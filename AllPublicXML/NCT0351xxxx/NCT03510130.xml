  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery rates have risen in the US in a dramatic fashion from less than 5% in the
      1960 to 32.7% by 2013 with stable rate around 32-33% in the last five years , cesarean
      delivery is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, Labor arrest is the
      most common indication for cesarean delivery, Maternal position during the second stage of
      labor has been suggested to affect the risk of instrumental vaginal delivery. A Cochrane
      review of position in the second stage of labor in women without epidural showed a reduction
      in instrumental vaginal delivery in the upright group, although the quality of the included
      trials was reported to be generally poor, A Cochrane review of position in the second stage
      of labour for women with epidural analgesia was published in 2017, This review included
      trials that compared upright with recumbent positions and suggested no effect.

      No prior studies examined whether maternal legs movement during the second stage of labor has
      any effect on the rate of operative deliveries.
