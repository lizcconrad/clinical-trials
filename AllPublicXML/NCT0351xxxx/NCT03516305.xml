    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single dose, pharmacokinetic study in 36 healthy adult
      male and female volunteers, including 18 smokers and 18 non-smokers. All subjects will be
      administered a single inhaled dose of Staccato alprazolam 1 mg via hand-held inhaler. Blood
      samples will be drawn for pharmacokinetic analysis. Eligible subjects are admitted to Phase 1
      unit for up to 48 hours. Subjects will receive a post-study safety phone call 14 days(± 2
      days) after dosing.

        3. Able to speak, read, and understand English and are willing and able to provide written
        informed consent on an IRB-approved form prior to the initiation of any study procedures.

        4. Willing and able to be confined to a clinical research facility for up to 48 hours
        (including 2 nights) and comply with the study schedule and study requirements.

        5. Normal spirometry at screening as demonstrated by FEVI +/- 80% of predicted and FVC +/-
        80% of predicted.

        6. Adequate veins, as assessed by the Investigator or Investigator's designee, that are
        suitable for the required number and frequency of PK blood draws in this study.

        7. In otherwise good general health as determined by a complete medical history, physical
        examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), blood chemistry profile, hematology, serology
        (HIV-l/2Ab, HBsAg, HCV Ab), and urinalysis at screening.

        8. Female participants (if of child-bearing potential and sexually active) and male
        participants (if sexually active with a partner of child-bearing potential) who agree to

          2. Significant hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, cardiovascular endocrine, neurologic
             (including history of seizures or stroke), or hematologic disease.

          3. Any acute illness in the 5 days prior to Visit 2.

          4. Upper respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks of Visit 2 or bronchitis or pneumonia

             acetaminophen, ibuprofen or ongoing doses of oral contraceptives or vitamins--within 5
             days prior to study drug administration.

         10. A history within the past 2 years of drug or alcohol dependence or abuse.

         11. Positive test for alcohol or a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse at screening

         12. A positive HIV test.

         13. Breastfeeding or a positive pregnancy test at screening (female subjects).

         14. Clinically significant ECG abnormality.

         15. Hypotension or hypertension, at screening or baseline.

         16. Poor veins in the opinion of the Investigator or the Investigator's designee such that
             the participant is judged to likely have difficult venipuncture during the study.

         17. Any other disease or condition, by history, physical examination, or laboratory
             abnormalities that in the investigator's opinion, would present undue risk to the
             subject, or may confound the interpretation of study results.

         18. Participation in another clinical trial within 2 months of the beginning of the
             present study, or blood donation or comparable blood loss (&gt;350mL) within 2 months
