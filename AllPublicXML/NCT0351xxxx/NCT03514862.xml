    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators propose to evaluate the impact of a Mindfulness-Based
      Intervention (MBI) Program on the well-being of University of Miami (UM) clinicians and
      faculty/staff. If successfully implemented and proven to be effective, this training program
      may be disseminated to other interested medical personnel.

    <description>Stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, a short-form 4 item scale with a range of 0 to 16, with higher scores representing greater stress. Baseline responses will be compared to 4-week assessment responses of the control and intervention groups. Results between the control and intervention groups will be compared for statistical significance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in measure of burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Burnout is measured using the 19-item Copenhagen Burnout Inventory including subscales assessing personal burnout, work-related burnout and patient-related burnout. Scores range from 0 to 100. Total score on the scale is the average of the scores on the items with a higher mean representing greater burnout. Baseline responses will be compared to 4-week assessment responses of the control and intervention groups. Results between the control and intervention groups will be compared for statistical significance.</description>
