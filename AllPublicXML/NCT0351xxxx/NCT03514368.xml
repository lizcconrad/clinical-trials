      This trial is a translational, open-label, multi-site, prospective cohort study of 440
      patients aiming to identify and to monitor immunological biomarkers associated with
      therapeutic response to immune checkpoints blockade (ICB), in patients with multiple types of
      advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) solid cancers.

      The study will be conducted on a population of patients receiving ICB (anti-PD-1 or
      anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA4, alone or in combination) in the context of either routine care or a
      clinical study protocol.

      Patients with any of the following tumor types may be enrolled in the trial:

        -  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),

        -  Head and neck cancer,

        -  Melanoma,

        -  Bladder cancer,

        -  Other tumor types when Immuno-Oncology agent is expected to be efficient or when a
           clinical trial is an option.

      For each included patient, tumor biopsy specimens and blood samples will be collected at
      different time points.

      All included patients will be followed-up until progression. After this date, survival data
      will be collected.

             limited to, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAb alone or in combination has been
             decided.

          4. Archived frozen tumor specimen available or feasible for pre-treatment tumor biopsy.

          5. Current treatment with ICB not yet started.
