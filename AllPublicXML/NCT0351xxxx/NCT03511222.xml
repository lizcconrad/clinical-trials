  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that vorolanib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors
      (pembrolizumab for gastric/gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancers and nivolumab for
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) may improve immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming treatment
      resistance of checkpoint inhibitors in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.

             contact allergens) is permitted.

          -  Active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may
             affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic
             corticosteroids. This includes but is not limited to: history of immune-related
             neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy,

             and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome, and psoriasis controlled with topical
             medication, and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA)
             or anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ
             involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be
             eligible. Patients with type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to
             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event) are eligible.
