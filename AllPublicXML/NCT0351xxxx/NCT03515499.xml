  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Financial incentives have been suggested as a possible means for increasing adherence to
      asthma medications. This study will evaluate an incentive strategy (daily small reward for
      adherence) in maintaining high levels of adherence as tracked by adherence sensors in
      adolescents with asthma.

      Two groups will be enrolled. The control group will have mediation monitoring sensors placed
      on their controller inhalers. The treatment group will also have the monitoring sensors
      placed on their medications, however they will be paid up to $1 per day for perfect adherence
      for 3 months. Both groups will be monitored for 4 months. 10 subjects will be chosen from
      each group to complete semi-structured phone interviews
