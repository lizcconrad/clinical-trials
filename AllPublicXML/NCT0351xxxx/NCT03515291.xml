  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injury to the heart, which may occur following a heart attack or owing to the mechanical
      effect of high blood pressure, leads to scarring (fibrosis) of the heart muscle. Fibrosis of
      the muscle can cause impaired pumping of the heart, which can lead to heart failure, and the
      abnormal conduction of electrical signals through the heart. This may in turn lead to
      abnormal, potentially fatal, heart rhythms. Currently, scarring of the heart muscle cannot be
      reversed and is generally progressive.

      A previous clinical study found that participants who received injections of immunomodulatory
      progenitor cells (iMP cells, &quot;Heartcel&quot;) showed a reversal of heart muscle scarring when the
      cells were injected into heart muscle during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
      However, the previous trial was a small scale study and did not have a control group. The aim
      of this study is to perform a larger scale investigation with 50 participants compared to the
      previous trial of 11, and split the 50 participants into two groups - a test group and a
      control group, so that a direct comparison may be made between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>

      Myocardial fibrosis is a currently untreatable medical condition. A previous trial reported
      that when iMP cells, a cell type of mesodermal lineage which is separate from, but shares
      characteristics with, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), were injected into the myocardium during
      CABG surgery, there was a reduction in the degree of scarring relative to baseline observed
      on 4 month and 12 month Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images.

      The previous trial was open label with 11 participants and no control group, only historic
      comparisons. The proposed trial will be larger and will include a control group. The trial
      endpoints have been updated to take account of the findings of the first trial and late
      gadolinium enhanced (LGE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, which have higher
      resolution than SPECT scans, will be used to assess the appearance of fibrosis.

      iMP cells were developed by the sponsor as an allogeneic mesodermally derived cellular
      therapy for cardiac conditions. While iMPs are plastic adherent like MSCs, iMPs do not meet
      the International Society for Cellular Therapy's definition of MSCs, though like MSCs,
      markers indicate that iMPs are immune privileged and can therefore be employed allogeneically
      without inducing a significant immune response.

      The trial is open to participants, male and female, who require CABG surgery and have 15% or
      greater left ventricular scarring. Unless part of normal clinical care, participants will be
      required to undergo a screening LGE-MRI to assess the degree of left ventricular scarring.
      The MRI however, may reveal that the individual is not eligible to participate in the study.
      If the individual is eligible, then the LGE-MRI will be used as the baseline recording and to
      plan the injection sites.

      Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 13.5 months. There will be
      two outpatient pre-operative hospital visits which will occur up to 6 weeks prior to surgery,
      though if a potential participant is an inpatient, the pre-operative eligibility/baseline
      tests can be performed over a shorter period of time as an inpatient. The CABG surgery will
      not differ from normal, except for the injections into the heart, and participants will not
      miss out on any standard care. There will then be follow up visits at 1 week, 1 month, 6
      months and 12 months post surgery. The 1 week visit may occur as an inpatient depending on
      post-operative improvement. The follow up visits will not involve overnight stays. Follow up
      visits will mainly entail an ECG, an echocardiogram, a blood test, a urine test, health
      questionnaires and a discussion about the participant's health and any adverse events.
      Specific details are available from the chief investigator, see below. The 6 month visit will
      also involve a follow up LGE-MRI for primary endpoint assessment. After 12 months,
      participation in the study will end and participants will receive only the normal post CABG
      care.

      As this is a quadruple blind randomised controlled trial, neither participants nor care staff
      will know to which group a participant is allocated. Of the 50 participants, 30 will receive
      injections of cells and 20 will receive control injections.
