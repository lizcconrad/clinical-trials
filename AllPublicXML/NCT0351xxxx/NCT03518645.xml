    <textblock>
      Study aim : To compare a novel strategy of lesion preparation with noncompliant balloons
      before implantation of BVS.

      Hypothesis: Predilatation with non-compliant balloons could facilitate optimal deployment of
      BVS. By achieving good scaffold apposition a need for post-dilatation could be significantly
      reduced. This is expected to result in better short- and long-term outcomes.

      Study design:

      Following pre-dilatation a BVS will be implanted and optical coherence tomography (OCT) will
      be performed in all patients. After OCT post-dilatation with non-compliant balloons might be
      performed if this is considered necessary by the treating interventionist. Final OCT will be
      performed in all patients. 1:1 Randomization of two strategies before the implantation of
      bioresorbable scaffolds:

        -  OPN strategy (study group): pre-dilatation with OPNÂ® NC (non-compliant) Super High
           Pressure PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) balloons

        -  standard strategy (control group): pre-dilatation with a standard (compliant) balloon

      Enrolment:

      Randomization of 50 patients

        -  25 in the OPN strategy (study group)

        -  25 in the standard strategy (control group)

    <description>The OPN NC Super High Pressure PTCA Balloon will be used as the study device for lesion preparation for BVS Absorb implantation - OPN strategy of lesion preparation. This balloon has a twin layer balloon construction, which allows a very high pressure resistance of 35 bar. The balloon has a 0.016`` lesion entry profile and is available in sizes between 1.5 and 4.5 mm and lengths of 10, 15 and 20 mm.</description>
