      Multicentric and prospective epidemiological study (NON INTERVETIONAL) to identify prognosis
      and predictive biomarkers of response to sunitinib and pazopanib as first line therapy in
      metstatic renal cell carcinoma.

      Molecular determinations will be developed ay CIMA and CNIO.

      In coming years new TKIs for the treatment of mRCC are expected to be available.
      Identificaction of novel biomarkers is required to select those patients who would most
      benefit from a particular therapeutic strategy:

      C-Met is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in cellular growth and vascular develoment, also
      identify as a proto-oncogene.

      Chemiokines: an increase in pro-angiogenic chemokines such as IL-6 &amp; IL-8 has been also
      suggested as a tumor dependent possible mechanism influencing invasion and metastasis after
      anti-VEGF therapy.

      PBRM1 (BAF 180) mutation: Second major involved gene in clear cell RCC with truncating
      mutations in 41% (92/227) of cases. Mutations appear to inactive a protein that plays role in
      remodeling the structure of genetic material.PBRM1 mutations could be (partially) involved in
      about 40% of clear cell RCC. PBRM1 may affect the processes of cell divsion in renal cells
      and could consequently be another target for new drugs.
