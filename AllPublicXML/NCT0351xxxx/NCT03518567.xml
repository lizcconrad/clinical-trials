    <textblock>
      This laboratory study will employ a multi-session experimental design to examine cue-induced
      craving for marijuana, the effect of marijuana administration (High THC) on behavioral
      economic demand for marijuana, and marijuana smoking topography. The study will recruit 100
      non-treatment seeking marijuana users who smoke marijuana at least twice weekly.

      This laboratory study will employ a multi-session experimental design to examine cue-induced
      craving for marijuana, the effect of marijuana administration (High THC) on behavioral
      economic demand for marijuana, and marijuana smoking topography. The study will recruit 100
      non-treatment seeking marijuana users who smoke marijuana at least once weekly. The
      relationship between hypothetical and actual demand for marijuana will be examined. We will
      also investigate the impact of marijuana cue exposure on demand for marijuana, and will
      examine the relationship between demand for marijuana and indices of marijuana smoking
      topography. The study will recruit 100 non-treatment seeking marijuana users who smoke
      marijuana at least once weekly to obtain a final sample of 85 with complete data (15% of
      attrition). Participants will be tested at a baseline session and during two experimental
      sessions (a marijuana cue-reactivity paradigm paired with ad libitum marijuana smoking
      session and a marijuana smoking topography session). This study will confirm the utility of
      the hypothetical marijuana purchase task as a reliable and valid tool for assessing
      behavioral economic marijuana demand.

    <measure>Change in Marijuana Purchase Task (MPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>MPT will be administered 3 times during the experimental session, up to 6 hours: at baseline, pre-marijuana cue-reactivity, and pre-smoking</time_frame>
    <description>The Marijuana Purchase Task will be used to collect data on marijuana demand. Participants indicate how much marijuana they would purchase at varying levels of price (e.g., free - $60). Indices of marijuana demand are derived from the task and used to determine the relative value of marijuana for each participant.</description>

    <time_frame>The MCQ will be administered pre- and post- marijuana cue presentation during the experimental session, up to 6 hours</time_frame>

    <description>Indices of Marijuana Smoking Topography will be obtained during the experimental session. Participants will smoke marijuana through a smoking topography device. The device tracks number of puffs, puff length, and inter-puff-interval.</description>
