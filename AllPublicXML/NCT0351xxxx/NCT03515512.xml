  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy drug as a possible treatment for IDH2
      mutant acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia while undergoing
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      The drug involved in this study is:

      -Enasidenib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved enasidenib as a treatment option
      for some cancers, but not for the specific indication under study with this protocol.

      Enasidenib is currently used to treat AML with an IDH2 mutation that has come back or has not
      improved after previous AML treatment. This study is examining whether or not enasidenib may
      be beneficial and well-tolerated as an agent to prevent the relapse of IDH2-mutated AML or
      other myeloid neoplasms after participants have undergone hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). IDH2 is an enzyme that, when mutated, can overproduce metabolites and
      compounds that contribute to the growth of tumors and cancerous cells. Enasidenib may help
      block the over production of these substances.

      There is an FDA-approved test available to detect IDH2 mutations in patients with AML, but
      for the purposes of participation in this clinical trial, an investigational test may be used
      to determine the presence of an IDH2 mutation.

      In this research study, the investigators are:

        -  Looking for the maximum dose of enasidenib that individuals can take without
           experiencing severe side effects following HSCT.

        -  Looking at how often Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD) occurs in participants taking
           enasidenib. GVHD is a complication of transplant.

        -  Assessing the rates of relapse for participants taking enasidenib after HSCT.

    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose of Enasidenib in this patient population. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level at which 0 or 1 of six patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). MTD is determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort, where 3 participants will be enrolled on the starting dose of 50 mg daily and if no DLT is experienced after a full 28-day cycle, 3 additional participants will be enrolled at the next dose level of 100mg daily. If during any dose level, 1 patient out of 3 develops a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be added to that dose level. If 2 out of the 3 patients placed on any dose level experience a DLT, the preceding dose is considered MTD. If 1 out of 6 participants has a DLT, the next higher dose level will commence accrual. If â‰¥ 2 of 6 patients have a DLT, then the preceding dose will be considered MTD.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicities are adverse events that occur during the first 28-day cycle that are considered serious enough to prevent an increase in the Enasidenib dose level. Adverse events are graded and documented per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of participants with Enasidenib related adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of treatment until 30 days after the end of treatment, treatment may continue for up to 12 28-day cycles</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with treatment related adverse events grouped by grade. Adverse events are assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4). Adverse events are considered to be related to treatment if they are deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment with Enasidenib by the investigator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 days 1, 8, and 15; day 1 of every subsequent cycle (cycles are 28-days), up to 100 days after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is graded according to a composite grading of the clinical stages of skin rash, liver function, and intestinal tract function. Skin rash is assessed by the portion of the body covered by rash, liver function is assessed based on blood bilirubin levels, and intestinal track function is assessed based on the volume of diarrhea per day. The acute GVHD grade ranges from 1 to 4 with 1 representing less severe effects and 4 the most severe. The incidence represents the proportion of participants that experienced any grade acute GVHD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 days 1, 8, and 15; Day 1 of cycles 2-12 (1 cycle is 28-days), up to 1 year of total follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative incidence of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). cGHVD is assessed as per the National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in cGVHD. cGVHD is graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The cGVHD grade is based on an aggregate score of different organ systems. The organ systems are graded from 0 to 3, with 0 being no-symptoms and 3 being the most severe symptoms. The cumulative incidence represents the proportion of participants that have any grade cGVHD.
cGVHD Grade:
Mild: Involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung), with no clinically significant functional impairment
Moderate: Involves at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no major disability or 3 or more organs or sites with no clinically significant functional impairment. A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate cGVHD
Severe: Indicates major disability caused by cGVHD. A lung score of 2 will also be considered severe cGVHD</description>

             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) during the entire study
             treatment period and through 6 months after the last dose of treatment

             long-QT syndrome

          -  Systemic infection requiring IV antibiotic or antifungal or antiviral therapy within 7
             days preceding the first dose of study drug, or other severe infection
