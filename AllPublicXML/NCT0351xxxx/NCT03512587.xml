    <textblock>
      The objetive of the study is to evaluate the effect of personalized quantum sonotherapy on
      the level of anxiety and pain in outpatients schedule for orthopedic surgery under regional
      anesthesia in a second level center. The investigators believed that personalized quantum
      sonotherapy could reduce the levels of anxiety and pain before and after surgery evaluated
      through hemodynamic variables and scales for pain (analogous visual scale) and anxiety (STAI
      Spielberger anxious state questionnaire).

    <description>To assess the effect of personalized quantum sonotherapy on the level of pain of patients taken to orthopedic surgery under regional anesthesia through pain score visual analoge score (VAS). VAS ranges from 0 to 10 being 0 no pain an 10 the worst pain ever felted. It would be measured before and after placing de sonotherapy, 24 and 48 hour after surgery.</description>

    <description>To assess the effect of personalized quantum sonotherapy on the level of anxiety of patients taken to orthopedic surgery under regional anesthesia through anxiety score Questionnaire of anxious state STAI (Spielberger). STAI is a score to meausre anxiety, it has 20 questions each one with a possible value from 0 to 3 points. Total score is evaluated adding each score for each question, and it goes from 0 to 60 points, being 60 de higest score for anxiety. It would be measured before and after placing de sonotherapy, 24 and 48 hour after surgery.</description>

    <description>Quantum sonotherapy is an alternative non-pharmacological treatment that effects a molecular reorganization that occurs after the sound stimulus. The audible words and their waves have the ability to generate vibrations and stimulate the psycho-neuro-endocrine chain, independent of the semantic meaning of the words. It is an alternative therapy that uses non-musical sound waves.</description>
