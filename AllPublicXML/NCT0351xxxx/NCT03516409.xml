  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is defined as an acute inflammation of the
      intestinal mucosa associated to the administration of antibiotics. Its aetiology seems to be
      linked to the impact of antibiotics on the normal digestive microbiota. Acute otitis media
      (AOM) is a common paediatric condition and it is one of the most commonly cited indication
      for antimicrobial therapy in children (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid).

      Treatment modalities for AAD are limited because no established treatment exists for
      non-Clostridium difficile associated AAD, except for discontinuing antibiotic therapy.
      Measures to prevent AAD include the use of probiotics. The rationale for the use of
      probiotics in AAD assumes that, considering the pathogenesis of AAD, AAD is associated with
      disturbance in the normal intestinal microbiota; administrating specific probiotic strains it
      is possible to normalize unbalanced indigenous microbiota.

      Scientific evidence suggests that prebiotics could be beneficial too. Prebiotics can act in
      synergy with probiotics, being efficacious in suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria
      that may occur during antibiotic therapy.

      Study rationale: the principal side effects of treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate include
      diarrhoea, vomiting and allergic reactions. Aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the administration of a synbiotic product, Bio-Kult Infantis®, in the
      prevention of AAD during a standard therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate to treat AOM.

      Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of a synbiotic product in the prevention of
      Antibiotics-Associated Diarrhoea (AAD) during a concomitant standard therapy with amoxicillin
      / clavulanic acid, also known as co-amoxiclav, to treat Acute Otitis Media (AOM).

      Study design: this is a multicenter, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled,
      randomized clinical study. 276 children 6 - 35 months old will be enrolled and then
      randomized into one of the two study groups (Bio-Kult Infantis® + co-amoxiclav standard
      treatment for AOM / placebo + co-amoxiclav standard treatment for AOM). A comparison will be
      performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a synbiotic product in the prevention of AAD
      during the concomitant standard therapy with co-amoxiclav.

      During the study 4 visits will have to be performed at the study centre, and extra visits
      will be performed in case of AOM relapse after recovery. The study will last for each patient
      38 ± 6 days.
