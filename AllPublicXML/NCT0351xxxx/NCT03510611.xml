      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of
      Ensartinib Capsules in Chinese Healthy Volunteers. In addition, the safety of Ensartinib
      Capsules in Chinese Healthy Volunteers who with High-fat meal or fasting state will also be
      evaluated.
