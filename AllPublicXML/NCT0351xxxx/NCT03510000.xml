  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the challenges in the design of the artificial pancreas (AP) is preventing
      postprandial hyperglycemia. Beyond algorithmic solutions, one countermeasure to postprandial
      hyperglycemia that may enhance performance of the AP is the use of adjunctive-to-insulin
      medications such as those in the Sodium Glucose-Linked Transporter 2 inhibitor class. This
      study evaluates whether use of oral empagliflozin on the background of single-hormone AP can
      improve postprandial blood glucose control. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a
      cross-over trial design by comparing open-label empagliflozin versus placebo in the setting
      of AP on separate study days that involve carbohydrate counting, simple meal announcement and
      no meal announcement strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin is a novel anti-diabetic medication and has been approved in Canada. The
      labelled indication for use of empagliflozin in clinical practice is as an adjunct therapy to
      diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. The
      investigators are proposing to use the medication as an adjunct anti-diabetic therapy in
      individuals with type 1 diabetes and would like to examine whether empagliflozin can
      alleviate need for carb-counting by eliminating post-prandial hyperglycemia in a setting of
      an artificial pancreas (AP).

      The study is designed as a randomized open-label, crossover non-inferiority trial comparing
      empagliflozin 25 mg oral daily in the setting of the single-hormone AP to single-hormone AP
      without empagliflozin in adults with type 1 diabetes. The duration of the study for each of
      the participants is about 3-9 weeks and during this time three different meal announcement
      strategies for AP will be used, on and off empagliflozin treatment.

    <description>Individuals will test insulin dosing during different meal strategies (carbohydrate counting, plain meal announcement, no meal announcement) in a setting of the single hormone artificial pancreas with or without SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) addition. After starting the empagliflozin therapy, there will be 1-2 weeks long therapy optimization period and afterwards meal strategies will be administered. Randomization will be used to determine whether participant will start meal strategies on empagliflozin or without empagliflozin, cross-over design enables all participants to undergo all combination of approaches.</description>

    <intervention_name>Meal strategies</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will use different approaches (strategies) to insulin dose estimation for ingested carbohydrates on study days. Goal of these various strategies is to recognize magnitude of empagliflozin effect in situations when artificial pancreas algorithm is working with information of different accuracy. Individual meal approach strategies include carbohydrate counting, meal size announcement and no meal announcement. The exception will be combination of no empagliflozin and no meal announcement, which didn't result in sufficient glucose control in previous trials therefore will not be repeated in a current trial. Meal approach strategies will occur on separate days- 5 days in total each day using one meal strategy for all meals during the day.</description>
