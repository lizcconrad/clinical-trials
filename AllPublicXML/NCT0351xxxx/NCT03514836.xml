      This clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of the combination of DCVAC/PCa with ONCOS-102
      in men with castration-resistant advanced metastatic prostate cancer, who have progressed
      following initial therapy with either hormones (e.g. abiraterone and enzalutamide) or
      chemotherapy.

      Male patients with castration-resistant advanced metastatic prostate cancer, who have
      progressed following initial therapy with either All patients must have at least one readily
      accessible soft tissue/nodal tumor lesion (for intra-tumoral application of ONCOS-102 and
      biopsy.

      Study Description:

        -  All patients who fulfill all eligibility criteria will undergo a leukapheresis
           procedure.

        -  ONCOS-102 administration will start within 3 weeks of leukapheresis at Week 5 (35 days
           since baseline +/- 2 days), and 3 further doses will be administered on a weekly basis

        -  Cyclophosphamide A priming bolus dose of CPO (300 mg/m2 intravenously) will be given 1-3
           days before the first (Week 5) and the fifth (Week 14) of ONCOS-102 administration.

        -  DCVAC/PCa therapy will start 6 weeks after leukapheresis at Week 8. DCVAC/PCa will be
           administered subcutaneously in cycles, always on Day 1 (+/- 3 days) of the corresponding
           cycle.
