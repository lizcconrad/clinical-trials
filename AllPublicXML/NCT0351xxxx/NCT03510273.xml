    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to evaluate the short-term safety and acceptability of the Liger
      Medical thermal coagulation device for treatment of cervical precancerous lesions. Study
      results will inform the Honduras Ministry of Health regarding potential use of the Liger
      device for precancer treatment in Honduras and results may be of interest to other Latin
      American settings as well.

      The research will be conducted in the Tegucigalpa Region in Honduras in 4 health facilities
      in urban and peri-urban settings. Participants will be women ages 30-49 who meet the study
      eligibility criteria. HPV and VIA positive women who are eligible for ablative treatment will
      be offered thermal coagulation with the Liger instrument to treat their lesions and ask about
      acceptability of the treatment. At this visit, biopsies will also be taken. Women will then
      be followed-up at 1-month to evaluate short-term safety outcomes with a physical exam and
      receive their biopsy results. Depending on their biopsy results, they will be asked to return
      for repeat screening, referred for further treatment or asked to come back for a 12-month
      study visit. At the 12-month visit after treatment women will be followed up to evaluate cure
      rates.

      A second investigational device, Pocket Colposcope, will be used to take cervix photos at the
      first study visit with participant consent. The photos will be used to explore factors
      influencing treatment failure. De-identified photos and women's diagnosis information will
      also be shared with the device developers, Duke University, for the purposes of improving
      their device. Women may choose to opt out of having cervix photos taken and still participate
      in the treatment portion of the study.

    <description>Level of pain women experienced during the thermal coagulation procedure will be calculated by the number and percent of women indicating minimal to worst possible levels of pain using the Wong-Baker FACES® pain rating scale. Women's acceptability will also be assessed by asking if they would recommend the Liger Thermocoagulator treatment to a friend or relative who needed similar treatment as well as reasons for her response.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-term safety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Short-term safety will be calculated as the number of women with each type of adverse event (numerator), divided by the total number of women treated (denominator). These are adverse events that WHO specifies as short-term safety concerns for ablative treatment and include: minor bleeding minor bleeding requiring packing or suturing; major bleeding requiring hospitalization/blood transfusion; major infections requiring hospital admission and antibiotics; damage to other organs or other surgery required such as injury to bladder or urethra; and major infections requiring hospital admission and antibiotics and pelvic inflammatory disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disappearance of lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To calculate rates of disappearance of lesions, we will include women with histologically-confirmed CIN2-3 lesions. The 12 month rate of disappearance of CIN 2-3 lesions will be calculated by dividing the number of eligible women who had no evidence of CIN 2-3 at 12 months after undergoing thermal coagulation for the treatment of their CIN2-3 lesions (numerator), divided by those women evaluated at 12 months (denominator). Analysis will include considering potential confounding factors such as clinic and provider as well as drop-out rates. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to confirm whether there are differences in rates by these potential confounding factors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment failure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of cervical photos will be a qualitative comparison of the characteristics of the uterine cervix and the pre-cancerous lesions at Visit 1 (enrollment) in women whose treatment resulted in disappearance of lesions and women with persistent pre-cancerous lesions after 12 months. The evaluation will examine what features or cervical conditions prior to treatment might be related to disappearance or persistence of lesions, such as shape of the cervix, size and location of the lesions, etc. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to confirm whether there are any differences by these features.</description>
