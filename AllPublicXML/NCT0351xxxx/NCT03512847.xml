  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims include:

        -  Exploring potential predictive molecular profiles to immunotherapy/chemotherapy

        -  Investigating the role of circulating tumor DNA as a dynamic biomarker during
           immunotherapy/chemotherapy

        -  Identifying possible resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy/chemotherapy

      Materials and methods:

      Approximately 150 patients diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC assigned for immunotherapy or
      chemotherapy will be candidates for inclusion during a 1-2 years period.

      A comprehensive molecular profiling will be made from the diagnostic biopsy. Before every
      treatment-cycle a blood sample will be taken to quantify ctDNA. At time of progressive
      disease during/after first line treatment, patients will be asked to participate in a new
      biopsy and a comprehensive molecular profiling will be performed.

      The tissue and blood samples collected will be stored in a biobank. Clinical data will be
      collected to perform a comprehensive database.

      Analysis:

      Potentially predictive molecular profiles for immunotherapy/chemotherapy will be found by
      comparison of treatment outcome for patients with specific molecular characteristics.

      Through quantification of ctDNA during treatment and upon progression, the role of ctDNA as a
      dynamic biomarker will be further strengthened.

      Differences in molecular profiles pre- and post-treatment may reveal resistance mechanisms to
      treatment. Molecular profiling on progression can be valuable in second-line treatment
      guidance.
