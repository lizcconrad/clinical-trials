  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of simulation based practice on
      anesthesiology trainee in ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane(TAP) block using an
      anesthetized porcine model.

      The residents filled out a questionnaire before and after the training session. The
      questionnaires consisted of knowledge including ultrasound anatomy and block technique,
      comfort, confidence, and axiety levels for the TAP block.

    <description>Participating residents receive lectures on TAP block and the use of ultrasound devices from an expert before training, and then receive simulation-based training for an hour from the anesthesiologist's staff. The residents performed three ultrasound guided TAP blocks using an anesthetized porcine model during the training session.
The residents filled out a questionnaire before and after the training session. Ten multiple-choice questions tested general knowledge in abdomen ultrasound and TAP block. Subjective comfort levels with ultrasound machine and block device functionality, patient positioning, proper block technique, image documentation, needle safety and overall procedural confidence and anxiety levels were reported on a 5-point Likert scale before and after training.</description>
