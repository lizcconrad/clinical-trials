      Brivaracetam (BRV) is a new antiepileptic drug approved in March 2016 by Health Canada for
      the adjunctive treatment of focal epilepsy in adults. Three phase III clinical trials have
      confirmed its efficacy with an acceptable adverse effects profile. While randomized
      controlled trials represent the gold standard in measuring intervention efficacy, the
      generalizability of these findings to usual clinical practice remains uncertain.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of BRV as an adjunctive
      treatment in epilepsy. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerability
      of BRV as an adjunctive treatment in epilepsy.

      This is a prospective and multicentre post-marketing observational study. All consecutive
      adult patients (i.e. aged at least 18 years) in whom BRV is introduced in participating
      medical centres, ambulatory or hospitalized, will be approached to participate in the study.
      We will exclude individuals with generalized epilepsy as well as those aged less than 18
      years, in order to respect current Health Canada indications. We will exclude individuals
      cognitively or physically unable to complete the study questionnaires.

      We will collect data from participants during three clinical visits with their regular
      treating physician. These will be the baseline visit, the 3-month visit (three months
      following the initiation of BRV), and the 6-month visit. At each visit, we will collect data
      on seizure type(s) and frequency. Study participants will also complete four questionnaires
      to measure irritability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life.

      There will be two primary study outcomes. These are: a) mean percent change in monthly
      seizure frequency; and b) proportion with at least a 50% decrease in seizure frequency. There
      will be several secondary study endpoints: a) mean change in irritability [measured using the
      Brief Irritability Test (BITe)]; b) mean change in generalised anxiety [measured using the
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scale]; c) mean change in depression [measured using
      the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory (NDDI-E) scale]; d) mean change in quality of
      life [measured using the 7-item Quality of Life Inventory in Epilepsy-10 (QOLIE-10) scale];
      e) the proportion of individuals that are seizure free, and f) change in distribution of
      seizure types (e.g. focal with motor seizures, generalized absence). We will query for all
      adverse effects the participant may experience.

      Study introduction/rationale:

      Brivaracetam (BRV) is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) approved in March 2016 by Health Canada
      for the adjunctive treatment of focal epilepsy in adults. Three phase III clinical trials
      (randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled) have confirmed its efficacy with an acceptable
      adverse effects profile.(Biton et al. 2014, Ryvlin et al. 2014, Klein et al. 2015,
      Ben-Menachem et al. 2016) While randomized controlled trials represent the gold standard in
      measuring intervention efficacy, the generalizability of these findings to usual clinical
      practice remains uncertain. These questions are in part because of certain aspects of the
      pivotal studies' design. These include: a) participation was limited to individuals with
      frequent focal seizures (at least eight seizures during an eight-week baseline period), with
      or without secondary generalization who were already treated with 1 or 2 AEDs; b) individuals
      aged less than 16 years and greater than 70 years (80 years in one study)(Klein, Schiemann et
      al. 2015) were excluded, as well as individuals with cerebral neoplasms, psychogenic
      non-epileptic seizures, or status epilepticus within the preceding 12 months; d) BRV was
      introduced at fixed doses without a titration period; and e) the treatment period was limited
      to 12 weeks. Inherent to any clinical trial, there remain questions as to what effect local
      clinical practice and patterns of reimbursement may have on intervention effectiveness (a
      measure of real-life efficacy that considers issues such as non-compliance). Clinical trials
      are also at high risk of the Hawthorne effect, where participants modify their behaviour
      (e.g. increased compliance) due to the knowledge that they are observed.(Delgado-Rodriguez et
      al. 2004) Canada is one of the first countries where BRV was commercialized. This allows for
      an important opportunity for investigators to carry out a prospective observational study to
      establish BRV's effectiveness and tolerability in routine clinical practice.

      Primary study objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of BRV as an adjunctive
      treatment in epilepsy.

      Secondary study objective(s):

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerability of BRV as an adjunctive
      treatment in epilepsy.

      Participant recruitment:

      This is a prospective and multicentre post-marketing observational study. As an observational
      study, the study investigators will not determine which individuals receive BRV nor how it is
      prescribed. The study investigators will not have any role in providing BRV to enrolled study
      participants.

      Data will be collected from participants during three clinical visits with their regular
      treating physician (MD). These will be the baseline visit, the 3-month visit (three months
      following the initiation of BRV), and the 6-month visit. The baseline visit will be the
      regularly scheduled clinical visit where the MD will decide to begin BRV in their patient.
      The patient will be asked by their MD if they are interested in participating in the proposed
      study. If the offer is accepted, the individual will be consented by the research assistant
      (RA). The baseline data questionnaire will be completed by the MD, with the input of the
      participant. The participant will then complete the four questionnaires to measure baseline
      irritability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. The study participant will be given a
      seizure diary and asked to prospectively record their seizures. At the 3-month visit the MD
      will record the seizure frequency (preferably based on the seizure diary but retrospectively
      assessed if necessary) and any adverse effects reported by the participant. The participant
      will complete the 3-month irritability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life measures.
      The data collected at the 3-month visit will be re-collected at the 6-month visit.

      The study is planned for 10 recruitment sites across Canada. Dr Mark Keezer (Université de
      Montréal) is the study principal investigator. The Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de
      Montréal (CHUM) is the primary study site. Véronique Cloutier (CHUM) is the primary study
      coordinator.

      Study safety endpoints:

      This is an observational study. We will include, however, a statement in the participant
      consent form stating &quot;Brivaracetam is approved by Health Canada for the adjuvant treatment of
      focal epileptic seizures in adults. It is currently not approved for the treatment of
      generalized epilepsies nor epilepsy in children. There are no data on the safety of
      brivaracetam during pregnancy and during breast feeding.&quot; If during this study there is any
      information learned by the investigators that may be relevant to the health of the
      participant, the investigators will immediately communicate this to the study participant and
      their MD.

      Study specific assessments/instruments/scales:

      The baseline data questionnaire will collect the following participant data: age, gender, age
      of epilepsy onset, type and aetiology of epilepsy, seizure type(s) and average seizure
      frequency over the preceding one month, name of the AED(s) currently used and previously
      tried, and past medical history (including psychiatric). If levetiracetam was previously
      tried but since withdrawn, the reason for its discontinuation will be noted.

      When possible, the baseline mean number of seizures per month will be calculated from the
      seizure diary (if the participant completes at least 30 days of data). This will occur
      following their recruitment into the study but before the initiation of BRV, where we expect
      there will be a delay. If at least 30 days of baseline seizure frequency are not recorded
      prospectively, the analyses will be conducted using the retrospectively collected frequency
      recorded in the baseline data questionnaire.

      The Brief Irritability Test (BITe),(Holtzman et al. 2015) Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7
      (GAD-7) scale,(Spitzer et al. 2006, Micoulaud-Franchi et al. 2016), Neurological Disorders
      Depression Inventory (NDDI-E) scale,(Gilliam et al. 2006, Micoulaud-Franchi et al. 2015) and
      Quality of Life Inventory in Epilepsy-10 (QOLIE-10) scale,(Cramer et al. 1996, Picot et al.
      2004) will be used to measure irritability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life,
      respectively. English- and French-language versions of these questionnaires have been
      validated, apart from the BITe which has only been validated in English. We will follow
      standard cross-cultural methods to create a French-language version of the
      BITe.(Maneesriwongul et al. 2004) The original English version will be translated to French
      by a professional translator. A second translator, blinded to the original English-language
      instrument, will back-translate the new French-language instrument to English. One study
      investigator, fluent in both English and French, will then compare the documents to ensure
      that the different versions are concordant.

      Adverse effects will be recorded by the MD, spontaneously reported by the participant, or in
      response to a standardized question. Each participant will be asked the standardized question
      &quot;Since the start of the brivaracetam, is there anything changed about your health?&quot; For each
      reported adverse effect, the MD will judge whether it is mild (i.e. does not interfere with
      their daily lives), moderate (i.e. sometimes interferes with their daily lives), or severe
      (i.e. most of the time interferes with their daily lives). The MD will judge whether the
      adverse effect is unlikely, possibly, or probably related to BRV. This method of assessing
      for adverse effects is modeled on those used in phase IV trials of levetiracetam.(Morrell et
      al. 2003, Steinhoff et al. 2007)

      Study sample size calculation:

      Eleven participants are sufficient to identify a mean percent seizure reduction of 20%
      [standard deviation (SD): 15], between the baseline versus the 3- and 6-month follow-ups,
      using ANCOVA for repeated measures. In addition, 76 participants are sufficient to identify a
      mean percent seizure difference of 5% between the 3- and 6-month follow-ups [i.e. 25% (SD:
      15) versus 20% (SD: 15)], using paired student's T-test. These sample size calculations
      assume a power of 90%, no correlation between the baseline and follow-up parameters but an
      80% correlation between 3- and 6-month follow-ups, and using a significance level of 0.05.

      Following the ten events per variable rule,(Vittinghoff et al. 2007) 115 participants are
      sufficient to construct valid logistic regression models for the proportion of individuals
      with at least a 50% decrease in seizure frequency, assuming the inclusion of four independent
      variables [follow-up timing (i.e. baseline, 3-month, or 6-month), age, sex, number of
      baseline AEDs] and an expected prevalence of 40% of participants with at least a 50% decrease
      in seizure frequency. Of note, the ten events per variable rule is considered by some to be
      overly conservative.(Vittinghoff and McCulloch 2007) The expected effectiveness of BRV is
      based upon the pooled phase III trial data.(Ben-Menachem, Mameniskiene et al. 2016)
      Stratified analyses are planned and so to guarantee sufficient sample size our target is 200
      participants.

      Study statistical methods:

      The effectiveness analyses will be limited to participants with at least three months of
      on-treatment follow-up data. The BRV tolerability analyses will be carried out in all
      participants that received at least one dose of BRV.

      Mean percent change in monthly (30 days) seizure frequency [95% confidence interval (95% CI)]
      will be compared between the baseline, 3- , and 6-month visits using ANCOVA for repeated
      measures. The same will be used to compare BITe, GAD-7, NDDI-E, and QOLIE-10 scores. For the
      analysis of these continuous outcomes, normality will be confirmed with visual inspection of
      histograms. If normality is not satisfied, the data will be transformed to meet normality, or
      we will calculate median estimates and use non-parametric tests. We will measure the
      association between the start of BRV and the average probability of participants experiencing
      at least a 50% decrease in seizure frequency (95% CI) at the baseline, 3-, and 6-month visits
      using conditional logistic regression. The same will be used to assess the association
      between BRV and the probability of participants being seizure-free (95% CI). We will control
      for the following potentially confounding variables: sex, age, and the number of baseline
      AEDs.

      We will stratify analyses by BRV starting dose (≥ 100 mg/day versus &lt; 100 mg/day), epilepsy
      type, the prior or concomitant use of levetiracetam (versus not), and the use of a
      retrospectively (versus prospectively) collected baseline seizure frequency data. Sensitivity
      analyses will include: the exclusion of any participant where changes to another AED occurred
      during the study period; the exclusion of any participant whose baseline mean seizure
      frequency was less that 4 seizures per month.

      We will descriptively assess tolerability, as measured by the reported adverse effects. The
      mean duration of BRV use, the distribution of seizures types (baseline, versus 3 months and 6
      months), and the reason (if any) for BRV discontinuation will also be presented
      descriptively.

      Statistical analyses will be carried out using STATA/SE, version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College
      Station, Texas, USA). Statistical significance will be defined as a p-value &lt; 0.05.
