  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Panobinostat is a potent oral histone deacetylase inhibitor that alters gene expression
      through epigenetic mechanisms and inhibits protein degradation. It was recently approved by
      the US Food and Drug Administration for use in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone
      in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who have received â‰¥ 2 prior regimens,
      including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug.

      A GEP-based histone acetylation score allowing identification of MM patients with a poor
      prognosis and who could benefit from HDACi treatment was recently reported(Moreaux et al.
      BJC. 2013).

      Our hypothesis is that the histone acetylation score could be promising to identify MM
      patients who could benefit from treatment with HDACi and the development of personalized
      treatment.
