  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of sequential overlapping treatment with
      PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), pembrolizumab/MK-1375, followed by ibrutinib on endogenous
      immune function in previously untreated, high-risk CLL patients. Immune function will be
      evaluated through various laboratory correlative tests.

    <description>Treatment with pembrolizumab and ibrutinib and follow-up period of up to 24 months.
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.
Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Ibrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK.</description>
