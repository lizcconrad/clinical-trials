  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vascular branches of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) involve superior rectal
      artery(SRA),Sigmoid artery(SA) and the left colic artery(LCA). Different levels of ligation
      of the (IMA) are applied in rectal cancer surgery, including retain or not retain the left
      colic artery(LCA). Retained the LCA would facilitate the vascularity. The variations of
      vessels are more frequent in the combinations of branches, while LCA, SA and SRA may vary
      from people to people. Which contribute to the difficulty of surgery to retain the LCA.. As a
      result, a better understanding of the anatomical branches classification of IMA is a must
      during operation. However, existing studies of IMA's branches combination are very rare and
      often single-centered with minimal samples. In order to achieve better surgical outcome and
      reduce operative complications, the investigators design this study to investigate the
      anatomical classification of IMA and the surgical outcome of each type
