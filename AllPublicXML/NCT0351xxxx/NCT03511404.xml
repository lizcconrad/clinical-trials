  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non specific chronic low back pain (LBP) is a debilitating disorder characterized by
      tremendous personal and socioeconomic impact, with long-term sick leave, low quality of life,
      and very high financial costs. Evidence suggests that patients with non specific LBP
      presented with altered muscle activity pattern when compare with healthy people. It has been
      reviewed that exercise therapy was effective for modulation of muscle dysfunction in chronic
      low back pain. However, there is a lack of objective assessment of the pain relief in low
      back pain rehabilitation. Clinical application of surface electromyography (EMG) may provide
      a quantitative and objective tool to evaluate the rehabilitation outcome in patients with non
      specific chronic low back pain before and after treatment.

      Objectives: To verify the usefulness of surface electromyography (EMG) in low back pain (LBP)
      rehabilitation assessment.

      Setting: Out-patient physiotherapy musculoskeletal rehabilitation

      Participants: One hundred adults with non specific chronic low back pain (LBP) will be
      recruited.

      Methodology: A prospective correlation study between clinical examination and
      electrophysiology assessment. This project will perform carefully with a definitive chronic
      low back pain (LBP). Firstly, we will compare the surface EMG features from patients with LBP
      to normal data. In addition, the changes in electrophysiology assessment will be compared
      with clinical assessment by Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). This allows us to verify the
      potential clinical application of surface EMG features in physiotherapy progress assessment.

    <description>Intensity of self-reported pain was measured using a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) anchored with 'no pain' at 0 and 'worst pain imaginable' at 10. Subjects rated their average pain over the preceding month prior to motor training, and rated their average pain across the final week of motor training.</description>

    <description>Disposable surface EMG electrodes will be attached in array to the right and left lumbar erector spinae (LES) muscles, approximately 2 cm lateral to the L3 spinous process. Root mean square amplitude of surface EMG measured was calculated and flexion-relaxation ratio in sitting was formulated by dividing the average surface EMG activity in upright sitting by the average surface EMG activity in slumped sitting.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One hundred persons with non specific low back pain will be recruited consecutively
             from the Specialist Outpatient Department (SOPD) of Physiotherapy Department of Queen
             Elizabeth Hospital. Subjects will be included in the study if they presented with
             symptom duration of greater than three months with no radiological abnormality
             detected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects should be able to provide informed consent and demonstrate sufficient
             ability to tolerate the experiment procedure to avoid aggravation of symptoms during
             the experiment procedures. Subjects will be excluded if they have any major
             orthopedic, neurological, circulatory or respiratory conditions, a history or family
             history of epilepsy, recent or current pregnancies, and previous surgery to the
             abdomen or back. The back pain history in the previous year will be documented for
             those eligible subjects.
