  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      .A surgical intervention involves the participant and his / her family in a very stressful
      situation with a biopsychosocial alteration of the participant, often presenting a lack of
      knowledge of the surgical process from admission to hospital discharge. Researchers (nursing)
      began to make prior visits to the surgical procedure to reduce anxiety and provide
      information about the surgical process. The importance of the presurgical nursing visit (PNV)
      is sought, how to achieve a better health education throughout the surgical process, improve
      communication between professionals through standardized records, contributing to an optimal
      approach to the participant, increasing well-being, health and the satisfaction of the
      participant

      In our Center, PNVs are carried out in the Ambulatory Area (External Consultations) in a
      specific and personalized nursing consultation, within an established and multidisciplinary
      program. One week before surgery, the patient and a family / primary caregiver are cited.

      The PNV conducts a semi-structured interview; the content may vary according to the type of
      surgery, but in general it can be understood as all those nursing interventions; how to
      provide information, support, advice and training to the patient and his family (primary
      caregiver).

      It is an innovative experience since it has been carried out for a short time. The PNV have
      been gradually restructured and continue to grow, since their establishment has been
      positively valued in the different services thanks to the experience gained and the numerous
      bibliographic references that demonstrate the beneficial results for the patient and the
      health system.

      A total of 356 participants have been calculated (surveys answered in more than 3 months),
      taking into account an approximate population of 1,172 programmed interventions carried out
      in 1 year, with a confidence interval of 95%, accuracy of 3% a proportion of 5% and with an
      expected loss of 15%.
