      The purpose of this study is to predict the outcome of peripheral revascularization surgery
      by use of a new technology developed by our team, Pulse Wave Velocity imaging (PWVI), which
      has the capability to detect pulse transit time (PTT), and pulse wave velocity (PWV). This
      PWVI will be compared against known gold standards pre and post lower extremity limb
      revascularization and used to evaluate outcomes. Specifically, is leg PWV different among
      those with or without PAD, and is leg PWV different among those who undergo revascularization
      surgery and those who do not? This study represents the first clinical pilot study of the
      device with the aim to expand study participant numbers in future research and to eventually
      develop a PAD screening tool. This would be the first of its kind ever described.

      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the narrowing of arteries in the extremities, resulting in
      insufficient blood supply to tissue in the extremities. In its mildest form, PAD may be
      asymptomatic, or may show mild symptoms such as intermittent claudication (IC), a pain one
      may experience while walking. [Hirsch et al, 2006; Criqui et al, 1992; Beckman, 2002] At its
      extreme, PAD may lead to critical limb ischaemia (CLI), necrosis, gangrene, amputation, or
      even death. [Hirsch et al, 2006; Hirsch et al, 2001; Criqui et al, 1992] PAD affects over 20%
      of all patients aged 70 and above, or aged 50 to 69 with a history of smoking or diabetes.
      [Hirsch et al, 2001; Beckman et al, 2006] In primary care, the ankle-brachial index (ABI) has
      been used as a screening tool for PAD. [Aboyans et al., 2012] The ABI consists of the ratio
      of systolic blood pressures measured at the ankle to that of the brachial artery. An ABI of
      0.9 - 1.1 is considered normal, and ABI â‰¤ 0.9 is considered abnormal. [Aboyans et al., 2012;
      Hirsch et al., 2001] By way of the ABI, a primary care practitioner may be able to diagnose
      PAD with a high degree of specificity (up to 99%), but sensitivity can vary greatly (15-79%).
      [Xu et al, 2010] More recently, the use of the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) has
      been used as another diagnostic tool with regards to coronary artery disease (CAD). [Katakami
      et al., 2014; Chae et al., 2013; Yamashina et al., 2002] Sugawara et al. have shown that the
      variability in the baPWV is due 58% to aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and 23% to leg PWV.
      [Sugawara et al., 2005] Although aortic stiffness is a larger component of the baPWV,
      numerous studies have shown that there is a correlation between baPWV and PAD. [Yokoyama et
      al., 2003; Amoh-Tonto et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2008] Additionally, it has been shown that
      baPWV can increase after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in the lower extremities.
      [Yokoyama et al., 2003] In context with CLI, although methods of diagnosis have improved over
      the past decades, amputation rates have seen an increase. [Beckman, 2007] Revascularization
      surgery has been shown to increase ambulatory function and quality of life in those affected
      by CLI as compared to those who had undergone amputation. [Brosi et al., 2007; Deneuville &amp;
      Perrouillet, 2006; Oresanya et al, 2015] This, and the cut-off ABI value &lt;0.95 set by Motobe
      et al. in 2005 for the accuracy of baPWV measurements, requires further investigation into
      leg PWV for a better understanding of PAD and CLI and the effects revascularization surgery
      has. [Wohlfart et al., 2013] The investigators believe that the ability to determine the
      success of revascularization surgery at the time of surgery would guide vascular surgeons in
      the intra-operative treatment and monitoring of these patients. The current standard of care
      is Doppler of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery post-operatively and at the
      bedside. This is not always an accurate determinate of the success of a revascularized limb
      and subsequently patients require either Duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography
      (CTA) or angiography. The results from these more sophisticated investigations provide
      accurate information about blood flow and its characteristics. Our group has designed a
      device called Pulse Wave Velocity imaging (PWVI). This device has the capacity to determine
      pulse wave velocity, pulse transit time and a waveform analysis at the bedside and can be
      designed as a small handheld tool. This is essentially a culmination of the information
      obtained from Duplex ultrasound and photoplethysmography but can be acquired within 30
      seconds in any environment (eg. Operating room, bedside, patient's home).
