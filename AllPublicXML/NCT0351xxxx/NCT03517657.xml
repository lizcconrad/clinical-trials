    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the best treatment for the arm that has been
      affected by a stroke. The investigators plan to determine if the arm affected by a stroke
      will improve with a combination of motor priming and motor training. Motor priming provides a
      warm up for the brain so that the brain and body will better respond to treatment. There are
      two types of priming in this study. One is called bilateral motor priming which involves
      using both hands. Bilateral priming requires that the individual make continuous wrist
      movements in a low-tech gadget called the Exsurgo primer, a piece of equipment in which each
      hand goes between two plates that are connected together so that the stronger wrist moves the
      weaker wrist in and out at the same time. The second type of priming includes use of low
      intensity stimulation for your affected arm. Understanding the benefits of priming will
      improve the efficacy of treatment for future patients with stroke. The investigators expect
      both groups to improve in arm function and impairment. The investigators expect the bilateral
      priming group will have more improvement. The study team anticipates enrolling approximately
      76 individuals with stroke at Northwestern University and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab into this
      study. Each participant will have 24 visits. Nine visits will be for evaluation and fifteen
      for therapy. Each visit will be two to three hours depending on the type of visit and tests
      being done. Participants who are eligible and want to participate in this study will be
      randomized (selected by chance) to one of the two groups. The possible groups are: 1)
      bilateral priming plus motor training and 2) electrical stimulation priming and motor
      training. Participants are not blinded. Evaluation sessions consist of three separate days of
      testing and will occur at three time points: (1) before treatment starts; (2) after treatment
      is completed; and (3) 8 weeks later (follow-up evaluation: visits 22-24). There are three
      motor assessments. The main test, Fugl Meyer Test of Motor function (FMUE) is a common test
      for movement of the arm after a stroke. Participants will also be tested on the Chedoke Arm
      and Hand Activity Index (CAHAI) and the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Finally, the
      Neuro-QOL (short form) will be administered. There is also an evaluation of cortical
      excitability using TMS. After a stroke, there is often an imbalance of excitability between
      the affected and less affected parts of the brain. The imbalance will be measured using
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a technique used in neurorehabilitation research.TMS
      will not be used for treatment. There will also be a grip termination evaluation. This test
      will determine how long it takes to relax the affected hand after gripping an object.

      Priming techniques to enhance use dependent plasticity have been examined in stroke
      rehabilitation research. Priming can upregulate ipsilesional cortex and/or down regulate
      contralesional cortex to improve effectiveness of subsequent therapy. Most priming techniques
      are costly and approved only for research. Here, we describe a priming technique that is
      cost-effective and has the potential to significantly change clinical practice. Bilateral
      motor priming (BMP) uses bilateral, symmetrical, rhythmic movement to ready the motor cortex
      for functional limb training. A &quot;rocker&quot; is used so that the less affected limb can drive the
      more affected one in symmetrical wrist flexion and extension. Active range of motion of the
      affected wrist is not necessary, and, thus, BMP can be used in severely impaired
      participants. Beneficial aspects of bilateral motor priming (compared to priming using rTMS
      and tDCS) include the fact that BMP is: 1) cost-effective; 2) available to a larger pool of
      individuals due to a paucity of safety concerns; (3) does not require a skilled operator; and
      (4) can be used the clinic. Previous studies comparing bilateral priming plus therapy found
      the priming and therapy combination to be more effective than therapy alone. This project
      compares two groups of randomly assigned participants receiving task specific training (TST).
      Seventy-six participants will be randomized to receive either fifteen 2-hour sessions (30
      hours) of BMP + TST or 30 hours control priming (CP) + training. Participants will attend
      sessions 3 times per week for 5 weeks with possible missed sessions scheduled at week 6.
      Outcome measures will be collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up (8
      weeks post discharge). Aim 1 will determine the magnitude of change in upper limb impairment
      and function in chronic stroke survivors who have undergone 5 weeks of BMP+TST. The primary
      outcome measure is the Fugl-Meyer Test of Upper Extremity Function (FMUE). The secondary
      outcome is the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Index, an assessment of bimanual functional
      tasks. The investigators expect both groups to improve on behavioral measures from pre-to
      post-intervention. However, the BMP+TST group is expected to have larger improvements than
      the CP + TST. The investigators also expect these measures to persist at follow-up (8 weeks
      post cessation of treatment) in the BMP+TST group but not in CP + TST. Aim 2 will determine
      the effects of bilateral priming on cortical mechanisms as measured by transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS). The investigators expect to find changes in TMS parameters that reflect a
      greater balance of hemispheric excitability in the BMP+TST group only. The hypothesis is that
      increases in hemispheric excitability will be associated with improvements in the FMUE.
      Currently, there is no clinically demonstrated long-term effective treatment for individuals
      with severe chronic upper limb hemiparesis. It is important to identify treatments for this
      underserved and under-investigated population.

    <description>Priming will always precede task specific training. During bilateral motor priming, the &quot;Rocker&quot; (Exsurgo Bilateral Primer, Aukland, New Zealand) will be used. For the individuals assigned to the bilateral priming group, both hands will be strapped in place in the vertically oriented plates which are attached via a mechanical linkage. They will move both wrists in rhythmic, symmetrical wrist flexion and extension for 15 minutes at a frequency of 1 Hz as cued by a metranome. Subjects do not need to have active flexion and extension of the affected hand as the less affected arm drives the weaker one (through an acutator underneath the surface) in in-phase bilateral symmetrical movement.</description>
