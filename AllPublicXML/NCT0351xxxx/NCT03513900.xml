  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is used to describe the endoscopic appearance of
      gastric mucosa in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension, with a characteristic
      mosaic-like pattern with or without red spots. The severity of PHG can vary from mild to
      severe, and patients with PHG are at an increased risk of acute and chronic gastrointestinal
      bleeding. According to the study by Kim et al, severe PHG showed a significantly high risk of
      mortality and reduced expected survival time than none or mild PHG. Therefore, we need to
      detect PHG as soon as possible.Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard test for
      measuring PHG, however, an invasive tool, and patients are afraid of it. Therefore, there is
      a need to find effective noninvasive indicators of PHG that can be predicted in the early
      stages, especially which requiring intervention.

      Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is used to describe the endoscopic appearance of
      gastric mucosa in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension, with a characteristic
      mosaic-like pattern with or without red spots. The severity of PHG can vary from mild to
      severe, and patients with PHG are at an increased risk of acute and chronic gastrointestinal
      bleeding.Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard test for measuring PHG,
      however, an invasive tool, and patients are afraid of it. Therefore, there is a need to find
      effective noninvasive indicators of PHG that can be predicted in the early stages, especially
      which requiring intervention.

      Recently ,there had been significant efforts in the last years to assess the utility of
      non-invasive techniques and approaches for the evaluation of liver fibrosis and portal
      pressure as well as the presence of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis .So far,
      the most promising technique is the measurement of liver stiffness by transient
      elastography(TE), either alone or combined with other parameters, had confirmed the presence
      of liver fibrosis, clinically significant portal hypertension（CSPH）and the presence of
      high-risk esophageal varices(HEVs)in patients with cirrhosis. TE is not accurate enough to
      assess the degree of liver fibrosis, PH and EVs by lver stiffness measurement(LSM).The Baveno
      VI report guidelines acknowledge this application and recommend that LS combined witn
      platelet count (PLT) can predict the risk of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with
      cACLD ,it means that a LSM &lt;20 kPa and a platelet count &gt;150,000 cells/ll have a very low
      risk (&lt;5%) of having HEVs and therefore do not require routine screening endoscopy .These
      criteria is validated and expanded extent to allow more people to avoid endoscopic
      screening.According to the study by Kim et al, LSPS(LSPS= LS×spleen diameter/platelet ratio)
      combined with parameters was clearly superior to the performance of LS and SS alone for
      predicting EV in patients with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis,and subsequently validated as a
      reliable predictor for CSPH in patients with cirrhosis by several studies.The PH risk
      score(PH risk score =—5.953 +0.188× LS +1.583 ×sex (1:male; 0: female) +26.705×spleen
      diameter/platelet count ratio) has been firstly developed by Berzigotti A for the diagnosis
      of CSPH in patients with cirrhosis of any cause.In addition, PSR(PSR=platelet count to spleen
      diameter ratio),and APRI(AST/PLT ration index) have also been confirmed by some studies that
      can partly predict the degree of liver fibrosis and EVs. A recent study showed that PSR and
      PLAR can predict PHG , PSR is the better predictor of PHG than RLAR with a not excellent
      accuracy(74.7%) but at the expense of relatively lower specificities and NPV .However, the
      detection of PHG with TE combined with other parameters in patients with cirrhosis have not
      been described. Portal hypertension is a direct consequence of the fibrotic transformation of
      liver tissue, so Liver stiffness has a reasonable correlation with fibrosis and with the
      hepatic venous pressure gradient. According to the study by Raul Cubilla et al.,portal
      hypertension is necessary for PHG to develop.The study by Nagula S et al suggests that PHG is
      a hallmark in patients with cirrhosis as it heralds the development of varices. The
      investigators speculate that non-invasive methods can also be used to identify PHG in
      patients with cirrhosis .

      Therefore, the investigators design this cross-sectional cohort study using these
      non-invasive measurement to explore this issue at our center.

      For these reasons, the investigators will perform this cross-sectional cohort study, collect
      all patients with cirrhosis who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria criteria coming to
      The Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University from March 2018 to December 2018 to
      evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a systematic strategy based on LSM and other
      parameters, with the specific aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy of these non-invasive
      techniques and models to screen PHG using Upper gastrointestinal(GI) endoscopy as a gold
      standard in patients with cirrhosis . The secondary aim is to assess degree of PHG to predict
      future bleeding in order to guide management to prevent the occurrence of adverse events.
