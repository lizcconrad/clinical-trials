    <textblock>
      Problem Solving Therapy for Primary Care (PST-PC) is an evidence based psychosocial
      intervention (EBPI) for use in primary care settings, with more than 100 clinical trials.

      Despite it's proven efficacy we have found that implementation of PST-PC is complicated,
      resulting in rapid program drift (deviation from protocol with associated loss of efficacy),
      among practitioners following completion of training. Many studied have shown that program
      drift is not uncommon in the implementation of EBPIs and can be mitigated through on-going
      decision support and supervision. Unfortunately, decision support and supervisors of EBPIs
      are not widely available in low-resourced primary care clinics. We will address this problem
      by creating decision support tools to be integrated into electronic health records. Because
      these tools hare deemed by many practitioners in other field to be burdensome, we will
      explicitly involve active input on the content, design and function of these support tools.
      Outcomes may include electronic dashboards for panel management, automated suggestions for
      application of PST-PC elements based on patient reported outcomes or integration of automated
      patient tracking, and 4) support of patient engagement. We hypothesize that enhance decision
      support (target mechanism) will sustained quality delivery of PST-PC, which in turn will
      improve patient reported outcomes.

      SPECIFIC AIMS. Although evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) are a preferred
      treatment option by vulnerable populations, they are rarely available in community primary
      care settings and when available, are often delivered with poor fidelity. High quality
      delivery of evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) in primary care medicine is a
      function of many variables, including clinician training and usability of the intervention.
      Several studies find that for EBPIs to be delivered with sustained quality, on-going
      supervision and guidance is critical (this study's focus). While the availability of
      clinicians trained in EBPIs is scarce, the availability to supervisors trained in EBPIs is
      even more limited. Given the ubiquity of electronic health records, automated decision
      support tools and feedback systems have been found to be effective in supporting sustained
      quality EBPIs7, but in practice have had mixed success on outcomes such that they may
      actually hinder clinical care and are often ignored by clinicians.In a report by the Agency
      for Healthcare Research and Quality, a significant barrier to the use of decision support
      tools is that these tools have not been developed with input from the clinician or in
      consideration of their work environment. Using the Center's Discover, Design, Build, Test
      (DDBT) framework, we will work with clinicians from 13 Behavioral Health Integration Program
      (BHIP) sites to create a clinical decision tool that addresses the common decisional dilemmas
      clinicians face when implementing EBPIs. We hypothesize that creating tools to support EBPIs
      will result in improved clinician competency and sustained skill (target) to EBPIs, compared
      to clinicians without these supports, resulting in better patient outcomes . The specific
      aims of this study are: Aim 1: Discover Phase (6 months). Using Participant Action research
      (PAR) informed user-centered design methods we will interview clinicians in primary care
      about challenges they face in the delivery of two EBPIs, Behavioral Activation and Problem
      Solving Treatment, observe them delivering these EBPIs, and receiving feedback on cases from
      experts in these EBPIs. This process will help us to identify the common decisional dilemma's
      clinician's face in delivering EBPIs, their preferences for expert guidance strategies, and
      how decision support tools could be embedded into clinic workflow to reduce obstacles and
      enhance the delivery of EBPIs.

      Aim 2: Design/Build Phase (6 months). Based on information obtained in the discover phase, we
      will engage in a rapid cycle iterative prototype development and testing of decision support
      tools to support PST-PC will be carried out using user-centered design (UCD). The build of
      these tools will include the development of prototypes for user testing and refinement with
      input from care managers across the 13 BHIP sites. Contribution to the Center. Data from this
      phase will be used to inform the Matrix of EBPI Modifications.

      Aim 3: Test Phase (18 months) In the second to third year of the proposed project we will
      test the decision support tools in a small pilot trial with six providers and thirty patients
      randomized to the use of the decision support tools. H1: Clinicians with access to decision
      tools will report better acceptability, usability, and less burden when using BA and PST-PC
      than clinicians without the tools . H2: Clinicians randomized to decision support tools will
      more competently deliver EBPI elements than clinicians randomized to unsupported EBPI. H3:
      Patients treated by clinicians with access to decision tools will have better
      patient-reported outcomes than patients treated by clinicians without access to these tools
      as assessed with functional disability and change in depression symptoms over time .

    <description>This is a four item measure of intervention acceptability, where each item is rated on a 1-5 scale, with 1 = not at all acceptable and 5 = very acceptable. each group will be compared on the degree they find the training they participated in acceptable after they complete training.</description>

    <description>The User Burden Scale is a 20-item scale that assesses six domains of user burden: use, physical burden, time/social burdens, mental/emotional burden, privacy concerns and financial burdens. The scale is calculated item measure of perceived burden of use that covers 6 domains: difficulty of use, emotional burden, physical burden, time and social burden, financial burden and privacy. Each item is rated on a 04- scale, with a maximum score of 80 (high burden) and minimum score of 0 (low burden).

    <time_frame>Participants in the will be asked to rate the usability of PST six months after they have been certified in PST.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item scale with each item ranked on a five point system of low to high usability. The scale score is calculated by adding the item scores and multiplying by 2.5. A score of 68 or better is considered to be above average usability. As score less than 68 s considered to be poor usability. In this study, a score of 80 or more is considered our cut off for high usability. We will compare the two training programs on usability with this scale.</description>
