  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition for gastrointestinal
      tract.

      Regarding its pathogenesis, there has been numerous studies to reveal the complex association
      between genetic and environmental factors.

      In Korea, the incidence of IBD is growing rapidly but genetic studies solely including
      patients with Korean descent were not sufficient enough.

      Therefore, the investigators planned to conduct genetic and fecal microbial analysis for the
      60 individuals from 30 Korean IBD families to find out the pathogenesis of IBD.

      Under the hypothesis that more risk variants will be observed among the familial IBD patient
      than in IBD patients without any other affected family members, the investigators designed
      genetic and fecal microbiome analysis for 60 patients form 30 families.

      After extracting the DNA from blood samples, whole genome sequencing will be performed and
      data will be comprared with the previously reported variances. Novel variances or incidence
      of specific variances will be measured.

      In this study, fecal microbiome is a surrogate marker for the enviromental aspect of
      pathogenesis of IBD. The investigators assumed that family members are sharing similar mode
      of lifestyle therefore we're presumed that their fecal microbial composition is alike.

      Comparing genetic and microbial datas altogether with the data from unaffected family
      member(Healthy internal control), investigators expecting to explain the genetic and
      enviromental aspect of IBD pathogenesis.

        The investigators are planned to study family members with IBD(Crohn's disease or
        ulcerative colitis).

        They are all Koreal descent and study candidates are two patients from each 30 families. As
        a healthy internal control, another family member without IBD history will be also
        enrolled.
