  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder. High magnitude and long-duration voucher-based
      abstinence reinforcement is one of the most effective treatments for alcohol and drug
      addiction and can maintain abstinence over extended periods of time, but practical methods of
      implementing these interventions are needed. Workplaces could be ideal and practical vehicles
      for arranging and maintaining abstinence reinforcement over long time periods. Investigators'
      research on a model Therapeutic Workplace has shown that employment-based abstinence
      reinforcement, in which participants must provide alcohol- or drug-free urine samples to
      maintain maximum pay, can maintain alcohol and drug abstinence. Now investigators need to
      develop effective and economically sound methods to arrange long-term exposure to
      employment-based abstinence reinforcement. Investigators are proposing to evaluate the
      effectiveness and economic benefits of a Wage Supplement Model of arranging long-term
      exposure to employment-based abstinence reinforcement. Under this model, successful
      Therapeutic Workplace participants are offered abstinence-contingent wage supplements if they
      obtain and maintain competitive employment. Governments have used wage supplements
      effectively to increase employment in welfare recipients. The Wage Supplement Model harnesses
      the power of wage supplements to promote employment, while simultaneously using the wage
      supplements to reinforce drug and alcohol abstinence. The intervention will combine 3
      elements -- the Therapeutic Workplace, Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported
      employment, and abstinence-contingent wage supplements. IPS is a supported employment
      intervention that has been proven effective in promoting employment in adults with severe
      mental illness. Under this model, participants will be exposed to the Therapeutic Workplace
      to initiate abstinence and establish job skills. To promote employment and prevent relapse to
      drug use, participants will receive IPS Plus Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplements. A
      randomized trial will evaluate the effectiveness and economic benefits of the
      Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplement Model in promoting employment and sustaining drug
      abstinence. Participants will be enrolled in the Therapeutic Workplace for 3 months and then
      randomly assigned to a Usual Care Control group or an IPS Plus Abstinence-Contingent Wage
      Supplement group for one year. Usual Care Control participants will be offered counseling and
      referrals to employment and treatment programs. IPS Plus Abstinence-Contingent Wage
      Supplement participants will receive the IPS intervention and abstinence-contingent wage
      supplements. This novel intervention could be an effective and economically sound way to
      promote long-term employment and drug abstinence.
