  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The existence of an adipose tissue microbiota causally involved in the triggering of a low
      grade inflammation could resemble what observed in liver fibrosis. To generate microbial
      hypotheses putatively responsible for the onset of liver fibrosis we sequenced the 16SrDNA
      gene from liver biopsies from 36 obese patients (ROLIVER cohort) and describe an original
      mathematical approach to decipher signatures of early stage of liver fibrosis F0, F1, F2.

    <textblock>
      Liver diseases and notably fibrosis are featured by a gut microbiota dysbiosis with a large
      diversity. Classical statistical analyses does not allow to discriminate between the
      different low score of liver fibrosis F0,F1,F2. The existence of an adipose tissue microbiota
      causally involved in the triggering of a low grade inflammation could resemble what observed
      in liver fibrosis. To generate microbial hypotheses putatively responsible for the onset of
      liver fibrosis we sequenced the 16SrDNA gene from liver biopsies from 36 obese patients
      (ROLIVER cohort) and describe an original mathematical approach to decipher signatures of
      early stage of liver fibrosis F0, F1, F2. We identified that Protebacteria as the main phyla
      in liver with Pseudomonadaceae and Proteobacteriaceae families representing ~60% of the
      16SrDNA gene diversity. While primary component analyses were unable to discriminate between
      the three groups the partial least square discriminant analysis appears as a powerful tool to
      identify signatures predictive for each group. We further constructed a matrix of interacting
      OTU clusters surrounding early scores of liver fibrosis. Eventually, we applied the tfidf
      approach to exemplify the rare variables which could be carrying some information suitable to
      refine the diagnosis. Altogether, we here propose a mathematical approach suitable for
      precise identification of bacteria putatively involve in the progressive development of liver
      fibrosis that represent hence a new therapeutic opportunity.

    <description>We have obtained liver samples during laparoscopic surgical procedures in the majority of cases. The majority of laparoscopic procedures were sleeve gastrectomies performed for morbid obesity as a primary restrictive procedure; in 5 cases the liver biopsies were performed during laparoscopic cholecystectomies.</description>
