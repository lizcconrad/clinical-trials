  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how well the drug works, safety and tolerability of an
      investigational drug called Ruxolitinib in gliomas and glioblastomas, when combined with
      standard treatment for brain cancer, temozolomide and radiation.

      Ruxolitinib is an experimental drug that works by targeting proteins in cells and stops them
      from growing. Ruxolitinib is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of gliomas or glioblastomas

      Temozolomide works by damaging the DNA of tumor cells so that they cannot divide properly.
      Some tumor cells can repair that damage and therefore be resistant to temozolomide.

      Primary Objective

      Arm 1:

      To determine Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib with radiation (2 Gy x 30) in
      patients with unmethylated MGMT high-grade glioma (HGG)

      Arm 2:

      To determine Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib with radiation (2 Gy x 30) and daily
      temozolomide at 75 mg/m2 in patients with methylated MGMT high-grade glioma (HGG)

      Secondary Objective(s)

      Arm 1:

        -  Safety of combination of ruxolitinib with radiation

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

      Arm 2:

        -  Safety of combination of ruxolitinib with radiation and temozolomide

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

      STUDY DESIGN

      A phase 1 design will be used with cohorts of 3 patients treated at each dose level in both
      arms 1 and 2 and monitored for treatment-related toxicities. Escalation to the next dose will
      proceed in the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).
