  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project uses community health workers (CHW) or lay health educators to implement asthma
      interventions that have been proven to work in the primary care setting and in schools. The
      objective is to integrate the home, school, healthcare system, and community for 600
      school-aged asthmatic children in West Philadelphia through use of CHWs.

      The children enrolled in the study will be randomized to one of four groups including:
      primary care CHW, school CHW, primary care and school CHW or the control group (no CHW).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has
      a two-decade history of utilizing CHWs to improve asthma outcomes of children in
      Philadelphia. Building on this foundation, a network of stakeholders was established
      including, The West Philadelphia Asthma Care Collaborative (WEPACC), with representation from
      public housing, healthcare, community, and schools. As a result of assessment of local needs,
      resource mapping, and months of planning, Investigators designed an asthma care
      implementation program with the broad objective of integrating home, school, healthcare
      system, and community for school-aged asthmatic children in West Philadelphia. Investigators
      seek to accomplish this goal using CHWs to deliver sustainable patient-centered
      evidence-based interventions. The evidence-based interventions include (1) a primary
      care-based Yes We Can intervention with home visitation and (2) a comprehensive and
      rigorously evaluated school-based intervention, Open Airways for schools and School Based
      Asthma Therapy. CHWs will function as the hub of each interventions, serving either as
      primary care CHWs or school CHWs to provide a network of education, care coordination
      support, and to facilitate communication for families of children with asthma between the
      four sectors. This project seeks to integrate interventions in a comprehensive and
      sustainable manner to reduce asthma disparities in poor, minority children.

      Using a factorial design, Investigators will recruit and randomize 600 asthmatic children
      (ages 6-12 years) from three inner-city primary care clinics who attend one of 23 West
      Philadelphia schools to one of four study conditions: both interventions (both primary care
      and school CHWs intervention), primary care CHW or school-CHW alone, or control and follow
      for one year. As a part of this project the Investigators seek to accomplish the following
      objectives:

      Objective 1. Compare effectiveness of the primary care and school interventions to improve
      asthma control and reduce symptom days using main and simple effects from the factorial
      design.

      Objective 2. Explore moderators and mechanisms of effectiveness and sustainability of the
      interventions.

      Objective 3. Use mixed methods to explore implementation determinants and outcomes of school
      intervention that promote effectiveness, fidelity and sustainability

      Objective 4. Examine the costs, savings, and cost effectiveness associated with the
      intervention and implementation strategies to promote sustainability.

    <intervention_model_description>A factorial design has enhanced statistical power and can handle cluster randomization of schools. Statistical methods will be used to estimate variation in the effect across schools over time. Linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes for school, and fixed effects for the school-level intervention, time, and time-by-intervention interaction will be applied. Second, marginal models using generalized estimating equations will produce robust estimates that adjust for clustering at the school level. Third, assumption-free, randomization-test-based methods do not rely on assumptions of parametric models. Investigators will use conventional levels of statistical significance (p=0.05) for all pre-specified comparisons for our objectives. Variability of the intervention effect across schools will reflect consistency of intervention effects and thus generalizability in new settings. Both mixed effects models and permutation-test methods will estimate variance components.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) developed by E.F. Juniper et al. is a 6-item recall of asthma control indicators over the past week and one objective measure of airway caliber (FEV1%) through pulmonary function testing. The 6-item recall includes awakening at night with asthma symptoms, asthma symptoms upon waking, activity limitations due to asthma symptoms, shortness of breath, wheezing, and administration of asthma rescue medications. The score range for the ACQ is 0 - 6, with lower numbers indicating poor asthma control and higher numbers indicating greater asthma control.</description>

The score range for each questionnaire item is 1 - 4. The range for the principal leadership and teacher professionalism dimensions is 7 - 28. The range for achievement press is 8 - 32. The range for vulnerability to the community is 5 - 20. Higher scores reflect a better organizational climate. The total school score, range 27 - 108, is computed by summing the subscale means. Total school score can be converted to standardized scores and compared with national norms.</description>
