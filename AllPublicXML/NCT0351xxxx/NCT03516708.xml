  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the combination of two drugs, epacadostat
      and pembrolizumab, when given with routine radiation therapy and chemotherapy (capecitabine
      and oxaliplatin) to treat rectal cancer before routine surgery is performed to remove the
      tumor. In the first part of the study, the investigators are looking at how the body
      processes epacadostat when given with radiation and chemotherapy (without pembrolizumab) and
      what types of side effects occur. In the second part of the study, the investigators are
      determining the best dose of epacadostat to given when it's given with pembrolizumab and
      radiation and chemotherapy. In the final part of the study, the investigators are studying
      how the cancer responds to the treatment regimen.

    <description>Patients will receive epacadostat at 100mg PO BID during the 21 weeks of standard of care preoperative therapy.
Standard of care preoperative therapy will consist of a total of approximately 20 weeks' preoperative therapy followed by surgery. Breakdown of the 20 weeks of preoperative therapy are as follows:
Short-course pelvic radiation therapy, 5 fractions over 1 week
2 to 3 weeks of break; tumor biopsy will be obtained on or after the last radiation day (D5-8) and before the start of chemotherapy (D21-28)
6 cycles of CAPOX for a total of 18 weeks
surgery will follow approximately 4 to 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy
CAPOX is typically capecitabine at 1000 mg/m2 PO BID and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV Q3W. The second cycle of epacadostat will begin when CAPOX starts (so may be more than 21 days long depending on when exactly CAPOX starts).</description>

             (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally
             killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.
             FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 72 hours of study entry.

             pneumonitis.

          -  Known history of active TB.

          -  Known HIV-positivity (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
