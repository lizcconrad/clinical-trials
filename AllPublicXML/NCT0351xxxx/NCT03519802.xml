  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aftermath of suicide is devastating, being the cause of 800 000 deaths every year
      worldwide. In France, suicide still causes about 10 000 deaths per year and the number of
      suicide attempts (SA) is estimated between 170 000 and 200 000 per year (InVS).

      It is often thought that a suicidal crisis is only related to depression, as it actually is a
      far more complex phenomenon. A suicidal crisis can occur on various grounds like psychiatric
      disorders but also contextual events or somatic diseases and it has been hypothesized that
      suicidal ideas or inclinations could have a common and independent cognitive origin
