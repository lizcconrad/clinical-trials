        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must give written informed consent to participate in the study

          -  Clinical diagnosis of familial partial lipodystrophy plus diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
             mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia.

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, made at least 6 months prior to the Screening with
             HbA1c ≥ 7% to ≤ 12% at Screening and on anti-diabetic therapy as defined in study
             protocol

          -  Hypertriglyceridemia as defined by fasting TG levels ≥ 500 mg/dL at both Screening and
             Qualification visits. Patients with the clinical diagnosis of FPL and with fasting TG
             levels ≥ 200 (≥ 2.26 mmol/L) to &lt; 500 mg/dL (≥ 5.7 mmol/L) who meet the genetic or
             family history criteria for study inclusion may be further screened and enrolled in
             the study.

          -  Presence of hepatosteatosis (fatty liver), as evidenced by a Screening MRI indicating
             a hepatic fat fraction (HFF) ≥ 6.4%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of generalized lipodystrophy

          -  Diagnosis of acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL)

          -  Acute Coronary Syndrome within 6 months of screening

          -  Major surgery within 3 months of screening

          -  Have any other conditions in the opinion of the investigator which could interfere
             with the patient participating in or completing the study
