  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By comparing dimethicone administration with/without subsequent repetitive position change
      before magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) examination, the investigators aim to
      determine the efficacy of repetitive position change in improving image quality for gastric
      preparation in patients receiving MCE examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Subjects receiving
      magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy at the institution will be randomly allocated into
      intervention group and control group before the procedure. Right after ingesting 5 g
      dimethicone mixed with 100 ml water, subjects in the control group will receive no
      intervention; while subjects in the intervention group will be instructed to repeatedly
      change the body position according to a prespecified protocol for a period of 15 min. Thirty
      and 40 min after dimethicone administration, subjects in both groups will additionally take
      200 ml and 800 ml water, respectively, and undergo MCE examination. Image quality will be
      rated by two physicians independently.

    <measure>Image cleanliness of gastric cavity</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The image cleanliness of gastric cavity of six primary anatomical landmarks of stomach (cardia, fundus, body, angulus, antrum, and pylorus) were recorded for evaluation. A 4-point grading scale was introduced to define the cleanliness as excellent (no adherent mucus and foam: score 4), good (mild mucus and foam but does not obscure vision: score 3), fair (considerable amount of mucus or foam present precluding a completely reliable examination: score 2) and poor (large amount of mucus or foam residue needing water to clear it: score 1)</description>

    <measure>Image visualization of gastric mucosa</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The mucosal visualization introduced as good (&gt;90% of the mucosa observed: score 3), fair (70-90% of the mucosa observed: score 2) and poor (&lt;70% of the mucosa observed: score 1) as used in the investigator's previous study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive findings of MCE</measure>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of MCE, or adverse events, defined as symptoms or signs such as abdominal distention, nausea, or vomiting, were monitored closely during the MCE procedure. Capsule retention (i.e., a capsule endoscope remaining in the gastrointestinal tract for more than two weeks or a capsule endoscope that requires directed intervention or therapy to aid its expulsion) was monitored and followed up for up to two weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients aged more than 8 years, who were scheduled to undergo a magnetically
             controlled capsule endoscopy, were eligible for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dysphagia or symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction, suspected or known intestinal
             stenosis, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, history of upper gastrointestinal surgery
             or abdominal surgery altering gastrointestinal anatomy, or postabdominal radiation;

          -  Congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, under therapeutic anticoagulation, in
