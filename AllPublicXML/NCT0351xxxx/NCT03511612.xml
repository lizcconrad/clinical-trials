  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several methods are available to measure ankle brachial index (ABI) non-invasively. A recent
      scientific statement of the AHA considers the Doppler method as the reference. However
      because Doppler devices are not widely available in primary care, several attempts have been
      made to propose alternative methods, among whom oscillometric methods (automatic blood
      pressure machines) have attracted most attention.

      We hypothesize that:

      - the diagnostic characteristics (i.e. sensitivity, specificity and AUC) of the oscillometric
      method would be very good as compared to the Doppler method.

      the oscillometric method would have better intra- and inter-observer reproducibilities as
      compared to the Doppler method.
