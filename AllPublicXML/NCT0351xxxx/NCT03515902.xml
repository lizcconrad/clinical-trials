  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth hypersensitivity due to dental erosion is one of the most common problem related to
      swimming in improper pH chlorinated pools. Because the teeth are exposed to acidic water for
      a long time, which cause the loss of dental hard tissue. Tooth hypersensitivity can lead to a
      negative effect on daily life such as dietary selection, maintaining optimal dental hygiene
      and beauty aspects. It has been found that using mouthguard while swimming can prevent the
      teeth directly contact to chlorinated water, so it can protect tooth structure and decrease
      tooth hypersensitivity. Moreover, using mouthguard with viscous products can seal the gaps
      between mouthguard and teeth which can help to protect tooth structure and decrease dental
      hypersensitivity more effectively. At present, there are many desensitizing products such as
      toothpaste, mouthwash and chewing gum. Desensitizing toothpaste is the most common
      over-the-counter (OTC) materials in desensitizing. Many research has endorsed the properties
      of desensitizing toothpaste that can reduce tooth tissue loss and helps to reduce tooth
      hypersensitivity effectively. So it can be hypothesize that when use the combination of
      mouthguard with desensitizing toothpaste, it might have synergistic effect on reducing tooth
      hypersensitivity in swimmers.

      Tooth erosion is the loss of dental hard tissue due to acidic agents without bacteria
      involvement.

      Mouthguard is a protective appliance use for covering the teeth and gums to prevent the teeth
      from acidic chlorinated water.

      Desensitizing toothpaste is toothpaste containing 8 percent arginine and calcium carbonate
      that can reduce tooth demineralization and promote remineralization.

    <measure>Tooth hypersensitivity changes after using mouthguard with/without desensitizing toothpaste</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline,2,4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth hypersensitivity changes will be measured by the mean difference of visual analog scale (VAS) score at baseline,2,4 and 8 weeks by using 2 clinical stimuli including tactile and cold stimulation. Each stimulation will be measured and separately recorded as follow :
1.Tactile stimulation
The score range from 0 (no tooth hypersensitivity) to 100 (worst possibly tooth hypersensitivity)
The mean difference of tooth hypersensitivity from tactile stimulation at any time point will be analyzed.
2. Cold stimulation
The score range from 0 (no tooth hypersensitivity) to 100 (worst possibly tooth hypersensitivity)
The mean difference of tooth hypersensitivity from cold stimulation at any time point will be analyzed.</description>

    <time_frame>2,4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The attitude and satisfaction will be collected by a self-administered questionnaire and interview at 2,4 and 8 weeks
The score range from 0 (no satisfying) to 100 (most satisfying)
The mean score of satisfying at any time point will be analyzed.</description>

    <description>The quality of life will be collected by interview at 8 weeks using oral impacts on daily performance (OIDP) questionnaire
The score range from 0 (no negative effect on quality of life) to 100 (worst negative effect on quality of life )
The mean score will be analyzed.</description>
