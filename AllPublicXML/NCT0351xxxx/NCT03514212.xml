  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with schizophrenia die approximately 20 years earlier than those in the general
      population, and this is mostly due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related poor physical
      health. The risk factors for CVD are significantly more prevalent in people with
      schizophrenia, but they are largely preventable by, for example, engaging in regular PA.
      Existing interventions to increase PA in schizophrenia are generally atheoretical and lack
      manualisation and appropriate evaluation, thus reducing their usefulness to clinical
      practice.

      Drawing on the MRC Guidelines for the development and evaluation of complex interventions, a
      12-week intervention was developed and informed by a systematic review of the factors that
      influence PA in people with schizophrenia and a qualitative study exploring the barriers and
      motivators to PA (n=10). The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention was then
      investigated in an uncontrolled pilot study (n=20).

      The pilot study demonstrated that the intervention was both feasible and acceptable to people
      with schizophrenia. The retention rate was 90% (n=18), and reasons given for dropout were
      work commitments and other illness.

      Of the 18 who completed the intervention, 17 (94%) increased their weekly step count, 14
      (78%) met current public health guidelines of 10,000 steps per day at some point during the
      12 weeks, 10 (56%) experienced some weight loss, 12 (67%) took up an additional health
      promotion opportunity (e.g., improving diet, stopping smoking, joining a gym) and 13 (72%)
      took up another form of PA in addition to walking (e.g., swimming).

      Participants found the intervention enjoyable and thought it should be offered to everyone
      with schizophrenia. The intervention also proved to be feasible and acceptable to staff who
      referred patients to take part. Informal feedback from staff confirmed the need for such a
      service, particularly for those taking anti-psychotic medication, and indicated that, if it
      was to be implemented more widely, it would be a popular and useful resource.

    <description>Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention was evaluated using mixed-methods to explore recruitment, delivery, reasons for drop-out, participant feedback (positive and negative), and suggestions for improvement. This was quantitatively assessed by recording the number of eligible participants that agreed to participate and the number of participants that enrolled but dropped out. Participants were also asked to complete a feedback form, which contained space for free text, during the last session of the intervention.</description>
