  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, three-arm study to investigate the effects of footbaths with
      ginger, mustard or warm water alone in female, adolescent patients with Anorexia nervosa and
      in healthy, female adolescents on psychophysiological parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a cross-over study design, the subjects (21 female patients with Anorexia nervosa, 20
      healthy, female controls) receive footbaths with either ginger, mustard or warm water alone
      in a randomized order with a wash-out period of at least 1-3 days. The effects of each
      intervention on the objective warmth generation are measured by infrared thermography,
      whereas the subjective warmth perception is determined by the 'Herdecke warmth perception
      questionnaire'. All parameters are determined at specified times (t1 = right before, t2 =
      right after and t3 = 10 minutes following the footbath), which enables an evaluation based on
      pre-post-comparisons. The statistical analysis comprises analyses of variances based on
      linear mixed effects models (after checking for carry-over effects).
