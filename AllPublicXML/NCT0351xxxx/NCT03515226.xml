    <textblock>
      This study will compare training as usual to automated training using an intelligent tutoring
      system in training bachelors (BA) level social workers in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
      The purpose of the study is to determine if time and cost of training front line clinicians
      in evidence-based treatments can be shortened, and if this new training model can reduce the
      need for clinicians to seek advice from experts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The University of Washington (UW) School of Social Work, in partnership with Heritage
      University's School of Social Work in Yakima Valley recently partnered to develop a training
      program for bachelors (BA) level Social Workers to address limited clinician capacity in
      rural primary care settings. Currently the curriculum is a combination of didactic training
      in telephone based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; 20 hours), role play training (25
      hours), and guided supervision. The scalability of these programs is limited, however, by
      expert time to conduct training activities, clinician time away from work to engage in
      training activities, and the fact that even when clinicians participate in training, there is
      no guarantee they will certify. Adaptive learning, an educational method that uses adaptive
      algorithms to may be a potential solution to these problems in capacity building. These
      programs can tailor the educational experience to the needs of the trainee, reduce time in
      training, improve competence in complex decision-making and standardize training. This study
      builds on the existing research base on clinicial training, and adds to it by designing and
      testing an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) based on adaptive learning algorithms. Both CBT
      experts (Aisenberg) and past CBT trainees (Heritage University School of Social Work) will
      partner with experts in educational software development (Popovic) to create the ITS, which
      will be compared to training as usual on time to training, competence and skill drift. The
      investigators hypothesize that capacity building through improved learnability (target
      mechanism) will result in enhanced clinical ability to deliver CBT elements competently, and
      in a shorter time-period, and that greater competence will result in better quality of care.

    <time_frame>This measure will be administered to participants in each training group after they complete the 25 hours of training.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a four item measure of intervention acceptability, where each item is rated on a 1-5 scale, with 1 = not at all acceptable and 5 = very acceptable. each group will be compared on the degree they find the training they participated in acceptable after they complete training.</description>

    <measure>User Burden Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>administered once after 24-hours of training</time_frame>
    <description>The User Burden Scale is a 20-item scale that assesses six domains of user burden: use, physical burden, time/social burdens, mental/emotional burden, privacy concerns and financial burdens. The scale is calculated item measure of perceived burden of use that covers 6 domains: difficulty of use, emotional burden, physical burden, time and social burden, financial burden and privacy. Each item is rated on a 04- scale, with a maximum score of 80 (high burden) and minimum score of 0 (low burden). We will compare the ratings of educational burden between groups to determine if the new training model is considered less burdensome than the traditional training model.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This scale will be administered to participants one time after they have participated in the training programs. once after 24-hours of training</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item scale with each item ranked on a five point system of low to high usability. The scale score is calculated by adding the item scores and multiplying by 2.5. A score of 68 or better is considered to be above average usablilty. As score less than 68 s considered to be poor usability. In this study, a score of 80 or more is considered our cut off for high usability. We will compare the two training programs on usability with this scale measure of the usability of a tool, and is consider the industry standard for measuring usability in the UCD field.</description>
