    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine how the blood pressure control is altered by an
      increased volume in the veins.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In humans, two-thirds of the blood volume is contained within the venous vasculature. Because
      of this, changes in peripheral blood volume and alterations in the mechanical properties of
      peripheral veins can greatly impact cardiac filling, cardiac output and blood pressure
      responses to physiologic stress. Work from our laboratory over the past seven years has
      showed that local upper limb venous distension via volume infusion into an occluded arm (i.e.
      volume infusion model) or applying negative pressure to an occluded leg (limb suction
      experimental model) leads to acute and dramatic increases in Muscle Sympathetic Nerve
      Activity (MSNA; an index of sympathetic activity directed to skeletal muscle) and blood
      pressure (BP) in humans. Since this venous distension reflex (VDR) differs physiologically
      from the other reflex systems and because this system may play a critical role in orthostatic
      BP control, the investigators believe that it is a significant area of study.

      These experimental models &quot;selectively&quot; alter peripheral venous volume as the investigators
      measure sympathetic reflex responses. This approach is innovative and allows examination of a
      previously overlooked autonomic reflex in conscious humans. If these studies confirm the
      hypotheses, the obtained data would challenge the present teaching regarding how the
      sympathetic nervous system is engaged in humans during postural stress.

      A number of thin afferent fibers (Group III and IV) end directly within the adventitia of the
      small venous vessels. Their discharge can be increased in response to both distention evoked
      by venous occlusion and the infusion of vasodilatory agents. The investigators postulate that
      limb venous distension causes the release of substance(s) from vascular walls and/or the
      surrounding tissues, and in turn stimulates these thin fiber afferents. Previous animal
      studies show that metabolic products of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme system (i.e.
      prostaglandins) play an important role in activating Group III and IV afferents during muscle
      contraction. Of note, colleagues have shown that COX blockade attenuates the rise in BP seen
      with venous distention in a rat model.

      In this protocol, the investigators will examine the role played by metabolic products of
      arachidonic acid in evoking this reflex. First, the investigators speculate that
      prostaglandins may cause engagement of the VDR by direct stimulation of afferents as seen
      during muscle contraction. Second, some of prostaglandins such as prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are vasoactive substances, that may induce vasodilation. Thus, the
      investigators speculate that prostaglandins could cause engagement of the VDR either by
      direct stimulation of afferents or by inducing vessel dilation, that in turn stimulates
      afferents. To examine this issue, the investigators propose studies to examine the effects of
      COX inhibition on venous size measured with 3 Tesla (3T) MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) as
      peripheral veins are distended in human subjects.

      The investigators have published several reports on VDR. However, the investigators have no
      data regarding if the VDR is still active AFTER COX blockade, if the reflex will be
      attenuated, or if COX blockade will alter the size of the veins during the venous distension
      procedure.
