  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cognitive impairment is common in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at
      all levels of severity. Such impairments may affect their ability to return to work and thus
      increase healthcare costs and the associated economic burdens. Both cognitive rehabilitation
      and stimulant medications are widely used to manage post-traumatic cognitive impairments;
      however, previous metaanalyses failed to demonstrate their beneficial effects on cognitive
      recovery in patients with TBI. Nurses, the first-line healthcare providers, should therefore
      seek and use an alternative approach for dealing with post-traumatic cognitive deficits.

      Purpose: To assess the effects of low resolution tomography (LoRETA) Z -score neurofeedback
      (NF) and theta/beta NF in alleviating cognitive impairments in patients with TBI as well as
      the possible mechanism through which they provide this alleviation. We hypothesize that
      adults with TBI receiving LoRETA Z-score NF and theta/beta NF will experience the
      improvements in cognitive functions while participants in the control group will not.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is the most common and debilitating residual symptom of traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) at all levels of severity and the prevalence of cognitive impairments varies,
      depending on the severity of the head injury and the time since the injury. Such impairments
      substantially affect a person's ability to return to productive activity and health-related
      quality of life. Furthermore, disabilities related to cognitive impairments following TBI
      increase healthcare costs and economic burden. Memory, attention, and information processing
      speed are basic cognitive functions. Deficits in such functions subsequently exacerbate
      disturbances in more complex cognitive functions (e.g., executive function). Therefore,
      targeting basic cognitive functions is the first priority of clinical treatments for
      post-traumatic cognitive impairments.

      Cognitive rehabilitation, a nonpharmacological intervention, is the first-line treatment for
      the management of cognitive impairments following TBI. However, the findings of previous
      reviews are still debated, with one metaanalysis supporting its beneficial effects on
      attention recovery and two metaanalyses denying the positive association between cognitive
      rehabilitation and cognitive recovery. Pharmacotherapies (e.g., methylphenidate) has been
      potentially used to accelerate cognitive recovery in patients with TBI. Nevertheless, recent
      systematic reviews failed to prove its effects on cognitive recovery. Moreover, adverse
      effects may contribute to the discontinuation of stimulant medication use.Taken together,
      current treatments are insufficient for managing post-traumatic cognitive impairments.
      Nurses, the first-line healthcare providers, should therefore seek and employ an alternative
      approach to deal with cognitive impairments following TBI.

      Both abnormal network connectivity of the brain (e.g., low neural communication between
      different brain areas) and dysregulated electroencephalographs (EEGs, e.g., increases in
      alpha and theta, and decrease in beta) following brain damage have been strongly connected to
      deficits in memory, sustained attention, and information processing speed. Neurofeedback (NF)
      can target and alter dysregulated brain functioning by giving real-time feedback of EEG
      activity to patients. Existing literatures have shown that NF might improve attention
      performance after TBI. Nonetheless, the effects of NF on other cognitive functions, such as
      memory and speed of information processing, have not been ascertained. In addition, limited
      methodological features of previous studies, including single group, pre- and posttreatment
      study design, small number of participants, and inconsistent treatment protocols, restrict
      their generalizability and practicability. Most importantly, knowledge regarding cognitive
      improvements being concomitant with changes in EEGs and the long-term effects of NF on
      cognitive recovery following TBI is still lacking.

    <description>LoRETA Z-score NF will be conducted using a 19-lead cap (Electrocap, Inc), which will be placed on the head according to the standard approach of the international 10-20 system with linked ear and ground reference. After the caps will be less than 5 kΩ. During each session, the participants will sit in front of a computer screen on which predesigned games or animations related to the LoRETA Z-score training are played and instructions regarding the inhibitory and reward aspects of the training are taught.</description>

    <intervention_name>theta/beta NF</intervention_name>
    <description>The goal of theta/beta NF is to increase the beta power(13-20 Hz) and simultaneously inhibit the theta power (4-8 Hz) relative to a baseline assessed at the beginning of a training session. The electrodes will be placed on Fz and Cz with a linked ear model(A1). The study will use both visual and auditory feedback. Each participant will sit in front of a computer screen on which predesigned games or animations related to the training criteria are played and instructions regarding the inhibitory and reward aspects of the training are taught. The threshold will be set according to 5-min baseline EEG measurements before each session. The thresholds are the mean amplitude of the beta and the theta in 5-min baseline EEG.</description>
