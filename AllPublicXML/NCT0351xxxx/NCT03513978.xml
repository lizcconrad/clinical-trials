  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of injuries has a close relation with the proprioception. In this sense, the
      proprioception is defined as the information about the corporal and segmental movement, as
      well as the position of the body and the corporal segments of oneself in the space. Some
      authors divide the proprioception into kinesthesia and the Joint Position Sense (JPS).

      The hypothesis of the study is the implantation of a progressive multimodal exercise protocol
      with transferences to sport in the trainings of amateur male soccer players in the age range
      from 18 to 30 years, can decrease the adverse effects of the fatigue during the high
      intensity activities and its relation with the JPS. Due to the close relation between fatigue
      and incidence of injuries, the obtaining of positive results could be an important finding
      for the design of prevention and rehabilitation protocols in soccer.

    <measure>Joint Position Sense of the knee</measure>
    <time_frame>Was measured at baseline (realized before the training), post-treatment (six weeks, realized before the training), ten weeks (before the training) and three months (realized before the trainng)</time_frame>
    <description>A digital inclinometer (range measured in degreesº) was used to assess knee Joint Position Sense in a Closed Kinetic Chain using an active modality (athletes actively reached and maintained the knee). The athletes did three trials to the target position. The average of three trials was used to compared with the target position to obtain the absolute error and relative error.</description>

    <description>The effort perception was measured with Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (Borg RPE), a 15-point single-item scale ranging from 6 to 20 (with anchors ranging from 6 &quot;No exertion&quot; to 20 &quot;Maximum exertion&quot;) (little or no effort) to 20 (maximun exertion) scores</description>

    <measure>Lateral Step Down Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Was measured at baseline (realized before and after the training), post-treatment (six weeks, realized before and after the training), ten weeks (realized only before the training) and three months (realized before and after the training</time_frame>
    <description>Five consecutive test repetitions were then performed. The examiner were positioned 3 m in front of the subject during the test. The examiner evaluated the performance of the test simultaneously and scored the test on a 6-point scale (0-5), according to the criteria outlined by Piva et al. A total score of 0 to 1 was classified as &quot;good&quot; quality of movement, a total score of 2 to 3 was classified as &quot;moderate&quot; quality of movement, and a total score of 4 to 5 was classified as &quot;poor&quot; quality of movement.</description>

    <measure>Counter movement jump</measure>
    <time_frame>Was measured at baseline (realized before and after the training), post-treatment (six weeks, realized before and after the training), ten weeks (realized only before the training) and three months (realized before and after the training</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by app &quot;My Jump 2&quot;, participants performed each CMJ with hands on their hips, starting from a static standing position and with their legs straight during the flight phase of the jump. The landing was performed simultaneously with either feet keeping ankle dorsiflexion. Participants were instructed to jump as high as possible.</description>
