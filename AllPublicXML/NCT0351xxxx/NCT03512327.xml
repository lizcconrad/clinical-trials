  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited data to guide the use of dietary change in the management of IBD, and it can
      prove challenging to implement in the setting of altered anatomy, comorbid conditions, and
      patient compliance. Therefore there is an important need to study diet as a therapy for IBD.
      Here, the investigators propose a novel study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the
      autoimmune protocol (AIP) diet in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC).

      The investigators propose a novel study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the
      autoimmune paleo (AIP) diet in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC).

      Specific aims:

        1. To evaluate the effect of the AIP diet on clinical and endoscopic disease activity for
           CD and UC,

        2. To examine changes in inflammatory biomarkers during AIP diet

        3. To characterize changes in RNA expression from intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens from
           prior to diet initiation to end of the study.

        4. To characterize changes in fecal microbiome during diet intervention

    <description>Clinical disease activity scores will be measured by Harvey Bradshaw Index (0-16+) for patients with Crohn's Disease (CD). The Harvey Bradshaw Index measures general well being, abdominal pain severity, number of stools daily, presence of abdominal mass, and complications. Lower values represent better outcome. Clinical remission is defined as Harvey Bradshaw Index &lt;5 for CD.</description>

    <description>Clinical disease activity scores will be measured by Mayo score (range 0-12) for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The Mayo score includes measures of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician global assessment, and endoscopic assessment. Lower values represent better outcome. Clinical remission is defined as Mayo score 2 or less for UC.</description>
