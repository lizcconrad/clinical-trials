  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Karie Automated Medication
      delivery device in enhancing medication adherence among a group of elderly patients with mild
      to moderate cognitive decline.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the risks associated with poor adherence and the apparent contribution of good
      adherence to reducing hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, interventions
      for promoting good adherence should be pursued. To this end, a number of devices have been
      developed to promote medication adherence, though with limited success due to reliability,
      cost, etc. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Karie Automated
      Medication Delivery Device in enhancing medication adherence among a group of
      community-dwelling patients immediately following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation.

      This study will utilize a multi-site randomized controlled trial design. One week prior to
      discharge from inpatient rehab, consenting patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      medication self-management education only (SME) or medication self-management education +
      Karie (SME+K). Both sites (West Park Healthcare Centre, and CapitalCare) will recruit 150
      participants for the study. At each site, 75 patients will be in the intervention group (SME
      + Karie) and 75 will be in the control group (SME only).

    <description>Patients randomly assigned to receive SME+Karie will 1) undergo Screening for Self Medication Readiness to determine self-management capacity, 2) will receive self-medication education (SME) by a study Occupational Therapist, and 3) receive a 5-day self-medication performance assessment by an Registered Nurse prior to discharge. In addition, this group will receive orientation to the Karie Automated Medication Delivery by the study Occupational Therapist. The participants in the intervention arm will use the Karie device for all applicable medications for the study duration.</description>

    <description>West Park has a &quot;Self-Medication Education Program&quot; policy in place which seeks to establish independent medication self-medication capacity during the inpatient stay. Eligibility criteria for SME include a need to manage medications independently at home; stabilized on medication (as per pharmacist/physician discretion); and mild-moderate cognitive/physical impairments (as per an OT assessment). During SME participants receive training by an Occupational Therapist, followed by a 5-day self-medication performance assessment by an Registered Nurse prior to discharge. Participants in the SME group will fill prescriptions as usual for the duration of study.</description>
