  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between daily
      consumption of NRPT, over a six-month (26-week) period, and changes in liver fat
      accumulation, compared to placebo and change from Baseline in healthy volunteers. In
      addition, an exploratory assessment of markers of inflammation and liver fat metabolism will
      be examined.
