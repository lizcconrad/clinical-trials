  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the evolution over 6 months of Health-Related
      Quality of Life (HRQOL) among different age groups in subjects with prostate cancer treated
      with GnRH agonist therapy.

      Relevant data collected as part of routine medical care will be captured on an electronic
      Case Report Form (eCRF). Investigator-subject questionnaires and subject self-questionnaires
      answers will be collected in a paper booklet. This study is non-interventional, thus if some
      assessments, are not routinely performed by the investigator, he/she will not complete the
      corresponding sections in the eCRF.
