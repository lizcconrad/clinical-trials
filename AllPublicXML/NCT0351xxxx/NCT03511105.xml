  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of GSK2798745 on
      alveolar-septal barrier permeability following LPS challenge in healthy subjects. The influx
      of protein-rich fluid into the lung due to damage to the alveolar capillary barrier, with
      resultant adverse effects on respiratory function, is a fundamental underlying defect in
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In this Phase 1, proof-of-mechanism study, a LPS
      challenge will be used as a surrogate injury model to investigate the effects of Transient
      receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel blockade on alveolar-septal barrier
      permeability in man. This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind
      (sponsor-open), segmental LPS challenge study of GSK2798745 in healthy subjects. Subjects
      will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to take 2 single doses of either 4.8 milligrams
      GSK2798745 followed by 2.4 milligrams GSK2798745 after 12 hours or a dose of placebo followed
      by another dose of placebo after 12 hours. The first dose will be administered on Day 1 at 2
      hours before Baseline bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling from a segment in the left lower
      lobe of lung. LPS 4 nanogram per kilogram will subsequently be instilled into the right
      middle segment and saline control into the lingula segment of the contralateral side. The
      second dose of study treatment will be administered 10 hours after LPS challenge followed by
      post-dose BAL sampling on Day 2. Each subject will take approximately 5 weeks to complete the
      study.
