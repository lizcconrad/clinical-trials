      This phase II trials studies how well acalabrutinib with or without obinutuzumab works in
      treating participants with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic
      lymphoma. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may interfere with the
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving acalabrutinib
      with or without obinutuzumab will work better in treating participants with early-stage
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response (CR)
      rate of acalabrutinib alone and acalabrutinib/obinutuzumab in early stage asymptomatic
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients who are high and
      very high risk by CLL-International Prognostic Index (IPI). (Arms A and B) II. To evaluate
      time to first therapy (TFT) in early stage asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients with low and
      intermediate-risk by CLL-IPI. (Arm C)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the safety of acalabrutinib alone and acalabrutinib/obinutuzumab in early stage
      asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients who are high and very high risk by CLL-IPI.

      II. To compare the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to next
      therapy (TNT) and overall survival (OS) of acalabrutinib alone and acalabrutinib/obinutuzumab
      in early stage asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients who are at high and very high risk by CLL-IPI.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in early
      stage asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients with low and intermediate risk by CLL-IPI.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the quality of life using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
      (FACT-G) quality of life (QOL) survey.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH:

      I. To compare the peripheral blood immune profile using 8-color flow cytometry, to assess
      changes in T-cells, natural killer (NK)-cells, and NK-T cells at baseline and during active
      treatment among patients receiving either acalabrutinib alone or acalabrutinib and
      obinutuzumab.

      II. To determine changes in the peripheral blood immune profile using 8-color flow cytometry
      to assess changes in T-cells, NK-cells, and NK-T cells at baseline and during event
      monitoring in patients with low and intermediate risk by CLL-IPI.

      III. Signal pathway studies-BTK, ERK, PLC gamma and S6 protein levels and phosphorylation
      status will be assessed by Western blot methodology using specific antibodies to pull down
      specific proteins from cell lysates.

      IV. To confirm if in vitro cell killing is via apoptosis we will also assess PARP and caspase
      3 cleavage.

      V. Apoptotic protein studies-MCL-1, XIAP levels will be determined by Western blot
      methodology using specific antibodies to pull down these specific proteins from cell lysates.

      VI. Bone marrow aspirates will be studied for hematopoietic function in two ways: estimation
      of colony forming capacity by purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and evaluation of the
      levels of HSCs and their differentiated progeny (i.e. MPP, CMP, CLP).

      VII. Paired bone marrow and blood samples will be evaluated for the levels of innate effector
      cells.

      VIII. Perform targeted sequencing of 59 genes mainly grouped in 8 biological pathways:
      NOTCH1, B-cell signaling, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response, chromatin modifiers,
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) metabolism, NF-kappaB pathway, cell cycle and apoptosis.

      OUTLINE: Participants with high or very high risk CLL-IPI are randomized to Arm A or Arm B.
      Participants with intermediate or low risk are assigned to Arm C.

      ARM A: Participants receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Participants then receive acalabrutinib PO BID on days 1-84. Treatment
      repeats every 84 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Participants may continue treatment with acalabrutinib If MRD negative CR/CR with
      incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) is not achieved after 12 courses.

      ARM B: Participants receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and
      obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of course 1 and days 1 of subsequent
      courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Participants then receive acalabrutinib PO BID on days 1-84.
      Treatment repeats every 84 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Participants may continue treatment with acalabrutinib If MRD negative
      CR/CRi is not achieved after 12 courses.

      ARM C: Participants will be observed every 6 months for up to 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
