    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mirikizumab in
      participants with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an
      inadequate response to, loss of response, or intolerant to conventional or biologic therapy
      for UC.
