  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma redox status is well known to alter with age but previously differences have only been
      reported for two specific redox couples; reduced and oxidized cysteine and reduced and
      oxidized glutathione. (Jones DP, Rejuvenation Res. 2006) The overall aim of this project is
      to develop new methods to determine how other Reactive Nitrogen and Sulfur species, such as
      free and protein-bound thiols (organic compounds that contain a Sulfhydryl group, -SH) and
      Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) change with age and gender in a medium-sized cohort of healthy
      individuals (n=100 of either sex; age 18-70).

      Our group has recently developed a novel analytical platform to measure thiol-containing
      compounds in biological samples that is based on the reaction with the thiol-alkylating agent
      N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). We have used this chemical for years as stabilisation agent in other
      analyses to quantify Nitric Oxide metabolites.(Feelisch et al, FASEB 2002 and Levett et al,
      Sci Rep 2011) We now wish to develop a similar method to measure thiol containing compounds
      using a novel rapid LC-MS/MS based technology for screening large numbers of individuals.

      The project will therefore have 2 stages:

        1. Initial method development will require occasional use of whole blood, plasma and red
           blood cells to establishing optimal conditions. E.g. to compare heparin and EDTA as
           anticoagulants to serum; investigate effects of temperature and pH; identify optimal
           concentration of derivatisation/reduction agents and optimal reaction times.

        2. We then aim to establish the normal distribution of these novel compounds across healthy
           individuals of different gender and varying ages.
