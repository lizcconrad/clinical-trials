      This study is a randomized controlled study to investigate the effect of &quot;Polyglycolic Acid
      Mesh Sheet (NeoveilTM)&quot; on the thyroid cancer surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is a most common solid organ cancer in South Korea, according to 2014
      statistics from Korea Central Cancer Registry.

      The most important treatment of thyroid cancer is a surgery. Principle of thyroid cancer
      surgery is cancer-involved thyroid gland resection and central/lateral compartment of neck
      node dissection.

      Part of surgical complications associated with neck lymph node dissection are seroma and
      chyle leakage. Incidence of seroma and chyle leakage have been reported as 4-5% and 1-7% in
      previous studies. Currently, there's no effective agents to prevent these complications.

      &quot;Polyglycolic Acid Mesh Sheet (NeoveilTM)&quot; is a tissue strengthening repair agent which is
      prevent air or fluid leakage. It's effects were proven in various surgical field - prevent
      air leakage in lung surgery, reduce pancreatic fistula in pancreas surgery and so on.
      However, there's no result in thyroid cancer surgery.

      This study will investigate the usability of NeoveilTM in thyroid cancer surgery and have the
      effect of preventing seroma and chyle leakage.
