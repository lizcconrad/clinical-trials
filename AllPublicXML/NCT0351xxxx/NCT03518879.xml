      Through this study, the investigators developed the ASTHMA-Educator mobile application, and
      evaluated its use through 2 phases: 1) Phase 1 = process outcomes evaluation with 30
      patients); and 2) Phase 2 (longitudinal clinical evaluation with 40 patients receiving the
      intervention at baseline, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months). The study's primary outcome is
      asthma control.
