  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the effectiveness of selected over-the-counter personal sound
      amplifiers in addressing functional hearing problems in middle-aged listeners with mild
      hearing loss. Many people are unlikely to pay several thousand dollars for hearing aids but
      they likely would be more willing to try a possible solution that is less expensive. When
      faced with counseling these individuals, audiologists are at a loss regarding whether or not
      to suggest that they try this type of technology, since there is virtually no research
      available to verify that these devices actually are helpful, particularly for individuals
      with mild hearing loss. The hypothesis being tested is that personal sound amplifiers can
      improve functional hearing and decrease cognitive load in complex auditory environments.

      The field trials in this project will require you to use OTC hearing devices for a specified
      period of time in both ears simultaneously, and in just one ear, with periodic lab-based
      re-evaluation. Each field trial will continue until asymptotic performance is identified (up
      to a maximum of 12 weeks). You will return to the lab for assessment every 2 weeks. During
      each visit, speech perception and subjective listening effort will be assessed. Depending
      upon the specific field trial, the investigators also will complete measures of cognitive
      load (via dual-task paradigms), spatial release from masking, and localization ability during
      each lab visit.

    <description>Participants will use an over-the-counter hearing device in one ear until asymptotic speech perception performance is noted (maximum 12 weeks). The same individuals will use over-the-counter hearing devices in each ear until asymptotic performance is noted (the order of these two phases will be randomized across participants). They will be asked to use these devices at least 4 hours/day.</description>
