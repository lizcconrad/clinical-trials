  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to complete the identification of genetic factors predisposing to
      thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) by constituting a cohort of 400 Grave's patients with
      or without ocular signs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease (GD) is a common autoimmune condition, and its ocular condition is known as
      thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). There is considerable evidence that both genetic and
      environmental factors are involved in the development of TAO. We conduct a study of 400
      Grave's patients, with or without TAO, and obtain the following data: genetic tests, ocular
      imaging and life style information. Genetic tests are obtained by collection of blood samples
      for DNA extraction, whole-genome sequencing, and identification of cellular biomarkers, using
      transcriptomics and mass cytometry. Ocular imaging data are collected from Orbit MRI
      examination. Life style data are collected using a standardized questionnaire.

        TAO Patients:

        Patients who are diagnosed as Grave's disease and TAO are enrolled into the study from 2
        clinical centers. This diagnosis is made according to classical criteria of TAO, including
        thyroid function testing, ocular examination and orbit MRI examination.

        Control:

        Patients who are diagnosed as Grave's disease but without ocular signs are enrolled into
        the study from 2 clinical centers. This diagnosis of Grave's disease is made according to
        classical criteria including thyroid function testing. Ocular signs are excluded by routine
        ocular examination and orbit MRI examination.
