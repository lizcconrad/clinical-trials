  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of women in the US who are breastfeeding their infants take prescription drugs. You
      are being asked to participate in this study because you are breastfeeding your infant and
      are currently taking, as part of your medical care, at least one of the drugs we are
      studying. We are interested in studying drugs commonly prescribed to women who are
      breastfeeding so we can learn more about the amount of drug that is transferred to breastmilk
      and estimate how much of drug that is consumed by breastfed infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if the study drugs of interest are found in
      breastmilk and how much; to estimate the amount of drug that is consumed by breastfed infants
      and what effect this may have on infants; and to share what we learn with other researchers.
      The study drugs of interest have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, but there is
      little or no information about the amount of drug found in the breastmilk of mothers who take
      them; the amount of drug that may be transferred to their infant's through breastmilk; or the
      effects this transfer may have on their infants. During this study we will ask to collect
      breastmilk and blood from mothers, and blood from infants, to measure the amount of study
      drug of interest in these body fluids. Results from this study will help researchers better
      understand how much of the study drug of interest is in your blood and breastmilk, and how
      much of the study drug of interest may be in your infant's blood because of breastfeeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concomitant condition which, in the opinion of the physicians providing patient
             care or the principal investigator conducting the study, would preclude a subject's
