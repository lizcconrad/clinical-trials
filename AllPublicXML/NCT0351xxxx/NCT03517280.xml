  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to investigate the effect of treatment of neuroblastoma on nutritional
      status, assessed by body mass index (BMI) z score, and body composition evaluated by
      mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), from diagnosis through 1-year post end of treatment. The
      study also aims to investigate the nutritional status and its role in toxicities, infection,
      survival rates, disease relapse, cost of care and readmission rates, as well as
      health-related quality of life. The study will take place in Sao Paolo in Brazil, where an
      estimated sample of 50 children with neuroblastoma will be recruited for the period of 2
      years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Brazil, cancer represents the leading cause of death by disease in children and
      adolescents from 1 to 19 years old. Neuroblastomas correspond to nearly 10% of all cancer
      diagnoses among children younger than 15 years of age, with an incidence of 1 case per
      100,000 children of this age group. About 500 new cases of neuroblastoma (NB) are diagnosed
      annually in Brazil. The complexity and intensity of treatment result in several
      treatment-related toxicities (TRT) that make it challenging to maintain nutritional status in
      these nutritionally at-risk patients. In Brazil, up to 26% of undernutrition at diagnosis has
      been found in patients with solid tumors. In neuroblastoma, high prevalence rates of
      malnutrition have been reported elsewhere with up to 80% of children at diagnosis and 20-50%
      during treatment classified as undernourished. It's important to underscore that nutritional
      status is a modifiable risk factor, therefore it needs more attention and close monitoring.
      It is important to better comprehend the effect of treatment for neuroblastoma on nutritional
      status and body composition, for which prospective longitudinal studies are required.
      Therefore, in this prospective cohort study, the investigators will evaluate the fluctuations
      in nutritional status over the course of treatment in children with neuroblastoma at the
      study center in São Paulo, Brazil. The results of this study will drive the development of
      evidence-based guidelines for the nutritional care of children with neuroblastoma and set
      research priorities for subsequent investigations.

      Blood collection to bank plasma and serum will occur at diagnosis, after completion of immune
      therapy and at 12 month post-treatment.

      For micronutrient analysis, 3 to 5 mL of the patient's venous blood will be collected without
      anticoagulant to study To obtain serum and plasma, to bank for future micronutrient analysis,
      blood samples (10 mL) will be collected by venipuncture.

        Demographic variables will be collected from medical records, including date of birth, sex,
        city/state/country of residence, date of diagnosis and ethnicity. Socioeconomic data (per
        capita annual income and living conditions) will be drawn from the institutions' social
        work service charts. The data will be collected in hospital - Instituto de Tratamento do
        Câncer Infantil, in Sao Paolo, Brazil.

        The investigators will also collect clinical outcome data from the medical chart. The
        incidence of infectious toxicity, all Grade 3 and 4 toxicities (defined by the National
        Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC)), death, disease relapse or
        progression, number of days in the hospital and delays in treatment will be documented
        during each cycle.
