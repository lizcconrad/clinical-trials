  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to improve inpatient monitoring of severely-ill children
      admitted to the hospital in low resource settings at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi,
      Kenya. Given the high ratio of patients to medical staff in these settings, the lack of
      reliable patient monitoring tools, and the high rate of early inpatient mortality, we will
      prospectively train parents as monitoring aids of their hospitalized children. Early
      recognition and intervention in critical illness is important to avoid (further) organ
      failure. Parents will be taught how to assess their child's mental status, work of breathing
      and capillary refill time which will inform a 3-point severity of illness scale. The severity
      of illness will be conveyed by the parents to the medical staff via color-coded flag system.
      The goal is to increase the healthcare provider patient reassessment rate according to
      patients' level of severity to assist in early recognition and treatment of patients'
      deterioration.

    <description>Number of healthcare provider assessments will be associated with the number of clinical procedures performed on patients. Invasive clinical procedures include, but are not limited to lumbar puncture, thoracentesis, abscess drainage).

    <time_frame>First 24 hrs after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of healthcare provider assessments will be associated with the change in patients' PEWS score between time of enrollment and 24 hrs status post enrollment. The bedside PEWS is measured by 6 components, including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, capillary refill time, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory effort and oxygen therapy. The score ranges between zero to 24 point, with 24 point representing the highest severity level.</description>

    <description>The intervention group parents will be taught the FASTER assessment tool. Intervention group parents will each be asked to monitor their own hospitalized child hourly using the FASTER assessment tool, and put up color-coded flags indicating severity of illness to the healthcare team. Parents will record the frequency of healthcare provider assessments of their child over the 24 hour intervention period.</description>

    <description>The control group parents will not be taught the FASTER assessment tool. Hence they will not be involved in monitoring their child, nor signaling severity of their child's illness per color-coded flag system.

    <description>The FASTER assessment tool consists of monitoring mental status, respiratory distress and capillary refill time by parents of children admitted to the hospital with febrile illness. Parents in the intervention group are asked to monitor their child hourly with the FASTER tool and signal severity of illness to the healthcare team via color coded flag system. Number of healthcare provider - patient reassessments will be compared in intervention and control group.</description>
