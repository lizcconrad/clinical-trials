  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication non-adherence can lead to serious health issues for older adults. This study is a
      four week study in older adults using a new device, the eDosette, which dispenses and records
      how one takes their medications, and subsequently makes this information available to the
      primary care team by the internet. This study aims to show that the eDosette can report how
      well a group of older adults living independently in the community are taking their
      medications (e.g. &quot;medication adherence&quot;). This study hopes to show that the eDosette
      intervention could play a role in medication adherence by improving conversations between
      older adults and primary care.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant's observed medication adherence for the entire study was calculated by dividing the total medication doses taken correctly by the total doses in the study. The numerator, total medication doses taken correctly is calculated by subtracting from the total doses any missed or late doses as determined by the eDosette. Missed doses is defined as any dose still present on image data after the next daily scheduled dose time); late doses is defined as any dose taken outside the two-hour time window of the average time of dose administration - e.g. 08h00-10h00 for a 09h00 average dose time. The denominator, total doses, was defined as the total number of pills prescribed for a patient to take during the study.</description>

    <description>The eDosette is an internet-enabled, medication administration monitoring unit that has been previously tested for feasibility in older adults. The eDosette was designed to be compatible with different types of weekly medication blister packs and dosettes, and monitors medication-taking behaviour in a patient's home. The eDosette securely transmits this information to a secure server where the information is converted to individual medication administration records. Patients can also use the eDosette to notify their primary care team of potential medication side effects.</description>
