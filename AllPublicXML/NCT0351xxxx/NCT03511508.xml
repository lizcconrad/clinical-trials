  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of pregnant women affected by chronic diseases such as epilepsy, hypertension and
      thyroid disease is rising, and in the Danish population 15 % of all pregnant women had a
      chronic disease in 2016. Chronic disease increase the risk of complications during pregnancy
      such as preterm birth and caesarian section, while children born of mothers with chronic
      disease have an increased risk of low birthweight, prematurity and birth effects. Moreover,
      pregnant women with chronic disease have an increased risk of post-natal depression and
      report higher rates of anxiety during pregnancy and have described dissatisfaction with the
      communication with care providers about issues such as breastfeeding, lack of coherence
      during the course of pregnancy and after delivery.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of an increased, interdisciplinary,
      coordinated and specialized maternity care multimodal intervention for pregnant women with
      chronic medical disease on the length of hospitalization (during pregnancy and after
      delivery). Secondarily, the purpose is to examine the effect of the intervention on
      psychological well-being and patient satisfaction.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the delivery of an increased interdisciplinary,
      coordinated and specialized intervention targeted pregnant women with pre-existing chronic
      disease will be beneficial for this group of pregnant women's' length of hospitalization
      during pregnancy and after delivery due to improved maternity care and improved self-care.
      Also, the investigators hypothesize that the effect of the intervention will be improved
      psychological well-being and satisfaction with care during pregnancy and after delivery.

    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with chronic disease such as epilepsy, sclerosis, heart disease, hypertension,
      and thyroid disorders have a significant increased risk of pregnancy complications such as
      spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and caesarian section. Children born by mothers
      affected by chronic disease have a higher risk of low birthweight, prematurity and birth
      defects. Moreover women affected by chronic disease have a higher incidence of post-natal
      depression than women with no history of chronic disease.

      Previous studies have found that pregnant some women with chronic medical disorders
      experienced a lack of continuity in the maternity care: they felt that their different care
      providers were giving contradictory information on issues such as mode of delivery,
      breastfeeding and medications. This lack of continuity led to dissatisfaction with care and
      insecurity with decision-making.

      Previous studies that evaluate maternity care interventions, have shown that the elements of
      the interventions that have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes such as lowering
      pregnancy and birth complications, health costs and patient satisfaction are: increased
      care-coordination, continuity of care providers, specially trained care providers (e.g.
      nurses and midwives), specialized teams, focus on transitions from e.g. one care setting to
      another and individualized women-centered care.

      However, none of these studies have been targeted pregnant women with chronic medical disease
      and how to optimize their course of maternity care. Moreover, systematic reviews point out
      that studies that examine the effect of the interventions on patient satisfaction, health
      costs and psychological well-being.

      On this background, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of an increased,
      interdisciplinary, coordinated and specialized maternity care multimodal intervention for
      pregnant women with chronic medical disease on the length of hospitalization (during
      pregnancy and after delivery). Secondarily, the purpose is to examine the effect of the
      intervention on psychological well-being and patient satisfaction.

      Patient enrollment The patients will be recruited from the Department of Obstetrics,
      Rigshospitalet, Denmark from August 2018 to December 2020. Participants will be selected on
      the basis of 1) the journal information provided from the women's general practitioner and 2)
      an electronic questionnaire that all pregnant women at Rigshospitalet are sent by e-mail and
      more than 90 % return before 10 weeks of gestation. The information from the questionnaire is
      routinely transferred to the women's medical journals. Potential participants receive patient
      information about the study at around week 9-17 of gestation depending on how early the
      hospital, receive the information about the pregnancy.

      The first contact to the patient will be made by phone or by e-mail at around week 9-18,
      depending on the timing of visitation to care at Rigshospitalet (contact is made as early as
      possible). A midwife from the study will ask if the woman wishes more information about the
      study and if so she can ask questions and a date for a personal meeting is set. At the
      meeting additional information about the study will be given before written informed consent
      is obtained and randomization takes place.

      Data collection. All participants complete an electronic baseline questionnaire after
      informed consent is obtained and before randomization. All data from the electronically
      distributed questionnaires are stored in a secured database.

      Questionnaire number two (33-37 weeks of gestation) and questionnaire three (two months after
      delivery) will be sent to the participants by e-mail and the returned questionnaires will be
      stored in a secured database.

      Other data will be obtained from patient records.

      Sample size The number of participants needed for the study is 260 women. The calculations
      have been made on the primary outcome measure, length of hospital stay (number of days during
      pregnancy to two weeks after delivery) based on data about hospitalization from pregnant
      women with the same chronic medical disease from 2015-2017 at Rigshospitalet as the
      participants in this study. We expect, at the effect of the intervention will be a reduction
      in length of hospital stay at 1.5 days. With a power of 80 % and a two-sided significance
      level of 5 %, a difference at 1.5 days (SD=4.05) can be detected by a two-sample t-test with
      116 participants in each group.

      The investigators expect it will be necessary to include a total of 260 participants, as it
      can be anticipated that 11 % of the enrolled participants will drop out.

      The primary data analysis will be performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle.
      Relevant multivariable tests will be carried by comparing secondary end points at follow-up.

      A pilot study with 15-20 participants will be carried out from August-September 2018. During
      the pilot study the recruitment and randomization procedure will be tested and the returned
      questionnaires will be evaluated.
