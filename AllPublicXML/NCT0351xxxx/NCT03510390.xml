      The study evaluates the effects of the drug Metformin on the oxygen content in cancer tissue.
      Low oxygen concentration in cancer tissue accelerates cancer growth. Moreover, the response
      to radiation therapy is worse when tissue oxygen is low, because radiation therapy depends on
      oxygen to unfold therapeutic effects. Metformin has been used to treat type II diabetes for
      over 50 years and features additional properties that could slow down cancer growth. One of
      these properties is the improved oxygen concentration in cancer tissue. This effect has been
      proven for various cancers.

      This study was planned to verify this effect in head and neck cancer. Patients who suffer
      from cancer of the mouth and are planned for surgical removal of the cancer will be given
      Metformin for 9 to 14 days. The tissue removed in the subsequent surgery will be compared to
      a tissue sample that had been taken from the same patient prior to Metformin intake. To
      evaluate the oxygen content in the tissue samples, the expression of genes that react to
      oxygen levels will be measured and compared between the samples taken before and after
      treatment with Metformin.

      A secondary aim is to evaluate whether changes in the oxygen content within the tumor can be
      visualized by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, participants undergo an
      MRI scan, before and after Treatment with Metformin. The changes in the MRI will be
      correlated to the changes measured in gene expression.

      The main objective of this trial is to prove the hypothesis that Metformin reduces tissue
      hypoxia in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma after a course of treatment of 9-14 days.

      The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in hypoxia-regulated gene expression upon
      Treatment with Metformin. Secondary endpoint are changes in MRI imaging correlating with the
      changes in gene expression.

      Study design: This is a single-arm, open-label interventional window of opportunity study for
      proof of principle. Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma is primarily treated by surgical
      tumor resection. This offers the possibility to study the effect of metformin on the tumor
      tissue.

      Baseline tissue from potential participants before the intervention will be acquired by
      biopsy during diagnostic panendoscopy. Provided surgery is recommended by tumor board
      decision, participants will be orally administered 850 mg of metformin twice daily between
      the therapeutic decision of the tumor board and the surgical resection of the tumor. The
      duration of the treatment is 9-14 days, depending on the date of the planned surgery. The
      resected tumor tissue as well as the biopsy taken prior to metformin treatment will be
      subjected to massive parallel sequencing and immunohistochemistry.

      To assess whether changes in hypoxia regulated gene expression can be correlated to changes
      in MRI scans, each participants will undergo a MRI scan before metformin treatment and a
      second MRI scan within 48 hours prior to the surgical resection of the tumor.
