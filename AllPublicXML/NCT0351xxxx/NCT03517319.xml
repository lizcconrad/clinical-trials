      Study Design: Randomized Single Blind Study Objective: To determine the dose relationship of
      DWP 450 for finger flexor spasticity Subjects: 78 patients with upper extremity spasticity
      after CVA Inclusion criteria: Patient who have spasticity (MAS greater than 2 in finger
      flexors) Methods: Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 5 groups. Gp 1: placebo, Gp 2:
      15U, Gp 3: 30 U, Gp 4: 50 U, Gp 5: 75 U

      Seventy-eight patients with upper extremity spasticity after cerebrovascular accident will be
      recruited and randomly assigned to one of 5 groups. The groups are as followings.

      Gp 1: placebo group (Normal saline 1.2 ml) Gp 2: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A (Nabota,
      DWP 450) 15 U Gp 3: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A (Nabota, DWP 450) 30 U Gp 4:
      Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A (Nabota, DWP 450) 50 U Gp 5: Clostridium Botulinum Toxin
      Type A (Nabota, DWP 450) 70 U

      According to the group, the injection will be performed to the finger flexor musles (flexor
      digitorum superficialis and profundus). Outcome measurement will be MAS (Modified ashworth
      scale), FMA, Wolf Motor Assessment, Cross sectional area measured by Ultrasonography.

      Patient evaluation will be conducted 2 weeks, 1 months, 2 months, and 3 months after the
      injection.
