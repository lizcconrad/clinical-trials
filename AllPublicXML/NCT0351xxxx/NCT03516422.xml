  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial step of wound management, debridement, is thought to be critical in promoting
      wound healing. Of the numerous debridement modalities, ultrasound seems to hold promising
      results in accelerate healing in our own clinical experience here at St. Michael's Hospital.
      In brief, ultrasound debridement is a method of removing devitalized tissue through
      microstreaming and cavitational effects. The non-thermal energy up-regulates cellular
      activity and promotes growth factor and protein synthesis, fibrinolysis, and is
      anti-bacterial . The technology selectively emulsifies dead and dying tissues with
      micro-sized gas bubbles, stimulates membranes of surrounding healthy cells, and renders
      bacteria more susceptible to antibiotic treatment. Thus, in addition to creating an optimal
      environment, the modality also serves to promote the process of healing. A systematic review
      and meta-analysis by Voigt et al. (2011) examined the use of low-frequency (20-30 kHz)
      ultrasound in randomized-controlled trials. It was found that low or high-intensity delivery
      of low-frequency ultrasound both promoted early healing in lower-extremity wounds. At St.
      Michael's Hospital, ultrasound debridement is already being used in the wound clinic with
      promising results. However, objective comparisons need to be made to validate our clinical
      observations. The goal of the proposed pilot study is to assess the feasibility of our
      current study design. The information gathered will allow us to refine the research
      methodology for the development of a larger-scale study.

    <description>The subject positioned so absorbent pads are in position to catch irrigation solution. The saline bottle will be held 10-15 cm from wound bed, and squeezed to spray all surfaces of wound in a sweeping motion, from clean to dirty area of wound. Irrigation will be repeated as necessary to remove exudate, slough, and debris from the wound until the solution draining from the wound is clear. Peri-wound skin will be cleansed using gauze and sterile normal saline and dry. Packing material will be applied (Acticoat速) into the wound cavity, undermining, or tunnel to fill the dead space without causing the wound to stretch or bulge or be packed tightly. Packing should be in contact with entire wound base and edges. Dressings changed once every 3 days by the patient's care provider.</description>

    <description>Low-frequency ultrasound SonicOne O.R. (Misonix, New York, US) generates ultrasound waves with 22.5 kHz frequency. Each probe is attached to a set of irrigation solution (saline 0.9%), they transform electric energy into mechanical vibrations to induce tiny particles of water from irrigation fluid. Absorbent pads are positioned to catch excess saline. With SonicOne set at continuous mode with minimum pump flow, the debridement will begin at most distal aspect of ulcer with the hand piece in constant motion until entire ulcer surface has been debrided until as much necrotic tissue has been removed. Peri-wound skin will be cleansed using gauze and sterile normal saline and dry. Packing material will be applied (Acticoat速) into wound cavity.</description>
