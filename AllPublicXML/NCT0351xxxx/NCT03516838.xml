      A clinical trial to evaluate a filling material (ACTIVA) and compare it to a traditional
      filling material (compomer) to restore decayed deciduous teeth in children
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A tooth decay in deciduous teeth has to be restored with proper filling material. ACTIVA™
      BioACTIVE is a new filling material which has the ability to release and recharge fluoride in
      the oral cavity which is important for preventing further tooth decay. In this study we will
      compare this new filling material with Compomer (the traditional control filling material) by
      restoring decayed deciduous molars with one of the mentioned filling materials.

      Both filling materials have no reported adverse effect and used regularly in the dental
      practice.

      The treatment procedure is performed in healthy children from both genders with decayed
      deciduous molars aged between 5 to 10 years by one operator in the dental chair under local
      anesthesia in the department of pediatric dentistry and special care, Ghent University
      hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

      At least 35 teeth is needed to demonstrate an effect. Each material is placed randomly based
      on randomization done by the computer. Each participant will receive both types of
      treatments, one type on each side of the mouth.

      The participants will come back each six months to check the success of each treatment group
      by two trained dentists other than the operator. and to check whether the control group
      performs similar, better or worse than the control group.

      The duration of treatment procedure of both treatment groups is recorded and compared to
      check if one filling material takes less time than the other to placed in the oral cavity.

    <masking_description>During treatment, the type of filling material was concealed from the patient, and the patient had no information which material was used in each side of the mouth. The type of material was not mentioned in the patient's file. Instead, it was replaced by a combination which the outcomes assessors were not familiar with. The operator was also blinded for the type of restoration during tooth preparation and was informed only at the time of restoration placement. The purpose of this discretion was to ensure double blinding both at the patient, as well as the outcomes assessor level.</masking_description>
