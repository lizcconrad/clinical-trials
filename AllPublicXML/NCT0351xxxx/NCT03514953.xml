  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will examine the role of physical activity (PA) on altering sleep
      quality (SQ) while systematically examining novel mechanisms that may drive changes in SQ.
      Specifically, the study will examine how a 2 week reduction in PA alters sleep quality in
      young, healthy individuals. Additionally, during this reduction in PA, the study will examine
      changes in inflammation, oxidative stress, and sympathetic activity to identify potential
      mechanisms for alterations in sleep quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep, which makes up approximately one third of an individual's life, plays a vital role in
      normal bodily functioning by regulating metabolic and endocrine function. Disturbed sleep,
      defined as any alteration to normal sleep patterns, is highly prevalent, affecting 35% and
      41% of the general population in the United States and has been linked to poor cardiovascular
      health, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Young adults are a population at
      high risk for disturbed sleep-related health outcomes due to negative lifestyle behaviors
      such as alcohol consumption, drug use, study patterns, and excessive screen time that remain
      with advancing age. Due to the importance of improving or maintaining health outcomes through
      adequate sleep quality (SQ), the proposed research will examine the role of physical activity
      (PA) on altering SQ while systematically examining novel mechanisms that may drive changes in
      SQ. Specifically, this study will examine how alterations (increases and decreases) in PA
      impact SQ and how these alterations modify inflammation, oxidative stress, and sympathetic
      stimulation in young adults.

    <description>Preliminary Phase (Baseline to Day 7): Subjects will begin wearing an accelerometer for 7 days to track physical activity and sleep patterns.
Experimental Phase 1 (Day 7 to Day 21): Participants will be required to reduce their step count by 5,000 steps per day and engage in no moderate-vigorous physical activity during this timeframe. Every 7 days subjects undergo the blood draw, vascular health measures and questionnaire assessments.
Experimental Phase 2 (Day 21 to 28): During the week of assessment, subjects will be asked to return to their normal physical activity patterns.</description>
