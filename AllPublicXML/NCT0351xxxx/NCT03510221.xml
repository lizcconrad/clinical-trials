  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that there is a directly proportional relationship between diets
      with a high concentration of antioxidants and the reduction of blood pressure and the risk of
      cardiovascular events. However, there is a gap with regard to research on the effects of
      these diets on vascular function, especially in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the effect of antioxidant supplementation through the consumption of blueberry, cranberry and
      pomegranate extract capsules (1 of each per day), the effect of the autonomic balance in
      hypertensive and normotensive adults.

      A clinical trial was performed, with 60 individuals, 30 normotensive and 30 hypertensive
      patients. Participants were of both sex, aged between 18 and 60 years and Body Mass Index
      (BMI) less than 35 kg / m². Venous blood samples were collected after 12-hour fasting for
      biochemical measurements (glucose, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
      triglycerides, uric acid, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, insulin), and adiponectin ,
      interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-2β (IL-2β), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1),
      leptin, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 and
      nitrotyrosine. An anthropometric evaluation was performed with measures of weight, height,
      waist circumference and cervical circumference. The hemodynamic evaluation was done through a
      non-invasive monitor. The study participants were divided into 2 different groups: Group A
      (normotensive) and Group B (hypertensive). The capsules for antioxidant supplementation were
      of blueberry, cranberry and pomegranate, being one capsule of each a day. Study participants
      received placebo capsules for 4 weeks and then received the fruit extract capsules
      (blueberry, cranberry and pomegranate), one capsule a day for 4 weeks. All tests were
      performed at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention. The comparison between groups was
      performed with the Multiple Comparison Test (ANOVA). The research project was approved by the
      Ethics Committee for Analysis of Research Projects (CAPPesq) of the Hospital das Clinicas of
      the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo. Participation in the research was
      voluntary and all participants read and signed the consent form. The risk for the present
      participant was minimal.
