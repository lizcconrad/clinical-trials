  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the influence of methylphenidate (Metadate®) and duloxetine
      (Cymbalta®), alone and in combination, on the reinforcing, subjective and physiological
      effects of cocaine.

    <measure>Delay Discounting Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Nine times over approximately four weeks inpatient admission.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete the delay discounting task during nine sessions while they are admitted to our inpatient unit. Responses will be used to calculate discounting slope (i.e., K).</description>
