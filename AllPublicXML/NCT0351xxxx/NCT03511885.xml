      EUROASPIRE is a multicentre European study in coronary patients and individuals at high risk
      of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), describing their management through lifestyle and
      use of drug therapies and providing an objective assessment of clinical implementation of
      current scientific knowledge. Four EUROASPIRE surveys have been carried out by the European
      Society of Cardiology so far: EUROASPIRE I in 1995-1997 in nine countries, EUROASPIRE II in
      1999- 2000 in 15 countries, EUROASPIRE III in 2006-2009 in 22 countries and EUROASPIRE IV in
      2012-2015 in 26 countries. The results showed a wide gap between the recommendations and
      clinical practice with many patients not achieving the lifestyle and medical risk factors
      goals for CVD prevention. The fifth EUROASPIRE survey is planned for 2016-2018 to determine
      in hospital coronary patients and apparently healthy individuals in primary care at high risk
      of developing cardiovascular disease whether the European and national guidelines on
      cardiovascular disease prevention have been followed and if the practice of preventive
      cardiology in EUROASPIRE IV has improved by comparison with those centres which took part in
      EUROASPIRE I, II, III and IV. This survey will also incorporate an assessment of dysglycaemia
      and kidney function in all patients. The main outcome measures will be the proportions of
      coronary and high cardiovascular risk patients achieving the lifestyle, risk factor and
      therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease prevention. The data collection will be based
      on a review of patient medical records and a patient interview and examination at least 6
      months and at most 3 years after recruiting event. All countries which participated in the
      first three surveys will be invited to take part in EUROASPIRE V. This fifth survey will give
      a unique picture of preventive action by cardiologists and primary care physicians looking
      after patients with coronary disease and individuals at high CVD risk.

      A fifth European survey of Cardiovascular Disease prevention and Diabetes (EUROASPIRE V) is
      being conducted in 2016-2018 under the auspices of the European Society of Cardiology,
      EURObservational Research Programme. This fifth survey incorporate an assessment of
      dysglycaemia and kidney function in all patients. As in the previous EUROASPIRE surveys this
      survey focusses on hospital patients with coronary heart disease, with and without diabetes
      mellitus, and apparently healthy individuals in primary care at high risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease including those with diabetes.

      This multicentre European study identifies risk factors in coronary patients and high-risk
      individuals, describes their management through lifestyle and use of drug therapies providing
      an objective assessment of clinical implementation of scientific knowledge as reflected in
      current European management guidelines. For the first time we extended this new survey to
      include more information about medication adherence, atrial fibrillation, familial
      hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. All
      centres and countries that participated in the first four surveys are invited to participate
      in the fifth European Survey of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Diabetes (EUROASPIRE V)
      and new countries and centres will be included. This fifth survey will give a unique European
      picture of preventive action by cardiologists, other specialists and primary care physicians
      looking after patients with coronary disease and their families, individuals at high risk of
      developing CVD and all those with dysglycaemia, diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
      Europe.
