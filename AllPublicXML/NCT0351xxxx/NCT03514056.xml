      In various studies, the incidence of fibromyalgia in Behçet's patients is widely distributed.
      It was aimed to investigate the frequency and severity of fibromyalgia in Behcet disease in
      province Bursa.

    <textblock>
      There are few studies in the literature investigating the frequency of fibromyalgia in
      Behçet's disease. In various studies, the incidence of fibromyalgia in Behçet's disease was
      5.7% -37.1%, which is widely distributed. There are no studies in literature comparing
      disease severity and pain thresholds at trigger points in fibromyalgia with and without
      Behcet's disease. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the frequency of fibromyalgia in
      Behcet's disease according to the criteria defined by the American Colloge of Rheuatology in
      2010 and updated in 2013. It was also aimed to compare the severity of disease in
      fibromyalgia with and without Behcet's disease.

    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Fibromyalgia 2013 criteria were derived from the 10-item symptom score from the Symptom Impact Questionnaire (SIQR) symptoms and the 28-area pain location inventory (PLI). If the patients PLI score is above 17 (range 0-28) and an SIQR symptom score is above 21 (range 0-50), the participant will be diagnosed with fibromyalgia</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Six days</time_frame>
    <description>The fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) has 21 individual questions . All questions are based on an 11-point numeric rating scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being 'worst'. In the FIQ, all questions are framed in the context of the past 7 days. The total maximal score of the FIQ is 100.</description>

    <measure>Pain thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain thresholds will be recorded by applying pressure to the 28 sensitive points until the participants demonstrate pain. Manual algometry device will be used to measure the pain threshold.</description>
