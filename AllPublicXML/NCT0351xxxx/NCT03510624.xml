      Investigate the acute effect of the steviol glycoside, rebaudioside A, on the glucose
      excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      Eligible individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be invited for two study visits.
      During the first study visit, an OGTT (baseline) will be performed and afterwards,
      rebaudioside A will be administered. At the second study visit, an OGTT will be executed to
      measure the response on rebaudioside A administration. The area under the curve blood glucose
      values during the first two hours of the OGTT will be compared for both conditions.
