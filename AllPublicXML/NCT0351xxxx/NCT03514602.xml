  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the effect of smoking cessation in pregnancy or in
      lactation on preventing rapid infant adiposity gain. Investigators propose a randomized,
      controlled experiment among smoking pregnant women from 1st prenatal care visit through 6
      months of postpartum period. Two-phase randomization will be applied to separate the effects
      of smoking cessation in two different critical periods (i.e., pregnancy and lactation) on
      infant adiposity gain. Investigators will first randomly assign 40 smoking pregnant women
      into either the multicomponent intervention (N=30) or the education-only control group
      (N=10). The multicomponent intervention group will receive education and counseling,
      monitoring and feedback, contingent financial incentives, and family support, while the
      control group will receive education only. At the end of pregnancy, investigators will
      further randomize successful quitters (estimated N=20) from the multi-component intervention
      group into either the continuous multi-component intervention group in lactation (N=10) or
      the education-only control group (N=10). All women and their newborns will be followed from
      enrollment to 6 months postpartum. The key outcomes include maternal smoking abstinence
      confirmed by urine-cotinine and infant gain in weight-for-length z-score. Specific Aim 1 is
      to examine the effects of maternal smoking cessation intervention in pregnancy on infant gain
      in weight-for-length z-score from birth to 6 months. Specific Aim 2 is to examine the effect
      of maternal smoking abstinence intervention in lactation and infant post-weaning gain in
      weight-for-length z-score among the women who have successfully quit smoking in pregnancy.

    <description>Pregnant patients in the intervention group will receive multicomponent interventions consisting of education, feedback, contingent financial incentives, and peer support. At initial intervention visit, they will choose a quit date within the next 14 days and sign a no-smoking pledge and a no-smoking contract. The contract lists the intervention components, the patient's and the counselor's responsibilities, importance of keeping scheduled visits, and rules on contingent incentives. After the quit date, pregnant women will meet with counselors daily for 5 consecutive days (Monday to Friday) for abstinence monitoring in weeks 1-2. The frequency of abstinence monitoring will decrease to twice a week (Monday and Thursday) in weeks 3-8, weekly in weeks 9-12, and biweekly in weeks 13 until delivery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to read, understand, and speak English.

          2. Are 18-39 years old

          3. Are less than 20 weeks of gestation

          4. Have a singleton pregnancy

          5. Currently smoking one or more cigarettes per day, based on self-report.

          6. Currently smoking biochemically verified by a level of 1 or higher in urine cotinine
             test (i.e., &gt;100ng/mL cotinine concentration).

          7. Willing to try to quit or reduce smoking by behavioral intervention

          8. Willing to monitor smoking status by breath carbon monoxide and saliva cotinine.

          9. Willing to provide breath, saliva, and urine samples to test smoking status

         10. With low household income (meeting federal income eligibility guidelines for the
             Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) and/or low
             education level (â‰¤12 years). These disadvantaged pregnant women are very likely not to
             quit spontaneously, and thus need extra intervention most.

         11. Currently living in Erie County or Niagara County; don't plan to move out of these two
             counties during the current pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous history of major chronic disease or blood clotting disorders such as cancer,
             thyroid disorders, heart disease, kidney disease

          2. Depression or have been diagnosed with depression or post-partum depression at any
             time

          3. In treatment for Axis 1 disorders that prevent them following smoking cessation
             interventions
