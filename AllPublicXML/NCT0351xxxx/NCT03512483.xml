  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a new model of specialty care for older adults in rural communities with
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) compared to usual rural physician care. Half the participants will
      receive the new model of specialty care, the Virtual AF Clinic (vAFC), while the other half
      will receive usual care. The vAFC will combine usual care, telehealth appointments with AF
      specialized nurse practitioners/cardiologist, and an educational website. Participants will
      be recruited from rural physician offices and will be followed for 12 months collecting data
      at four time points on AF quality of life, AF knowledge, healthcare utilization (e.g.,
      hospital/emergency department/physician visits), lifestyle behaviors (e.g., physical
      activity), and stroke/bleeding risk. This will generate evidence to determine the feasibility
      of scaling up the vAFC model to other sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diseases and unhealthy behaviors are more prevalent in older adults in rural
      communities yet they have less access to healthcare, especially specialist care. This is
      problematic for the rising population of older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have
      rapid disease progression, and increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and death. In rural
      communities with specialty care gaps, a virtually delivered AFC offers a viable cost
      effective option for older adults with AF compared to general practitioner (GP) care, given
      the complexity of AF patients with multiple co-morbidities and poor symptom control.

      The purpose of phase 3 of this multi-phase study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial
      to test a newly developed virtual AF clinic in comparison to usual rural GP care.

      Participants in the control group (usual care) will receive usual GP care in their rural
      communities. Usual care will include some combination of treatment, education, and support as
      per each GPs individual practice. Participants will also have contact with the research team
      during the four data collection time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).

      Participants in the intervention group (vAFC) will receive usual GP care plus the vAFC which
      consists of telehealth appointments with Nurse Practitioner/Cardiologist and access to an AF
      specific educational website. It is anticipated the vAFC, as with the onsite clinic, will
      include up to a maximum of four scheduled telehealth appointments: an initial appointment
      following randomization, at 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Participants will attend
      appointments at their local hospital. Appointments will follow the usual protocol of the
      onsite AF clinic in Kelowna including, but not limited to, reviewing with patients their
      vital signs, tests (e.g., Echo, Holter, stress test), symptom management, concerns, and
      medications.

      In addition to the telehealth appointments participants in the intervention group will also
      have access to an educational AF website. Following randomization participants will be given
      an orientation on how to access the website, its purpose, and a tour of the content. The
      website content is inclusive of topics specific to AF, such as; (1) What is AF, (2) Risk
      Factors, (3) Lifestyle, (4) Symptom Management, (5) Complications, (6) Frequently Asked
      Questions, and (7) Patient Stories. Content was developed and vetted by researchers and
      clinicians to ensure information is relevant, up to date, and evidence based. To promote and
      encourage website interaction, emails will be sent to participants once a month for the
      duration of the intervention with highlights and important messages from the website

    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 7 point likert scale measuring how much their atrial fibrillation has bothered them over the past 4 weeks, where 1= &quot;not at all&quot; and 7 = &quot;extremely&quot;. Subscales include symptoms, daily life, treatment concerns, and treatment satisfaction. Overall scores or subscale scores range from 0 to 100. A score of 0 corresponds to complete disability (or responding &quot;extremely&quot; limited, difficult or bothersome to all questions answered), while a score of 100 corresponds to no disability (or responding &quot;not at all&quot; limited, difficult or bothersome to all questions answered).</description>
