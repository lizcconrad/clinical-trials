  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Qatar, tobacco use is one of the main causes of premature deaths and preventable diseases.
      As per the 2013 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), 12.1% of adults and 20.2% of men in Qatar
      smoke tobacco, and 55.4% of this smoke an average of 16 cigarettes or more per day. Moreover,
      15.7% of school students aged 13 to 15 years currently use some form of tobacco according to
      the 2013 Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). In Qatar, tobacco-related diseases including
      cardiovascular diseases and cancers are highly prevalent. In an effort to reduce tobacco use,
      Qatar has ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and has implemented
      many tobacco control initiatives. In spite of these measures, tobacco use is still rising in
      Qatar. Pharmacists practicing in retail/community pharmacy are often the first port of call
      for individuals requiring health advice in general. Evidence has proven that they have a
      pivotal role in health promotion and disease prevention including tobacco cessation. Hence,
      pharmacists have excellent opportunities to reduce tobacco use in Qatar. Yet, ambulatory and
      community pharmacists in Qatar are not sufficiently contributing to tobacco control. Based on
      published data, only 21% of community pharmacists in Qatar always or most of the time ask
      patients about their smoking status. Furthermore, when asked about their smoking cessation
      training, 89% of pharmacists did not receive any kind of education or training about smoking
      cessation counseling in the past. In an effort to build the capacity of pharmacists in Qatar,
      the aim of the proposed study is to design, implement and evaluate an intensive education
      program on tobacco treatment for pharmacists in Qatar. The study will be a prospective
      randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of the education program on
      pharmacists' tobacco cessation-related knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and skills.

    <description>This outcome will be assessed using OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination).
Pharmacist's practical skills in the delivery of effective tobacco cessation will be assessed through the use of a performance-based assessment such as Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Examples of skills to be assessed include communication skills in general, counselling skills, law and professional ethics, and interviewing skills. We propose a 5 to 8 station OSCE that will target core competencies and skills covered in the program. In the OSCE, each participant will be allocated 10 mins to interact with a standardized patient who will be trained using a validated script. Performance of participants will be assessed using validated assessment checklists.</description>

    <time_frame>3-6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint of the study will be the performance difference in relation to skills in the practice setting between the intervention and the control groups assessed using the mystery shopper approach.
In this phase, the study will evaluate whether participants in intervention and control groups will offer appropriate tobacco cessation counseling and will recommend proper tobacco cessation aids in their practice setting. Using a mystery shopper approach to data collection 3 to 6 months post program, the study will assess the quality of advice and recommendations of participants given to mystery shoppers asking for help in quitting smoking. Mystery shoppers using designed and validated case scenarios will visit participants in both groups. The shoppers will be selected to resemble the sociodemographic and practice characteristics of Qatar population and residents. Objective assessment forms will be developed using tobacco cessation guideline</description>
