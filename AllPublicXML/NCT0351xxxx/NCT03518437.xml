      The investigator prospectively enroll 30,000 outpatients who were suspected of coronary
      artery disease (CAD) and underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT). Cardiac CT was assessed
      for coronary artery calcification score (CACS) and the extent, the location, the stenosis
      severity, and the composition of the plaque in CTA. The base line information was recorded,
      including risk factors, drugs, bio-markers, and psychological. The endpoint was MACE, defined
      as composite cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).we aim to evaluate the
      prognostic value of CTA, risk factors and bio-markers for major adverse cardiac events
      (MACE).

    <description>cardiac death, myocardial infarction (Cardiac death was defined as death due to acute myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, refractory heart failure or cardiogenic shock. The investigator reviewed all available data to determine whether a cardiac etiology was the immediate cause of death and categorized cardiac deaths into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden cardiac death. Sudden cardiac death was defined by published criteria . myocardial infarction was defined based on the criteria of typical chest pain, elevated cardiac enzyme levels and typical alterations of the electrocardiogram. )</description>
