  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by hypervigilance. In particular,
      previous works suggest that patients tend to scan constantly the environment for possible
      threats. The present project aims at investigating such attentional bias in patients with
      PTSD using the change blindness paradigm that offers the interesting possibility of studying
      sensitivity to sudden changes using ecological stimuli. More precisely, the investigators
      will investigate whether patients are more sensitive than matched controls to sudden changes
      in the visual environment and whether this hypersensitivity is specific or even stronger when
      visual information has an emotional content. The attentional bias will be measured using
      motor responses (accuracy and speed to indicate the occurrence of a change by pressing a
      button) as well as eye movements.

    <measure>Total duration until the participant first fixed on a ROI.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: one session</time_frame>
    <description>The implicit response will be measured by the localization and duration of fixations. All fixations outside the recording field will be excluded. The main variable will be the mean latency of the first fixation in a region of interest (ROI). This variable corresponds to the total duration until the participant first fixed on a ROI.</description>
