  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional, observational, prospective and global patient data
      registry. The study will collect effectiveness and safety data from approximately 1000
      patients with liver cancers treated with TheraSphere® in a real life setting from multiple
      centers globally. The absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissue will be calculated using the
      Simplicit90Y™ software in the subgroup of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

      This study is a non-interventional, observational, prospective and global patient data
      registry.

      Approximately 1000 patients with liver cancers who are treated with TheraSphere®will be
      enrolled.

      Data regarding patient and treatment characteristics (TheraSphere® and other anti-cancer
      treatments) will be collected within a 12 month period post TheraSphere® administration to:

        -  Assess treatment effectiveness and safety in a real life administration setting

        -  Identify prognostic and predictive factors for liver cancer patients receiving
           TheraSphere® treatment

      Data for dosimetry determination will be collected on approximately 300 HCC patients to
      assess :

        -  99mTc-MAA normal tissue and tumor Absorbed Dose using pre-procedural SPECT/CT

        -  Y90 normal tissue and tumor Absorbed Dose using post-procedural PET/CT(or equivalent for
           Asia) scans
