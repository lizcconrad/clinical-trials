      This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, pilot study administering hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy with Mitomycin-C in 10 men and women with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma
      of the bladder undergoing radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection who have risk
      factors for tumor recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder

          2. Patient's aged 45-85, both genders.

          3. ECOG performance status &lt; 1

          4. Hematology: ANC &gt; 1.5x109/L; Platelets &gt; 100x109/L

          5. Women with child bearing potential who are negative for pregnancy test (urine or
             blood) and who agree to use effective contraceptive method. Reliable contraception
             should be used from trial screening and must be continued throughout the study. A
             woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is biologically capable of
             becoming pregnant.

          6. Signed and dated written informed consent to participate in this clinical trial must
             be obtained prior to any study procedure.

             Either any of the following preoperative factors for increased risk of recurrence:

          7. Lymphovascular invasion

          8. Variant histology in the background of primary urothelial (notably plasmacytoid)

          9. Clinical T3 or greater

         10. Clinical N+

         11. No prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or lack of response to NAC

             Or any of the following perioperative factors for increased risk of recurrence:

         12. Palpable concern for extravesical disease

         13. Tumor spillage/bladder entry

         14. Suspicious nodes or positive intraoperative frozen sections

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have previously undergone intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

          2. Subjects with tumor histology other than urothelial cell carcinoma.

          3. Patients on concurrent anti-cancer therapy other than that allowed in the study.

          4. Other prior malignancies, except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer or curatively
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated malignancies for which
             there has been no evidence of activity for more than 3 years.

          5. Subjects with renal insufficiency defined as creatinine &gt; 1.5x the upper limit of
             normal or a calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 50 cc/min.

          6. Subjects with a condition which may interfere with the subjects' ability to understand
             the requirements of the study.

          7. Known HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C positive.

          8. Subjects with uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or severe infection requiring antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric illness or
             other condition which in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at an
             unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

          9. Any condition that would preclude the ability to deliver appropriate IP therapy.
