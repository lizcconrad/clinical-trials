  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare patients and nurses using insulin pen injector to inject premixed insulin
      respectively, using continuous glucose monitoring system to evaluate the glucose excursion in
      the two sets, study the relationship between glucose excursion and inject technique in type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients with type 2 diabetes who used premixed insulin will enrolled in this
      study.Measure their blood pressure，height and weight, BMI, liver and kidney function, blood
      lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, 2 hour postprandial glucose，fasting C
      peptide, 2 hour postprandial C peptide, fasting glucagon, 2 hour postprandial
      glucagon,fasting serum insulin，2 hour postprandial serum insulin，urinary albumin and insulin
      antibodies.The first and second days，the patients inject premixed insulin themselves，the
      specialist nurse graded the patient's injection technique score.The third and the fourth days
      the nurse change a new insulin with the same types maintain the same injection dosage.The
      patient need perform continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS) for 96-hours.
