  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will include a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of using
      Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating cannabinoid, as an adjunctive to Prolonged Exposure
      therapy (PE). The trial will compare PE + CBD to PE + placebo in a sample of 136 military
      Veterans with PTSD at the VA San Diego Medical Center. The study represents the logical and
      innovative next step for augmenting existing treatments and developing novel pharmacotherapy
      for PTSD. Findings from the proposed RCT will inform clinical practice and policy by
      investigating whether administration of CBD in the context of PE therapy will improve
      treatment outcomes for military Veterans with PTSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is among the most efficacious treatments for PTSD and is
      designated as a VA/DoD frontline treatment. However, PE does not always lead to clinically
      meaningful symptom reductions in Veterans with PTSD. Successful PE treatment relies on
      extinction learning, which is often impaired in patients with PTSD. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a
      non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid. Administration of specific phytocannabinoids, like CBD,
      increase extinction learning in patients with PTSD, and could increase the speed and
      effectiveness of PE therapy. CBD also modulates 5-HT1A, which may directly improve
      hyperarousal/insomnia symptoms, and improve engagement and retention in treatment. Given
      these findings, adjunctive administration of CBD+PE could improve response rates to PE and
      reduce the number of sessions of PE needed to reach clinically meaningful change. The
      proposed study is designed to test the efficacy of using CBD in conjunction with PE for the
      treatment of PTSD in US Military Veterans. A randomized, controlled, double-blind study will
      compare Veterans who receive PE+CBD to PE+placebo. Participants will include 136 male and
      female Veterans from all service eras with PTSD. The primary hypothesis is that PE+CBD will
      reduce PTSD symptoms to a greater degree than PE+placebo.

    <description>Rate of PTSD symptom reduction will be assessed by comparing the time-to-event of clinical response to treatment. The time-to-event is defined by number of PE sessions completed before patient achieves a 10-point reduction from baseline in total (summed) PTSD Checklist scores (PCL-5). PCL-5 Total Scores range from 0 to 80; Higher scores indicate worse functioning.</description>
