  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if RRx-001, which is added on to the cisplatin and
      radiation treatment, reduces the duration or length of severe oral mucositis in patients with
      head and neck cancers. All patients in this study will receive 7 weeks of standard of care
      radiation therapy given with the chemotherapy agent, cisplatin. Patients in arms 1, 2 and 3
      will also receive RRx-001 on different schedules.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for head and neck cancer currently includes a chemotherapy drug called
      cisplatin that is given by intravenous (IV) infusion and radiation, which is delivered from a
      machine that precisely targets the tumor. One common and unfortunate side effect of treatment
      with cisplatin and radiation is oral mucositis, which refers to irritation of the lining of
      the mouth. Oral mucositis is a serious problem 1) because the open mouth sores from oral
      mucositis may lead to severe pain, nutritional problems and dehydration from an inability to
      eat and drink, an increased risk of infection from bacteria and fungus and delay or
      discontinuation of treatment and 2) because there are no approved therapies to treat or
      prevent it.

    <measure>Duration of Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Duration in days of severe oral mucositis (SOM). Defined as oral mucositis grade 3 or 4 on the WHO Mucositis Grading Scale which comprises 5 grades: 0 = none, 1=oral soreness, erythema, 2=oral erythema, ulcers, solid diet tolerated, 3=oral ulcers, liquid diet only, and 5=oral alimentation impossible. Sever Oral Mucositis duration is obtained by totaling the number of days a given patient experiences oral mucositis grade 3 or 4 during the randomized treatment period. Higher Sever Oral Mucositis duration numbers are indicative of worst outcomes. The total Sever Oral Mucositis duration for a given patient will range between 0 days and the maximum number of days the patient participated in the randomized treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to onset of Sever Oral Mucositis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of Sever Oral Mucositis defined as time (in days) from randomization to the first observed Sever Oral Mucositis. Longer Sever Oral Mucositis onset times are indicative of a better outcome. The time to onset of Sever Oral Mucositis for a given patient will range between 0 days and the maximum number of days the patient participated in the randomized treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Sever Oral Mucositis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of Sever Oral Mucositis defined as the proportion of patients experiencing Sever Oral Mucositis during the randomized treatment period. Sever Oral Mucositis incidence range is 0 to 100%, and higher percentages are indicative of worse outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of ulcerative Oral Mucositis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Duration (in days) of ulcerative oral mucositis defined as the proportion of patients experiencing oral mucositis during the randomized treatment period. Defined as oral mucositis grade 0 or 1 on the WHO Mucositis Grading Scale (described above). Longer duration of ulcerative oral mucositis is indicative of a worse outcome. The total ulcerative oral mucositis duration for a given patient will range between 0 days and the maximum number of days the patient participated in the randomized treatment period.</description>

    <time_frame>up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of ulcerative oral mucositis defined as the proportion of patients experiencing ulcerative oral mucositis during the randomized treatment period. Ulcerative oral mucositis is defined as oral mucositis grade 0 or 1 on the WHO Mucositis Grading Scale (described above) and ranges from 0 to 100% with higher percentages being indicative of worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported pain</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported mouth and throat soreness score obtained from Question #2 from the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ) filled out by the patient. OMDQ Question #2 asked &quot;During the last 24 hours, how much mouth and throat soreness did you have?&quot;. OMDQ Question # 2 uses the following five-point categorical scale to quantity mouth and throat soreness: 0=no soreness, 1=a little soreness, 2=moderate soreness, 3=quite a lot of soreness and 4=extreme soreness. Higher mouth and throat soreness values are indicative of worse outcomes. The range of the month and throat values is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.</description>
