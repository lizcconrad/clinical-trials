  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center Clinical Trial.
      Patients with no tumor lesions 21 days after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment groups：6mg/d Tyroserleutide (injection), or
      placebo

      -  The first stage includes evaluation of subjects, to assess the inclusion criteria and
           exclusion criteria, based on the patients' preoperative imaging results, including tumor
           size, tumor characteristics, etc.

        -  In the second stage, subjects will return to the hospital 21 days following the baseline
           examination.The investigator will determine whether the subject satisfies all
           inclusion/exclusion criteria. If all requirements are satisfied, then randomization will
           occur 21 days after surgery

        -  The day of randomization will be defined as Day 0. Randomized subjects will return to
           the hospital and begin cycle 1 on the day of randomization (Day 0). and the relevant
           laboratory tests will be performed within 3 days after the end the study drug infusion.

        -  Cycles will occur as follows: cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and n will begin on days 42±3, 70±3,
           98±3, 126±3, and 14+28（n-1)± 3, respectively.

        -  Based therapeutic drugs are Gan Fu Le

        -  the participant will receive medical inspection so as to observe and ensure drug safety.
