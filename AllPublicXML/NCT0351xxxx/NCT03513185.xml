  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 70-80% of patients with somatic symptom disorder (SSD) visit the general medical
      hospital instead of psychiatric or other mental health settings. The current self-reporting
      questionnaires are neither sufficiently considering companioned anxiety or depression nor
      validated for monitor the treatment efficacy of such group. The Somatic Symptom Scale-China
      (SSS-Ch) is developed due to the urging clinical demanding in general hospital. The study
      aims to investigate whether the SSS-Ch could serve as a timely and practical instrument to
      detect SSD and assess the severity of the disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common medical conditions seen in general hospital is somatic symptoms
      disorder (SSD). As the disorder is characterized by the prominent attention to somatic
      concerns, patients mainly present initially in medical rather than mental health care
      settings. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
      (DSM-5) is currently the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the diagnosis of SSD, but it is clinically hard
      to follow. Thus, It is more clinically practical to detect a disorder by self-administered
      questionnaires, that patients can score symptoms according to their own condition and
      severity in a short time. However, the current self-reporting questionnaires, such as the
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and
      the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) are neither sufficiently considering companioned
      anxiety or depression nor validated for monitor the treatment efficacy of SSD patients.

      The Somatic Symptom Scale-China (SSS-Ch) is developed based on DSM-5 to assess SSD, and it is
      an abbreviated 20-item version of somatic symptoms that can be entirely self-administered by
      the patient, but its assessment value has not yet been widely tested. The study aims to
      investigate whether the SSS-Ch could serve as a timely and practical instrument to detect SSD
      and assess the severity of the disorder.

    <description>After recruiting participants and collecting the baseline data, the SSS-Ch, PHQ-15, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires will be carried out. An independent diagnosis will be made by primary care physician using the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criterion standard. Deanxit, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) will be selectively prescribed according to the severity category assessed by physician. Two, 6,10 weeks after patients with correspondent medications, a face-to-face interview, telephone interview or mobile-apps survey will be underwent to follow-up using the SSS-Ch, PHQ-15, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 checklists.</description>
