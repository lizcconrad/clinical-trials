  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether, compared to a standard, low-fat, calorie-restricted diet
      intervention, the clinic-supported Ideal Protein weight loss method will result in greater
      weight loss and improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors over 3 months among obese adults
      with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restricting total calorie intake is emphasized in the 2013 American Heart Association/
      American College of Cardiology/ The Obesity Society Guideline (AHA/ACC/TOS) for the
      Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults for its effectiveness at reducing body weight
      and decreasing cardiometabolic risk factors. An implication of this focus on total quantity
      of calories consumed is that macronutrient composition of dietary intake and its effects on
      the hormonal milieu that regulates adipose accumulation in the human body do not play a
      significant role in weight loss. Such recommendations and the results of limited previous
      studies have led to the advice that all weight loss diets regardless of macronutrient
      composition will produce the same degree of weight loss if adherence to the diet is similar.
      In contrast, our previous studies have shown that despite comparable adherence to dietary
      goals, participants losing weight on a moderately carbohydrate-restricted, adequate protein
      regimen have improved cardiometabolic indicators as compared to those restricting fat. The
      RENEWAL trial will provide unique data on the efficacy of the Ideal Protein method (moderate
      carbohydrate restriction and adequate protein) for weight loss and improvement in
      cardiometabolic risk factors. The interventions will include a significant proportion of
      African-Americans, a group with very high rates of obesity which is often under-represented
      in trials examining the effects of weight loss diets. Findings from this trial may offer new
      evidence for the recommendation of specific macronutrient and behavioral approaches to the
      reduction of cardiometabolic risk factors.

Although participants will be told of their treatment assignment they will not be provided details about the intervention techniques of the other treatment groups. Focus will instead be maintained on the group to which they are assigned.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All participants will be obese. Obesity will be defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 at the
             baseline study visit. An upper limit of BMI will be set at 49 kg/m2 to include a wide
             range of obese men and women with a reasonable probability of losing weight in the
             context of a dietary behavioral intervention.

          2. Participants must have at least one co-morbid condition that increases risk of
             cardiovascular disease (history of CVD, type II diabetes mellitus, fasting plasma
             glucose&gt;100 mg/dL, metabolic syndrome as defined by ATP III criteria, hypertension,
             hyperlipidemia, WC&gt;40 in among men or &gt;35 in among women).

          3. All potential participants must be willing and able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any bariatric surgery, including gastric banding, Roux-en-Y and duodenal
             switch with biliopancreatic diversion procedures, vertical banded gastroplasty, etc.

          2. Currently on a diet or using prescription weight loss medications, and/or experienced
             weight loss &gt;15 pounds within 6 months of study entry.

          3. Regular use of alcohol &gt;3 beverages per day or 21 beverages per week (1 standard
             beverage = 350 mL of 5% alcohol beer, or 150 mL of 12% wine, or 45 mL of 80-proof
             distilled spirits), amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, or marijuana over past 6 months.

          4. Past or present history of eating disorder (including anorexia, bulimia or binge
             eating disorder) or severe/untreated psychiatric illness which may affect
             participation in study interventions.

          5. Strict dietary concerns (e.g., vegetarian or kosher diet, significant nut or multiple
             food allergies). This is an exclusion because participant may not be able to fully
             participate in the intervention.

          6. For women, current pregnancy or breastfeeding or plans to become pregnant during the
             study period. This is an exclusion because weight loss is contraindicated during
             pregnancy.

          7. Plans to move out of the study area (&gt;1 hour from study site) or difficulty to come to
             the study site. This is an exclusion because these conditions may interfere with the
             ability to fully participate in and complete the study.

          8. Participation of another household member in the study; employees or persons living
             with employees of the study. This is an exclusion because randomization of more than
             one participant in a household to differing diets may cause conflict within a
             household and limit engagement in the intervention. Employees of the study are
             excluded due to potential conflicts of interest and knowledge of study assignments.

          9. Participation in other lifestyle intervention trials currently. This is an exclusion
             because interference with ability to determine whether study interventions are
             responsible for outcomes.

         10. Medical condition in which a carbohydrate restricted diet may not be advised (eg.
             severe renal impairment, osteoporosis, untreated thyroid disease, frequent gout
             attacks, Type I diabetes). This is an exclusion because participant may not be able to
             fully participate in the intervention.

         11. Hospitalization for a CVD event such as myocardial infarction, stroke, TIA, coronary
             revascularization, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, or unstable angina within
             the last 6 weeks or unstable coronary artery disease. Major new medical illness
             including renal disease requiring dialysis, a life-threatening illness with life
             expectancy less than six months, or cancer requiring chemotherapy or radiation
             treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE: potential participants may still qualify
             if they have had treatment for an early stage cancer in the past two years and the
             prognosis is excellent.] This is an exclusion because these conditions may interfere
             with the ability to fully participate in and complete the study.

         12. MMSE score &lt; 23 or dementia. This is an exclusion because it may interfere with the
             ability to fully participate in the study.

         13. Non-English speaking, a visual impairment or a hearing impairment that interferes with
             study participation. This is an exclusion criterion because these potential
             participants may not be able to participate fully in the intervention.

         14. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.
