  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab administered every 2 weeks (Q2W), on low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of treatment in children with homozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) 8 to 17 years of age on top of background treatments.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab after treatment on LDL-C levels.

        -  To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab.

      weeks, a screening period of up to 2 weeks, a treatment period of up to 48 weeks, and a
      follow-up of 8 weeks.

          -  Patients treated with optimal dose of statin +/- other lipid modifying therapies
             (LMTs), or non-statin LMTs if statin-intolerant at stable dose(s) for at least 4 weeks
             prior to screening lipid sample.

          -  A signed informed consent indicating parental permission with or without patient
             assent.

          -  For patients on apheresis, currently undergoing stable low-density lipoprotein (LDL)

             statin ± other stable LMTs, or stable non statin LMTs in statin-intolerant patients)
             treatment for at least 4 weeks.

          -  Patients with body weight less than 25 kg.

          -  Patients aged 8 to 9 years not at Tanner Stage1 and patients aged of 10 to 17 years
