      This research programme aims to translate expertise in warfarin anticoagulation from
      resource-rich to low and middle income countries (LMIC)settings with the goal of improving
      patient health outcomes.

      An observational study which will be used to develop warfarin dosing algorithms - the
      ultimate aim will be to ascertain whether these algorithms increase time in the therapeutic
      range, reduce bleeding and thrombotic risks, and clinic visits for International Normalised
      ratio (INR) monitoring. Two algorithms will be developed: the first will take into account
      clinical and geographical factors (&quot;clinical algorithm&quot;), while the second will also
      incorporate genetic factors in addition to the clinical and geographical factors (&quot;genetic
      algorithm&quot;). Patients will be recruited from sites in rural and urban Uganda, and in Cape
      Town, South Africa, to develop a clinical dosing algorithm. It is important to note that
      there is a wealth of literature data which will be used to define the clinical data that
      needs to be collected from these patients. To identify genetic factors in African patients,
      Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) will be undertaken and any novel factors incorporated
      into the genetic algorithm - the percentage variation in warfarin dosing explained by the
      genetic algorithm will be compared with the clinical algorithm.

      This project focuses on an area unmet clinical need, oral anticoagulation, in patients with a
      variety of cardiovascular diseases. The investigators' ambition is to translate their
      internationally renowned expertise in warfarin anticoagulation into low and middle income
      country (LMIC) settings where it can significantly improve health. By working with policy
      makers, the investigators will provide the required evidence to allow national roll out of
      new practices, including the introduction of 1mg warfarin tablets as a quick win to improve
      dosing accuracy.

      This National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Global Research Group is a collaboration
      between the University of Liverpool and two low and middle income countries (LMICs), Uganda
      and South Africa. It will focus on a clinically important non-communicable disease area which
      requires the use of anticoagulation.

      Anticoagulants, in particular warfarin, are used in these countries for the treatment of
      venous thromboembolism, valvular heart disease including rheumatic heart disease and
      prevention of strokes in patients with irregular heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation).
      Anticoagulation represents an unmet clinical need in Sub-Saharan Africa as patients either do
      not receive anticoagulation (because of difficulties in monitoring) or are poorly
      anticoagulated because of poor dosing guidelines. This results in potentially preventable
      morbidity and mortality which affects the poorer sectors of the population in particular. The
      investigators have extensive expertise in the United Kingdom and European Union of improving
      the use of warfarin through the development of novel dosing algorithms, which have now begun
      incorporating genetic factors.

      By contrast, in the investigators' two collaborating partner countries, no locally validated
      warfarin dosing algorithms exist, even those which only take into account clinical factors.
      This results in haphazard dosing with the attendant risks of thrombotic or bleeding
      complications. In both countries, monitoring requires frequent clinic visits, incurring
      transport costs and missed work days. Patients are often co-infected with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or Tuberculosis, requiring multiple concomitant medicines
      which complicate warfarin dosing and dose adjustment.

    <description>Recruitment of patients currently on warfarin will be undertaken to identify clinical and other non-genetic factors associated with poor anticoagulation control to enable development of a warfarin clinical dosing algorithm. Data on patients' age, weight, height, gender, co-morbidities, co-medications, socio-economic factors, warfarin dose history and quality of anticoagulant control (International Normalised ratio (INR) measurement history) will be obtained for the algorithm development.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of genes specific to the local African populations in Uganda and South Africa that can impact on anticoagulation control will be carried out, resulting in the development of a novel genetic dosing algorithm. In order to identify ethnic specific genetic factors, the investigators will undertake a Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) on these patients, and any novel genetic factors will be incorporated into an improved dosing algorithm which will be compared with the original algorithm in terms of its ability to predict therapeutic dose.</description>
