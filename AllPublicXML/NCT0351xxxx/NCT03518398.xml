  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is one of the most common causes of dry eye diseases. Over
      the past decade, several treatment options in MGD have been extensively studied including
      warm compression, lid hygiene, ocular lubricants, forceful expression, LipiFlow thermal
      pulsation system, intraductal probing, debridement scaling and intense pulsed light (IPL).
      IPL is a broad spectrum, non-coherent and polychromatic light source with a wavelength
      spectrum of 500-1200 nm. It can be filtered to allow only a range of wavelengths to be
      emitted. Different wavelength makes different depth of tissue to absorb a specific light
      energy. Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been widely used in dermatology as a therapeutic tool
      for removal of hypertrichosis, benign cavernous hemangioma, benign venous malformations,
      telangiectasia, port-wine stain and pigmented lesions. Concurrent ocular surface improvements
      have been observed in patients undergone IPL treatment. Very few prospective clinical trials
      showed that subjective dry eye symptoms decreased and some of the dry eye signs also
      improved. Nonetheless, there is still inconsistency in the efficacy of IPL among these
      studies. Biomarkers, specifically cytokines, in dry eye diseases have been studied to some
      extent. Moreover, the change in ocular surface inflammatory cytokines in patients with MGD
      after IPL treatment is unclear.

      The investigators proposed a prospective randomized double-masked sham-controlled clinical
      trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of intense pulse light in MGD patients.
