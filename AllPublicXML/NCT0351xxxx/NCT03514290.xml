      Objective: The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate low-level laser (LLL) therapy
      in tooth sensitivity and in effecting color change after in-officer bleaching treatment
      across three weeks of treatment.

      Methods: Twenty-one volunteers were evaluated through the split-mouth model, so that the
      right and left maxillary/mandibular quadrants were randomized and allocated to one of two
      groups: GPLACEBO - the laser tip was positioned without the emission of light (placebo
      effect) + tooth bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP); GLASER - treated with LLL + tooth
      bleaching with 35% HP. To assess tooth sensitivity, a modified visual analogue scale (VAS)
      was used after an evaporative stimulus (stimulated pain) and a daily pain questionnaire
      (unstimulated pain) was also applied. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the color.
      Three bleaching sessions were performed, with intervals of 7 days. Sensitivity results were
      tested using Friedman test for intra-group evaluation and Wilcoxon test for inter-group
      evaluation and ANOVA for color change.

    <description>Received Low-lever laser therapy using the infrared spectrum, with a wavelength of 808 nm in its active medium AsGaAl (arsenic-gallium-aluminum), at two points: on the central of cervical and medial regions of incisors, canines and premolars in the corresponding hemi-arch. At each point, 60 J/cm2 was applied during 16 seconds with an irradiance of 3.75 W/cm² using the therapeutic visible infrared device.</description>
