  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-Week, multicenter, double-blind, controlled, randomized study assessing change
      in psoriasis severity and level of stress in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis
      treated with TEN. Psoriasis severity and stress levels will be measured at Weeks 0, 4, 8 and
      12.

Scoring is interpreted as follows: 0-7 points is defined as no symptoms, 8-10 points are mild symptoms, 11-14 points signify moderate symptoms, and severe symptoms are defined as having greater than 15 points. Depression and anxiety states are diagnosed when HADS-D and HADS-A scores are greater than 8 points, respectively.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient, male or female of any race, 18 years of age or older.

          -  Moderate (&gt;3 to &lt;10% BSA) with a PASI of at least 6 and less than 12 or severe (≥10%
             BSA) plaque psoriasis with a minimal PASI score of 12.

          -  Subject diagnosed with psoriasis at least 6 months prior to entering the study.

          -  Subjects who have received treatment in the past for psoriasis and are currently
             untreated or subjects who are on stable treatment for psoriasis that is expected to
             remain unchanged throughout the entire duration.

          -  Subjects who have not received psoriasis treatments in the past should be stable in
             their disease for the last 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis subtypes.

          -  Evidence of skin conditions other than psoriasis that would interfere with
             study-related evaluations of psoriasis.

          -  Unstable psoriasis or unstable treatment of psoriasis over the entire duration of the
             study.

          -  Subjects with moderate psoriasis are not allowed to use concurrent systemic therapies
             for psoriasis (i.e., phototherapy, orals, biologics, etc.). Topical medications are
             allowed;

          -  Subjects with severe psoriasis are allowed to use any concurrent therapy for
             psoriasis, provided that disease state is stable for ≥2 months and they meet minimum
             PASI requirements.

          -  Cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, or other implanted metallic or electronic
             device.
