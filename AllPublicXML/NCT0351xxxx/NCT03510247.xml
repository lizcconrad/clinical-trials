  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rugby union is a high intensity, intermittent team sport which is played over 80 minutes.
      Players are divided into two main positional groups, forwards and backs, with backs covering
      a larger distance and completing more sprints and forwards partaking in more static
      exertions. With the game of rugby union getting progressively faster, body composition and
      power to weight ratio are key determinants. Due to the demands placed on these players it is
      essential that they are in optimal health continually, however, whilst the required physical
      attributes are well documented, this research will provide an insight into physiological and
      anthropometric changes that occur across two seasons.

      During this study subjects will be asked to attend the lab on 8 occasions over the course of
      two seasons (June 2018, September 2018, January 2019, April 2019, June 2019, September 2019,
      January 2020 and April 2020). During these visits the following tests will be completed; a
      peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) scan of the bone mineral composition of
      the tibia and radius, total body composition via Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA),
      anterior-posterior spine bone mineral density to assess fracture risk via DXA, vertebral
      fracture risk via DXA. ~24ml of whole blood will be taken to determine serum 25(OH)D,
      albumin, calcium, zinc, total red blood cell count, lymphocytes, monocytes, carboxy-terminal
      collagen crosslinks (CTX) and amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) concentrations. In June all
      players will complete a 6 minute run to determine fitness. Players will be expected to
      measure body weight and complete wellness questionnaires daily at the club and have skinfold
      measurements taken monthly. global positioning system (GPS) data will be collected during
      each training session and performance analysis will be utilised to determine the amount of
      contacts completed. Illness and injury occurrences will be recorded throughout the season.
