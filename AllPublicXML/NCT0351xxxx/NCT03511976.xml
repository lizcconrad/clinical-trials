  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The primary purpose of the proposed project is to investigate the efficacy of Tier 1
      and Tier 2 interventions delivered through a Response to Intervention (RTI) framework for
      children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Further, for children who do
      not respond to initial Tier 2 strategies, the proposed study will assess which additional
      course of intervention is most effective: (1) enhanced Tier 2 strategies or (2) stimulant
      medication. The majority of youth with ADHD are in general education settings, whether
      classified as special education students or not. Thus, experimentally evaluating the efficacy
      of well-developed and evidence-based behavioral interventions within a problem-solving
      framework such as RTI would significantly inform practice within school-based behavioral
      intervention teams.

      Project Activities: This study will employ a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial
      design (SMART). Prior to the beginning of the academic year, students will be randomly
      assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Business as Usual in which children receive whatever
      sequence of academic supports and interventions their teachers, school, and parents would
      typically put into place throughout the entire academic year and (2) an RTI approach to begin
      with Tier 1 classroom-wide management strategies with opportunities to add Tier 2 strategies
      for youth who do not respond to the initial Tier 1 approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Setting: The proposed investigation will be conducted in elementary schools throughout the
      Western New York and Southern Florida areas.

      Sample: Participants will be 300 children, grades 1 - 5, with ADHD who have not been
      classified as special education students (e.g., Specific learning Disability, Emotional
      Disturbed, Other Health Impaired), who are not currently prescribed psychoactive medication
      and are na√Øve to psychoactive medication. Half of the participants will be recruited in
      Florida and half will be recruited in New York. This sample is selected to represent
      school-age children with ADHD who are at elevated risk for referral for special education
      services.

      Intervention: The intervention under study will be a RTI approach for child behavior. The
      entire intervention includes Tier 1 classwide-behavioral management strategies used by the
      teacher, a Daily Report Card (DRC) that targets the child's behaviors needed to promote
      successful social and academic outcomes, and if needed, an enhanced RTI. Participants
      assigned to the enhanced RTI arm will receive a DRC enhanced with additional behavior
      management strategies (e.g., differential attention, delayed punishments to reduce
      escape-maintained behaviors, premack contingencies, etc.) targeting behaviors as indicated by
      a functional behavior analysis. Participants assigned to the stimulant medication condition
      will continue to receive the DRC established previously and will also receive stimulant
      medication during the school day.

      Research Design and Methods: One-third of children will be allocated to the BAU condition and
      two-thirds will be allocated to the RTI approach (Phase 1 Randomization). Children assigned
      to the RTI approach who do not respond to the Tier 1 strategies will receive a Tier 2
      intervention, namely a daily report card (DRC; Phase 2). Children who demonstrate
      non-response to the DRC will be randomly assigned to one of two additional treatment arms:
      (1) enhanced RTI (RTI-E) or (2) stimulant medication (Phase 3 Randomization). Children will
      be allocated evenly across these two conditions.

      Control Condition: The RTI framework will be compared with other alternative intervention
      approaches that represent the standard of care for ADHD treatment in schools (i.e.,
      medication, business as usual classroom intervention) to determine whether this specific
      model/framework of intervention is efficacious relative to an ecologically valid,
      counter-factual, comparison group.

      Key Measures: Measures of key outcomes will include risk of referral to special education as
      measured by functional academic outcomes, observations of behavior in the classroom by
      observers unaware of study hypothesis or treatment condition, and parent and teacher ratings
      of functioning. Secondary outcome measures will include potential mediators and moderators of
      treatment response including: discipline referrals, parent contacts due to problems in
      academic or behavioral functioning, teacher adherence to Tier 1 and Tier 2 strategies, and
      referrals for an IEP or 504 plan.

      Data Analytic Strategy: We will address our specific aims using primary data analysis
      strategies for SMART trials. Specifically, we will subject each of the outcome measures to
      the following primary analyses:

      Main effect of Phase 1 randomization. Regressions with group membership as a predictor will
      be used to determine the effect of randomizing participants to either (a) the RTI
      problem-solving framework approach or (b) business as usual.

      Main effect of Phase 3 randomization. Regressions with group membership as a predictor will
      be used to determine the effect of randomizing non-responders to both Tier 1 classroom
      management strategies and Tier 2A basic RTI to either (a) enhanced RTI or (b) medication
      management.

      Pairwise comparisons of the three embedded treatment protocols. This SMART design has three
      embedded treatment protocols, or sets of decision rules that together define an adaptive
      intervention. Those three protocols are as follows:

        1. Business as usual (BAU)

        2. Tier 1 strategies, followed by Tier II strategies in the event of non-response (i.e., a
           DRC), followed by enhanced RTI in the event of non-response.

        3. Tier 1 strategies, followed by Tier II strategies in the event of non-response, followed
           by medication management in the event of non-response

    <description>Independent observations will be conducted using the Student-Behavior Teacher-Response observation system (SBTR; Pelham, Greiner, &amp; Gnagy, 2008; Vujnovic, Fabiano et al., 2014). The SBTR is an observation code that collects information on: (1) the frequency of student rule violations; (2) whether a teacher observed the misbehavior; (3) if observed, whether the teacher enacted a consequence and whether it was an appropriate consequence. The SBTR system also records the number of praise statements and commands issued. The SBTR is a well-defined and validated observation system for use with children with ADHD in classroom settings. The SBTR system documents child functioning across a number of disruptive behavior categories (e.g., be respectful, obey adults, work quietly, stay on task), and it is consistent with an evidence-based assessment procedure for ADHD (Pelham, Fabiano, &amp; Massetti, 2005).</description>

    <description>One-third of participants will be assigned to this condition and will receive academic accommodations and interventions as deemed appropriate by their teachers, school personnel, and parents. This condition is intended to mirror current standard procedures for youth with ADHD. Thus, the specific accommodations and interventions are expected to vary across students. Some students' parents and physicians may choose to start stimulant medication with a goal of improving classroom performance.</description>

    <description>The primary classroom teacher for each participating student will receive consultation related to implementing Tier I management strategies at a classroom level for all students including the target child (see Appendix C). Consultation will be provided by trained study personnel (i.e., M.A.-level psychology or special education professionals) and the strategies will be implemented by the general education teacher (i.e., the end user of the intervention) Each teacher will receive two consultation visits at the beginning of the academic year. The purpose of the first visit will be to establish a plan for implementing Tier 1 strategies. During the second visit, the consultant will work with the teacher to assess progress with the Tier 1 strategies and adapt as needed (Fabiano et al., under review).</description>

    <description>Students in the RTI DRC condition will receive Tier II strategies, namely an individualized DRC. Behavioral consultants will meet with teachers to identify appropriate behavioral targets and establish a DRC according to established protocol (see our website for an example http://ccf.fiu.edu/for-families/resources-for-parents/printable- information/). Consultants will also meet with parents to develop a plan for reinforcing the DRC at home using a hierarchical menu of rewards/privileges that will be provided contingent on meeting daily goals.</description>

    <description>In this condition, students who did not show sufficient response to the Phase 1 DRC will receive additional and more intensive Tier II supports.
Following student assignment to RTI-E, the teacher will have meet with one of the consultants to complete a functional behavior analysis (FBA) to identify remaining target behaviors and ascertain their function. The consultant and teacher will then use the completed FBA to develop a treatment plan for an enhanced DRC (DRC-E).
Tier II enhancements will be chosen to directly map on to the functions of the target behaviors as outlined in the FBA.</description>
