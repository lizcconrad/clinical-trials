      The purpose of this study is to formally characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and
      tolerability of TS-1 in combination with cisplatin in adult patients with advanced solid
      tumors who have mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment relative to patients with normal
      hepatic function, as categorized by the United States National Cancer Institute organ
      dysfunction working group [NCI-ODWG] criteria for hepatic dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic impairment is a common co-morbidity in cancer patients, particularly in those with
      extensive liver metastases. Decreased drug clearance as a result of impaired liver function
      may lead to increased systemic exposure and possibly greater toxicity. As many
      chemotherapeutic agents are metabolized by the liver, treatment options tend to be limited in
      patients with severe hepatic impairment, even in the presence of good performance status and
      adequate other organ function. Cisplatin is an active chemotherapeutic agent with broad
      spectrum activity that can safely be administered in severe hepatic impairment. Cisplatin has
      been combined safely with full dose oral TS-1 with good efficacy in a spectrum of solid
      tumors in patients with adequate renal and hepatic function.

      The purpose of this study is to formally characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and
      tolerability of TS-1 in combination with cisplatin in adult patients with advanced solid
      tumors who have mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment relative to patients with normal
      hepatic function, as categorized by the United States National Cancer Institute organ
      dysfunction working group [NCI-ODWG] criteria for hepatic dysfunction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must fulfill ALL the following inclusion criteria

          -  Age 18 years.
