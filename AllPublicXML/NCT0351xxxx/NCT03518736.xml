  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants born very preterm (≤28 weeks of gestation) are at high risk of having developmental
      disabilities including cerebral palsy, coordination impairments, attention deficit and
      learning disabilities. Impairment including reduced postural control, movement variability,
      visual motor skills, and motor learning are common during the first months of life and are
      associated with later developmental disabilities. However, infant born very preterm rarely
      receive evidence based therapeutic intervention in the first months of life when basic
      science and animal intervention studies suggest the greatest efficacy. Barriers to enrollment
      in services delay the onset of services and delivery models rarely support targeted
      preventative intervention or enhanced parent engagement during in the transition from the
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to home.

      Targeted intervention supporting postural control and motor learning in the NICU have
      resulted in short term motor gains. Interventions that enhance parent's ability to read their
      infant's cues and provide engagement opportunities improve maternal mental health and infant
      social and cognitive outcomes in the short-term. The purpose of this randomized clinical
      trial is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention that combines evidence based motor
      intervention and parent engagement to enhance the parent's ability to provide daily motor and
      cognitive opportunities resulting in improved motor and cognitive outcomes.

      Supporting Play Exploration and Development Intervention (SPEEDI) uses guided participation
      to empower parents in reading infant's behavioral cues, identifying ideal times for
      interaction, and enriching the environment and learning opportunities. Parents participate in
      5 session in 3 weeks while learning principles of engagement, readiness for interaction, and
      to provide early motor and cognitive learning opportunities. Parents provide 20 minutes of
      motor and cognitive play based enrichment daily for 12 weeks with bi-weekly physical
      therapist support. The parent is empowered to determine the infant's current abilities and
      advance the activities to the &quot;Just Right Challenge&quot; throughout the 12 weeks, likely
      continuing after the intervention.

      The efficacy of SPEEDI will be assessed during delivery at 2 time point; the transition from
      the NICU to home (around the infant's due date) and at 3-4 months of adjusted age (after the
      infants due date). Ninety infants will be randomly assigned to a Usual Care group,
      SPEEDI_Early, or SPEEDI_Later group. Group differences will be assessed in developmental
      outcomes on the motor and cognitive scales of the Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler
      Development as well as the Early Problem Solving Indicator and Gross Motor Function Measure
      at the end of each intervention period, 12 and 24 months of age.
