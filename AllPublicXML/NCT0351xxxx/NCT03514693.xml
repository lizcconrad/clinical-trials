    <textblock>
      This study examines non-inferiority of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for persistent atrial
      fibrillation (AF) to extensive ablation; and reveals the effect of the presence or origin of
      AF trigger on outcomes of catheter ablation.

      Study design The EARNEST-PVI trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label
      non-inferiority trial in which patients with persistent AF will undergo ablation. After
      providing written informed consent at each hospital, patients who are eligible for the trial
      will be randomized to either PVI alone or PVI plus additional ablation. Left atrial
      dimensions will be the only adjustment factor considered in dynamic allocation to avoid bias.
      Patients randomized to the PVI alone group will be treated with PVI, while patients
      randomized to the PVI plus additional ablation group will receive additional complex
      fractionated atrial electrogram or linear ablation after PVI. Ablation for AF triggers from
      non-PV foci, the cavotricuspid isthmus, clinical coexisting tachyarrhythmia such as atrial
      flutter (AFL), atrial tachycardia (AT), and supraventricular tachycardia will be allowed in
      both groups. Patients will be followed up 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the procedure. The
      primary endpoint of the study is the recurrence of AF documented by scheduled or
      symptom-driven ECG during 1 year after the procedure. &quot;Recurrence of AF&quot; is defined as the
      documentation of any atrial arrhythmia including AF, AFL, and/or AT lasting ≥ 30 seconds by
      ECG or other appropriate tests. The sample size and randomization are specified based on the
      concept of non-inferiority to achieve the primary objective. The recurrence rate of AF was
      assumed to be 40% in both groups and a non-inferiority margin of 10% was calculated by
      referring to the previous studies. Therefore, a sample size of 256 subjects in each group is
      required with a power of 80% and significance level of 5% considering some dropouts. The
      statistical evaluation will be carried out according to the intention-to-treat principle.
