  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently there has been concern about the effect of inhaled steroids, routinely used in the
      treatment of asthma, on the body's ability to produce its natural stress hormone cortisol.
      Failure of adequate cortisol production in times of stress e.g. illness, can result in
      serious illness or death. Patients receiving longterm steroid treatment may have reduced
      levels of cortisol and not be able to produce adequate amounts in times of need, a process
      called adrenal suppression. Initially it was thought that the absorption of inhaled steroids
      into the bloodstream would be too low to cause adrenal suppression however high profile
      deaths followed by a national survey revealed a number of fatal or near fatal cases of
      adrenal suppression. The vast majority of these were in children. Since then doctors have
      been encouraged to ensure that children on high doses of inhaled steroids carry a steroid
      alert card and that the ability of their adrenal glands to produce adequate amounts of
      cortisol is checked. However it is unknown what dose of inhaled steroids puts one at risk,
      whether age or gender affects one's risk and when to check the function of the adrenal gland.

      The Short Synacthen Test (SST) investigates the ability of the body's adrenal glands to
      produce cortisol. Presently the SST requires intravenous (i.v) cannulation through which
      Synacthen is injected to stimulate the adrenal glands and multiple blood samples are
      collected to assess the response in terms of cortisol production. It is invasive, time
      consuming and unpleasant for the child. Our project aims to produce a noninvasive alternative
      to the current SST, with Synacthen given nasally and using saliva to measure the subsequent
      production of cortisol. A noninvasive test will allow us to establish the first normal ranges
      for children and determine which children with asthma are at risk of adrenal suppression.

      The success of the nasal administration of a novel formulation of Synacthen to adults was the
      first step in a work-stream, which aims to develop the clinical applicability of the
      non-invasive SST in addition to using it as an important research tool. The invasive nature
      of the current diagnostic test makes large cohort research impracticable. Having gained proof
      of concept with the initial study we will now go on to gained detailed pharmacokinetic
      information in adults with the IV comparator of the 250 mcg test in addition to the data
      already gained for the 1 mcg test. We will test two doses of nasal Synacthen. We will do
      intra-individual variation work also.

      The next stage will then to be to perform pharmacokinetic validation of the nasal Synacthen
      plus chitosan dose in twenty children in order to establish that the chosen dose, peak
      cortisol response, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are similar in the paediatric
      population. This will require 40 visits to our Childrens' Clinical Research Facility.

      In order to obtain the quality of pharmacokinetic data required for commercial regulatory
      approvals an improved Synacthen assay is required. This work is ongoing in collaboration with
      ACTH assay experts at the University of Manchester.
