  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determinate de efectiveness of eccentric exercise combined
      with vibration or cryotherapy in achilles tendinopathy and its effects on the anterior rectus
      abdominis muscle.

      The investigators hypothesis is the combined eccentric exercise with vibration get better
      results than cryotherapy with eccentric exercise in rectus abdominis muscle parameters.
