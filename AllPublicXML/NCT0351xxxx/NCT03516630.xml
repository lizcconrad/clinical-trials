  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study has been designed to evaluate the effect of three doses of trazodone (20,
      60 and 140 mg), in comparison to placebo, on the QT/QTc interval of healthy volunteers.
      Trazodone oral drops 6% formulation has been selected in order to evaluate the three doses
      using the same formulation, because the lowest available strength for the tablet formulations
      is 50 mg. According to the E14 guideline on the evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation
      and proarrhythmic potential of antiarrhytmic drugs, a negative control (placebo) and a
      positive control (moxifloxacin) will also be assessed.

      Twenty (20) healthy volunteers (about 50% males and 50% females) will be randomised.

      Primary end-point:

        -  Evaluation of the relationship between the plasma concentration of trazodone (free base)
           and the change from baseline in QTc, placebo-adjusted and corrected for HR based on the
           Fridericia correction method (QTcF) method (∆∆QTcF).

        -  Trazodone can be declared to have no influence on QTc if the null hypothesis, that the
           upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI of the predicted mean placebo corrected change from
           baseline for QTcF is greater than 10 msec at the observed mean Cmax for the therapeutic
           dose of trazodone, can be rejected.
