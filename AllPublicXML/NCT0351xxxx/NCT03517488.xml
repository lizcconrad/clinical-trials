    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multiple dose, ascending dose escalation study to define a MTD/RD and
      regimen of XmAb20717, to describe safety and tolerability, to assess PK and immunogenicity,
      and to preliminarily assess anti-tumor activity of XmAb20717 in subjects with selected
      advanced solid tumors.

               -  Breast carcinoma that is estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2
                  negative (triple-negative breast cancer; TNBC);

               -  Hepatocellular carcinoma;

               -  Urothelial carcinoma;

               -  Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck;

               -  Microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient colorectal carcinoma
                  or endometrial carcinoma;

               -  Non-small cell lung carcinoma;

               -  Gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma

          -  All subjects' cancer must have progressed after treatment with standard therapies or
             have no appropriate available therapies.

          -  Have available archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block(s) containing tumor or
             at least 20 unstained slides containing tumor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any CTLA4 antibody within 6 weeks of the start of study drug.

          -  Treatment with nivolumab or any PDL1 or PDL2-directed antibody within 4 weeks of the

             dependent).

          -  Subjects currently receiving other anticancer therapies.

          -  Treatment with any other anticancer therapy within 2 weeks of the start of study drug
             (i.e., other immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, etc.).
