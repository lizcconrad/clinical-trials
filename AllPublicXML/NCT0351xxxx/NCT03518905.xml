  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heterotopic gastric mucosa found in the cervical esophagus was first described in 1805
      and affects 10-15% of individuals undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy. It leads to
      laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), which causes symptoms like globus sensation, hoarseness and
      chronic cough. The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) that ranges from 0-45 measures LPR. Scores
      greater than 13 are considered to be pathologic. Currently, patients that suffer from
      symptoms of LPR and present with a heterotopic gastric mucosa are routinely offered
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as curative treatment. Up to now, around 40 patients were
      already treated at the department of Surgery with 90% histologic eradication rates after 2
      treatment sessions and no reported serious adverse event. Nevertheless, the placebo effect
      could also be responsible for perception of improving symptoms. Therefore, this prospective
      sham-controlled trial was designed to exclude the placebo effect. As the device is already
      approved and routinely used for focal ablation safety data are already available. Up to now,
      there were no major adverse events, whereas only 10% of patients describe a sensation of
      irritated throat that dissolves within the first three days after treatment.

    <measure>Reflux Finding Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at the first intervention at study completion after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the Reflux Finding Score is measured by using laryngofibroscopy to document potential absence of laryngopharyngeal reflux. The reflux finding score (RFS) represents an objective and validated instrument to analyze physical findings and severity of laryngopharyngeal reflux. An 8-item checklist with excellent inter-observer reliability grades abnormalities documented during laryngoscopy from 0-26 points. The total score is reported and summed from an 8 item checklist providing 0-4 points. Statistically, total scores greater than 7 have a likelihood of 95% to reflect LPR. Higher scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>Radiofrequency ablation is performed using the Barrx Channel endoscopic catheter (Medtronic, Dublin, Republic of Ireland) generating an energy density level of 12 Joule/cm2. The energy is applied using a simplified protocol of three ablations without removal of coagulated tissue. The device is used on a routinely basis all around the world and already approved. The ablation catheter is applied through the working channel of the endoscope.</description>
