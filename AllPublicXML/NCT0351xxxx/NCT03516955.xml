  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety and efficacy of generic Rosuvastatin in reducing plasma low
      density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in Lebanese adult patients (18 years or older) with
      dyslipidemia for both primary and secondary prevention based on their total cardiovascular
      risk. No visits or interventions, additional to the routine clinical practice, were requested
      or performed.

    <textblock>
      An observational, multicenter, prospective study of Lebanese adult (18 years or older)
      hypercholesterolemic patients administered generic Rosuvastatin (Superstat®).

      Eligible newly diagnosed hypercholesterolemic patients took generic Rosuvastatin as
      prescribed by their treating physician. Assigning patients to generic Rosuvastatin was
      decided within the current practice and medical indication and was independent from the
      recruitment into the study.

      Patients were followed‐up at the clinic as per the standard practice of care. Each patient
      was followed-up for a period of 2 months.
