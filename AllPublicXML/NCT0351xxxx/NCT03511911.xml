      1. To explore the correlations among measures of PFM strength between using vaginal
           palpation quantified by modified Oxford Grading Scale and Levator ani testing and
           manometry in PHENIX instrument;

        2. To determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability of PFM strength measured using
           manometry in PHENIX instrument.

    <textblock>
      This is a study using a randomized crossover blind method.All the volunteers are divided into
      2 groups randomly. At the first time, a gynecological physician evaluates patient's pelvic
      floor muscle strength by vaginal palpation based on modified Oxford Grading Scale(MOS) and
      Levator ani testing(LAT) without telling patient her result, and record it on a unique paper
      other than in the Case Report Form.

      At the same day, patient will be tested by inspector A or B randomly twice with the PHENIX
      instrument.A 5 minutes' interval is needed between two tests in order to reduce the
      possibility of fatigue of pelvic floor muscles. The outcome is secretive to the patient as
      well.

      A second time evaluation is required in 3 days' later by a different inspector from the first
      time.(interrater and intrarater) All the data including strength of MOS and LAT, the outcomes
      by inspector A and B, cannot be collected together and told to the patient until she finished
      the whole process.

      Pelvic floor muscle training is not permitted during the evaluations.
