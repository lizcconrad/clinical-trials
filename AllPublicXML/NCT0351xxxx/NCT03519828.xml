  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke can affect not only the social adaptation ability,
      but also affect the comprehensive rehabilitation of patients. The damage of cognitive
      impairment after ischemic stroke is not lower than the body function defect after stroke.
      Many studies have shown that oxidative stress is one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of
      ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Many studies have reported that the oxidative-reduction of
      cells plays an important role in the life activities of organisms, affecting the health,
      aging and death of the organism. In the recent years, some scholars have suggested that
      post-stroke cognitive impairment may be related to oxidative-reduction homeostasis of the
      body, but the relevant evidence is lacking and needs to be further explored. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to explore the effect of oxidation-reduction homeostasis on
      cognitive impairment in patients with ischemic stroke, and provide a theoretical basis for
      the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke.
