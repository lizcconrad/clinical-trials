  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate SYNB1618 (investigational product) in healthy volunteers (HV) and
      subjects diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU) for the possible treatment of PKU.
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder that occurs in people who are
      missing an enzyme that the body needs to use phenylalanine. Eligible subjects will receive
      investigational product (IP) in the clinic, and will undergo safety monitoring, evaluations
      and subsequent follow-up after IP administration.

      This Phase 1/2a, first-in-human, oral single and multiple dose-escalation, randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of SYNB1618 in healthy adult volunteers and adult
      subjects with phenylketonuria will evaluate safety, tolerability, kinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics within the following 2 study parts:

      Part 1 comprises a single-ascending dose (SAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting (3
      treated:1 placebo) over 4 days in HV male and female subjects evaluated in up to 6 dose
      cohorts to identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD) within the single dose-dose range studied.
      Up to 24 healthy subjects may be enrolled in this part of the study. Following attainment of
      the MTD in HV, a SAD cohort of up to 4 subjects (male and female, &gt;18 years old) previously
      diagnosed with PKU will be enrolled (3 treated:1 placebo).

      Part 2 comprises a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting (6
      treated:2 placebo) over 10 days in HV male and female subjects evaluated in up to 4 cohorts
      at doses that will not exceed the MTD from the SAD part of the study to identify the MTD of
      SYNB1618 within the multiple-dose range studied. Up to 32 healthy subjects may be enrolled in
      this part of the study. Once the highest MAD cohort and the SAD PKU cohort have been
      completed, a multiple-dose cohort of male and female subjects (&gt;18 years old) previously
      diagnosed with PKU will be evaluated. Up to 20 subjects with PKU may be enrolled in the MAD
      PKU cohort (12 treated: 8 placebo).
