  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MK-1697.
      There are 2 parts in this study: dose escalation to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) and confirm the RP2D (Part A) and cohort expansion to determine preliminary efficacy
      in participants with adenocarcinoma of the stomach and/or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) or
      head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) (Part B).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During Cycle 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The following toxicities will be considered a DLT, if assessed as related to study treatment: Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity; Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding; ≥Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with the exception of fatigue lasting ≤3 days, Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea or vomiting without use of anti-emetics or anti-diarrheals per standard of care, Grade 3 rash without use of corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory agents per standard of care; Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic laboratory value if: medical intervention is required, the abnormality leads to hospitalization, persists for &gt;1 week, or the abnormality results in drug-induced liver injury; Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia; treatment-related toxicity that causes discontinuation; inability to administer ≥75% of the planned dose due to drug-related tolerability; Grade 5 toxicity; delay in Cycle 2 start by &gt;2 weeks due to toxicity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 27 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented.</description>
