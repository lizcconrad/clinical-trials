  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a regimen of three widely available, generic and minimally
      toxic antineoplastic agents (CMF) will result in improved patient adherence and relatively
      low toxicity for hormone receptor-positive Ugandan women with locally advanced breast cancer.

      Notably, capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate are each on the World Health
      Organization (WHO) model list of essential antineoplastic medicines. Given the documented
      efficacy, side effect profile, patient preference, and logistic ease, the investigators
      expect that the oral regimen of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
      capecitabine to be as effective as an IV regimen (with 5-FU) with increased adherence and
      thus improved outcomes. Here the investigators propose to assess the feasibility of an
      effective oral therapeutic regimen based on hormone receptor status.
