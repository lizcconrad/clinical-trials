  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and characterise an imaging strategy for
      biology-guided individualisation of the proton therapy plan to improve patient outcome and
      quality-of-life.

      Positron-emission tomography (PET) studies reflecting glucose metabolism, hypoxia and
      physical changes of proton-irradiated tumour tissues will be performed. Patients with head
      and neck cancer will be studied, as these individuals frequently experience recurrences
      within the radiation field, often with limited therapeutic options. Severe side-effects and
      functional impairment, deteriorating patients' quality-of-life, limited the use of
      dose-escalation in recent feasibility studies of photon therapy guided by individual
      PET-response. However, proton therapy, currently being introduced in the Netherlands,
      improves the precision of radiotherapy and thereby limits the side-effects caused by
      irradiation of neighbouring healthy tissues. Therefore, in proton therapy dose-escalation to
      improve patient outcome is less restricted by toxicity.

      Using PET-studies of two hallmarks of radioresistance, glucose metabolism and hypoxia,
      side-by-side, before and early in-treatment, the predictive ability of both PET-techniques
      for local recurrence-free survival will be compared. A treatment plan adapted to the
      individual response measured by both procedures and compute tumour-dose and toxicity, will be
      simulated, thereby substantiating feasibility of image-guided adaptive replanning.
      Simultaneously to biological responses, proton therapy-induced physical changes will be
      studied. These atomic changes, dependent on tissue-composition and dose-deposition, are
      measurable by PET. It is expected that activation-PET to measure tissue-changes during
      therapy, a potential new biomarker of treatment efficacy, toxicity but also accuracy of
      treatment plan execution. Activation-PET will be related to earlier-mentioned PET-imaging of
      metabolism.

      This clinical-technological project paves the way for an interventional trial of PET-guided
      treatment personalisation. Activation-PET will also serve as biomarker and quality control
      for proton therapy and support the current development of specialised in-beam PET-technology.
      These PET-techniques together will help us to individualise treatment, which is of great
      importance for the success and cost-effectiveness of proton therapy.

      Rationale: Proton therapy (PT), currently being introduced in the Netherlands, delivers
      radiation dose more conformal than photon radiotherapy, therefore healthy tissue damage is
      expected to be lower and at least similar tumouricidal effects are described. This increases
      the therapeutic window of radiotherapy which could be used for intensified treatment to
      patients prone to locoregional failure. From photon radiotherapy it is known that
      stratification of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is possible
      using different positron-emission tomography (PET-)techniques. Distribution of tumour
      hypoxia, a main cause of resistance to radiotherapy, and glucose metabolic need have been
      described. PT, in contrast to photon therapy, results in activation of endogenous atoms in
      the irradiated tissues which can be measured using PET and reflect dose deposition and tissue
      composition. This provides a unique application of PET in this treatment modality as quality
      assurance of proton therapy and potentially as biomarker of tissue response to proton
      therapy. The main hypothesis is that early during PT, PET is capable of discerning a subset
      of patients with increased risk of locoregional failure with a univariate hazard-ratio of at
      least 4.0. At this time point, treatment intensification would still be possible.

      Objective: To assess whether early changes in hypoxia between baseline and in the (end of
      the) second week of proton therapy are predictive for time-to-local recurrence in patients
      with HNSCC (primary). Secondary objectives include: to compare the role of hypoxia-PET to
      more readily available PET of glucose metabolism, to describe spatial conformity between the
      PET-scan and the location of the recurrence, to determine the potential of adaptive
      replanning based on two-timepoint PET-imaging. In a pilot setting the feasibility of
      activation PET in a clinical setting for quality assurance of PT-plans and potential
      biomarker of PT-induced tissue changes will be explored.

      Study design: Prospective, single-arm, observational cohort study with invasive measurements.

      Study population: Adults diagnosed with primary, unresected invasive HNSCC, planned for PT Â±
      systemic therapy with curative intent with at least one measurable lesion larger than 2 cm at
      baseline (n=40).

      Intervention: All patients are asked to undergo one additional baseline 18F-FAZA PET-scan
      (hypoxia) at baseline 18F-FDG PET-imaging (glucose metabolism) is already performed during
      clinical work-up. Both 18F-FAZA and 18F-FDG PET-scans will be repeated in the (end of the)
      second week of PT, unless no hypoxia is witnessed at baseline, then only the 18F-FDG PET-scan
      is repeated. In a pilot setting, 10 patients are asked to further undergo activation
      PET-scanning immediately after PT in the first, second and last week.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are the percent change in hypoxic
      tumour volume between baseline PET and interim PET of hypoxia and the percent change in total
      lesion glycolysis between baseline PET and interim PET of glucose metabolism. The primary
      endpoint is 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Each PET-acquisition will be performed in radiotherapy position using fixation
      devices (mould mask). The procedures of PET-imaging of 18F-FAZA (hypoxia) and 18F-FDG
      (glucose metabolism) each involve preparation (hypoxia: none, glucose metabolism: 6h fasted),
      intravenous injection of a radiopharmaceutical, a waiting period in solitude (hypoxia: 2 h,
      glucose metabolism: 1 h), followed by PET-acquisition (hypoxia: 10-20 min, glucose
      metabolism: 5-10 min). Occurrence of infusion-related reactions (e.g. allergy) is highly
      unlikely. The radiation burden attached to each of these procedures are 6.8 mSv (hypoxia) and
      2.9 mSv (glucose metabolism). The pilot substudy requires immediate transfer from PT-gantry
      to scanner followed by a 30-min PET-acquisition three times, resulting in an additional
      radiation burden of ~0.5 mSv per procedure. All other procedures are part of clinical
      protocol. There will be no individual benefit for enrolled subjects. Financial compensation
      for study-related travel expenses have been arranged. However, where possible, each study
      procedure will be combined with a regular visit to the PT-facility.

    <description>This is defined as the length of time (days) that the patient survives since study registration without any signs or symptoms of locoregional HNSCC assessed by structured clinical and radiological (clinical) follow-up (paragraph 8.5). If at close-out date of the study, there are no signs of locoregional recurrence, the patient will be censored to the date of the most recent follow-up examination. Distant recurrence/progression and second cancers diagnosed before locoregional recurrence and death in absence of locoregional recurrence are not considered events of interest, but will be considered as competing risk events in the analysis of this endpoint. The 2-year cumulative incidence rates will be estimated from the curves and its associated 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>

        In the Netherlands, 85% of patients that will be treated by PT , which includes
        HNSCC-patients, will be selected using a model-based approach (MBA). For every potential
        PT-patient an in silico comparison between a PT-plan and XRT-plan will be made to determine
        the amount of dose to relevant organs at risk (OARs). Using models of normal tissue
        complication probability (NTCP), which describe the relationship between dose and the risk
        of complications, the difference in NTCP ( NTCP) between PT and XRT is estimated. Cases
        that surpass a predefined threshold and thus are expected to significantly suffer from less
        toxicity from PT than XRT, will be accepted for PT and form the base population of this
        study.
