      The objective of the study is a multi-center prospective registry to collect clinical
      outcomes of anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-randomized multi-center prospective registry and subjects will be treated
      according to standard of care at each center. Subjects will be approached for participation
      in this study after they have made the decision to undergo a primary or revision shoulder
      arthroplasty procedure. The treating surgeon will obtain verbal consent from the patient for
      a research coordinator to screen for eligibility. Patients who meet all criteria will be
      offered enrollment into the study. The total enrollment goal is a minimum of 500 anatomic
      shoulder arthroplasty and 500 reverse shoulder arthroplasty subjects enrolled in the
      multi-center registry.
