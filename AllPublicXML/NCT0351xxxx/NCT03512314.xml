  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study for patients previously enrolled in the AB2 Bio Ltd.
      ongoing Phase III clinical trial NLRC4/XIAP.2016.001 (IND N° 127953). This OLE study will
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Tadekinig alfa in patients suffering from
      pediatric monogenic autoinflammatory diseases harboring deleterious mutations of NLRC4 and
      XIAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric auto-inflammatory conditions related to spontaneous activating mutations of the
      NLRC4 and with recurrent MAS-like flares with constitutive IL-18 hypersecretion, may require
      long-term blockade of the IL-18 pathway.

      Patients with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency and suffering from
      Hemophagocytic-Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a MAS-like syndrome, also show high levels of serum
      IL-18 and may benefit from IL-18 blockade treatment until a curative hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation can be performed The safety of IL-18 blockade during long-term periods is of
      major interest for the treatment of these patients

        Inclusion Criteria: (both criteria must be met)

          1. Patients have participated in AB2 Bio ltd. Phase III clinical trial
             NLRC4/XIAP.2016.001 (IND N° 127953) by one of the following mechanisms : a) Patients
             that have completed the first 18-week RCT phase of the preceding clinical trial but
             were not eligible for the RW phase due to flare symptoms. Or b) Patients that
             completed the first 18-week RCT phase and completed the RW phase of the preceding
             clinical trial. Or c) Patients who have exited either the RCT or RW phase of the
             preceding clinical trial due to treatment failure requiring rescue immunosuppression.
             Such patients must wait a minimum of 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation from the
             preceding clinical trial before enrolling in this OLE. If patients do not consent to
             enroll in the OLE after their early termination in the main study, they will be asked
             to continue with the planned visits of the main study

          2. Women of childbearing potential with negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at all visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients may not enter the OLE if they voluntarily withdrew from RCT or RW study or if
             the time period between participation exceeds 3 months

          2. Evidence or history of malignancy

          3. Evidence of invasive or life-threatening infection

          4. History of tuberculosis

          5. Life-threatening bleeding within 2 weeks of screening

          6. Vaccination with a live vaccine within the previous 3 months

          7. Evidence of severe organ compromise including but not limited to: (see details in the
             protocol)

          8. Pregnant or breastfeeding females

          9. Inability to follow highly effective birth control recommendations during the study
             and until 1 month after the end of the treatment.

         10. Inability to provide informed consent, and also assent if applicable

         11. Life expectancy less than 4 weeks

         12. Concomitant use of other immunosuppression except NSAIDs, glucocorticoids,
             cyclosporine, tacrolimus, IL-1 inhibitors (Anakinra, Canakinumab, or Rilonacept)
