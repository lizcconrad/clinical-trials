      As the world goes into the aging society, the number of total hip and total knee arthroplasty
      (THA and TKA) will increase fast. It's important to develop strategies to improve the quality
      of healthcare and get earlier recovery and better outcome for patients undergoing THA and
      TKA. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways have been reported to promote faster
      recovery. A volatile anesthetic desflurane has characteristics of rapid metabolism with minor
      dependence on liver and kidney function, so we hypothesized that desflurane-based ERAS
      (D-ERAS) pathway could provide better recovery for patients undergoing primary THA or TKA.

      This trial is a prospective, open-labelled, randomized controlled trial that will test, for
      length of stay (LOS) in hospital, the superiority of D-ERAS pathway as compared with current
      clinical practice. A total of 604 patients undergoing primary THA or TKA will be randomized
      to allocate either D-ERAS pathway (D-ERAS group) or conventional care according to different
      participating center (non-ERAS group). The primary outcome is LOS in hospital. Secondary
      outcomes include Postoperative LOS, all-cause mortality by 30 days after operation,
      in-hospital complications, mobilization, postoperative pain evaluation, total in-hospital
      cost, and readmission rate by 30 days after discharge from the hospital.

    <textblock>
      Total joint arthroplasty is a definitive treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis of the hip
      and knee, which is increased as the world goes into the aging society. It was reported that
      0.33 million total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 0.7 million total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were
      performed in the United States annually, and the demand for the procedures were estimated to
      0.57 million and 3.48 million per year in 2030, respectively. It's important to find
      strategies to improve the quality of healthcare and get earlier recovery and better outcome
      for patients undergoing THA and TKA, so as to slow the growth of the heavy economic burden
      associated with the increase of the procedures.

      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is proposed as a series of evidence-based
      perioperative optimization with multidisciplinary treatment to reduce surgical stress and
      accelerate postoperative recovery. Under this general guidelines, different ERAS pathways
      have been reported to decrease morbidity, save costs, promote faster recovery, and achieve
      the clinical and economic gain in colorectal, thoracic, and orthopedic surgery. Regional
      anesthesia was recommended for ERAS because it provides reliable analgesia and little
      disturbance on hemodynamics in previous literatures. But for patients undergoing THA and TKA,
      epidural or spinal anesthesia is always associated with indwelling urinary catheter even in
      surgery with short duration and small amount of blood loss, and femoral or sciatic nerve
      block decreases muscle strength, leading to postponed mobilization. Desflurane, a volatile
      anesthetic with a low blood/gas distribution coefficient, has been reported to metabolized
      quickly with minor dependence on liver and kidney function, and provide rapid awakening from
      anesthetic state. Based on its characteristics, we hypothesized that ERAS could be achieved
      by general anesthesia with the use of desflurane when combined with short-acting opioids and
      muscle relaxant.

      In this trial, we'll develop a desflurane based ERAS (D-ERAS) pathway in patients undergoing
      primary THA and TKA, and compare with the conventional treatment in length of stay (LOS) in
      hospital, postoperative complications, as well as the hospitalization costs. The aim of this
      trial is to verify our hypothesis that D-ERAS could provide reduced LOS while not increase
      complications and in-hospital cost when compared with the current clinical practice.
