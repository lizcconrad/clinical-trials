      Prospective randomized comparison of minisling (altis) with the TVTO procedure for the
      management of women with genuine stress urinary incontinence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized study double blinded. Two group of patients consisting group A of 40
      patients being operated with altis minisling and group B with 40 patients operated with TVTO
      procedure. All patients will be operated with epidural anesthesia.

      The patients participating in the study will meet the following requirements. a. Having
      genuine stress urinary incontinence proven by urodynamics, b. be willing to be operated and
      participate in the study. Exclusion criteria wil be the following: a.History of previous
      irradiation in the lower genital tract, b. BMI more than 30kg/m2, c.previous
      anti-incontinence surgery, previous vaginal surgery, e. having MUCP&lt; 20 cm H2O or Valsava
      leak point pressure less than than 60 cm H2O.

      Patients will be allocated in each operation by an automatic system using a computer
      software.

      Primary outcome measure will be the objective cure rate at 6 months as it is assessed with
      cough stress test during urodynamics. Secondary outcome measures will be the subjective cure
      rate, improvement and failure rate, the incidence of complications such as obstruction,
      voiding difficulties, hemorrhage etc. Patients will be asked to complete preoperatively and
      postoperatively the ICIQ-FLUTS, patient satisfaction questionnaire and the female sexual
      function index.postoperatively the patients will complete the PGI-I questionnaire.
