  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is
      an understudied complication of HCT that significantly affects transplant related morbidity
      and mortality. The investigators hypothesize that early intervention with complement blocker
      eculizumab will double survival in HCT recipients with high risk TMA, as compared to
      historical untreated controls. An optimal eculizumab dosing schedule can be determined for
      this population through eculizumab pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) testing.

      This clinical trial is a prospective single arm multi-institution study in children and young
      adults undergoing allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who will
      receive early therapy with eculizumab to prevent TMA-associated MODS after transplantation.
      The purpose of this research study is to examine efficacy of complement blocker eculizumab in
      HCT recipients with high risk TMA and to determine optimal eculizumab dosing regimen for HCT
      recipients with TMA using PK/PD studies. All patients will receive therapy based on their
      weight for 24 weeks. Survival will be assessed at 6 months from TMA diagnosis.
