  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of rogaratinib in combination
      with copanlisib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are
      mRNA-positive for at least one FGFR1-4 subtype.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      rogaratinib and copanlisib alone or in combination, and to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of
      rogaratinib in combination with copanlisib locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that
      are mRNA-positive for at least one FGFR1-4 subtype.

          -  For the dose expansion part: Patients with histologically confirmed, locally advanced
             or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) including urinary

             patient must not be undergoing acute steroid therapy or taper (chronic steroid therapy

             screening radiographic studies).
