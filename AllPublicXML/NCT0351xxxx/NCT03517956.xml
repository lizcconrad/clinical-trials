  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of rogaratinib in combination
      with copanlisib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are
      mRNA-positive for at least one FGFR1-4 subtype.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      rogaratinib and copanlisib alone or in combination, and to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of
      rogaratinib in combination with copanlisib locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that
      are mRNA-positive for at least one FGFR1-4 subtype.
