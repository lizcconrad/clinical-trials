  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The disease malaria affects many people in Mali and other parts of Africa and the world. It
      is caused by germs spread by mosquito bites. Malaria may be mild. But it can also be serious
      or lead to death if it is not treated promptly. Researchers want to find a safe vaccine that
      prevents malaria.

      Objective:

      To study how safe and tolerable the malaria vaccine called PfSPZ Vaccine is for healthy
      adults.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults:

        -  ages 18-35 in Ou(SqrRoot)(Copyright)less(SqrRoot)(Copyright)bougou, Mali

        -  not infected with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C

        -  for females, not pregnant or breastfeeding and must use reliable birth control during
           the study

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with questions about malaria and will undergo blood, urine, and
      heart tests.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups. They will get injections of either
      the PfSPZ vaccine or a salt-water placebo. They will not know which one they get.

      One vaccine group and one placebo group will get an injection 3 times over 4 weeks. They will
      be followed for 7 months for a total of 26 visits.

      The other two groups (vaccine group and placebo) will get an injection 3 times over 16 weeks.
      They will be followed for 11 months for a total of 34 visits.

      All participants will be treated with an antimalarial medication prior to the third
      injection.

      At vaccine visits, female participants will have a pregnancy test before injection. All
      participants will have an arm cleaned and the vaccine injected in a vein. They will be
      watched for 30 minutes.

      At non-vaccine visits, participants will have a physical exam and be asked how they are
      feeling. They will usually have blood tests.

      It is known that humans can be protected against malaria by repeated immunization with
      radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Sanaria, Inc. has developed a process for manufacturing, in
      compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) aseptic, purified, radiation-
      attenuated cryopreserved sporozoites from a well-characterized isolate of Plasmodium
      falciparum (Pf). This product, which is called PfSPZ Vaccine, can be administered by needle
      and syringe.

      A collaboration among the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC, Mali), the Laboratory
      of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
      Diseases (NIAID), and Sanaria, Inc. has shown that sterile protection against naturally
      occurring malaria infection can be achieved. In this study, five doses of 2.7 (SqrRoot) 10^5
      PfSPZ during the dry season resulted in protective efficacies of about 48% by time to first
      positive blood smears (BS) and about 29% by proportion of participants with at least one
      positive BS during a full malaria transmission season (20 weeks), higher than those reported
      for other malaria vaccine candidates.

      A follow up study in 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02627456) that reduced the
      number of vaccinations (from 5 to 3) while increasing the dose of sporozoites at each
      vaccination (2.7 x105 to 1.8x106 PfSPZ Vaccine) was conducted. Preliminary results show that
      42 of 55 (77.8%) participants from the placebo group and 32 of 54 participants (58.1%) from
      the vaccine group developed Pf infection. Per protocol, the vaccine efficacy (VE) was 51%
      (p=0.004, 95% CI 20-70) by time-to-infection analysis (intention to treat (ITT) 39%, p=0.033)
      and 24% (p=0.031, 95% CI 2-41) by proportional analysis (ITT 22%, p= 0.041), similar to the
      previous study.

      Studies are ongoing to establish a vaccination regimen, optimum dose and schedule, that will
      lead to improved sterile protection in endemic regions. Preliminary results from more recent
      studies in malaria-na(SqrRoot) ve and malaria-experienced participants have shown that
      9.0x10^5 PfSPZ Vaccine dose per vaccination (lower than 1.8 x10^6 used in studies above) in a
      three-dose regimen may be an optimal dose for immunization. In addition, there is emerging
      evidence that a condensed, more practical regimen may also lead to development of sterile
      immunity. This proposed study is therefore designed to assess safety, immunogenicity and
      protective efficacy of two separate three-dose vaccination regimens during natural
      transmission season.
