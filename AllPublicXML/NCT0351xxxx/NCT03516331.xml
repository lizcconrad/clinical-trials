  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an 2-part study. Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      single doses of FDL176 with and without co-administration of FDL169. Part 2 will assess the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of FDL176 with and without
      co-administration of FDL169 .

      This is an open-label, non-randomised, single-sequence 2-part study. Enrolment into Part 2 of
      the study will begin after Part 1 is complete, and a review of safety and pharmacokinetic
      data has been completed.Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      single doses of FDL176 with and without co-administration of FDL169. Part 2 will assess the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of FDL176 once daily (QD) with
      and without co-administration of FDL169.

             clinically significant by the investigator.

          -  Must agree to follow the study's contraception requirement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical findings, ECG findings
             or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's (or delegate's) opinion, could
             adversely affect the safety of the subject or would place the subject at increased
             risk.

          -  History of long QT syndrome and/or QT corrected according to Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF) interval (&gt;450 msec) or QTcF &gt;450 msec at Screening or Day -1.

          -  Presence or history of clinically significant allergy requiring treatment, as judged
             by the investigator. Hayfever is allowed unless it is active.

          -  Use of any prescription drugs within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
