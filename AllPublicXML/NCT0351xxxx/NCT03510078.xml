  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia is a common condition among hospitalized patients. The occurrence of severe
      hyperglycemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in several populations.
      Several trials assessed the benefits of aggressive versus conventional glucose control. These
      studies evaluated different patient populations, glucose targets and treatment protocols and
      as a result reported conflicting results. To date there are no clear guidelines regarding to
      the preferred glucose target range in hospitalized non-critically ill patients. The common
      practice is to maintain glucose level lower than 180 mg/dl however there are no evidence
      based regarding to the outcomes of hospitalized patients treated with intensive compared to
      conventional glycemic control. This prospective randomized controlled study will compare
      intensive vs. standard glycemic control in hospitalized non-critically ill patients.

      Within 24 hours of hospitalization in the internal medical or geriatric departments, patients
      who are expected to require hospitalization for at least three consecutive days will be
      randomly assigned into one of the two study groups - intensive with a target blood glucose
      range of 130 mg per deciliter or less, or conventional glucose control, with a target of
      130-180 mg per deciliter. The investigators defined the primary end point as a composite
      outcome of mortality in 30 days, severe hypoglycemia, severe infections within 30 days, CVA
      and cardiac ischemic events within 30 days.
