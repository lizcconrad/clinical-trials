      Randomized clinical trial about the evaluation of the use of nature photographs in the
      positive and negative affects of oncological patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades there has been growing interest from researchers in understanding how the
      adoption of natural elements in daily life, even in hospitals, can characterize restorative
      environments and reflect in better health for patients. Contact with nature can be done
      indirectly through photographs. This clinical trial aims to verify the therapeutic potential
      of the nature images, previously validated in another part of this study, in the care of
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Anchored on the assumptions of the theory of
      Biophilia, and the environmental theory of Florence Nightingale our study hypothesis is that
      this intervention promotes well-being and promote more positive mood states, and reduce
      symptoms resulting from the treatment during chemotherapy session.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline positive and negative affects at immediate post intervention, through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire aims to verify the positive and negative affects of participants in oncologic treatment before and after their first chemotherapy session, in order to verify if after the intervention, the negative affects decrease and the positive ones increase. Each questionnaire will be analyzed individually.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS-Br)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Edmonton Symptoms at immediate post intervention, through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This tool is designed to assist in the assessment of nine symptoms common in cancer patients: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing and shortness of breath, (there is also a line labelled &quot;Other Problem&quot;). The severity at the time of assessment of each symptom is rated from 0 to 10 on a numerical scale, 0 meaning that the symptom is absent and 10 that it is of the worst possible severity. It does not have final classification scores. It measures the frequency and intensity of symptoms presented at the time of its application.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Connectedness to Nature Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Single baseline measurement</time_frame>
    <description>The Nature Connection Scale is used to verify the affective aspect of the person-environment relationship. It is composed of 14 items, which are answered in a scale of 5 points, ranging from 1 (I totally disagree) to 5 (I totally agree). The higher the score, the greater the individual's connection with nature.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Nature Relatedness Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Single baseline measurement</time_frame>
    <description>The 21-item Nature Relatedness Scale (NR) assesses subjective connectedness with the natural environment. Participants respond to statements using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and items are averaged with higher scores indicating stronger connectedness.</description>

    <description>A pre-validated nature images video will be shown to the patient during their chemotherapy session. After thirty minutes of the start of the chemotherapy session, the patient you will receive a notebook (specific to the study and blocked for other functions) that he can watch a presentation of nature images. It will be four videos with fifteen minutes each one.</description>

    <description>After signing the Informed Consent Form, the participants will respond to a demographic questionnaire to characterize the sample and then they will watch nature videos. After that, will be applied a scale questionnaire about the physical and psychological symptoms of chemotherapy in the positive and negative mood of that patient.</description>
