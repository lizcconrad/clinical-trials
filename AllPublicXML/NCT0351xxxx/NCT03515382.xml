  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor wants to investigate how well the test medicine is taken up by the body when
      given alongside two other already approved medicines. This kind of study is known as a
      drug-drug interaction study. In this case the other medicines are itraconazole and
      voriconazole.

      The sponsor will also look at the safety and tolerability of the test medicine when taken
      alone, and when taken with the approved medicines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written, signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) as approved by the Independent
             Ethics Committee (IEC), prior to any screening evaluations.

          -  Male subject between 18-55 years of age (extremes included) on the day of signing the
             ICF.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18.0-32.0 kg/m², inclusive, with body weight at least 50
             kg.

          -  Judged by the investigator to be in good health based upon the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory
             results.

          -  Non-smoker, defined as an individual who has abstained from smoking (or the use of
             e-cigarettes or nicotine containing products) from at least 1 year prior to screening.
             A breath carbon monoxide reading of less than or equal to 10 ppm at screening and

          -  Negative urine drug screen (at a minimum: amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
             cannabis, cocaine, opiates, methadone, and tricyclic antidepressants) and alcohol
             breath test at screening and admission.

          -  Negative serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or 2, hepatitis B
             virus surface antigen (HBs-Ag) or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab), or any history
             of hepatitis from any cause, with the exception of hepatitis A at screening.

          -  Subject must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures as and must be able

             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of serious allergic reaction to any drug as determined by the investigator
             (e.g. anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization) and/or known sensitivity to study drug or
             the excipients.

          -  Use of strong inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A4/5 and/or P-gp, including
             consumption of herbal medications (e.g. St. John's Wort) and grapefruit/grapefruit
             products within 7 days prior to the first study drug administration.

          -  Contra-indication for the use of itraconazole or voriconazole as described in the
             package insert.

          -  Abnormal liver function test, defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and/or gamma-glutamyl
             transferase (GGT) &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Retesting is allowed once.
             Subjects with documented Gilbert's syndrome are eligible for inclusion in the study.

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence).

          -  Clinically relevant abnormalities detected on ECG regarding either rhythm, rate or
             conduction (e.g. QT interval corrected for the heart rate using Fridericia's formula
             [QTcF] ≥450 ms, or a known long QT syndrome). A first degree heart block or sinus
             arrhythmia is not considered as a significant abnormality.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal vital signs and/or abnormalities detected during physical
             examination.

          -  Per judgment of the investigator, substantial blood loss (including blood donation),
             or a transfusion of any blood product within 8 weeks prior to the first study drug
             administration.

          -  Any condition or circumstances that, in the opinion of the investigator, could make a
