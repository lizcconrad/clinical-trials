  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent years, the use of bronchoscopic lung volume reduction in emphysema patients
      instead of surgical operations has become widespread. Before this procedure, the
      implementation of Pulmonary Rehabilitation became a necessity. The inadequacy of the number
      of Pulmonary Rehabilitation Centers in our country and in our city and the increasing number
      of mentioned operations have increased the need for different exercise program applications.
      Prior to valve and coil applications in our study, changes in clinical conditions of patients
      will be examined if Pulmonary Rehabilitation is performed at home or in a hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The records of emphysema patients referred to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit for
      prophylactic pulmonary rehabilitation prior to bronchoscopic lung volume reduction will be
      recorded prospectively. Two parallel groups will be formed from patients with hospital-based
      pulmonary rehabilitation (Group 1) and those with home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (Group
      2). The patient will receive an 8-week Pulmonary Rehabilitation Exercise Program and will be
      reevaluated after 8 weeks. The differences in the parameters of initial and rehabilitation
      end-tracing and the differences between the groups will be examined.
