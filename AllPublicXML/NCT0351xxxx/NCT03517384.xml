      The aim of the study is to study an english-language version of BDD-NET (Enander, et al.,
      2014; Enander, et al., 2016), an internet-based treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder, on a
      globally recruited sample. This is an uncontrolled pilot study where a within-subjects
      repeated measures design was used to assess the feasibility of conducting all aspects of the
      study remotely, including recruitment, assessment, and treatment delivery.
