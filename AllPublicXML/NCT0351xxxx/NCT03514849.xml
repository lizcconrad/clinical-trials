  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, for participants with cT1-2N0 small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the International
      guidelines recommend surgical radical resection (lobectomy + systematic lymph node sampling
      or cleaning); If the postoperatively pathological examination is confirmed to be in pT1-2N0
      stage, a single postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (combining etoposide with cisplatin) is
      recommended. If participants are difficult to tolerate the side effects of cisplatin, the
      investigators can replace cisplatin by carboplatin in the adjuvant chemotherapy scheme.
      Participants with pT1-2N0 SCLC are not recommended to receive postoperative chest-assisted
      radiotherapy. For participants with pT1-N0 SCLC after specific surgical resection,
      prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is currently recommended. But this recommendation is
      currently lacking the support of research evidence.

      The main purpose of this study is to study the prognostic effects of PCI on participants with
      pT1-2N0 stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have received radical surgery and
      postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The main endpoint of this study is to observe the total survival rate (5-year OS%) in 5
      years.

      The secondary outcome measures include 5 years of disease-free survival (5-year DFS%),
      disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), surgical complications, resection rates,
      quality of life (QoL), and exploration of biomarkers (tumor tissue).

      This is a two-arm, open, multicentral clinical study designed to compare the 5-year OS% of
      participants receiving or not receiving PCI for pT1-2N0 stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
      with radical surgery plus postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Previous literature reports
      that the 5-year OS% of participants with pT1-2N0 period SCLC who have received surgical
      resection is about 50%. Assuming that PCI can increase 5 years OS% by 10%, then enrolling 320
      participants in the group can guarantee 70% degree of certainty with observing a unilateral
      significant difference α&lt; 0.1. Taking about 10% of the follow-up loss rate into account, the
      investigators expect to enroll 360 participants.

      Dividing the 360 participants divided into two groups randomly, each group is composed of 180
      people. All participants received lobectomy plus mediastinal lymph node dissection or
      systematic lymph node sampling. Participants in the control group are enrolled in the
      follow-up, and the participants in research group will receive PCI by 25gy/10fx.
