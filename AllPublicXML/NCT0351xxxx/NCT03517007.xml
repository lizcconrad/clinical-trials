  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to implement an opt-out protocol to guide appropriate
      de-escalation of antibiotics in qualifying patients. The protocol, determined over the course
      a year with the help of a large, well-rounded expert panel, will be used by pharmacists to
      recommend de-escalation of antibiotics to hospital providers. Providers can then decide
      whether or not to follow the recommendation in determining the best treatment pathway for his
      or her patient.
