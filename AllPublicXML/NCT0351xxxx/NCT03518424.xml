  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to establish the injury incidence, severity and burden
      typically observed within Scottish professional football clubs. In line with the
      well-established model of sports injury prevention research proffered by van Mechelen, the
      first stage in this process is establishing the extent of the problem i.e. injury incidence,
      severity and burden. Such a multi-club study has never been conducted within Scotland despite
      a thriving professional game.
