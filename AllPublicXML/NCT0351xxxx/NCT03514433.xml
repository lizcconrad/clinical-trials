  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TRIP Project aims to overcome barriers to widespread implementation and dissemination of
      evidence-based practices that will improve the delivery of guideline-concordant care to
      vulnerable women with breast cancer. To accomplish this goal the study team will create (a)
      regional patient registries; (b) systematic screening for social barriers to care with a
      personalized referral plan; and (c) patient navigation services that integrate into one model
      of care to improve the quality and effectiveness of care delivery, for minority and/or
      low-income women with breast cancer in Boston.

      This community-engaged program will demonstrate the feasibility of community-academic
      partnerships to provide innovations in information sharing and systems implementation
      targeted to reduce treatment disparities. Patient navigators will be able to utilize the
      patient database to track their patients throughout their treatment, and receive guidance
      regarding recommended social resources to patients experiencing hardships via the social
      determinants platform.

      Who: The four Massachusetts CTSA hubs (Boston University, Harvard University, Tufts
      University, and University of Massachusetts) partnered with the Boston Breast Cancer Equity
      Coalition, and the 6 hospitals that care for women with breast cancer.

      Patient population: 1,100 vulnerable inner city women with risk for delay in breast cancer
      care. Massachusetts (MA) Cancer Registry data identified the following characteristics of
      Boston residents with greatest delays in breast cancer treatment: Black, Hispanic,
      non-English speaking, and public health insurance. Six health care institutions care for &gt;90%
      of these women:

        1. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (site PI: Ted James, MD)

        2. Boston Medical Center (PI: Tracy Battaglia MD, MPH)

        3. Brigham Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (PI: Jennifer Haas MD, MPH)

        4. Faulkner Hospital (site PI: Rachel Freedman, MD)

        5. Massachusetts General Hospital (site PI: Beverly Moy, MD)

        6. Tufts Medical Center (PI: Karen Freund MD, MPH)

      UMass Medical Center (PI: Stephenie Lemon, PhD) will play an integral role in the planning
      and implementation of the TRIP intervention but is not a clinical site.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized cluster stepped wedge design will be conducted. This pragmatic design involves a sequential, randomized roll-out of the intervention across 6 participating clinical sites or &quot;clusters&quot; over 3 month intervals or &quot;steps&quot;. Consistent with a stepped wedge design with one cluster per step, prior to the collection of data in the pre-intervention period, the investigators will generate a set of uniform random numbers for each of the six clusters to assign a starting period for the study intervention. There will be no crossover of patients from usual care to the intervention. That is, patients at each site during the pre-intervention period will experience only usual care and will act as historical controls and those enrolled after the initiation of intervention will experience the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The receipt of timely care will be defined as initiation of care within 90 days, as this the shortest delay that has been shown to consistently affect mortality. The time element will be calculated from date of diagnosis (Time0) to date of treatment initiation (Time1) .The date chosen for the Time1 variable will depend on the recommended care plan for each patient, as derived from the chart abstraction and based on patient presentation, including but not limited to stage at diagnosis and co-morbid medical conditions.</description>

    <description>This study will be utilizing electronic health record data to identify patients that match the TRIP eligibility criteria and received patient navigation prior to study rollout in June 2018. These patients will receive standard patient navigation at their care site and will act as historical controls in comparison to the TRIP experimental group.</description>

    <description>This study will be enhancing current patient navigation at the participating 6 hospitals with the 3 components of the TRIP intervention (a shared patient registry, a social determinants of health platform, and additional training and support for Patient Navigators). All patients that are identified as TRIP eligible will receive these intervention benefits and will be categorized into the experimental arm of the study.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

             intervention to effect the outcome is limited;

          2. presence of a cognitive impairment such as dementia or delirium from any cause (e.g.
             metabolic, medication or drug induced), given the unique challenges to their treatment
             decision making/ adherence and the fact that the intervention would not include the
