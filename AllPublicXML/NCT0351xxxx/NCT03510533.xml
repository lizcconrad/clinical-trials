      Eating disorders are a public health issue. It has been recently reported the importance of
      immune system modifications in eating disorders physiopathology, involving autoantibodies
      directed against neuropeptides regulating food intake. A recent study of laboratory INSERM
      1073 showed the existence of an intestinal bacterial protein exhibiting structural
      similarities with α-MSH: ClpB. The autoAc directed against the latter also react with α-MSH
      because of these similarity of structures, thus leading to a potential digestive origin of
      these autoAc. To consolidate this new etiopathogenic assumption, a large clinical study is
      necessary with analysis of patients autoAc profiles. a monocentric study with inclusion of
      240 patients over 2 years and 80 healthy volunteers is proposed.

      This study should lead to the validation of the concept of the autoAc directed against the
      neuropeptides involved in food intake regulation. Nutritional modulations (probiotic,
      amino-acid…) could constitute an interesting therapeutic perspective in the future.
