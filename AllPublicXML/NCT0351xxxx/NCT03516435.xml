      This experiment is expected to understand the benefits of different settings of electrical
      stimulation in the treatment of overactive bladder.The study will adopt a longitudinal
      research design with randomized quasi-experimental trial.The patients will recruited and be
      randomly assigned to Group A (Parasacral transcutaneous electrical stimulation) or Group B
      (Intravaginal electrical stimulation). There will be 30 participants in each group. Data will
      be collected 2 times.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>3 Days Voiding diary</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>This chart is a record of your voiding and leakage or urine. Choose three (3) separate 24 hour periods to complete this record. Pick days which will be most convenient for you to measure every void.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overactive Bladder Symptom Score( OABSS）</measure>
    <time_frame>20 min</time_frame>
    <description>This is a single symptom score that employs a self-report questionnaire to quantify OAB symptoms.Questionnaire has many items with the same minimum and maximum score.Four question items, daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency and urgency incontinence, were included in the questionnaire according to the definition of OAB.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>minVisual analogue scale (VAS) for urgency</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog or Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. Respondents mark the location on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of urgency they experienced. This gives them the greatest freedom to choose their urgency intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for each respondent to express a personal response style. VAS data of this type is recorded as the number of millimeters from the left of the line with the range 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Pad test</measure>
    <time_frame>20min-1hr</time_frame>
    <description>To measure leakage and may be performed in the specialist's office or at home. Pad testing can be done over a period of time as short as twenty minutes or up to one hour.</description>
