  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean section (CS) constitutes a large proportion of the total surgical volume in
      low-income countries. This rate comes with challenges including surgical complications,
      shortage of beds, and consequently long waiting time for operations and high costs. These
      have led to the adoption of ERAS in developed countries in a bid to save costs by reducing
      hospital length of stay without compromising the health of the mother and her baby.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CS is the most common major surgery at Mbarara Hospital (56.2%). This rate comes with
      challenges including surgical complications, shortage of beds, and consequently long waiting
      time for operations. Enhanced recovery programs are composed of preoperative, intraoperative
      and postoperative strategies combined to form a multi-modal pathway. ERAS requires a
      multidisciplinary team of anesthetists, surgeons and nurses for successful implementation and
      realization of its advantages. ERAS has been seen to reduce duration of hospital stay,
      complications and costs. Although many of the elements of enhanced recovery after surgery are
      similar, it has not been tested in emergency CS and there is limited data about its
      applicability in low income settings like Uganda where 95% of CS are emergencies. The aim of
      this study was to assess the impact of ERAS protocols following emergency caesarean delivery
      in a low resource setting.

    <intervention_model_description>The ERAS arm was exposed to modified ERAS elements including preoperative counseling and education, prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting (PONV), individualized goal directed fluid therapy, early mobilization at 6-8 hours postoperative, early feeding within 1 hour postoperative,urethral catheter removal at 6 hours, oral fixed combination non opioid analgesia, oral antibiotics and anti-emetics. PONV included intravenous metoclopromide and dexametasone, no ondansetron given. Patients in the control arm recovered with routine care.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Mothers delivering by emergency CS were randomly assigned to either ERAS or routine care arms in a ratio of 1:1. We did simple randomization to either ERAS or routine care arm without any blocks. We generated patient group assignments using the computer algorithm (computer-generated list of random numbers) and placed in identical sealed opaque envelopes. A statistician not involved in the research generated the random number list. The envelopes were opened sequentially by the anesthetist when an eligible patient was encountered. Mothers were recruited into the study by the two research assistants implementing ERAS elements. Single blinding of PI and the two research assistants assessing outcomes was done to minimize bias.</masking_description>
