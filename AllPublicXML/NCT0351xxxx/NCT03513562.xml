  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well venetoclax and ibrutinib work in treating participants
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and have developed genetic mutations after previously being
      treated with ibrutinib. Venetoclax and ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if the addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib therapy can eliminate ibrutinib
      resistance mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rate of minimal residual disease negative complete remission to combination
      ibrutinib and venetoclax therapy.

      II. Determine progression-free survival after the addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib.

      III. Determine overall survival after the addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib. IV. Describe
      the toxicity profile of venetoclax in combination with ibrutinib in this patient population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. Describe changes in variant allele frequency (VAF) of known
      ibrutinib resistance mutations after the addition of venetoclax.

      II. Perform BH3 profiling and correlate with response to combination venetoclax and ibrutinib
      therapy.

      III. Determine if increased expression of MCL-1 and BCL-XL is a potential mechanism of
      resistance to venetoclax when given in combination with ibrutinib.

      IV. Determine potential mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib and venetoclax combination
      treatment by whole exome and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of venetoclax.

      Participants receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and ibrutinib PO once daily
      (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 or 24 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with minimal residual disease
      (MRD) negativity after 12 or 24 courses discontinue treatment, while participants with MRD
      positivity continue treatment with venetoclax in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 2 years
      and then every 6 months thereafter.
