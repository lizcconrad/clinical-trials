  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life and satisfaction in aesthetic surgery is still under-evaluated. It is a
      prospective and multicenter study with a 4 months follow-up of patients under rhinoplasty or
      rhinoseptoplasty procedure. They will answer to the FACE-Q and NOSE questionnaires before
      surgery, one week later and 4 months after the procedure. The aim of the study is to show a
      significant augmentation of the quality of life scores. At this occasion, the FACE-Q
      questionnaire has been translated and validated in French

      The main objective of this study is to show the efficiency of the rhinoplasty or
      rhinoseptoplasty procedure on the quality of life in a French population. There are many
      Patients reported outcomes questionnaire in aesthetic surgery but none of them is perfect.
      The FACE-Q rhinoplasty modules questionnaires is a recent test which has been validated in
      English but not in French. It is able to evaluate different areas of the quality of life and
      patient satisfaction. After French validation of the FACE-Q, this study will compare patient
      satisfaction before and after rhinoplasty or rhinoseptoplasty procedure. There is a lack of
      studies in the French population about rhinoseptoplasty surgery and quality of life or
      satisfaction. The goal is to show the interest of a surgery procedure on the feeling of the
      patients, concerning very different domains of appearance. This could help us to define the
      preoperative patients who are able to be really improved by this surgery
