    <textblock>
      This study intends to collect tumour tissue and blood from consenting patients for the
      development of manufacturing processes for potential immunotherapies.

      Suitable patients will provide consent at the first patient visit. Baseline assessments as
      per standard of care and a record of patient demographics will be taken for visit 1. Details
      will also be collected about current medical conditions and procedures and current
      medications. Patients will be tested for infectious diseases e.g. HIV, Human T-cell
      lymphotropic virus (HTLV), Hepatitis B, C and syphilis.

      Visit 2: At this visit, tissue samples will be obtained per standard treatment. The patient
      will also donate blood. This procedure is outside the standard of care.

      All donated samples will be couriered to the specialist Sponsor laboratory with appropriate
      oversight.

      Visit 3 Following standard of care procedure, patients will receive their standard follow up
      care. For this protocol a follow up telephone call will be made to ensure patients have
      recovered fully.

      This then concludes the patients' participation in the study.

    <study_pop>

        Patients with solid tumour scheduled for either biopsy or resection of their tumour(s) as
        part of their standard of care.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be at least 18 years old at the Screening Visit.

          2. Patient has given informed consent to participate in the study

          3. Suspected or confirmed diagnosis of solid tumour with either primary, recurrent or
             metastatic disease scheduled for surgical excision and/or collection of multiple
             tissue samples via image or device guided biopsy.

          4. Haemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL

          5. White cell count ≥ 3 x 10^9/L

          6. Negative laboratory test for blood borne pathogens (see exclusion criterion 5)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical status precludes surgical removal of, or collection of multiple biopsies
             from, accessible tumour tissue

          2. Inadequate peripheral venous access precluding collection of blood

          3. Known pregnancy

          4. Known/laboratory confirmed diagnosis of an infectious disease preventing the use of
             the material

        As a minimum, the patient will undergo specific screening for the following infections: HIV
        1 and 2, HTLV I/II, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Syphilis.
