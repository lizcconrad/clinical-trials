  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major aim of this study is to investigate the effects of biofeedback assisted abdominal
      breathing training on improving the psychological and physiological distress in patients with
      ACI. In this randomized, controlled, single-blind trial, AIS patients were randomly assigned
      into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received four HRVBF training
      sessions. The control group received routine care. Repeated measures of HRV, Mini-Mental
      Status Examination (MMSE), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS), and Barthel Index
      for ADLs were collected prior to, and at one, and three months post-intervention.

      Study protocol Participants who provided signed consent were randomly assigned to HRVBF
      intervention or control group. They underwent baseline measurements of demographics,
      psychological distress, cognitive impairment, ADL capabilities, and autonomic function.
      Random numbers from the Bernoulli distribution were calculated using the Excel BINOMDIST
      function, and concealed in an opaque envelope, until participants' baseline measurements were
      completed.

      The HRVBF group received four, one-on-one bedside biofeedback training sessions (20-minutes a
      day for 4 days), and practiced on their own (10-minutes twice a day) using a FDA-regulated,
      hand-held mobile biofeedback device (StressEraser, Helico Inc., New York, NY, USA).26 The
      control group received usual care. Afterwards, all participants were telephoned bi-weekly and
      encouraged to practice slow breathing (HRVBF group) or to perform self-care (control group)
      for three months. psychological distress, cognitive impairment, ADL capabilities, and
      autonomic function (represented by HRV) were re-assessed at one, and 3-months after the
      intervention, by an independent investigator blinded to group assignment.

      HRVBF intervention protocol The HRVBF protocol was modified from Lehrer's HRV biofeedback
      manual.20 A noninvasive visual biofeedback system (NeXus-10 with BioTrace+, Mind Media B.V.,
      Netherlands) and a laptop computer were used for the intervention. Participants in the HRVBF
      group received four, one-on-one bedside training sessions (20-minutes a day for 4 days). The
      first session (Day 1) was focused on teaching patients to breath slowly (6-8
      breaths-per-minute) and to extend their expiratory phase using pursed-lip breathing. Also,
      respiration sensors for tracking breathing pace were introduced. The second session (day 2)
      was focused on teaching patients diaphragmatic breathing in conjunction with pursed-lip
      breathing, and to use respiratory sensors to pace breathing (6 breaths a minute). The third
      and fourth sessions (days 3 and 4) were focused on reviewing diaphragmatic breathing,
      pursed-lip breathing, and teaching patients to breathe in-phase with their heart rate
      changes. Additionally, participants were encouraged to practice slow diaphragmatic and
      pursed-lip breathing, on their own, with the aid of the hand-held biofeedback device, for 10
      minutes, twice-a-day, during the 4-day training period.

    <measure>Changes from Baseline Psychological distress (Anxiety and Depression) at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1-month, and 3-month visits</time_frame>
    <description>The hospital anxiety and depression scale was a 14-item ordinal scale, used for participants to self-rate their psychological distress related to anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items). Items are scored 0(no distress) to 3 (serious distress). Based on the findings from previous studies, scoring at or higher than the cut-off point of 8 out of 21, identified those with anxiety or depression.</description>

    <measure>Changes from Baseline Cognitive function at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1-month, and 3-month visits</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to measure patients' cognitive function. MMSE includes eleven items and consists of five facets orientation (space and time, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language). The maximum total score is 30. Lower scores represent worse cognitive function.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 1-month, and 3-month visits</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Barthel Index (BI) was used to measure participants' capabilities in activities of daily living (ADLs) (feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, transfers, and toilet use). BI score ranges from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicating lower ADLs capabilities.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 1-month, and 3-month visits</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability (HRV) was used to represent the autonomic function, and measured with Mind Media B.V. (-NeXus-10, Netherlands). Time and frequency domains of HRV was analyzed using Kubios HRV software (Biosignal Analysis and Medical Imaging Group, Finland).</description>
