    <textblock>
      Phase 2, open label, dose escalation study of two dose cohorts of MABp1 in patients with
      moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa. The study is multicenter and will consist of two
      dose levels: MABp1 administered subcutaneously at a dose of 200 mg weekly (12 doses) and
      MABp1 administered subcutaneously at a dose of 400 mg weekly (12 doses). Patients will be
      followed for 12 weeks to allow for assessment of safety and preliminary efficacy.
