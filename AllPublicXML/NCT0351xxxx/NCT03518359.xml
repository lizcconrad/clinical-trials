    <textblock>
      Burnout and overwhelming stress are growing issues in medicine and are associated with mental
      illness, performance deficits and diminished patient care. Among surgical trainees, high
      dispositional mindfulness decreases these risks by 75% or more, and formal mindfulness
      training has been shown feasible and acceptable. In other high-stress populations formal
      mindfulness training has improved well-being, stress, cognition and performance, yet the
      ability of such training to mitigate stress and burnout across medical specialties, or to
      affect improvements in the cognition and performance of physicians, remains unknown. To
      address these gaps and thereby promote the wider adoption of contemplative practices within
      medical training, investigators have developed Enhanced Stress Resilience Training, a
      modified form of MBSR - streamlined, tailored and contextualized for physicians and trainees.
      Investigators propose to test Enhanced Stress Resilience Training (ESRT), versus active
      control and residency-as-usual, in mixed-specialty interns (from Emergency Medicine, Internal
      Medicine, Pediatrics, Family Practice, OBGYN and Surgery Departments) evaluated for
      well-being, cognition and performance changes at baseline, post-intervention and three or
      six-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiencing joy in the practice of medicine is by no means guaranteed. For many physicians,
      the unique bond with patients, the deep satisfaction of saving a life, and a profound sense
      of calling make the sacrifice and heartache worthwhile. In contrast, the growing prevalence
      of burnout and mental distress in physicians is being linked to diminished performance,
      patient outcomes, and hospital economics. This has broad ramifications, including threatening
      the physician-patient bond and the societal pillar this represents.

      Overwhelming stress without adequate coping skills has been posited to promote burnout and
      distress, and may promote performance deficits (from surgical errors to poor professionalism)
      by impairing cognition and self-regulation. In other high-stress/high-performance groups
      formal mindfulness training has been shown to enhance stress resilience, well-being and
      performance. Nevertheless, quality research exploring the effects of mindfulness training on
      chronic stress and performance in physicians remains scarce, contributing to the slow
      adoption of mindfulness training into medical practice and residency.

      To date, investigators have conducted a national survey which showed that the presence of
      high dispositional mindfulness in surgery residents reduced the risk of burnout and distress
      by 75% or more. Investigators have conducted a Randomized Clinical Trial of Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) in surgery interns, demonstrating feasibility and acceptability of
      formal mindfulness training as well as promising positive effects in well-being, cognition
      and performance. Finally, investigators developed an MBSR-based, streamlined curriculum
      tailored for physicians called Enhanced Stress Resilience Training (ESRT). ESRT has been
      beta-tested in surgery and anesthesia faculty and mixed-level residents allowing refinement
      in terms of logistics, dose and delivery. Investigators have disseminated promising results,
      thereby generating access to a larger study population for the proposed Randomized Clinical
      Trial in mixed-specialty interns, studying ESRT as a means to improve well-being, cognition
      and performance.

      As such, the investigators aim to:

      Aim 1. Assess the feasibility of ESRT for multi-specialty interns. Aim 2. Optimize and
      Manualize ESRT. Aim 3. Identify outcome measures that are feasible and reflect relevant
      intervention targets for physicians' well-being, cognition and performance.

      While this study will likely not reach statistical power, it will absolutely allow for
      broader vetting of the curriculum, testing of scaled-up data acquisition and management
      methods, and the appropriateness of the outcome measures in a mixed-specialty population,
      paving the way for a high-quality, fully-powered multi-center trial in the near future.

      The significance of studying mindfulness mental training in medical and surgical trainees is
      two-fold.

      One, as a process-centered skill with demonstrated effects on psychological well-being,
      perceived stress, cognitive performance and physiologic health, mindfulness represents a
      potential gateway mechanism for providing individuals with a 'universal tool' to address
      challenges across all stages of medical training and practice. This includes burnout and
      errors, both looming issues that have been largely immutable for the last decade.

      Two, if feasibility and efficacy among medical and surgical trainees can be shown, the social
      clout of impacting such a high stress and high performance field is uniquely powerful and
      could further the dissemination of evidence-based mindfulness interventions to a remarkable
      degree. Finally, the enhanced self-awareness and equipoise frequently resulting from
      mindfulness training has been contagious in other settings, and could hold great promise for
      a culture change in medicine that benefits patients and providers, alike.

      The innovation of this work is in bringing a mind-body intervention to bear not only on
      well-being but also on the fundamental cognitive processes believed to sub-serve performance,
      such as the impact of attention and working memory capacity on medical decision-making, and
      the impact of emotional regulation and self-awareness on professionalism and team work. The
      potential to improve both the operative and clinical environments as well as medical errors
      is unprecedented. Finally, a vetted, manualized curriculum specifically crafted for
      physicians could accelerate dissemination nationally.

    <description>ESRT involves six weekly 90-minute group classes and one 2 - 4 hour retreat. Classes focus on developing mindfulness skills (i.e. sustained attention, open monitoring, emotional regulation, meta-cognition) in the context of skills and concepts for managing stress, particularly in practicing medicine. Homework consists of 20 minutes per day of mindfulness exercises following guided meditation CDs or videos of movement-based practice, and practice will be reported periodically by text. A 3-hour outdoor retreat occurs at week six. The central exercises of ESRT are the body scan, sitting meditation, chi gong and yoga. For both arms, the weekly teaching sessions occur on a workday morning during protected time at Parnassus, Mission Bay or Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital campus.</description>
