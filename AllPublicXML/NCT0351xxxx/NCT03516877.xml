      Mounting evidence shows that burnout, a critical metric for dissatisfaction and distress, is
      a growing problem within medicine. Burnout is a syndrome associated with worse physician
      performance, patient outcomes, and hospital economics. Furthermore, investigators are coming
      to understand that burnout, diminished performance and the development of mental and physical
      illness are related. It has been proposed that chronic and overwhelming stress, in the
      absence of adequate coping skills, promotes performance deficits from surgical errors to poor
      professionalism due to the effects of stress on cognition.

      Notably, in small studies of physicians and other high-stress/high-performance groups
      mindfulness-based interventions have shown exceptional promise in improving burnout and
      distress symptoms, protecting cognition, and enhancing meaningfulness and satisfaction in
      work. Nevertheless, in spite of promising results in various populations the translation of
      mindfulness-based interventions to real-world settings has been slow.

      There is a paucity of quality research examining individually-based interventions, formal
      mindfulness training in physicians, or either of these things in the high stakes world of
      surgeons and anesthesiologists. To address these gaps, investigators have developed Enhanced
      Stress-Resilience Training (ESRT) based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), but
      streamlined and tailored for surgeons and anesthesiologists. Investigators have administered
      a needs assessment and found almost 100 faculty interested in such training, and concluded
      beta-testing of the curriculum which allowed for further refinement of logistics, dose and
      delivery. Finally, to establish a baseline in both departments, investigators administered a
      comprehensive well-being survey which captures multiple facets of psychosocial well-being and
      will be used along with executive function testing and measures of performance to evaluate
      the efficacy of out training in a stepped-wedge trial of faculty surgeons and
      anesthesiologists at multiple UCSF hospital sites.

      Investigators believe the myriad positive effects of Mindfulness training are due to the very
      central mechanistic effect of mindfulness training on the brain. This is a critical facet of
      mindfulness mental training in particular because it is the centrality of the training effect
      that allows it to be meaningful through stages of practice, changing career trajectories and
      variable stressors which will inevitably occur over the course of a physician's career.

      It is currently held that mindfulness mental training acts to reduce stress by changing
      relationship to stressors. thereby affecting the perception of daily experience. Put a
      different way, the transformative ability of mindfulness doesn't come from changing the
      content of thoughts, or eradicating negative emotions. It comes from changing how humans
      relate to thoughts and emotions. It is not changing how humans intellectualize or understand
      circumstances, it is changing how they experience them. Learning mindfulness is in some
      regards like push-ups for the brain, that result in the ability to non-judgmentally
      experience life on life's terms (whether it be emotional, stressful or thought-provoking)
      which can result in any one of the myriad facets of well-being described in this proposal.

      Investigators have already shown that such an intervention, when supported institutionally,
      is feasible and acceptable to surgical trainees - a significant litmus test. Moreover, the
      preliminary data from that work suggests that mindfulness training is effective in increasing
      mindfulness, improving psychological well-being, protecting or enhancing executive function,
      improving motor skills and changing the brain in ways that reflect new cognitive habits as
      compared to controls. Finally, the faculty have demonstrated a need and are receptive to this
      intervention. They have beta-tested the current curriculum, helping us to further refine the
      content, delivery and logistics, such that investigators feel confident that ESR training in
      surgery and anesthesia faculty will prove feasible as well as efficacious in improving
      well-being, work satisfaction and distress in this population.

      To test this, investigators have developed a streamlined form of mindfulness training based
      on the proven efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, but modularized for more
      widespread use and, for this project, tailored to surgeons and anesthesiologists. Training
      involves 1.5 hour classes, once per week for 6 weeks; a 2-3 hour retreat and suggested daily
      home practice of 20 minutes. Investigators have designed a pragmatic, longitudinal
      stepped-wedge trial involving up to four of University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
      hospital campuses, expected to recruit more than 100 faculty. Investigators have already been
      granted seed money by the UCSF Medical Center for teachers, facilities and supplies; a grant
      from The Physicians Foundation, and spent 18 months building myriad relationships to support,
      facilitate and populate this project. Investigators will collect pre-, post- and 6- month
      follow-up data on wellbeing, physiologic stress, cognitive function and performance.
      Additionally, investigators will rigorously assess and monitor feasibility.

      Investigator's goal is to establish a culturally-adaptable, pragmatic intervention that
      promotes personal resilience as one necessary component of restoring the joy to the practice
      of medicine - even when it's hard.

    <description>The intervention will be derived from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction in the form of Enhanced Stress Resilience Training (ESRT). ESRT was developed with modifications to languaging, some activities and contextualization to tailor the training to physicians involved in the operating room environment. The structure involves a 'learning component' consisting of 6 weekly 1.5-hour group classes and 2-4 hour retreat at week 6. Classes focus on developing mindfulness skills (i.e. sustained attention and open monitoring) in addition to training focused on stress and coping. 20 minutes per day of mindfulness exercises following guided meditation CDs or independent practice is assigned. The central exercises of the training are the body scan, sitting meditation and limited yoga. Several weekly teaching sessions will be offered to try and accommodate changing and complicated schedules. Daily practice will occur independently, unsupervised, with the duration reported daily by text.</description>
