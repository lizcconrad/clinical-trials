      -  This is a 3-year study and the enrollment time of this study is 24 months.

        -  The participants have to receive the investigational agent:Cerdelga.(Cerdelga have 21
           mg、42 mg and 84 mg capsule.)

        -  The participants have to go back to the hospital and receive the investigational agent
           and take the Gaucher related biomarkers test before receiving Cerdelga, and 2 weeks, 1,
           3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after receiving Cerdelga.

        -  The participants have to inform if any adverse events happened.

        -  The investigators will follow up by phone if adverse events happened in the participants
           after one months start the treatment.

    <description>This is a 3-year study and the enrollment time of this study is 24 months.
The participants have to receive the investigational agent, Cerdelga
The participants have to go back to the hospital and receive the investigational agent and take the test before receving Cerdelga, and 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after receiving Cerdelga.
IMP Administration Method: Cerdelga have 21 mg、42 mg and 84 mg capsule.
No need for fasting before use, but can't take with grapefruit juice.
Five ml Blood and 10 ml urine shoud be taken before receiving Cerdelga, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after receiving Cerdelga for Gaucher related biomarkers test.</description>
