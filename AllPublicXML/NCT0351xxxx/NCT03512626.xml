      This study evaluated visual outcome after cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of
      either a diffractive - refractive (hybrid) multifocal intraocular lens (MFIOL) or monofocal
      intraocular lens (IOL) as a control grup.

      PURPOSE: To present the outcomes of hybrid multifocal and monofocal intraocular lenses (IOL)

      SETTING: Parc de Salut Mar, Universidad Pompeu-Fabra - Autónoma, Barcelona, Spain.

      DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial.

      METHODS: Consecutive patients with bilateral cataract were included. Phacoemulsification with
      randomized implantation of either a monofocal IOL (AR40e, AMO-Abbot 30 Laboratories Inc.
      Abbot Park, Illinois, USA) or multifocal IOL (OptiVis™, Aaren Scientific, Inc, Ontario, CA,
      USA) was performed by the same surgeon and under the same conditions. Over a 3-month
      follow-up, the main outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA),
      corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity at 60 cm
      (UIVA), distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA), uncorrected near visual acuity
      at 33 cm (UNVA), distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), spherical equivalent (SE),
      contrast sensitivity (CS), presence of dysphotopsia, use of spectacles and patient
      satisfaction with the test VF-14 (Visual Function Index) .

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  senile cataract with Snellen visual acuity ≤ 0.5,

          -  motivation for spectacle independence for near vision (as the study was conducted in
             Spanish public health care system, entering study was the only option to get
             multifocal lens, as they are not provided by public health care, and the patients were
             conscious of the possibility of randomization to monofocal group.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  corneal astigmatism ≥ 1.10 diopters (D) and irregular astigmatism,

          -  axial length &lt; 21.5 or ≥ 25 mm,

          -  pupillary diameter in mesopic conditions in distance vision ≤ 2.5 mm and ≥ 6 mm,

          -  ocular pathology that could affect the visual function and/or intraocular lens
             centering and intraoperative or postoperative complications.

          -  highly demanding patients and those whose profession could be affected by a multifocal
             design (professional drivers, jewelers etc.) were also excluded (as in the Spanish
             public health care system secondary procedures needed to satisfy patients'
             expectation, such as LRI´s, LASIK, PRK´s, are not available).
