             refraction;

          -  Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 0.20 logMAR (approx 20/30) or better in each
             eye with the study contact lenses.

          -  Has clear corneas and no active* ocular disease

          -  Appears to have any active* ocular pathology, ocular anomaly or severe insufficiency
             of lacrimal secretion (severe dry eye) that would affect the wearing of contact
             lenses;

          -  Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment (by verbal
             confirmation at the screening visit);
