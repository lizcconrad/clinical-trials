  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a public health challenge that includes a range of conditions including
      abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. The syndrome is associated
      with an increase in the risk of Cardiovascular disease and death. Curcumin is a very active
      compound obtained from turmeric root. Curcumin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects,
      and is also involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways. Since curcumin powder
      has low bioavailability, fast metabolism and low absorption, nanomicielle curcumin will be
      used in this study. Therefore, this study is planned to determine the effects of
      supplementation of nanomicielle curcumin on oxidative stress, systemic inflammation,
      adiponectin in serum and NF-kB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with
      metabolic syndrome.

Each subject will give informed written consent to participate in the study. 10 cc fasting blood samples will be collected from each subject at baseline and at the end of trial. Anthropometric parameters will be measured.In order to control the confounding factors in patients, they will be randomly assigned to receive either nanomicielle curcumin or placebo. nanomicielle curcumin and placebo supplements will be provided from the Elixir Nano Sina Company the patients will advise not to change their lifestyle during the study.</description>
