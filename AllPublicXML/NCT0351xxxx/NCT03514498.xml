  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As anesthesia is often needed for childhood surgery and procedures, researchers have examined
      the potential effects of anesthesia on neurodevelopment. There are few studies that have
      examined the effect of anesthesia on neurodevelopment in children with confirmed diagnoses of
      ASD, and the results of these studies are mixed. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders
      can have age-dependent variations in brain anatomy, function, and connectivity, which may
      alter their sensitivity to the potential neurotoxic effects of anesthetic and sedative drugs.
      Given the potential adverse neurodevelopmental effects of anesthesia on typically developing
      children, it is important to examine if anesthesia exposure can worsen the clinical course of
      ASD.

      We hypothesize that children with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD will regress developmentally
      following general anesthesia for dental surgery in comparison to children without ASD
      (controls) undergoing dental surgery. In this pilot study, we will investigate this
      hypothesis through the following objectives:

        1. to determine in a clinical study if anesthesia induces post-operative persistent adverse
           changes children with ASD as compared with typically developing controls;

        2. to determine the potential mechanism for the adverse effects of anesthetics on patients
           with ASD compared to healthy controls, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be
           isolated from blood samples (PBMCs), before genomic DNA isolation for mitochondrial
           content analysis.
