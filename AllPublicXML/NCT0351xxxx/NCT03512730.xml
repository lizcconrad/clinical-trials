      Objective:

      The objective of this study was to evaluate a new mechanical method (Ti-Brush, Straumann, AG,
      Basel, Switzerland) of implant surface decontamination.

      Material and methods:

      A randomized double-blinded controlled clinical trial with a 1-year follow-up it is being
      carried out. After a hygienic phase, defects were randomly assigned to a control (n=18) or to
      a test group (n=18). In control group, implant surface was decontaminated both mechanically
      and chemically with 3% H2O2 and plastic ultrasonic scalers, respectively, while in test group
      Ti-Brush was added. Infrabony defects in both groups were regenerated with BoneCeramic
      (Straumann, AG, Basel Switzerland) and collagen barrier membrane Cytoplast (Osteogenics,
      Lubbock, United States). Clinical and radiographic parameters were measured at baseline, 6,
      and 12 months after surgery.
