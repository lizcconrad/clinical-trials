      The objectives of this prospective, two-arm, multicenter post-market study is to confirm
      safety and performance through the incidence of subjects reporting serious adverse device
      effects (ADEs) up to and including 30 days following use of Signia™ Stapling System with Endo
      GIA™ with Tri-Staple™ Technology and Tri-Staple™ 2.0 Intelligent Reloads in subjects
      undergoing indicated abdominal or thoracic procedures for resection, transection and creation
      of anastomosis per the IFU.

      This study will evaluate the use of Signia™ Stapling System using Signia™ Intelligent Loading
      Units with Tri-Staple™ 2.0 Intelligent Reloads in indicated abdominal or thoracic procedures
      (e.g., resection, transection of tissue, and creation of anastomoses). Subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be considered for study participation at a minimum of 10 sites and
      will be followed up to and including 30 days post-operative. Overall the study is estimated
      to progress for up to 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults (male or female) between 22 and 80 years of age inclusive at the time of the
             procedure.

          2. The subject must be willing and able to participate in the study procedures and to
             understand and sign the informed consent.

          3. The subject is scheduled to undergo an indicated primary abdominal or thoracic
             procedure for resection, transection and creation of anastomosis per the IFU where the
             Signia™ Stapling System with Endo GIA™ with Tri-Staple™ Technology and Tri-Staple™ 2.0
             Intelligent Reloads will be used per its IFU.Additionally, if considered appropriate
             for the procedure only Medtronic buttresses can be used during the course of the
             study.

        3a. Thoracic procedures may include, but are not limited to wedge resection and lobectomy,
        and may include video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or open procedures.

        3b. Abdominal procedures may include, but are not limited to, laparoscopic sleeve
        gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects undergoing cardiac and vascular procedures.

          2. The procedure is an emergency procedure.

          3. The procedure is a revision/reoperation of a primary operation..

             those without sufficient mental capacity).

          6. The subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements or follow-up
             schedule.

          7. The subject has comorbidities which, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator,
             will not be appropriate for the study or the subject has an estimated life expectancy
             of less than 6 months.

          8. The subject has been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder and/or is undergoing active
             and not reversed anticoagulant treatment.

          9. The subject is concurrently enrolled in another investigational drug or device
