      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the range of improvement of NOVANUIT® triple action on sleep quality global
      score.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate the range of improvement of NOVANUIT® triple action on following parameters:
           time for getting asleep, sleep time, number of nocturnal awakening, number of
           nightmares, sleep quality (score from 0 to 10), and mean tiredness during the day (score
           from 0 to 10).

        -  To estimate persistency of NOVANUIT® triple action effects after end of study product
           consumption.

        -  To assess dependency to NOVANUIT® triple action after study product cessation.

        -  To assess tolerance of NOVANUIT® triple action during the study.
