  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, monocular trial evaluating the safety and
      effectiveness of the Bausch &amp; Lomb DVisc40 dispersive OVD compared to the Alcon VISCOAT®
      dispersive OVD when used in cataract surgery. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two
      treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (DVisc40:VISCOAT®).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be at least 45 years old and have a clinically documented diagnosis
             of age-related non-complicated cataract that is considered amenable to treatment with
             standard phacoemulsification cataract extraction and IOL implantation.

             2. The subject must have the capability to provide written informed consent on the
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved Informed Consent Form
             (ICF) and provide authorization as appropriate for local privacy regulations.

             3. The subject must be willing and able to return for all scheduled follow-up
             examinations through 90 days following surgery.

        Study #877 Protocol DVisc40 28JUL2017 V1.0 CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 53 4. The subject must
        have clear intraocular media other than the cataract in the operative eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. The subject has participated in any drug or device clinical investigation within 30
             days prior to entry into this study and/or during the period of study participation.

             2. The subject has any corneal pathology (e.g., significant scarring, guttata,
             inflammation, edema, dystrophy, etc.) in the operative eye.

             3. The subject has anterior segment pathology likely to increase the risk of an
             adverse outcome for phacoemulsification cataract surgery (e.g., pseudoexfoliation
             syndrome, synechiae, iris atrophy, inadequate dilation, shallow anterior chamber,
             traumatic cataract, lens subluxation) in the operative eye.

             4. The subject has any condition which prevents reliable specular microscopy in the
             operative eye.
