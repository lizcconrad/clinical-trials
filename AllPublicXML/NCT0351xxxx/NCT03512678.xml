  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light microscopy, which is based on century-old technology, remains a key indicator in drug
      efficacy testing performed in the context of clinical trials for monitoring existing
      antimalarial drugs or in the context of regulatory clinical trials for registration of new
      drugs. It is one of the main diagnostic methods for malaria diagnosis in general, as in an
      ideal setting it can provide low-cost accurate diagnosis, determine the density of parasites
      in the blood, and accurately differentiate between different malaria parasite species,
      characteristics vital to the implementation of global plans for drug efficacy monitoring.
      Malaria rapid tests (RDTs), while useful for rapid diagnosis and case management, do not
      provide information on the parasite density nor the species differentiation necessary for
      research and drug efficacy assessment. Microscopy therefore retains key advantages over a
      number of newer technologies, but its reliability is severely impeded by dependence on high
      technical competence of the human operators as well as availability of high quality equipment
      and reagents. Recent studies have demonstrated frequent poor specificity and sensitivity
      associated with manual microscopy diagnostics in operational conditions. These drawbacks
      constitute a major limiting factor to effective monitoring and preservation of vital
      anti-malarial medicines.

      Advances in digital microscopy performance and affordability have now opened the door to
      potentially significant improvements in the performance of malaria microscopy, overcoming
      serious deficiencies in current drug efficacy assessment, and more broadly in malaria
      diagnosis and management. Global Good (GG)/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory (IVL) sponsored
      by the Global Good Fund, has developed a microscope prototype consisting of low cost
      components to scan and capture images from Giemsa-stained thick blood films on slides. The
      captured images are analyzed with custom image analysis software developed at GG/IVL, using
      algorithms that are designed for automatic malaria diagnosis, without user input. Versions of
      a prototype of the device were first tested in field settings in Thailand in 2014-2015 at
      clinics operated by the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) and then again in 2016-2017. When
      compared to expert microscopy at SMRU, the performance of the device with respect to
      diagnostic sensitivity (87.8%), species identification (85.6% species correctly identified)
      and parasite density estimation (44% of estimates within +/-25% of reference microscopy
      result) corresponded to WHO Competence Level 2. The device and the accompanying image
      analysis algorithms have since been further developed and a new, third version of the
      prototype is now available for testing in diverse settings with varying malaria prevalence
      and user expertise.

      The primary purpose of this evaluation is to quantify the diagnostic performance of the
      EasyScan Go prototype in various field settings. The performance of the EasyScan Go prototype
      will be assessed by scanning of negative and positive slides with the EasyScan Go and
      comparing the results with expert microscopy. Plasmodium genus- and species-specific PCR will
      also be performed on samples collected at some sites as an additional confirmatory test for
      the detection of malaria parasites and their species if present. Testing by microscopy and
      EasyScan Go will be performed in field clinic settings on Giemsa-stained slides prepared from
      febrile patient blood collected from a finger-prick. Further work will be undertaken at the
      WWARN laboratory in Bangkok for data analyses and for quality assurance.

        The multi-centric evaluation is currently planned for implementation at relatively few
        sites/countries and the primary criteria for the selection of sites will be based on
        operational feasibility of the project, i.e., availability of resources to perform the
        study procedures, adequate expected numbers of malaria positive cases, etc.

        Potential sites in Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Congo, South Africa, Burkina Faso,
        Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Cambodia are being considered for the
        study.

        A minimum of 80 malaria cases confirmed by expert microscopy and a minimum of 80
        malaria-negative cases per study site.
