      The Collar Therapy Indicator (CoTI) (A device that is placed in collar around the neck
      resembling a turtle neck sweater collar with a wire and recording box) has been shown in a
      single small previously published experience to provide data regarding radioiodine exposure
      that correlates with conventional methods of measuring I-123 and I-131 uptakes after
      diagnostic dose administration and/or therapy for thyroid disorders. We hypothesize that the
      device's continuous measurement capability will permit more accurate estimates of radiation
      exposure to thyroid tissue than conventionally employed methods assessing fractional uptake
      at one or a few time points. It may also provide information about the extent of variability
      in the absorbed radiation dose among patients with thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. By
      providing more complete information about individual patient's exposures, it will facilitate
      more accurate estimation of the administered I-131 dose requirements for control of
      hyperthyroidism and thyroid remnant ablation while reducing the need for repeated visits to
      the clinic for dosimetry measurements. The aims of our project include the following: (1)To
      compare quantitative imaging-derived thyroid time activity curve to that obtained using the
      CoTI and to determine the extent to which there is variability in radiation dose predicted
      using conventional methods to that predicted from measurement of the full Time-Activity Curve
      (TAC).(2) Evaluate the uptake and clearance kinetics across the 5 patients in each category
      as proof of principle for a potential larger trial to investigate use of this device in
      optimizing the administered doses of radioactive iodine to achieve therapeutic goals while
      minimizing risks of comorbidities, such a post-radioiodine hypothyroidism in patients with
      Graves' disease.(3)Evaluate patient experience, convenience, and discomfort in using the CoTI
      device with a survey instrument.

    <textblock>
      Radioiodine treatment for thyroid disorders represented an early example of individualized
      medicine. Since its introduction 80 years ago, the therapeutic I-131 dosage has usually been
      tailored to individual patient requirements based on the uptake of a tracer radioiodine dose.
      Various techniques have been employed to estimate the administered dose of I-131 for optimal
      therapeutic benefit. Estimated exposure has typically been extrapolated from the results of
      activity measurements at one or two time points, e.g., at 4 and 24 hours. We now know that
      treatment of hyperthyroid Graves' disease with these methods lead to a 13-25% rate of failure
      to cure hyperthyroidism and a 46-80% rate of long-term hypothyroidism in cured patients.
      Similarly, such relatively crude dosimetry doubtless result in significant overtreatment in
      the case of remnant ablation for differentiated thyroid cancer.

      For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer requiring remnant ablation, the administered
      activity has, in most cases, been derived empirically, ranging between 30-100 mci. The high
      success rates in ablating remnant thyroid tissue implies that many patients are still treated
      with higher 131-I doses than required, with potential side effects, such as radiation
      sialadenitis.

      Pilot Study Rationale; Our overall objective is to provide the optimal dose to each patient.
      This study will apply a novel &quot;wearable&quot; radiation detection technology to determine
      continuous cervical measurements over days following tracer radioiodine administration will
      provide information that permits the tailoring of subsequent therapeutic radioiodine doses
      more precisely to improve clinical outcomes, as described above.

      The actual therapeutic dose decisions in this pilot trial, however, will not be based on the
      collar device measurements. Patients with Graves' disease will receive 180-200 µCi I-131 per
      gram of estimated gland mass based on the conventional method of dose calculation, based on a
      24-hour % uptake and gland volume. Most patients with thyroid cancer would receive the 30 mCi
      dose for remnant ablation prior to the placement of the COTI device, as per the American
      Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines.

      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This will be an unmasked prospective pilot study involving patients
      with Graves' disease (Group I) and differentiated thyroid cancer (Group II). Five patients in
      each group will have radiation activity measurements using the COTI devise. All persons in
      the study will receive 131-I treatment based on the current standards of care for dose
      estimation.

      Study Device; The CoTI has 3 components;

        -  A collar unit: a gamma detector wrapped around a body part-neck in this case and
           contains a scintillating crystal and a silicon photomultiplier. The photon pulse signal
           is then converted to digital signals (measuring the counts per second). Usually two
           detectors are placed in specified positions.

        -  A cable that connects the collar unit to the Control Unit

        -  A control unit that collects the signals and transmits it wirelessly to a hand-held
           computer tablet.

      Two types of collar devices will be used: the lower activity and the medium activity

        1. Lower activity collar for patients with Graves' disease as well as diagnostic I-123 scan
           in thyroid cancer patients. These patients typically receive 0.2-1.2 m Ci of
           I-123/I-131.

        2. Medium activity collar for Patients with thyroid cancer after 131-I ablation, for which
           patients typically receive 30-100 mci of I-131.

      Study Population;

        -  Group I: Patients with diffuse toxic goiter (Graves' disease) diagnosed clinically with
           no prior history of radioiodine treatment.

        -  Group II: Patients with differentiated epithelial thyroid cancer who are s/p total
           thyroidectomy and candidates for remnant ablation based on ATA guidelines.

      IRB approval and HIPPA regulations; Since it is a project involving a medical device which
      will be applied to the patients' neck, it will require the following;

        1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) regular approval.

        2. Registry into ClinicalTrials.gov.

        3. Appropriate forms and consent process for the patients. The recruitment of subjects for
           the study;

             -  Informed consent including the benefits and the risks of the Collar device (CoTI)
                will be obtained.

             -  Confidentiality agreement would be signed regarding the CoTI and its application.

             -  Demographic, clinical and tumor characteristics of the participants will be
                obtained, as outlined below.

             -  The instructions on the application CoTI will be provided in detail.

             -  Instructions regarding communication in the event of any difficulties will be
                provided.

      Preparation the patient;

        1. The patients will be prepared by general standards of care prior to CoTI placement. For
           patients with Graves' disease, any thionamide anti-thyroid meds will be stopped 3-5 days
           prior to I-123 diagnostic dose administration. After obtaining written consent, a venous
           blood sample will be obtained for work for requisite laboratory evaluation for baseline
           labs, as outlined below, and in women, for a pregnancy test. A (low activity) CoTI
           device will be placed under supervision and then adjusted for comfort and optimal
           activity measurement as a trial and then removed. Background activity of the patient, a
           phantom, and the device itself will be measured. After administration of I-123, an
           initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The CoTI device will then be placed and the
           patient will be asked to return to the clinic at scheduled imaging times for Group I.
           Anatomical localization of the CoTI in all patients will be standardized by pen
           markings.

        2. Patients with Graves' disease, who will be administered 200 µCi of I-131 and fitted with
           a low-activity CoTI device after administration of the dose. Background activity of the
           patient, a phantom and the device itself will be measured prior to placement of the
           device. After administration of I-131, an initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The
           CoTI device will then be placed and the patient will be asked to come back at scheduled
           imaging times for Group II. Anatomical localization for the CoTI for all patients will
           be standardized by markings.

        3. Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer will be placed on a low iodine diet for one
           week. Recombinant TSH will be administered on days 1 and 2 (typically Monday and
           Tuesday), and the diagnostic I-123 dosage will be administered on day 2. As per the
           protocol standard of care, the diagnostic whole-body scan is done on day 3 and the I-131
           dose for I-131 ablation (30-100 mci) is administered on day 4.

      After obtaining written consent, venous blood sample will be obtained for work for requisite
      laboratory evaluation for baseline labs as outlined below, including in women, a pregnancy
      test prior to the I-131 remnant ablation dose. The (medium activity) CoTI device will be
      placed under supervision and then adjusted for convenience as outlined above. Background
      activity of the patient, a phantom, and the device itself will be measured. After
      administration of I-131, an initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The CoTI device will
      then be placed and the patient will be asked to come back at scheduled imaging times for
      Group II. Anatomical localization for the CoTI for all patients will be standardized by
      markings.
