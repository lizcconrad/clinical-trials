    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of Horner's syndrome on cardiac autonomic nervous activity
      after interscalene brachial plexus block. Cardiac autonomic nervous activity and bilateral
      pupil diameters will be measured in a scotopic light condition, 30 minutes after interscalene
      brachial plexus block under ultrasound guidance.

      Stellate ganglia provide sympathetic fibers to the heart. Ipsilateral stellate ganglion block
      accompanied by interscalene brachial plexus block causes Horner's syndrome presenting with
      miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis. The extent of Horner's syndrome can be represented by the
      difference in pupil diameter between bilateral eyes. Cardiac autonomic nervous activity
      affected by stellate ganglion block can be measured by calculation of heart rate variability
      parameters.
