    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate QPI-1002 versus placebo for the prevention of Major
      Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE) in subjects at high risk for acute kidney injury following
      cardiac surgery. Half of the participants will receive QPI-1002 while the other half will
      receive placebo.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial to evaluate QPI-1002
      versus placebo for the prevention of Major Adverse Kidney Events in subjects at high risk for
      acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery. Subjects will be dosed with active drug or
      placebo after the completion of cardiovascular surgery.
