      This randomized, controlled, pilot experiment will evaluate the effects of an aerobic walking
      intervention on OIPN (oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy) in patients with colorectal
      cancer who are already prescribed FOLFOX by their oncologists. FOLFOX is a standard
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy treatment for stage II-III colorectal cancer that causes
      oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in 85-95% of patients.

      Background: Over 135,000 men and women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2017.
      FOLFOX is a standard oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy treatment for stage II-III colorectal
      cancer that causes oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in 85-95% of patients.
      Currently, OIPN is the primary dose-limiting factor of FOLFOX regimens, because persistent
      OIPN can impair physical function and quality of life (QOL) years after treatment completion.
      There are no effective treatments for OIPN. Four randomized controlled trials and two
      quasi-experiments have reported positive effects of at least 10 minutes/day of
      moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, 2-5 days/week over at least 6-8 weeks on
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Exercise-enhanced circulation could re-distribute
      neurotoxic drugs away from vulnerable neurons, reduce oxidative stress, and help to prevent
      OIPN. However, all the prior trials had critical study limitations and all but two studies
      evaluated OIPN as a secondary outcome. Thus, this prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot
      experiment will evaluate the efficacy of an aerobic walking intervention for OIPN in
      colorectal cancer patients who are already prescribed FOLFOX by their oncologists. The
      &quot;MI-Walk intervention&quot;— an 8-week motivational enhancement therapy (MET)- and home-based
      aerobic walking intervention—will be tested in this study.

      Specific aims: The specific aims and hypotheses are to:

      Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of the MI-Walk Intervention on OIPN severity at 8 weeks (T7)
      compared to physical activity (PA) education alone.

      Hypothesis: Participants who receive the MI-Walk intervention will exhibit less severe OIPN
      at T7 than participants who receive PA education alone.

      Aim 2: Explore the effect of the MI-Walk intervention on total oxaliplatin received, and QOL
      at T7 compared to PA education alone.

      Hypothesis: Participants who receive the MI-Walk intervention will receive higher total doses
      of oxaliplatin and report higher QOL at T7 than participants who receive PA education alone.

      Aim 3: Evaluate the feasibility of the MI-Walk intervention. Research Questions: Among
      patients receiving FOLFOX, 1) how acceptable is the intervention? 2) what percent of patients
      will enroll in, complete, and adhere to the walking intervention? 3) what participant
      characteristics are associated with study compliance, adherence, completion, and
      acceptability? 4) What, if any, adverse events will result from the MI-Walk intervention?

      Study design: Sixty colorectal cancer patients will be recruited at two cancer clinics up to
      two cycles after they have initiated FOLFOX treatment. All participants will receive a PA
      education pamphlet. Half (n=30) will receive the MI-Walk Intervention. These patients will
      receive a tailored progressive walking plan, supplemental cancer treatment &amp; exercise
      education, patient testimony, HR-enabled pedometer and PA-tracking app, exercise diary, and
      semi-scripted brief MET (motivational interviewing, SMAART goals, and if-then statements)
      from research staff before practicing the intervention at home for 8 weeks. Additional brief
      MET sessions at 2 (T4) and 4 weeks (T5), progress summaries at T4, T5, and T7, a private
      Facebook group, weekly group walking events, and peer accountability phone calls will be used
      to engage and support participants. To level attention, both groups will receive regular
      phone assessments of intervention-related adverse events at 1 week (T3), T4, T5, and 6 weeks
      (T6). Outcomes will be measured before chemotherapy (T1; about 4 weeks before intervention
      initiation) and at intervention completion (T7). The outcome measures include the 0-10 NRS of
      OIPN symptom severity (primary outcome measure); and EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 self-report survey,
      cumulative oxaliplatin dose, and EORTC QLQ-C30. The study will also record feasibility,
      adherence, acceptability, and intervention fidelity data. Multiple linear regression will be
      used to evaluate the inter-group differences in the T1 to T7 change in mean NRS scores
      (OIPNΔ), controlling for T7 total oxaliplatin received (OXALIT7), and the interaction between
      the intervention and OXALIT7. Mediation analysis will be used to explore the secondary
      outcomes.

      Future Directions: This study will be among the first to provide efficacy and feasibility
      data for an 8-week home-based aerobic walking intervention to reduce OIPN - a common
      chemotherapy side effect, for which there are no good treatments. This pilot study will
      inform the design of larger phase III trials to evaluate the efficacy of aerobic walking for
      OIPN, and potential mediators (e.g., vascular biomarkers) in this relationship.
