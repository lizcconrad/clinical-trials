  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show that patch augmentation in rotatorcuff tear results in lower
      rate of recurrent tendon defects compared without patches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is nowadays mostly implemented in order to restore
      function and reduce or eliminate pain. The primary objective of this randomized controlled
      trial is to demonstrate, in patients 60 years or older with a large rotator cuff tear, that
      biological or synthetic patch augmen-tation in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair results in
      decreased rate of retear 24 months post-operatively compared to re-pair without patch
      augmentation.

    <measure>Pain level (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pain level in the operated shoulder will be measured with a numeric rating scale (0=no pain, 10 = maximum pain) as part as the Constant Murley Score (CS)</description>

    <measure>Range of motion (flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation)</measure>
    <time_frame>6/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The following active and passive range of motion parameters of the affected shoulder will be documented using a goniometer : Elevation (flexion), abduction, External rotation by 0° abduction, external-internal rotation by 90° abduction</description>

    <measure>Constant Murley Score (CS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CMS is a 100-point scoring system that is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), range of motion (40 points) and strength (25 points).Pain and activities of daily living are self-reported by the patient using visual analog scales and ordinal categories. Range of motion is obtained during active painfree elevation in flexion and abduction (using a goniometer), and functional internal and external rotation of the shoulder (using ordinal scale). Strength testing was performed at 90° of abduction in the scapular plane.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Shoulder Score used after 3 months is the primary parameter. The Score tests the ability to participate in the patients' normal life before they got injured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective shoulder value (SSV)</measure>
    <time_frame>6/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) is based on a single question that is answered subjectively by the patients. The English formulation of this question is: &quot;What is the overall percent value of your shoulder if a completely normal shoulder represents 100%?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (utilities) and general health using EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>6/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective improvement, expectation, satisfaction with treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to assess their current state of health related to the operated shoulder at follow-up compared to the state before surgery. Further on A similar question will be asked regarding their perceived change in quality of life.At the 24-month follow-up questionnaire, patients will rate whether the surgical results met their expectations:</description>
