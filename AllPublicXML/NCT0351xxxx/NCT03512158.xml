    <textblock>
      Lungs of babies born early are not fully developed and they often need a machine to help them
      breathe. The traditional approach to provide this support is with a breathing tube passed
      into the windpipe. However, we know that breathing tubes can cause injury to the fragile
      lungs of premature babies. Providing breathing support through nose-masks instead of
      breathing tubes (called nasal breathing support) is becoming popular, as it is gentler on
      developing lungs. Doctors, in trying to limit the use of support with a breathing tube, are
      using many different forms of nasal breathing support. The most common form is nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which delivers a constant pressure and the baby
      breathes on his on her own. However, when this strategy is no longer able to support a
      premature baby's breathing, the best way to provide breathing support is not known. Some
      doctors use a strategy called &quot;nasal intermittent positive airway pressure&quot; (NIPPV) which
      gives the baby artificial breaths through the nose-mask. Others simply increase the pressure
      on nasal CPAP to higher than traditional levels. In the first study of its kind, we will
      compare these two strategies of nasal breathing support given to premature babies.

      BACKGROUND:

      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity of prematurity, and affects up
      to 40% of all preterm infants. It is independently associated with long term pulmonary and
      neurodevelopmental impairment, and confers a significant cost to society. Although
      development of BPD is multifactorial in nature, endotracheal mechanical ventilation (EMV) is
      known to be a significant contributor and strategies aimed at avoiding endotracheal
      mechanical ventilation may indeed reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

      Use of non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) has increased over the last decades in an
      effort to minimize dependence on endotracheal ventilation and reduce BPD in preterm neonates.
      Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) remains the prototypical form of NRS and is
      most commonly utilized. Another commonly used modality is non-invasive positive pressure
      ventilation (NIPPV) though it is often relegated as a &quot;rescue&quot; NRS mode following failure of
      NCPAP. NIPPV mimics tidal breathing by delivering &quot;breaths&quot; through a nasal interface at
      regular intervals, and results in higher mean airway pressures compared to NCPAP. Despite the
      increase in use of NRS and evidence from clinical studies demonstrating effectiveness in
      reducing BPD,results at a population level have been rather disappointing, with a recent
      report from the United States actually showing an increasing trend in BPD.

      In recent years, in an effort to further minimize dependence on endotracheal ventilation and
      BPD, some new strategies in NRS use are emerging. One of these approaches is the early use of
      NIPPV in place of NCPAP, rather than as a rescue mode after failure of NCPAP. Two recent
      Cochrane reviews have evaluated NIPPV as an alternative to NCPAP., and suggested superiority
      over NCPAP Based on these results, a number of NICUs have started utilizing NIPPV in place of
      NCPAP as the default NRS mode. However, there are a number of methodological limitations of
      studies that were included in these reviews. First, most studies did not allow for rescue use
      of NIPPV in the NCPAP arms, which is not representative of current clinical practice at most
      NICUs. Secondly, the mean airway pressures in NIPPV vs. NCPAP were vastly different, and the
      question remains whether it is truly the mechanism of NIPPV or simply higher mean airway
      pressure that leads to the superior outcomes reported. These limitations warrant
      consideration because most NIPPV use is not synchronized to patients' respiratory efforts,
      the optimal and safe peak pressures remain unknown.

      An alternative approach that has emerged in recent years is the use of high end-expiratory
      pressures (defined as pressures &gt; 8 cm H2O) on NCPAP. As of 2015, use of high NCPAP pressures
      had only been adopted at 5 out of 28 Canadian neonatal intensive care units (NICU), and
      McMaster Children's Hospital NICU is currently one of only few Canadian centres employing
      pressures &gt; 12 cm H2O on NCPAP. The reasons for the lack of widespread use of high
      end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP are unknown, but may relate to the theoretical concerns of
      altered systemic hemodynamics including impaired cardiac venous return, decreased venous
      drainage of the cerebral circulation as well as the potential for air leak syndromes such as
      pneumothoraces. On the other hand, such high end-expiratory pressures are very commonly and
      safely used during endotracheal mechanical ventilation, as well as during NIPPV. As such, the
      selective use of high end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP non-invasively may be quite
      appropriate. However, the use of high end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP is currently based on
      very limited evidence, and whether adopting this strategy leads to a meaningful decline in
      the dependence on endotracheal ventilation and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains unknown.
      In this study, we aim to comparatively evaluate use of NIPPV vs. high end-expiratory
      pressures (&gt; 8 cmH2O) on NCPAP after failure of NCPAP use at traditional pressures (≤ 8
      cmH2O) among preterm infants. This will be the first prospective clinical study to evaluate
      high end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP, and also the first to compare NIPPV and NCPAP at
      equivalent mean airway pressures. If high NCPAP is shown to be as effective and safe as
      NIPPV, it will lead to a significant advancement in the understanding of NRS and the
      respiratory management of extremely preterm neonates.

      OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS:

      To determine the feasibility of the conduct of a larger and definitive trial comparing two
      NRS strategies (NIPPV vs. high NCPAP pressures) in preterm infants. An additional objective
      is to assess safety of high NCPAP with respect to hemodynamics by way of non-invasive
      assessment of regional cerebral and renal perfusion. We hypothesize that a definitive trial
      of high end-expiratory pressures during NRS to assess clinical outcomes will be feasible, and
      that high NCPAP will preserve regional cerebral and renal perfusion as compared to NIPPV use.

      METHODS:

      Parents of all patients with gestational age &lt; 29 weeks who do not meet any of the exclusion
      criteria and are currently on respiratory support with either EMV or NCPAP ≤ 8 cmH2O will be
      approached for consent by the research assistant at the earliest opportunity. Consent will be
      sought within the first 7 days. Subjects whose parents provide consent AFTER 7 days, but for
      whom high NCPAP or NIPPV has not previously/currently employed will still be eligible. A
      subject for whom consent is obtained from the parents will be considered an &quot;enrolled
      subject&quot;. The research assistant will be responsible for indicating this by placing a
      laminated card at the bedside, and informing both the medical and respiratory therapy teams.
      An enrolled subject who is currently on EMV may only be extubated to NCPAP ≤ 8 cmH2O.

      Some enrolled subjects may not ever need NRS support beyond NCPAP 8 cmH2O, and as such will
      not be randomized into either study arm. On the other hand, enrolled subjects who meet NRS
      failure criteria despite NCPAP 8 cmH2O, as determined by the medical team, will be eligible
      for randomization to either high CPAP &gt; 8 cmH2O (experimental arm) or NIPPV (control arm).
      Once NRS failure criteria (indicated on bedside laminated card) and randomization eligibility
      is confirmed, the next sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelope (stored in a locked
      cabinet in the respiratory therapy office) indicating the randomization arm will be opened by
      the respiratory therapist caring for the subject. An enrolled subject who gets randomized to
      one of the two arms will be considered a &quot;randomized subject&quot;. A study initiation form
      (stored in respiratory therapy office) will be completed by the medical team, and a new
      laminated card indicating arm of randomization and extubation criteria will replace the
      enrollment card. This form will include demographic data about the subject, the NRS failure
      criteria that was met which led to randomization, and the suspected underlying
      pathophysiological mechanism for NRS failure.

      Guidelines for initiation and recommended increments of both high CPAP and NIPPV will be
      provided, with a view towards maintaining similar mean airway pressures between the two modes
      (which will also be placed at patient bedside in randomized subjects). Given the existing
      variability of practice in NRS application and lack of evidence-based guidelines, the
      strategies will not provide guidance with regards to day-to-day changes in settings or
      modalities, but rather provide only ceiling limits and maximum allowed pressures for each NRS
      mode. Of note, the maximum recommended settings for each NRS mode need not be reached before
      decision to intubate a subject, at the medical team's discretion - but intubation criteria
      must be met and documented at time of intubation. Furthermore, the NRS strategy corresponding
      to the randomization arm reflects use of NRS at any and all times after randomization until a
      randomized subject is discharged or transferred. The decision to wean down to traditional
      NCPAP levels from either arm will be at discretion of the medical team. Finally, subjects
      randomized to a particular strategy will not be allowed to cross-over to the other arm until
      the first intubation. Patients may be pulled out from the study protocol only at the
      discretion of the attending medical physician following the first intubation, and the reason
      must be discussed in advance with the PI (A.M.). A customized protocol violation form will
      then be completed by the attending physician, facilitated by the research assistant.

      Assessment of cerebral and renal regional perfusion will be performed using near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) for all subjects at time of randomization. At the time an enrolled
      subject meets NRS failure criteria, the NIRS leads will be placed and recording will be
      initiated. Perfusion will be assessed immediately prior to and continuously for up to 7 days
      post-randomization (or intubation if sooner that 7 days). This will be conducted by the
      research assistant during office hours and the respiratory therapist at night.

      At the end of the study period, relevant demographic data and outcome variables for all
      randomized subjects will be extracted from the local Canadian Neonatal Network (CNN) database
      and from patient charts/electronic records by the research coordinator using a customized
      data collection form. Demographic data will also be gathered on enrolled patients not
      ultimately randomized to identify systematic differences between the two groups (i.e.
      &quot;enrolled and not randomized&quot; vs. &quot;enrolled and randomized&quot;) that will allow for better
      targeting of patient population for larger, definitive trial.

      DATA ANALYSIS, STATISTICS AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS

      All randomized patients will be analyzed using intention-to-treat principle. Mean (SD) or
      Median (IQR) will be reported for continuous variables depending on normality of data, and
      percentages will be reported for categorical variables. T-test (or Wilcoxon rank sum test for
      non-normally distributed variables) and Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test as
      appropriate) will be used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
      Regional perfusion data using NIRS will be compared within each randomization arm
      (immediately prior to and 2 hours post-randomization) as well as between the two
      randomization arms 2 hours-post-randomization using paired t-test and unpaired t-tests,
      respectively. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4.

      With respect to the feasibility of a larger and definitive clinical trial, a convenience
      sample of 40 subjects (20 in each arm) will be chosen. With respect to the co-primary outcome
      of cerebral and renal regional perfusion - considering an average value of 75% (with standard
      deviation 10%) from literature on normative values in neonates,(18-20) this sample size will
      readily allow us to detect a clinically meaningful difference of at least 10%. For
      between-group difference 16 x 2 = 32 subjects will provide a power of 0.80 at alpha of 0.05,
      and for within group difference 11 subjects in each arm will provide a power of 0.90 at alpha
      of 0.05 for each comparison (pre- and post-randomization, as well as pre- and
      post-escalation).
