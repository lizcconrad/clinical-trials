  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled phase II trial will investigate whether the addition of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy to checkpoint inhibitor treatment in patients with
      non-small-cell lung carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma or
      head-and-neck carcinoma can improve progression-free survival as compared to checkpoint
      inhibitor monotherapy. The primary outcome is progression-free survival; secondary outcomes
      include overall survival, response according to iRecist and Recist v1.1 and toxicity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             ICH/GCP and national/local regulations.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumour.

          -  At least one tumour lesion available for radiotherapy administration.

          -  Patient will receive a checkpoint inhibitor per standard of care in one of the
             following settings (locally advanced or metastatic): melanoma (1st - 3rd line
             nivolumab or pembrolizumab); renal cell carcinoma (2nd line nivolumab); non-small cell
             lung carcinoma (2nd or 3rd line nivolumab or pembrolizumab); urothelial cell carcinoma
             ( 1st or 2nd line nivolumab or pembrolizumab); head-&amp; neck squamous cell carcinoma
             (2nd line nivolumab).

          -  Karnofsky Performance status &gt; 60

          -  Age 18 years or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiotherapy preventing treatment with SBRT.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer or
             prostate cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy and with normalized
             PSA.

          -  Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline (controlled =
             previously-treated CNS metastases (surgery Â± radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or gamma
             knife) and who meet both of the following criteria: a) are asymptomatic and b) have no
             requirement for steroids or enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants), and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C
             infection.

          -  Mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope and
             possible consequences of the study.

          -  Patient not likely to comply with the protocol; I.e. uncooperative attitude, inability
             to return for follow-up visits and unlikely to complete the study.

          -  Contraindication for radiotherapy.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of
             study medication.
