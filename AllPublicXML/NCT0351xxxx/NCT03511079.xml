  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music has often been used in hospitals as a therapy but there is a limited amount of research
      looking at how music actually affects the different molecules in the body, such as cortisol
      (a marker of stress). There is especially a lack of research in the context of surgery. The
      hope is that this study will show that music can be used to minimize some of the side effects
      related to breast surgery and improve the patient experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In medical practice, an ideal therapy should have maximal benefit with minimal risk. While
      considerable effort is being placed into discovering more effective pharmaceuticals, there is
      a growing field of interest in alternative therapies. In the 1970's, George Engle put forward
      the idea of the biopsychosocial response in which the patient's social and psychological
      factors can influence the body's biologic function and vice versa. One such potential therapy
      that could work by this mechanism is music. Advantages of music include low cost,
      availability, no required expertise, and minimal side effects. Studies have shown that music
      leads to reduced postoperative pain, anxiety, and analgesic needs in surgical patients. It
      has also been shown that patient selected music has greater outcomes than researcher selected
      music. While there is a significant body of literature on changes in clinical measurements,
      there are only two studies known to us which try to examine the effects of music on a
      molecular level, measuring cortisol and blood glucose respectively. Neither of these studies
      have been performed in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer.

      On the other hand, considerable research is currently being conducted to determine biomarkers
      in the context of surgery that are associated with poor outcomes, especially in the context
      of breast surgery. Stress, usually associated with cortisol levels, has been associated with
      increased sleep disruption, increased metabolism, increased risk of thromboembolic events,
      and impaired wound healing in patients. In breast cancer patients, it has been found that
      C-reactive protein levels correlated in fatigue postoperatively and decreased diurnal
      variation in cortisol has been associated with depression. Melatonin, in general, is a marker
      for circadian rhythm and would also be representative of sleep disruption. C-reactive protein
      is primarily a marker of inflammation which in turn is associated with disease progression
      and poorer clinical outcomes in breast surgery patients.

      This study aims to determine both if music affects molecular mechanisms through measurement
      of clinical biomarkers as well as if there is an association with significant quality of life
      measures. A positive association could provide evidence into music being used as an adjunct
      therapy peri-operatively.

    <measure>Change in Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will be given three days prior to surgery and seven days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using select questions from the BREAST-Q model. The individual pain items will be measured on a 5 point Likert scale as follows:
= None of the time
= A little of the time
= Some of the time
= Most of the time
= All of the time
Total summed scores range from 12 to 60 in breast conserving modules and 16 to 80 for mastectomy modules. Higher scores are representative of more pain experienced by the patient.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>The scale will given three days prior to surgery and seven days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness scale. The KSS is a 9-point Likert scale often used when conducting studies involving self-reported, subjective assessment of an individual's level of drowsiness at the time. The KSS Scores are defined as follows:
9. Extremely sleepy, fighting sleep 8. Sleepy, some effort to keep alert 7. Sleepy, but no difficulty remaining awake 6. Some signs of sleepiness 5. Neither alert nor sleepy 4. Rather alert 3. Alert 2. Very alert
1. Extremely alert
Higher values indicate a higher level of drowsiness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire will be given three days prior to surgery and seven days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. The CES-D scale is a 20-item measure that measures how often over the past week one has experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely.
Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Total summed scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>
