  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of automated reminders for the 6 month and 12 month vaccine
      visits to increase vaccination in parents experiencing logistic barriers to vaccination.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children less than 11 months of age will be identified as delayed or missing
      vaccinations due to logistic barriers in the Kaiser Permanente Colorado population. Parents
      identified will be randomized to the intervention arm or the usual care arm. Those in the
      intervention arm will receive automated reminders for the 6 month and 12 month vaccine
      visits. Reminders will include scheduling information as well as access to a website with
      vaccine and scheduling information. They will also have an opportunity to provide preferences
      in how they receive the automated reminders (text, phone or email). There will be 2 reminders
      before the 6 and 12 month visits and 2 after the 6 and 12 month visits. Parents will be
      excluded from receiving reminders if they have received vaccines within the time frame when
      they are eligible to receive another vaccine or have a well child visit scheduled.

    <description>Parents will receive usual care for their child at Kaiser Permanente Colorado. This includes recommendations for well child visits at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age as well as automated reminders for age eligible children to receive the flu shot during flu season.</description>

    <description>Parents randomized to the reminder arm will receive automated reminders to complete a 6 month and 12 month vaccine visit for their child. They will receive 2 reminders before the child is 6 and 12 months of age and 2 reminders after their child is 6 and 12 months of age. Reminders will not occur if they have received vaccines within the eligible time frame to receive a vaccine or have a visit scheduled. After randomization, participants in the intervention arm will have an opportunity to provide their preference on how they receive reminders (text, phone and/or email). Participants not providing a preference will receive text reminders. If a child is randomized into the study after the child is 7 months of age, the parent will only be eligible for reminders for the 12 month vaccine visit.</description>
