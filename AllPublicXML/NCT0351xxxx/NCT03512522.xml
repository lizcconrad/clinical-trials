  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well documented that severe pain is more common in older adults than it is younger
      persons. Of concern, older adults may not have access to traditional face-to-face
      self-management programs, which are recognized to be valuable in chronic pain management.
      Access to effective self-management approaches is particularly important for older adults who
      may have mobility limitations or live in remote areas, or have difficulty accessing health
      care services. The development of effective pain self-management programs for older adults
      who cannot access traditional psychological interventions is of significant importance.
      Internet self-management programs have the potential to address pain undermanagement. As
      technology advances, the digital divide between the older and younger demographic continues
      to progress. Given the known difficulties with treatment access, the purpose of this study is
      to explore the efficacy and acceptability of a remotely-delivered chronic pain
      self-management program tailored to older adults, the Pain Course, when delivered in online
      and workbook formats. The program was previously shown to be effective among younger persons
      but has not been tested with older adults.

      The program is delivered through a secure platform administered by the Online Therapy Unit
      for Service Education and Research at the University of Regina. Using a patient preference
      randomized control trial (RCT) design, participants (n = 120) will be enrolled in either the
      online group or workbook group, or to a wait list control group. The content of both programs
      will be identical and contain 5 core lessons, which participants will be encouraged to work
      through over an 8-week period. By exploring the efficacy of an online vs. workbook group, the
      results from this study may serve as a stepping-stone for improved self-management of chronic
      pain in older adults.

      A patient preference randomized controlled trial (RCT) was chosen for this study. The goal is
      to have most participants accept randomization by emphasizing they are equally acceptable, so
      only those with a very strong preference or no access to Internet aren't randomized.
      According to the preliminary power analysis, a total of 120 participants will be randomly
      assigned to be enrolled in the online group or workbook group, or be placed on a twelve-week
      wait list control, which will serve as a control group to control for the influence of time
      on symptom change between groups.
