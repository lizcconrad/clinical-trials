  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the outcomes of children who
      received an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis when they were toddlers. The study is
      interested in whether an early diagnosis can help children with their cognitive, language,
      social, and behavioral abilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in
      domains of social communication and restrictive and repetitive behavior. There is general
      agreement, in light of knowledge around optimal periods of neural plasticity, that ASD should
      be diagnosed as early as possible since young toddlers are at a critical stage in early
      development when intervention is theoretically most effective. The rate of persistence of an
      ASD diagnosis is heavily debated.Therefore this study attempts:

        1. To determine the rate of persistence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis and
           functional outcomes, as defined by cognitive level, adaptive functioning, language
           skills, persistence of ASD symptoms, and classroom placement at kindergarten age, among
           children who received a DSM-5 ASD diagnosis at &lt; 36 months.

        2. To evaluate predictors of rate of persistence and functional outcomes among kindergarten
           grade level children ages 5-7 years, who received an ASD diagnosis as toddlers.
