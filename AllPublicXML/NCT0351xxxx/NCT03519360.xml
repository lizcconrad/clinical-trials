  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of trials that change the dialysis
      ultrafiltration rate (UFR) by limiting the maximum rate and to estimate the extent to which
      limiting the ultrafiltration rate reduces the risk of abnormal heart rhythms in people with
      kidney failure who are being treated with chronic hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within four weeks of consent, subjects will have an Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR)
      (Medtronic LINQ) device implanted. Subjects will be given a transmitter/charger and a Patient
      Care Assistant which they will be required to keep for the duration of their participation in
      the study. ILR tracings will be uploaded automatically and reviewed by the study team for the
      occurrence of clinically significant arrhythmia.

      Following ILR implantation, subjects will alternate between weekly periods in which the
      ultrafiltration rate can be unlimited or in which the ultrafiltration rate is limited to
      ≤10mL/kg/hour.

    <measure>Change in duration of clinically significant arrhythmia (CSA) per month</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total monthly duration of CSA (in minutes) will be utilized as the primary efficacy endpoint in comparing this pair of interventions (aggressive vs. conservative UF). In the event of incomplete follow-up, CSA duration will be indexed to follow-up time. CSA will be defined on the basis of arrhythmias likely to lead to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or serious morbidity and mortality and will include AF, asystole ≥3 seconds, bradycardia ≤40 beats per minute lasting ≥6 seconds, and sustained VT ≥130 beats per minute lasting ≥30 seconds. CSA's will be adjudicated by study electrophysiologists.</description>

    <description>The percent of screened patients enrolled will be calculated as a secondary feasibility measure to assess the size of the necessary screening pool. Reasons for non-enrollment (vis-à-vis inclusion and exclusion criteria and patient and physician preferences) will be assessed to determine the potential for protocol modification to improve recruitment.</description>
