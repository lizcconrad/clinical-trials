      The phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of panitumumab-IRDye800 in
      diagnosing participants with malignant glioma who undergo surgery. Panitumumab-IRDye800 can
      attach to tumor cells and make them more visible using a special camera during surgery, which
      may help surgeons better distinguish tumor cells from normal brain tissue and identify small
      tumors that cannot be seen using current imaging methods.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine/verify the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of panitumumab conjugated to the
      optical dye IRDye800CW (panitumumab-IRDye800), as an imaging agent in patients undergoing
      surgery for malignant glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 in identifying malignant glioma compared to
      surrounding normal central nervous system tissue.

      II. Determine whether a loading dose of panitumumab is necessary to achieve an effective
      tumor-to-background ratio.

      III. Determine the optimal timing of the surgical procedure to maximize the
      tumor-to-background ratio.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase
      II study. Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A (Cohorts 1a, 2a, &amp; 3): Participants receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on day 0, and following a 15-minute observation period, receive panitumumab-IRDye800
      IV over 60 minutes. Participants then undergo near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) imaging during
      standard of care surgery 1-5 days after receiving panitumumab-IRDye800.

      GROUP B (Cohorts 1b and 2b): Participants receive panitumumab-IRDye800 IV over 60 minutes on
      day 0. Participants then undergo NIR imaging as in Group A.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up on day 15 and then again on
      day 30.

    <description>Descriptive statistical analysis of subject disposition, baseline characteristics, exposure to study drug, and adverse events will be performed.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Panitumumab Loading Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The fluorescence intensity of tissue obtained from patients undergoing surgery will be evaluated as an indicator of whether or not the loading dose of panitumumab is necessary to achieve an effective tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The Fluorescence intensity of tissue will be assessed on the specimens collected on the day of surgery (Day 1-5 Post infusion), in group a vs group b, for Cohorts 1 and 2, in order to determine the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The outcome will be expressed as TBR by group and cohort. TBR will be reported as means +/- STD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal Timing of Surgical Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The fluorescence intensity of tissue collected at surgery will be measured 1 to 5 days after infusion, and the outcome will be assessed as highest daily mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), with standard deviation. The tissue analysis to obtain the outcome data will occur within 1 year from surgery.</description>
