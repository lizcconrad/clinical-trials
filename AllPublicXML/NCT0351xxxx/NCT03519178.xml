  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics and clinical activity study of PF-06873600 administered
      as a single agent and then in combination with endocrine therapy. The study contains two
      parts, a Part 1 single agent dose escalation and combination endocrine therapy dose finding
      component and a Part 2 dose expansion as both a single agent and in combination with
      endocrine therapy.

      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of PF-06873600 administered as a
      single agent in sequential dose levels and then in combination with endocrine therapy. In
      Part 1A, successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of PF-06873600 and then
      in dose finding (Part 1B) with PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (ET). This
      study contains 2 parts, dose escalation with single agent (Part 1A) and then dose finding
      with PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (Part 1B) followed by dose expansion
      arms as a single agent and PF-06873600 in combination with endocrine therapy (Part 2).
