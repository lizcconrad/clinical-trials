  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerance of intravenous milrinone combined to the
      current standard treatment for cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
      Assessment of IV milrinone safety in this setting is mandatory before the conduction of a
      large study assessing its effectiveness.

      The aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the hemodynamic tolerance of
      intravenous milrinone for the treatment of arterial vasospasm following subarachnoid
      hemorrhage. Intravenous milrinone is part of our standard care protocol for the management of
      cerebral vasospasm in association with nimodipine (intravenous or enteral route) and high
      arterial blood pressure (mean arterial pressure of 100-120 mmHg, spontaneously or induced by
      volume expansion and norepinephrine). All patients of our ICU who were diagnosed with
      cerebral arterial vasospasm during the few days following a subarachnoid hemorrhage will be
      included.

    <time_frame>At 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A good hemodynamic tolerance is defined by a stable mean blood pressure of 100-120 mmHg without neither the need to decrease milrinone infusion rate below 0.5 g.kg-1.min-1 nor the need to increase norepinephrine above 1g.kg-1.min-1 Safety Issue: No</description>

    <time_frame>Rhythmic tolerance will be assessed for the duration of treatment, which will be on average one month.Heart rate and rhythm will be measured continuously, but assessed for fluctuation outside the reference range daily (during the length of treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Rhythmic intolerance is defined by the occurrence of arrhythmia prompting the initiation of an antiarrhythmic medication and the need to decrease or even to stop the infusion of milrinone Safety Issue: No</description>

    <measure>Hematological tolerance: will be considered good if milrinone infusion was not interrupted</measure>
    <time_frame>Hematological tolerance will be assessed daily through measuring platelet count for the duration of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Hematological tolerance will be considered good if milrinone infusion was not interrupted owing to the occurrence of thrombocytopenia Safety Issue: No</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Milrinone efficiency on cerebral vasospasm</measure>
    <time_frame>Milrinone efficiency on cerebral vasospasm will be assessed for the duration of treatment, which will be on average one month. Mean velocity and the lindegard index will be initially measured at 0, 2, 12 and 24 hours; and subsequently daily.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using ultrasound measurements of middle cerebral arteries velocities. A decrease of at least 20% of the mean velocity or of the Lindegaard index will be considered as a significant positive effect of the treatment (including milrinone).

Able to take care of his own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities, 3 = Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted, 4 = Moderate severe disability. Unable to meet their own physical needs without help and unable to walk without help, 5 Severe disability.
