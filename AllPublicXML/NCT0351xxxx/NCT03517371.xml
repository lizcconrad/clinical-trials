  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identifying effective ways to improve function, slow decline and reduce disability is a high
      priority for people living with Parkinson disease and other chronic conditions. Regular
      participation in walking is essential to reduce disability and enhance participation in
      preferred life activities. However, people with chronic conditions are often sedentary,
      contributing to greater disability. The goal of this work is to determine the benefits of a
      walking, walking enhancing exercises and cognitive-behavioral strategies delivered using
      mobile health technology for people with Parkinson disease over a sustained period of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most disabling chronic health conditions affecting older
      adults globally. While advances in medical and surgical management of PD have increased
      lifespans, these have not effectively altered the progressive decline in physical function
      and quality of life associated with PD. Identifying effective ways to improve function, slow
      decline and prevent or reduce disability remains of utmost importance in PD. Of particular
      concern in PD is gait decline, which is considered a red flag signaling emerging disability.
      Prior work has shown that people with PD experienced a 12% decline in amount of walking over
      one year - despite relative stability of motor impairments during that year. Treatment
      targeting walking, the most rapidly changing aspect of disability in PD, may have the
      greatest influence on slowing the impact of disease progression on physical function and
      reducing disability.

      Traditionally, rehabilitation has targeted impairments and functional limitations with the
      expectation that gains would translate into greater participation in real-world activities.
      However, the evidence suggests that this does not occur. In this proposal, the investigators
      suggest a paradigm shift in which the primary target of the intervention is real-world
      walking behavior, as greater walking activity could preserve walking function and slow
      disability. The primary factors that limit engagement in walking in PD are psychological
      (e.g., low self-efficacy) rather than physical (e.g., motor impairments) in nature. As such,
      investigators will evaluate a cognitive-behavioral approach, grounded in social-cognitive
      theory and targeted at enhancing walking activity. This &quot;connected behavioral approach&quot; links
      physical therapists to persons with PD using a mobile health (mHealth) platform to deliver
      strategies to increase self-efficacy and provide goal-oriented, dynamic walking routines and
      walking enhancing exercises over one year. This approach will be compared to a control
      intervention which provides equivalent components and dosing of walking and a walking
      enhancing exercise program delivered by physical therapists but without a
      cognitive-behavioral mHealth approach. Investigators hypothesize that the mHealth group will
      demonstrate higher amounts of walking activity and greater walking capacity relative to the
      control group. With regard to mechanism underlying improvements in the mHealth group, it is
      hypothesized that self-efficacy will mediate changes in amount of walking and that changes in
      amount of walking will mediate changes in walking capacity over one year. The insights to be
      gained regarding mechanisms underlying changes noted will be critical to inform
      rehabilitation interventions designed to encourage sustained, long-term physical activity. If
      effective, our &quot;connected behavioral approach&quot; offers a unique, generalizable and scalable
      means to increase walking activity and improve walking capacity, thereby reducing disability
      in PD and perhaps in other chronic progressive conditions.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will take place at Boston University (BU) and Washington University in St. Louis (WU). This is a two-arm, single-blinded, 1-year randomized controlled trial. Persons with mild to moderate PD are randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms. In the mHealth arm, individuals participate in a cognitive-behavioral community-based walking program plus home-based walking enhancing progressive resistance exercises delivered using a mobile health platform. The active control condition receives the same components and dose of walking and exercise but without a cognitive-behavioral approach or the use of mobile health technology.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants in the mHealth delivered exercise program have up to 10 in-person visits with a physical therapist over 12 months. The mHealth exercise program, consisting of walking, strengthening and stretching exercises, is prescribed and remotely adapted by a physical therapist over 1 year. Approximately 5-7 exercises are implemented 5 days per week. The exercise program is video-recorded and accessed on a smartphone or computer tablet via an application (&quot;app&quot;). Cognitive-behavioral elements are integrated emphasizing participant engagement in managing their health condition. Components of the mHealth program include goal setting, action planning, automated rewards, self-monitoring of progress and a remote connection to a physical therapist through a messaging feature.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group have up to 10 in-person visits with a physical therapist over 12-months - equivalent to the dose provided to the mHealth condition. Participants are instructed by the physical therapist to engage in walking and perform the same progressive resistance and stretching exercises (tailored to their needs and provided in written format) at the same frequency (5x/week) as participants in the mHealth condition. Participants in the control condition are instructed to gradually progress their exercise program and to increase the amount of walking over a 1-year period. No cognitive-behavioral approaches or mHealth technology will be provided.</description>
