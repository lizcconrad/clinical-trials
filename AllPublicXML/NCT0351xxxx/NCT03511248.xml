    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of inorganic dietary nitrate to the optimal treatment of
      patients diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Some vegetables contain
      large amounts of inorganic nitrate, and research suggests that this nitrate has beneficial
      effects on the heart and blood vessels. We have shown in lab experiments that nitrate has
      positive effects on the heart. We wish to test whether dietary nitrate might be useful in
      halting deterioration and/or improving heart function in patients with heart failure, with a
      specific focus on a marker of poor outcome in heart failure: high uric acid levels. Half of
      the patients will receive nitrate-rich beetroot juice, and the other half a nitrate-deplete
      placebo beetroot juice.

    <textblock>
      Background: Heart failure (HF) affects 1-2% of those under 70 years, and 10-20% of those over
      70 years in developed countries; approximately 900,000 people in the UK suffer with HF.
      Despite several promising pre-clinical targets, clinical translation has been disappointing,
      with very few successful phase 3 studies of new HF therapeutics. Dysfunction of the classical
      pathways that underlie endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, with deficient cardiac
      constitutive NO supply, are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of HF. It has
      been mooted that novel strategies that replace/restore this diminished NO have therapeutic
      potential.

      The organic nitrates, as a method of NO delivery, provide an efficacious treatment in the
      acute HF setting. However, the development of tolerance, tachyphylaxis, and endothelial
      dysfunction with long-term use severely limits their utility in chronic heart disease.
      Alternative methods for sustained NO delivery without tolerance are therefore of interest.

      Recent clinical research demonstrates that inorganic nitrate offers this possibility through
      sequential chemical reduction, first via the enterosalivary circuit to nitrite, and
      subsequently from nitrite to NO. In particular, pre-clinical research suggests that delivery
      of NO via this pathway imparts benefit in HF models. Dietary inorganic nitrate is known to
      provide a safe and non-invasive method to elevate NO in humans, and a once daily dose
      (5-6mmol), in the form of a beetroot juice, can improve vascular function and reduce blood
      pressure in hypertensives.

      Inorganic nitrate as a HF treatment is particularly exciting since a key pathway involved in
      the generation of NO from nitrate is xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR); an enzyme upregulated in
      HF. Conventionally, XOR is considered detrimental as it generates superoxide and uric acid;
      both exert negative effects on cardiac function, and are associated with worse outcomes in
      HF. However, XOR also plays an important role in the second step of nitrate bioactivation:
      conversion of nitrite to NO in the heart. Importantly, we have hypothesised that in an
      environment of elevated XOR activity, such as HF, delivery of inorganic nitrate to the body
      would result in reductions in superoxide/uric acid with concomitant elevations in NO. This
      might prove more efficacious than simply inhibiting the enzyme using classical inhibitors.
      Importantly, a recent study (EXACT-HF) has shown a trend for reduced HF re-hospitalisations
      in those with XOR inhibition via allopurinol; it has been suggested that greater benefits
      might be seen if these effects are coupled with NO delivery.

      Research Hypothesis and Aims: We aim to investigate whether dietary inorganic nitrate
      provides benefit in patients with HF. We will determine whether inorganic nitrate delivery by
      elevating nitrite, delivers substrate to XOR resulting in a two-fold benefit: increasing NO
      production, whilst concomitantly reducing superoxide and uric acid levels.

      Plan of Investigation: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel two-limb study
      in New York Heart Association (NHYA) class II-III HF patients. Patients with left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% and elevated NT-proBNP/ BNP levels will be enrolled and
      stratified by degree of hyperuricaemia. 92-patients will receive a once daily dose of
      nitrate-rich beetroot juice (versus nitrate-deplete beetroot juice) for 12-weeks. The study
      is powered for significant reductions in hyperuricaemia. Powered secondary outcomes include
      circulating nitrite/nitrate levels, nitrite reductase activity, and a difference in LVEF from
      baseline by cardiac MRI. A number of mechanistic exploratory outcomes will also be reported,
      including assessments of oxidative stress, erythrocytic XOR activity, 6-minute walk test,
      quality of life questionnaire and levels of NT-proBNP/BNP as surrogate measures of cardiac
      dysfunction.

      Benefits: This trial if positive will identify a new, safe and easy-to-deliver therapeutic
      option for HF patients. The NHS would benefit by providing a new inexpensive pharmacotherapy
      for a disease with significant unmet need and increasing burden to the health service.

    <description>The placebo control is an identical juice from which the nitrate anion has been removed using a standard anion exchange resin. Visually there is no detectable difference between the juices and previous spectral, ion concentration, sugar levels, ascorbate analysis and taste testing has confirmed no differences in colour and constituents. The process to extract nitrate from the juice is the same technique used to remove inorganic nitrate from general drinking water supplies, and has been approved for use by Ethics Committees. The nitrate-free juice is not considered a drug or medicine, and is classified as a foodstuff.</description>

                    -  hospitalisation within 12 months: NT-proBNP &gt;400pg/mL and BNP &gt;100pg/mL

          3. NYHA Class II-III symptoms

          4. On optimally-tolerated, stable (&gt;12 weeks) prognostic medical therapy (beta-blocker,

          6. Clinic systolic blood pressure ≥110mmHg

          7. Able and willing to give written informed consent

        The intervention with dietary nitrate is intentionally designed to be in addition to the

        supplements or prescription medications, other than those listed in the exclusion criteria
        below.

             such mouthcare for at least one month prior to entering the study, and for the
             duration of the trial) as this interrupts the enterosalivary circuit and thus prevents
             the bioactivity of nitrate

          2. History of recurrent symptomatic gout or current treatment with xanthine oxidase
             inhibitors for hyperuricaemia

          3. Concomitant use of long acting organic nitrates or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (not
             including on an as required basis)

             &gt;twice/week), or awaiting revascularisation

          7. Current life-threatening condition that might prevent a patient-subject completing the
             study

          8. Medical devices (including non-MRI conditional pacemakers and implantable cardiac
             defibrillators) or other conditions that preclude imaging with cardiac MRI

          9. Pregnancy

         10. Anaemia, defined as Haemaglobin &lt;80g/L

         11. Subjects with any acute infection, or recent systemic antibiotics (oral or
             intravenous) within 3 months of screening, or significant trauma (burns, fractures)

         12. The subject has a three-month prior history of regular alcohol consumption exceeding
             an average weekly intake of &gt; 28 units (or an average daily intake of greater than 3
             units) for males, or an average weekly intake of &gt; 21 units (or an average daily
             intake of greater than 2 units) for females. 1 unit is equivalent to a half-pint
             (284mL) of beer/lager; 25mL measure of spirits or 125mL of wine

         13. Mobility thought to be restricted significantly by other illnesses apart from heart
             failure

         14. Any other subject whom the Investigator deems unsuitable for the study (e.g. due to
             other medical reasons, laboratory abnormalities, expected study medication
             noncompliance, or subject's unwillingness to comply with all study-related study
             procedures)
