  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in whether or not the use of a mobile health (mHealth)
      application increases the rate of immunosuppressant medication adherence among adult liver
      transplant recipients. The investigators aim to test this by randomly assigning transplant
      recipients to the intervention (use of an mHealth app to manage and track their
      immunosuppression regimen) or control arm (standard of care) upon discharge from their
      initial transplant hospitalization, and tracking medication adherence over time. The study
      population will be approximately 50 adult liver transplant recipients at the Johns Hopkins
      Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adult transplant recipients, poor adherence to immunosuppressant medications carries the
      risk of graft rejection, post-transplant complications, and increased healthcare costs. In
      adult liver transplant recipients, adherence to immunosuppressant drugs, as well as to
      general medical indications (e.g. avoiding alcohol intake), is imperative to short- and
      long-term outcomes. The rate of non-adherence to immunosuppressant medications in this
      population varies vastly, with reports ranging from 15-40%. Because of lacking objective and
      accurate non-adherence measurements, the true implications and prevalence of non-adherence is
      not yet well understood. Therefore, the investigators believe that mobile health (mHealth)
      technology has the potential to allow clinicians and researchers to more comprehensively
      address and understand non-adherence in adult liver transplant recipients. Additionally, an
      mHealth application with the ability to track symptoms, side effects, and alcohol cravings
      could provide clinicians with valuable information on post-transplant care.

      emocha Mobile Health Inc. has developed an application that enables users to track
      dose-by-dose medication adherence through asynchronous, video directly observed therapy
      (DOT). This helps patients take their medication as prescribed and gives providers the
      assurance that their patients are supported and successful in treatment. DOT is the practice
      of watching a patient take every dose of medicine in-person, and has typically only been done
      in extreme cases because it can be both costly and burdensome: DOT is the standard of care
      for Tuberculosis treatment and has proven high-adherence rates. Through mHealth technology,
      DOT can be used more broadly and without added burden; emocha's technology allows this
      through enabling patients to use their mobile application to view their regimen, record
      themselves taking every dose of their medication, report side effects or symptoms, visualize
      their treatment progress, and access educational content. This information is encrypted and
      transmitted to a HIPAA-secure web portal for providers to review. The aim of this study is to
      conduct a randomized control trial to compare medication adherence between patients who use
      the mHealth application against controls who do not.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single center, prospective, randomized control trial with two arms. Participants in the intervention arm will use the mHealth app to manage and track their immunosuppression medical regimen post-transplant, and participants in the control arm will receive the current standard of follow-up care post-transplant.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be aware of which arm they are randomized to; thus, the study will not be blinded to practitioners or patients. However, study personnel performing data analysis will receive de-identified data that does not explicitly describe which group is intervention and which is control, but simply the code without a key. Only the PI and necessary personnel performing data extraction will have the key for the code to minimize bias in data analysis.</masking_description>
