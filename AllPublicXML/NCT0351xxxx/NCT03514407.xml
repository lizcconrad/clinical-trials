    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of
      INCB059872 or INCB057643 in participants with Ewing sarcoma who are refractory or relapsed
      from prior standard therapy and not eligible for further standard systemic therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma and have
             progressed on or after standard therapies.

          -  Must not be a candidate for potentially curative therapy or standard-of-care approved
             therapy.

          -  Measurable disease by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging based on
             RECIST 1.1 as determined by site radiology.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2.

          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of anticancer medications, anticancer therapies, or investigational drugs
             within protocol-defined intervals before the first administration of study drug.

          -  Must have recovered (≤ Grade 2 or at pretreatment baseline) from adverse events (AEs)
             from previously administered therapies except for stable chronic toxicities (≤ Grade
             2) not expected to resolve.

          -  Untreated brain or central nervous system (CNS) metastases or brain/CNS metastases
             that have progressed.

          -  Prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of study treatment. A 1-week washout period is
             permitted for palliative radiation to non-CNS disease with medical monitor approval.

          -  Laboratory values outside the protocol-defined range at screening.

          -  History or evidence of bleeding disorder or active clinically significant bleeding
             requiring medical intervention.
