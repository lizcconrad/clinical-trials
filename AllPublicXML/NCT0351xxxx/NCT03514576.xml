  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is a well-known and potentially severe
      complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and the treatment options are limited.
      Pasireotide has shown to be effective in preventing hypoglycemia in RYGB operated subjects,
      however treatment often leads to increased hyperglycemia.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate two doses of pasireotide that are lower than
      doses previously used in RYGB operated subjects with postprandial hyperinsulinemic
      hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the growing number of RYGB operated subjects the attention on complications such as
      postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (PHH) has increased. PHH is characterized by
      increased glycemic variability and hypoglycemic episodes occurring 2-3 hours after a meal
      together with a markedly increase in insulin and glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels.
      Symptoms vary from dizziness and palpitations to confusion, loss of consciousness and
      convulsions. At present there are few treatment options available for RYGB patients with PHH
      and most of them rely on dietary changes that are difficult to adhere to.

      Pasireotide has been shown to reduce hypoglycemia in RYGB operated subjects with PHH, but
      often leads to increased hyperglycemia as well.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate two doses of pasireotide in RYGB operated subjects
      with PHH.

      Each subject will undergo two meal tolerance test (MTT) preceded by either 75 µg or 150 µg of
      pasireotide. Blood samples will be collected throughout the meal test at predefined time
      points and will be analyzed for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1 and glucagon levels.
