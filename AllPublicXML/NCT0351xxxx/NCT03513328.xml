      In this study, the investigators test 2 dose levels of thiotepa (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) added
      to the backbone of targeted reduced dose IV busulfan, fludarabine and rabbit anti-thymocyte
      globulin (rATG) to determine the minimum effective dose required for reliable engraftment for
      subjects undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for non-malignant disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative choice for a number of inherited
      bone marrow failure syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, metabolic disorders and primary immune
      deficiencies. While survival of these patients is typically better than survival of patients
      with malignancies, toxicities of conditioning regimens and failure of engraftment remain
      challenges. Most children with non-malignant disorders present with normocellular or even
      hypercellular bone marrow, posing a barrier to engraftment and requiring intensive
      conditioning. Commonly used backbone of busulfan and fludarabine, although well tolerated,
      results in variable engraftment, in particular with mismatched unrelated donors and cord
      blood recipients. In this study, the investigators test 2 dose levels of thiotepa (5 mg/kg
      and 10 mg/kg) added to the backbone of targeted reduced dose IV busulfan, fludarabine and
      rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) in order to determine the minimum effective dose
      required for reliable engraftment. Subjects are stratified in groups A and B based the risk
      of graft failure.

    <intervention_model_description>The study builds in rules for escalation of thiotepa dose based on graft failure by day 42. Patients are stratified in two groups A (lower risk of graft failure) and B (higher risk of graft failure). Patients undergoing 10/10 HLA matched bone marrow and peripheral blood transplants are assigned to Group A, and patients receiving &lt;10/10 matched bone marrow or peripheral blood, or receiving cord blood, even if fully matched, are assigned to Group B.
If criteria for thiotepa dose escalation are met first in Group A, which has a lower risk of graft failure, thiotepa dose will be escalated for all subjects (Groups A and B). If criteria for thiotepa dose escalation are met first in Group B, dose will be escalated only in Group B and Group A will continue enrolling patients at a lower dose level.</intervention_model_description>

             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of protocol therapy or that might affect the interpretation of
             the results of the study or that puts the subject at high risk for treatment
             complications, in the opinion of the treating physician.
