  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of screening for undiagnosed
      atrial fibrillation (AF) using simple, efficient, and portable electronic health and mobile
      technologies in a healthcare system. The investigators propose to perform population-based
      screening for undiagnosed AF as part of usual care in patients ≥ 65 years when their vital
      signs are checked (spot-check) at scheduled outpatient visits in adult Massachusetts General
      Hospital (MGH) primary care clinics. Patients will receive routine care by their primary care
      provider (PCP) based upon the results of the screening during the visit.

      The investigators hypothesize that rates of AF detection among individuals ≥ 65 years in the
      MGH primary care network will be greater among patients in clinics assigned to the spot-check
      arm compared to patients in clinics assigned to the usual care arm of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incident AF during the study period</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The numerator of the outcome is the number of eligible patients with newly diagnosed AF during the study period. The eligible study population comprising the denominator will be assessed in two ways: (1) the whole population, defined as all patients aged 65 years and older presenting for an outpatient clinic appointment with a participating physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant at a study clinic during the enrollment period, and (2) the whole population excluding patients with an AF diagnosis prior to outcome assessment (prevalent AF).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incident AF associated with a primary care encounter during the study period</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The numerator of the outcome will be the number of eligible patients with newly diagnosed AF associated with a primary care visit. Similar to the primary outcome, the denominator will be assessed in two ways: (1) the whole population, and (2) the whole population excluding prevalent AF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New oral anticoagulation prescription during the study period</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The numerator of the outcome will be the number of eligible individuals with a new oral anticoagulation prescription during the study period. The eligible study population comprising the denominator will be assessed in three ways: (1) the whole population, (2) patients with a new AF diagnosis (incident AF), and (3) patients with prevalent AF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continued prescription of anticoagulation at 12 months among those started on anticoagulation during the study period</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months following initial prescription of anticoagulation (ie, up to 24 months after study start)</time_frame>
    <description>The numerator will be the number of individuals with a refill or prescription of an alternative anticoagulant in the subsequent 12 months after the day of new anticoagulant prescription. The eligible study population comprising the denominator will include individuals who are started on OAC during the study period. The denominator will be assessed in three ways: (1) whole population, (2) incident AF and (3) prevalent AF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New ischemic stroke within 24-months of the study start</measure>
    <time_frame>24-months</time_frame>
    <description>The numerator of the outcome is the number of patients sustaining ischemic stroke within 24 months of the study start. The eligible study population comprising the denominator will be assessed in two ways: (1) whole population, and (2) patients with an AF diagnosis (prevalent AF or incident AF prior to the outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Major hemorrhage within 24-months of the study start</measure>
    <time_frame>24-months</time_frame>
    <description>The numerator of the outcome is the number of patients sustaining a major hemorrhagic event within 24 months of the study start. The eligible study population comprising the denominator will be assessed in two ways: (1) whole population, and (2) patients with an AF diagnosis (prevalent AF or incident AF prior to the outcome).</description>

    <description>For eligible patients from primary care clinics randomly selected for the Atrial Fibrillation Spot-Check arm, practice medical assistants will screen assenting patients for undiagnosed AF during regularly scheduled office visits using a single-lead handheld electrocardiogram (ECG). Single-lead handheld electrocardiogram readings detecting AF will be confirmed during the same office visit with a standard 12-lead ECG at the discretion of the primary care physician. If AF is detected, the patient's PCP will be able to address the condition with them during the clinic visit and initiate appropriate follow-up to manage the AF.</description>
