  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical study. Blood is drawn from the patient and brought to our
      laboratory for isolation of immune cells. These immune cells are then proliferated over a two
      week period and used to produce our patented product IKC (Immune Killer Cells). The IKC will
      then infused back into the patient to treat the cancer. Each patient will receive a total of
      six infusions.

      For each indication (cancer of the lung or liver) 10 patients are anticipated to be
      recruited, making a total of 20 subjects. All subjects will receive treatment as this is a
      single-arm study.

    <description>The assessment will be performed using The World Heath Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL)
This questionnaire produces a quality of life profile. It is possible to derive four domain scores. The four domain scores denote an individual's perception of quality of life in each particular domain (1. Physical health 2. Psychological 3. Social relationships 4. Environmental) Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life).
The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score (min: 0 max: 100)
Domain scores are then calculated (divide domain score by 4) to produce a final QOL Score (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life min: 0 max:100).</description>
