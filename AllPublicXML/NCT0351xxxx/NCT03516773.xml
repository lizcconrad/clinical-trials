      <textblock>
        -Criteria for Inclusion:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism, as defined by the European Society
             of Endocrinology as a patient with hypocalcemia and inappropriately low PTH levels. If
             the source of hypoparathyroidism is surgical or iatrogenic, diagnosis must be for more
             than 1 year. If the source of hypoparathyroidism is not surgical or iatrogenic, and
             confirmed by inappropriately low PTH levels and hypercalciuria, diagnosis does not
             have time limitations.

          2. 1, 25(OH)2D levels ≥20 ng/mL.

          3. Signed Informed Consent Form).

          4. Age 18 to 80 years with body mass index of 19 to 35 kg/m2.

          5. Patients able to adhere to the visit schedule and protocol requirements.

        Criteria for Exclusion:

          1. Known history of hypoparathyroidism resulting from an activating mutation in the
             calcium sensing receptor gene or impaired responsiveness to PTH
             (pseudohypoparathyroidism).

          2. Hemoglobin &lt;11.5 g/dL (females) / &lt;12.5g/dL (males) [lower limit of reference range,
             12 to 15 g/dL and 13 to 17 g/dL]

          3. Acute or chronic renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73
             m²).

          4. Significant liver function impairment (liver enzymes above ×2 the upper limit of
             normal range).

          5. Patients with hypomagnesemia should be excluded unless serum magnesium is corrected
             prior to study initiation.

          6. Active gastrointestinal inflammatory, gastrointestinal motility disorders, and chronic
             gastritis, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
             short bowel syndrome, celiac disease, gastroparesis, etc.

          7. Active hepatitis or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)/AIDS-related syndrome

          8. Any conditions or factors that, in the judgment of the Investigator, somehow may
             impact gastrointestinal absorption.

          9. Concurrent therapy with the following medications: (1) 14 days: thiazide diuretics;
             loop diuretics (2) 30 days: lithium, systemic corticosteroid; (3) 1 month: calcitonin,
             cinacalcet hydrochloride, recombinant PTH(1-84) or N-terminal PTH or PTH-related
             peptide fragments or analogs; (4) females only; changes in hormone replacement therapy
             within 2 months; (5) 3 months: methotrexate, growth hormone, digoxin; raloxifene or
             similar selective estrogen receptor modulators; (7) chronic or concurrent use of
             gastrointestinal motility modulators (domperidone, loperamide, erythromycin
             metoclopramide etc.); and (8) other concurrent therapy that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study
             medication.

         10. Significant drug or alcohol abuse as assessed by the PI.

         11. Treatment with any investigational product within the last 30 days or 5 half-lives (if
             known) whichever is longer.

         12. Has participated as a patient in any investigational drug study within the last 30
             days preceding the screening visit or plans to participate in another investigational
             drug study at any time during the study or within 30 days of his/her completion of
             this study.

         13. Presence of any other condition or circumstance that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, might increase the risk to the patient or decrease the chance of
             obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study.

         14. Historical documented allergy to soy bean products or known hypersensitivity to the
             PTH (1-34).

         15. Patients at increased risk for osteosarcoma, such as those with Paget's disease of
             bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, hereditary disorders
             predisposing to osteosarcoma, or with a prior history of external beam or implant
             radiation involving the skeleton.

         16. Patients with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases.

         17. Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy or lactating. Female patients of childbearing
             potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and be willing and
             able to use a medically acceptable method of birth control (reliable use of oral
             contraceptive, non-hormonal intrauterine device with condom, diaphragm with condom, or
             condom with spermicide) from the screening visit through 90 days from last dose or
             declare that they are abstaining from sexual intercourse from the screening visit
             through the study termination visit or are surgically sterile (have undergone
             bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal.
             True abstinence can only be in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and
             postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        Childbearing potential is defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral
        tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal. Women
        will be defined as postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months (prior to
        signature of Informed Consent Form) without an alternative medical cause.
