  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non‐interventional, single‐arm, multi‐center study aimed at gathering
      real‐world data on Juluca use in routine clinical care in Germany, to supplement clinical
      trial data to further improve/optimize care in HIV positive subjects in Germany.
      Approximately 250 virologically suppressed HIV positive subjects on stable antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) will be included in the study at the discretion of treating physician. Eligible
      subjects will be followed up for approximately 3 years and data will be collected during
      routine clinical care.
