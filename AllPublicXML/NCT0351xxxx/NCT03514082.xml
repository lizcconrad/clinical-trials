  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a rotational deformity of the spine that could be
      seen 2-3% of population. Conservative treatment of AIS with 20-45 degree lateral flexion
      angle (Cobb) includes brace and therapeutic exercises. Some gait abnormalities were defined
      like decreased torsional movements of spine, increased muscular work and energy expenditure
      in AIS. Additionally wearing a brace limits pelvic motions and affects pendulum-like
      mechanism of gait. Our aim was to investigate gait energy consumption, pulmonary functions,
      balance and lower extremity loading symmetry in AIS subjects who are getting conservative
      treatment.

    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at the end of first month of conservative treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Balance will be assessed with a special equipment that gives deviation that lower values mean better.</description>
