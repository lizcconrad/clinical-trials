  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic open, three-arm individually-randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation
      will be conducted in one primary health care centre in Blantyre, Malawi, where HIV and TB are
      major contributors to early mortality.

      Participants will be adults with symptoms of tuberculosis (cough of any duration) attending
      the primary clinic with an acute care episode. We will exclude adults who have taken
      treatment for TB within the previous 6-months, who are taking isoniazid preventive therapy,
      who are not resident of Blantyre, or who plan to move out of Blantyre in the following
      6-months.

      Participants will be randomly allocated into one of three groups:

      Group 1: Standard of care: Participants will be seen by facility health workers and receive
      clinician-directed screening for HIV and TB according to Malawi national guidelines.

      Group 2: Optimised HIV testing and treatment linkage: Participants will be offered testing
      for HIV using rapid oral fluid kits by research assistants. Those with confirmed HIV
      infection will be linked to the HIV care clinic where facility healthworkers will screen for
      TB using standard sputum-based diagnostics.

      Group 3: Optimised TB diagnosis, HIV screening and treatment linkage: Participants will
      receive a high-throughput and high-sensitivity TB screening intervention, in addition to the
      HIV testing intervention. This will comprise of an initial digital chest x-ray classified by
      the CAD4TB image-recognition software as either &quot;high probability of TB&quot;, or &quot;low probability
      of TB&quot;. Participants whose x-rays are suggestive of TB will receive confirmatory sputum
      testing with Xpert MTB/Rif Ultra cartridges, whilst participants whose x-rays have a low
      probability of TB will be referred to facility healthworkers for routine care.

      All participants will be seen at the health facility at day 56, where they will be tested for
      HIV (if not on ART) and screened for TB.

      The Primary Trial Outcome will compare between groups the time to tuberculosis treatment
      initiation by day 56. The trial is sufficiently powered to permit 3 pairwise comparisons
      between groups (i.e. Group 1 vs. 2; Group 2 vs. 3; and Group 1 vs. 3).

      This three-arm pragmatic trial design allows us to efficiently answer two separate, important
      public health questions: firstly, by comparing Group 2 to Group 1, we should be able to
      determine whether HIV care should be prioritised for adults with TB symptoms. Additionally,
      by comparing Group 3 to Group 2, we will provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of an
      optimised and integrated HIV and TB diagnostic and treatment linkage approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ambitious global targets have been set to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem
      by 2035. However, in Africa, where HIV has driven extremely high incidence rates, progress in
      reducing new infections and TB deaths remains too slow.

      We have previously demonstrated that adults seeking diagnosis and treatment for TB and HIV
      face considerable barriers, and have long delays in starting treatment with high
      pre-treatment mortality.

      Efforts to reduce TB mortality have been hampered by limitations in TB diagnostics, with
      considerable uncertainty about how available and new tests can be best implemented.

      The aim of the PROSPECT Study is therefore to investigate the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of optimised TB/HIV diagnosis and treatment linkage interventions on TB
      and HIV case detection, treatment initiation and mortality.

      Study design A pragmatic open, three-arm individually-randomised controlled trial and
      economic evaluation will be conducted in one primary health care centre in Blantyre, Malawi.

      Study site and participants The study will be conducted at one primary health clinic in
      Blantyre Malawi, where we have established HIV and TB research facilities and previously
      demonstrated high need for improved TB and HIV diagnosis. Sputum-based TB diagnostics (smear
      microscopy, and Xpert MTB/Rif) and treatment, and comprehensive HIV care (including
      provider-initiated HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy) are available free-to-cost to
      patients through the Malawi national TB and HIV programmes.

      Participants will be adults with symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (cough of any duration)
      attending the primary clinic with an acute care episode. We will exclude adults who have
      taken treatment for TB within the previous 6-months, or who are taking isoniazid preventive
      therapy, or who do not live in Blantyre, or plan to move out of Blantyre.

      Interventions

      Participants will be randomly allocated into one of three groups:

      Group 1 - Standard of care: Participants will be seen by facility health workers and receive
      clinician-directed screening for HIV and TB according to Malawi national guidelines without
      further study input.

      Group 2 - Optimised HIV testing and treatment linkage: Participants will be offered testing
      for HIV using rapid oral fluid kits by research assistants. Those with confirmed HIV
      infection will be linked to the HIV care clinic where facility healthworkers will screen for
      TB using standard sputum-based diagnostics without further study input.

      Group 3 - Optimised TB diagnosis, HIV screening and treatment linkage: Participants will
      receive a high-throughput and high-sensitivity TB screening intervention, in addition to the
      HIV testing intervention. This will comprise of an initial digital chest x-ray classified by
      the CAD4TB image-recognition software as either &quot;high probability of TB&quot;, or &quot;low probability
      of TB&quot;. Participants whose x-rays are classified as having high probability of TB will
      receive confirmatory sputum testing with Xpert MTB/Rif cartridges, whilst participants whose
      x-rays have a low probability of TB will be referred to facility healthworkers for routine
      care.

      All participants will be seen at the health facility at day 56, where they will be assessed
      to determine whether they are taking treatment for tuberculosis by inspection of medication,
      inspection of treatment cards, and inspection of facility TB registers. They will also be
      offered testing for HIV (if not on ART) and screened for TB, including by sputum culture,
      Xpert and smear microscopy.

      Outcomes The primary trial outcome will be time in days - from Day 0 up to but not including
      Day 56 - to tuberculosis treatment initiation, evaluated at Day 56 following randomization.
      The trial is sufficiently powered to permit 3 pairwise comparisons between groups (i.e. Group
      1 vs. 2; Group 2 vs. 3; and Group 1 vs. 3).

      This three-arm pragmatic trial design allows us to efficiently answer two separate, important
      public health questions: firstly, by comparing Group 2 to Group 1, we should be able to
      determine whether HIV care should be prioritised for adults with TB symptoms. Additionally,
      by comparing Group 3 to Group 2, we will provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of an
      optimised and integrated HIV and TB diagnostic and treatment linkage approach.

      Statistical considerations Assuming 17% of participants in Group 1 initiate TB treatment by
      8-weeks, and 5% loss to-follow-up, a sample size of n=1455 participants randomised in a 1:1:1
      ratio across the three groups provides at least 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.5
      comparing Group 2 to Group 1, and a hazard ratio of 1.41 comparing Group 3 to Group 2.

    <description>The primary trial outcome will be time in days - from Day 0 up to but not including Day 56 - to tuberculosis treatment initiation, evaluated at Day 56 following randomization.
Analysis of the primary outcome will be done on an intention to treat basis, with all participants analysed according to the group to which they were randomised. Time to TB treatment outcome analysis will be right censored at Day 56 from randomisation if TB treatment is not initiated, or at day of loss to follow-up. We will make three pair-wise comparisons (Group 2 vs. Group 1; Group 3 vs. Group 2; and Group 3 vs. Group 1).</description>

    <description>Although not statistically powered for comparison, in pre-specified exploratory sub-group analysis, we will stratify analysis of comparisons between pairs of groups for the primary outcome of time to tuberculosis treatment initiation (stratified by sex, and by microbiological TB status), and for the secondary outcomes of the proportion of participants with undiagnosed/untreated microbiologically-confirmed TB (stratified by sex), and undiagnosed/untreated HIV (stratified by sex).
These pre-specified exploratory analyses will be done for hypothesis-generating purposes and to support the case for future research, as our previous studies have shown that men fare considerable worse than women throughout the TB and HIV diagnostic and care pathways.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory Bayesian analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 56 days after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>We will additionally undertake a Bayesian analysis of the primary trial outcome. Prior distributions for the proportion of participants initiating TB treatment will be elicited from key stakeholder groups, including community members, clinicians, researchers, TB experts, and policymakers.
Key stakeholders will be invited to attend workshop meetings, where they will be introduced to the study design and interventions through presentations and group discussions. To elicit prior beliefs for effect of interventions, we will use a &quot;bin-and-chip&quot; method, implemented within an interactive web application.
Using Bayes' theorem, we will combine elicited stakeholder group-specific log hazard ratio prior distributions with log-likelihood hazard ratio distributions from each pairwise comparison being made in the PROSPECT Study to construct posterior probability distributions.</description>

A digital chest x-ray using the study MinXray unit.
Chest x-rays will be immediately classified by the CAD4TB software running on the MinXray unit laptop as either &quot;high probability of TB&quot;, or &quot;low probability of TB&quot;.
Participants whose chest x-rays have a low probability of TB will be referred to facility health workers (at either the onsite HIV care clinic if HIV-positive, or the clinic waiting area), with copies of their results for further routine care, and without further study input.
Participants whose chest x-ray x-ray show a high probability of TB will submit a single spot sputum sample for Xpert testing (done in the clinic). Those with confirmed TB will be linked to register at the onsite TB clinic.</description>

    <ipd_description>We are strongly committed to ensuring that the trial datasets are made openly available, and that all code used in the analysis are published to allow fully reproducible research. The data collected by this research will be of importance to other researchers and the public, and could for example be used by other researchers conducting meta-analysis, or by policymakers modelling the potential return on investment of implementing interventions within their settings.
Therefore, we will establish a public online GitHub repository, where the final anonymised individual participant trial dataset and code to allow reproduction of all analysis will be published.</ipd_description>
