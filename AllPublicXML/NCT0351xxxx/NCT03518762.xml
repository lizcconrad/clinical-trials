  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study to investigate the effect of application of sustained
      lung inflation (SLI) at birth on the respiratory outcome of preterm infants with respiratory
      distress syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled infants (n=160) were randomized before birth into 2 groups (intervention and control
      group) in a ratio 1:1. Randomization was done through an online randomizer
      (www.graphpad.com), and sealed envelopes were used to assign the infant to one of the two
      groups.

    <description>Participants in this arm (n=80) received:
Sustained lung inflation (SLI) manoeuvre(s) was applied once or twice, based on the protocol algorithm.
Within the first 60 seconds of life, assessment for the need of advanced resuscitation (defined as the need for more than oxygen and tactile stimulation during resuscitation) was done;
Infants who needed advanced resuscitation were considered to receive SLI as a rescue approach.
Infants who needed only oxygen and tactile stimulation were considered to receive SLI as a prophylactic approach.
Then Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was given through an ETT, if intubation was needed.</description>
