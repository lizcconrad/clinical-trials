  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2008, preterm neonates are taking care of in a Special Baby Care Unit (SCBU). Those
      born less than 34 weeks of gestation are followed-up monthly for one year for monitoring
      their hematocrit level, growth and development.

      Medical chart reviews are useful to evaluate the burden of diseases, characterize care
      treatment patterns and clinical outcomes by patients' subgroups; ultimately it can help
      identifying gaps in care pathways thus improving quality of care and ultimately reducing
      mortality. Medical records of all preterm neonates hospitalized in the SCBU including those
      followed up during their first year of life are computerized.

      The investigators propose to review the clinical charts of the preterm neonates in regards to
      four main points of care a) feeding, b) infections including early onset of neonatal sepsis,
      necrotizing enterocolitis and umbilical cord infection, c) body temperature control and d)
      respiratory distress.

      This medical charts review will be complemented by i) focus group discussions (FGD) with the
      medical staff working in the SCBU on the benefits and difficulties in using the existing
      guidelines for preterm care and by ii) interviews with mothers who delivered a preterm
      neonate on their experience in caring for their child and the challenges they faced.

      While performing the retrospective part of the project and after discussing the preliminary
      findings from the medical staff perception of the existing guidelines, the investigators will
      evaluate the feasibility to implement some additional recommendations to improve preterm
      birth outcomes based on recent literature and new protocols for resource-limited settings.

        along the Thailand-Myanmar border, mostly from Burman and Karen ethnicity, but also from
