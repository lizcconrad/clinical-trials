  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal aging is associated with balance, mobility and executive functions decline that
      increase fall risk and influence Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental ADL (IADL)
      functions such as safe road-crossing, planning and organizing everyday activities. Changes in
      cerebellar functional plasticity may mediate between the decline in balance, mobility and
      executive functions during elderly. Fortunately, mounting evidence suggests that physical
      activity is beneficial for decreasing aging effects and optimize brain structure and
      function. According to the dynamic systems theory, the environment in which the physical
      activity occurs influences the results of the activity. We propose an aquatic physical
      intervention program as a tool to decrease aging effects that in turn might lower fall risk,
      increase safety of road-crossing and improve planning and organizing everyday activities
      among community-dwelling older individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The percentage of elderly individuals (65+) in the society of Israel is 10.6%. As life-span
      increases, this percentage is expected to reach 15% in 2035. According to the Central Bureau
      of Statistics of Israel regarding the injuries and fatalities of road users, about 14% of the
      injuries and about 42% of the fatalities are pedestrians. Older pedestrians are about 22% of
      the pedestrians, twice their part in the population. Ageing effects on balance, mobility and
      executive functions (especially working memory and inhibitory control) might partially
      explain these statistics.

      Changes in cerebellar functional plasticity may mediate between the decline in balance,
      mobility and some executive functions during elderly. Studies have shown age-related decrease
      in structural morphology and function of the cerebellum. The traditional functions of the
      cerebellum mainly include involvement in the coordination of motor movements, maintenance of
      balance, and motor learning. Interestingly, studies have found that cerebellar alpha power
      has an important role in voluntary movement, as well as in higher non-motor cognitive
      functions such as working memory. Cerebellar activation during working memory task may reﬂect
      the automated simulation of cognitive operations.

      Various forms of physical interventions were found beneficial to promote balance, mobility
      and executive function of working memory and inhibitory control performances and optimize
      brain structure and function during elderly. The environment in which the physical
      intervention occurs is important. Therefore, changing the environment of intervention from
      on-land to aquatic may result in changing of cerebellar activity, thereby influence on
      balance, mobility, working memory and inhibitory control abilities proven to be functions
      connected to the cerebellum.

      Due to the characteristics of water (such as density and viscosity), an immersed individual
      is exposed to physical forces (e.g. specific gravity, thermodynamics and the meta-centric
      effect) that do not exist on land. Immersion improves balancing abilities by increasing the
      proprioceptive input to the immersed body. Sensory feedback is increased by promoting a sense
      of body awareness, as resistance to movement through water is greater than resistance to
      movement through air. In support of this view, a recent Magnetoencephalography (MEG) study
      among adults has shown improved verbal working memory ability following one month of
      intensive aquatic physical intervention. Improved verbal working memory was positively
      correlated with increased right cerebellar alpha power. In the purpose study we examine the
      effects of physical intervention in different environments on balance, mobility, working
      memory and inhibitory control abilities and brain activity in order to decrease aging effects
      that in turn might lower fall risk, increase safety of road users and improve planning and
      organizing everyday activities among community-dwelling older individuals.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 1.5 months of intervention and to 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This test is a standardized evaluation of balance and mobility designed to determine risk for falls during elderly. It has a very good inter-rater reliability and sensitivity. The gait testing included initiation of gait, step height, step length, step symmetry, step continuity, path deviation, trunk stability, walk stance, and turning while walking. Each item scored 1 if normal or 0 if abnormal. The balance testing included sitting balance, arising from chair, immediate standing, standing balance, balance with eyes closed, turning balance, neck turning, back extension, one-leg standing, push test, reaching up, bending down, and sitting down. Each item scored 1 (normal) or 0 (abnormal). Tinetti scores for risk of falls: ≤18 points=high risk; 19-23 points=moderate risk; ≥24 points =low risk.</description>

    <measure>Change in digit span forward and backward tests</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 1.5 months of intervention and to 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>During the task a sequence of digits is read by the experimenter at a rate of 1/second, and participants is asked to recall the digits in forward or backward order immediately after hearing them. The task starting with a sequence of two digits, the number of digits per sequence will increase by one if a participant successfully recall a given sequence length twice. Testing will end when the participant makes errors on two successive trials of a given length. Performance will express as the number of sequences successfully recall.</description>

    <description>During the tasks the subject watches the tester touch a series of blocks (one block per second), then the subject is to touch the blocks in the same order or backward. The task starting with one block, the blocks per sequence will increase by one if a participant successfully recall a given sequence length twice. Testing will end when the participant makes errors on two successive trials of a given length. Performance will express as the number of sequences successfully recall.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 1.5 months of intervention and to 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This task measures inhibitory control which is one of the core elements of executive functions. The task involves showing words that are the names of colors. The letters making up each word are printed in a color of ink different from the color name the word represents. The participant is asked to quickly respond with the color ink he sees, and inhibit the printed word. Performance will express the time (in seconds) it takes to finish the task and accuracy.</description>

    <measure>Change in the weekly calendar planning activity test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This tool was designed to be useful across a variety of populations that exhibit difficulties in executive functioning. It provides a broad analysis of how a person manages and copes with a complex and cognitively challenging activity. In addition to including a weekly schedule, the assessment features client profiles on error analysis, visual performance, awareness of task difficulty, and pre/post comparisons. The Weekly Calendar Planning Activity has three levels of difficulty, from Level 1, the easiest, in which appointments are preordered, to Level 3, the most difficult, in which appointments are randomly ordered in paragraph form. We will use Level 2 for this study, In Level 2 the participant is presented with a list of appointments in random order they have to schedule during 1 week by filling in a paper calendar.</description>
