    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/1b, open-label, first-in-human, monotherapy study will be conducted in 2 parts.
      Part A will consist of the SRF231 monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the study, and will
      enroll up to 48 patients with advanced solid tumors and hematological cancers. Part B will
      include monotherapy expansion cohorts in advanced solid and hematologic cancers to further
      examine SRF231 as monotherapy (100 patients total).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SRF231 as a
      monotherapy via dose escalation (Part A), and to determine the dose(s) of SRF231 to be
      further examined in expansion cohorts as monotherapy. The preliminary clinical activity of
      SRF231 administered as monotherapy will be characterized, along with pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics. In Part B, the safety and tolerability of SRF231 as monotherapy will be
      evaluated in select patient cohorts of advanced cancers and evaluate clinical activity. The
      study also is designed to examine the effect of SRF231 monotherapy on peripheral blood immune
      cell subsets, peripheral blood gene expression, and serum biomarkers
