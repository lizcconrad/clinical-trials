  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation is fundamental in the treatment of patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      regarding the educational, physical exercise and quality of life dimensions. Considering the
      competences of Specialist Nurses in Rehabilitation Nursing and the current prevalence of risk
      factors associated with cardiovascular disease, it is essential to implement programs in this
      area.

      This study aims to assess the impact of Specialist Nurses in Rehabilitation Nursing
      interventions on a cardiac rehabilitation program during hospitalization (phase I) and 1
      month after cardiac surgery (phase II), in around 30 patients of both sexes, between 25 and
      64 years old, and according to the American Heart Association and the American Association of
      Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, met the criteria for low or moderate risk, class
      B for participation and exercise supervision, absence of signs/symptoms after cardiac
      surgery, with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40%. Supervised interventions
      were performed during hospitalization, pre- and post-cardiac surgery, and 1 month after
      hospital discharge. In phase II, a physical exercise program was fulfilled according to the
      norms of the American College of Sports Medicine, comprising 3 sessions of physical exercise
      per week lasting between 30 to 60 minutes, including heating, aerobic exercise, and
      recovery/stretching. Hemodynamic data (blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen
      saturation) and the Borg scale were recorded in the initial, intermediate and final periods
      of each session. The aerobic capacity was evaluated through the 6-Minute Walk Test and
      health-related quality of life using the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36V2) questionnaire.

      competences of Specialist Nurses in Rehabilitation Nursing and the current prevalence of risk
      factors associated with cardiovascular disease, it is essential to implement programs in this
      area.

      Participants of both sexes will be included, between 25 and 64 years of age, meeting the
      criteria for low or moderate risk, class B for participation and exercise supervision,
      absence of signs/symptoms after cardiac surgery, with a left ventricular ejection fraction
      greater than 40%, according to the American Heart Association and the American Association of
      Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation.

      Inclusion criteria will consider patients with stable chronic heart failure (class I-III
      according to New York Heart Association), with dyslipidemia, controlled hypertension, without
      arrhythmias, without motor or psychic alterations, with previous acceptance of the informed
      consent of the intervention program. Participants will be excluded if present non-controlled
      arrhythmias, severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure,
      unstable angina, uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus, decompensated coronary insufficiency, and
      pericarditis.

      Supervised interventions will be provided during hospitalization, pre- and post-cardiac
      surgery, and 1 month after hospital discharge, considered phase I. In phase II, a physical
      exercise program will be performed, according to the norms of the American College of Sports
      Medicine, comprising 3 sessions of physical exercise per week lasting between 30 to 60
      minutes, including heating, aerobic exercise and recovery/stretching. Hemodynamic data (blood
      pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation) and the Borg scale will be recorded in
      the initial, intermediate and final periods of each session. The aerobic capacity will be
      evaluated through the 6-Minute Walk Test and health-related quality of life will be assessed
      through the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36V2) questionnaire. No control will be assessed.

    <intervention_model_description>An exercise program was performed by the Specialist Nurses in Rehabilitation Nursing, comprising the combination of the various components of the exercise: aerobic and recovery/stretching. The program will start in the intensive care unit after the 24 hours post-surgery, and later, during hospitalization. The evaluations will be performed during hospitalization, in phase I of cardiac rehabilitation, and one-month post-discharge, in the Nursing visits of follow-up (phase II of cardiac rehabilitation). Clinical data (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Peripheral Oxygen Saturation) and Borg scale will be recorded in the initial, intermediate and final periods of each session. Capillary glycemia will be evaluated at the beginning of each session. Three sessions of exercises will be performed weekly with duration of 30 min to 60 min, divided in heating (10-25 min), aerobic exercise (10 min) and recovery (10-25min).</intervention_model_description>
