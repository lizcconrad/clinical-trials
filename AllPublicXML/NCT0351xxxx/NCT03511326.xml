      Interventional open label prospective and multicentre study conducted in Germany in subjects
      with thin or non-hyperkeratotic and non-pigmented multiple AKs in one anatomical area on the
      face (e.g., forehead or cheek or chin), excluding nose eyelids, lips and mucosa or balding
      scalp, using Luxerm® DL-PDT treatment.

             non-pigmented actinic keratoses in an anatomical area on the face (e.g., forehead or
             cheek or chin) excluding nose, eyelids, lips and mucosa, or balding scalp, at baseline
             visit.

             non-melanoma skin cancer) on the target anatomical area.

          2. Subject with severe AK (thick, hyperkeratotic AK) per anatomical area (face or scalp).

          3. Subject with clinical diagnosis of other skin disease on the target anatomical area.

          4. Subject with pigmented AK on the target anatomical area.
