  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The device &quot;Patello&quot; was designed to passively mobilize the Patella in cranial-caudal
      direction. Its application field lays in the rehabilitation of any knee pathology where knee
      range of motion may be restricted due to the Patella mobility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the device Patello has not been tested so far. This clinical study aims
      to assess and proof the effectiveness of this device. The aim is to objectify the movement of
      the Patella induced by the device Patello in cranial / caudal direction. As outcome parameter
      serve ultrasound measurements of a bony reference point of the femur and the Patella and its
      displacement / distance after mobilization.
