  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to innovatively extend acupuncture research in adult oncology to
      adolescents and young adults (AYA) by piloting a tailored acupuncture protocol for pain
      management in AYA in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP's) Center for Integrative
      Health.

  <detailed_description>

      Acupuncture is an integrative medicine (IM) with a growing evidence base that is often
      incorporated into comprehensive pain management in adult oncology. However, it is
      under-utilized and under-researched in pediatric oncology, especially with adolescents and
      young adults (AYA). Acupuncture is a promising palliative therapy to manage pain and improve
      quality of life (QOL) of AYA. AYA are underserved and typically endure more morbidity and
      longer treatments than younger patients. More than half report at least three debilitating
      cancer-related symptoms and their QOL is significantly lower compared to norms, with symptoms
      being the greatest contributor to poor QOL. Not surprisingly, AYA identify pain management as
      an unmet need, leading a majority of AYA to want information on IM or seek it for treatment.
      Given the potential benefit of acupuncture for addressing unmet needs of AYA by reducing
      physical suffering, and the established difficulty with pain management using conventional
      methods, there is a critical need to establish the efficacy of acupuncture for pain
      management in AYA. The few studies that have evaluated acupuncture in pediatric oncology,
      demonstrating it to be safe, accepted, and associated with symptom relief are uncontrolled,
      retrospective, and/or unprotocolized, and none focus on AYA. To establish the evidence base
      for acupuncture in AYA oncology, research is needed to determine and test optimal acupuncture
      protocols.
