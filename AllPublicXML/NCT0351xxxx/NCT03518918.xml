    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a clinical syndrome defined by loss of ovarian
      activity before the age of 40 years. The POI guideline development group of ESHRE recommends
      the following diagnostic criteria: oligo/amenorrhea for at least 4 months and an elevated
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level ＞25 mIU/mL on two occasion ＞4 weeks apart. But there
      still no diagnosis standard of POI in Chinese.The study aims to establishing the diagnosis
      standard of POI and analyzing the risk factors in Chinese women.
