  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal approach to
      analgesia for patient's pain after hip arthroscopy and to also assess if this new approach
      will result in a reduction in post-operative narcotic use.

      This study is a single-center, randomized prospective study comparing post-operative pain
      scores and narcotic consumption between individuals receiving acetaminophen along with a
      reduced quantity of Percocet (to be used as needed for breakthrough pain) and individuals
      receiving Percocet only. Both pain management options are considered to be standard of care.
      Both cohorts will receive aspirin for DVT prophylaxis and celecoxib for heterotopic
      ossification prophylaxis.

      The primary objective of the study are to compare patients' narcotic consumption and reported
      pain following arthroscopic hip surgery, and determine if acetaminophen can provide adequate
      pain relief compared to a narcotic medication.
