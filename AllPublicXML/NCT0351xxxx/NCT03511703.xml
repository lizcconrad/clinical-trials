    <textblock>
      This study uses to suppress the growth of tumors, extend the patient's survival time and
      improve the quality of life as much as possible. Through the treatment, the patient is given
      the chance to undergo surgical resection, thereby more effectively prolonging the OS.
      Apatinib is a small-molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It mainly treats malignant
      tumors by inhibiting VEGFR and exerting anti-angiogenic effects. Preclinical studies have
      shown that its antitumor effect is better than that of the similar drug PTK787. Phase II
      studies of hepatocellular carcinoma have initially demonstrated the effectiveness and safety
      of apatinib in the treatment of advanced HCC. TACE embolized tumor artery blood supply to
      inhibit tumor growth and shrink tumors. Based on the therapeutic potential of apatinib, and
      TACE in their respective tumors, we designed a prospective exploratory clinical study of this
      patient with advanced liver cancer.

    <description>Apatinib, a small molecule anti-angiogenic targeted drug that has been demonstrated to be safe and effective after failure of standard chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer, has been initially successful in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of unresectable advanced HCC patients. The efficacy of ralfiny in the treatment of Oriental population (ORIENTAL study) is better. The randomized, doubleblind, multi-center phase III clinical study of apatinib second-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma showed a good efficacy and safety. Currently, Phase III clinical studies of apatinib in HCC patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy or sorafenib treatment have progressed. Initial results lso showed good efficacy and safety.</description>

    <description>Intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for tumors, commonly used chemotherapy drugs include anthracyclines, platinum, etc.; chemotherapeutic drugs and embolic agents are mixed together and injected through the blood supply artery of the tumor. The most commonly used embolic agent for TACE treatment is a lipiodol emulsion. First infusion of some chemotherapy drugs, the general infusion time should not be &lt;20 min. Then another part of the chemotherapeutic drugs and lipiodol were mixed into emulsions for embolization. The amount of lipiodol is generally 5-20 ml, not more than 30 ml.</description>
