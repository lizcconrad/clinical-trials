  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a platelet transfusion saving strategy based on thrombopoietin
      administration in heart or lung transplantation (HLT) patients or assist device implantation
      in bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) or bridge to-decision (BTD). This strategy was applied
      from May 2014 to October 2015 in patients whose platelet counts were below 100 Giga per liter
      (G/L). As part of a health care quality improvement project, the investigators evaluated this
      strategy in a before/after design. January 2010 to December 2013 constituted the before
      period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In may 2014, after Heart or Lung transplantation or assist device implantation, the
      investigators decided to off-label administered Romiplostim in patients with thrombocytopenia
      below 100 Giga per liter. The purpose was to reduce platelets transfusion side effects.
      Romiplostim was used off treatment algorithm was based on previously published data in
      idiopathic, thrombocytopenia, cirrhotic and hematological patients. The first subcutaneous
      injection of 1.5 to 2 μg/kg of romiplostim was administered in the postoperative periods. An
      algorithm based on patient weight and platelet count evolution was established to determine
      romiplostim doses to administered weekly. Romiplostim posology was adjusted between 2 and
      5μg/kg according to platelet count with a maximum of 4 administrations in the ICU. If
      platelets remained below 50 Giga per liter after 2 injections, bone marrow analysis after
      hematologist referral was discussed. Platelet count until day 15 after the last injection was
      monitored to detect thrombocytosis.

      In January 2016, the investigators decided to retrospectively assess Romiplostim
      implementation in the standard of care in the ICU through a Healthcare quality improvement
      project in a before/after design.

The first subcutaneous injection of 1.5 to 2 µg/kg of romiplostim was administered in the post-operative periods. An algorithm based on patient weight and platelet count was established to determine romiplostim doses. One injection per week was performed. Romiplostim posology was adjusted between 2 and 5µg/kg every week according to platelet count with a maximum of 4 administrations in the ICU.</description>
