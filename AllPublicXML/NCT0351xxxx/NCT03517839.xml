  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on fear of
      movement due to dyspnea in COPD patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to two
      groups. Inspiratory muscle training in the training group will be administered at least 5
      days a week, 15 minutes twice a day, beginning at 30% of the MIP for 8 weeks. Patients will
      come to the control once a week, the MIP values will be re-measured and the new training
      intensity will be determined at 30% of the new value. For the control group, a fixed training
      session will be given for at least 5 days a week, 15 minutes twice a day, not exceeding 15%
      of the MIP for 8 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary diseases are a common cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) causes respiratory muscle weakness, but also causes
      hypercapnia, dyspnoea, oxygen desaturation, and gait disturbances. In COPD, the main symptom
      is dyspnea and leads to activity limitation. It has been shown that with exercise, the
      diaphragm workload increases in COPD patients and requires more MIP than healthy humans. This
      is associated with dyspnea during exercise and tiredness in the respiratory muscles. Dyspnea
      is defined as the difficulty in breathing of a person. Painful situations are defined as
      'kinesiophobia' as a result of physical injuries and fear of repetition of the problem as a
      result of injury. Similarly, COPD patients avoid themselves from dyspnea-related activities
      or compensate by reducing the rate of activity. This reduces the severity of the symptom that
      precedes the symptom that may occur. As a result, fear of movement occurs due to dyspnea.
      Decrease in the level of activity; social isolation, fear of dyspnea, depression and anxiety
      result in a stubborn cycle, reducing the quality of life. In order to increase respiratory
      muscle strength and endurance, to improve the length tension relationship of respiratory
      muscles and to increase respiratory capacity, respiratory muscle training is performed by
      using the training principle of skeletal muscles. In COPD, inspiratory muscle training has
      been shown in many studies to reduce dyspnoea perception, increase exercise capacity and
      quality of life.

    <description>Breathlessness Beliefs Questionnaire-BBQ Breathlessness Perception Questionnaire; is a measure evaluating kinesophobia and anxiety due to the breathlessness of 17 questions answered by one's own practice. Patients score from 1 to 5 (I strongly agree). High scores indicate high levels of kinesiophobia and anxiety due to breathlessness.</description>
