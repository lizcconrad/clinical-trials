  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded cross-over study evaluating and quantifying
      the effect of pyridostigmine on muscle strength and symptoms in Myasthenia Gravis (MG)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate and quantify the effect of pyridostigmine on symptoms and muscle
      strength in newly-diagnosed patients and patients on stable medication.

      Pyridostigmine treatment is initiated in the vast majority of MG patients. No studies have
      quantified the effect in a randomized trial, and no studies have examined the potential
      difference in effect in newly diagnosed patients as compared to patients on stable,
      antimyasthenic medications.

      The study will investigate the effect in two groups

        1. Newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients.

        2. MG patients on stable antimyasthenic medication.

    <description>De-novo: Each capsule contains 60 mg. pyridostigmine. 1 capsule is administered twice within 4 hours.
Chronic: Each capsule contains 60 mg. pyridostigmine. Number of administered capsules per dosage depend on the patient's usual dosage. Study drug is administered twice within 4 hours.
Patients are examined/rated before 1st dose, 1 hour after 1st dose, 1 hour after 2nd dose (Visit 1). After cross-over (Visit 2), patients will be rated open-label at 1 month (Visit 3) and 3 months (Visit 4).</description>
