  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase III randomized trial to compare the efficacy in terms of overall survival of two
      follow-up strategies (conventional versus intensive) among smokers and/or alcohol drinkers
      patients, older than 35 year, in complete remission 2-4 months after treatment of head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma Patients will be randomized after the post-treatment check-up
      (clinical examination and reference imaging including PET-CT for patients ≥ N2) performed 2
      to 4 months after the end of treatment. The randomization ratio is 1:1.

These 3 exams are performed every year during 3 years after inclusion (i.e. 3 CT-scan, 3 digestive endoscopies and 3 PET-CT per patient). Clinical follow up will be conducted as in the conventional follow up group and panendoscopy or bronchoscopy will be performed if needed. After 3 years, patients will be followed by conventional follow-up.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females aged superior to 35 years

          -  Current or previous smokers (smoked more than 10 packs year) or alcohol drinkers
             (current or previous, more than 140 g alcohol per week) or both

          -  Histologically proven invasive HNSCC stage 0 to IVa, excluding T4b and nasopharynx.
             Patients with in situ carcinoma are eligible.

          -  Treated with curative intent

          -  Free of cancer at the post-treatment clinical and radiological examination (negative
             PET-CT for N≥2) at least 2 months after the end of the last treatment and no later
             than 4 months after. If there is a strong doubt of lack of complete remission (for
             example if more exams or longer follow-up are needed to affirm or deny complete
             remission), the patient is not eligible for the trial.

          -  Remark: Patients with several head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (concomitant or
             successive), all treated with curative intent and all in complete remission, are
             eligible.

          -  Agree to have a long term follow-up

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Patient affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of the same

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Severe psychiatric condition that may inhibit protocol participation and in the
             judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

          -  Impossibility to perform the planned exams of the intensive strategy

          -  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

          -  Other malignancies within 5 years prior to randomization that needs followup by
             PET-scan or chest CT or head and neck CT/MRI

          -  Any disease that needs follow-up by regular upper digestive endoscopy
