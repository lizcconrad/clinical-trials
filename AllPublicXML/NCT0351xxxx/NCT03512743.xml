  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large amounts of experimental and animal evidence have confirmed that iron accumulation is
      associated with bone loss. However, it is still lack of the clinical studies relating iron
      accumulation to bone loss, especially in the pathological conditions during our Chinese. In
      this study, the investigators aim to assess the association between the levels of serum
      ferritin and bone mineral density in Chinese healthy postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the past few years, an increasing number of in vitro studies show the association of iron
      accumulation with bone loss, particularly in postmenopausal women. And body iron accumulation
      is accurately reflected by levels of serum ferritin in clinic. The levels of serum ferritin
      among healthy women are about 13-150μg/L, and we give a definition of iron accumulation when
      serum ferritin range from 500μg/L to 1000 μg/L. How will the bone mineral density change in
      iron accumulation? The investigators intend to perform this study to explore and establish
      the relational function and logical function between serum ferritin, bone mineral density and
      biochemical markers of bone metabolism in Chinese healthy postmenopausal women.

        The study population consists of postmenopausal women aged 55 years or older who shall
        undergone comprehensive routine health examinations at the Second Affiliated Hospital of
        Soochow University, and on whom BMD, serum ferritin concentrations and bone turnover
        markers will be measured.The visitors are usually healthy and receive extensive screening
        tests for early detection of malignancy, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other age-related
        disease.
