      A study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single intra-articular
      injection of UBX0101 in patients diagnosed with painful osteoarthritis of the knee.

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose
      study that will evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of UBX0101 in patients
      diagnosed with painful femoro-tibial osteoarthritis.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to receive UBX0101 or placebo in 3:1 randomization by
      dose level (cohort).

      The primary objective is to establish the safety and tolerability of UBX0101 given as a
      single intra-articular injection into the femoro-tibial joint of patients with
      osteoarthritis.
