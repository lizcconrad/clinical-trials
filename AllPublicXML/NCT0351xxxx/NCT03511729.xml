  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed studies are aimed to measure Tau and P-Tau levels in pre- and postoperative
      blood, urine, feces and saliva, as well as to assess pre- and postoperative neurocognitive
      function in children (3 to 5 years old) who will have surgery under general anesthesia
      (single versus multiple exposures). The studies will establish a system to study biomarkers
      of the anesthesia/surgery-associated neurocognitive impairment in children and generate
      hypothesis that Tau or P-Tau serves as the biomarker of such neurocognitive impairment in
      children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed studies have two specific aims:

        1. To investigate the relationship between pre-operative or postoperative blood levels of
           Tau or P-Tau and neurocognitive outcomes. The working hypothesis is that pre- and
           postoperative blood Tau/P-Tau levels are higher in participants who develop
           neurocognitive impairment than those in the participants who do not develop it. The
           investigators will perform neurocognitive test before the surgery and then at 12 months
           after the surgery. The investigators will collect pre-operative and postoperative blood
           and measure Tau/P-Tau levels in the blood. Finally, the association of the changes in
           the Tau/P-Tau levels and neurocognitive scores will be assessed. More importantly, this
           Aim will establish an eligible: recruit ratio, retention rates, safety of the protocol,
           and power calculation, which will provide crucial information to guide better design of
           future R01 study.

        2. To perform the feasibility studies of measuring Tau or P-Tau in urine, feces and saliva
           of the participants. The working hypothesis is that Tau/P-Tau in urine, feces or saliva
           of children can be measured. The investigators will use the nanobeam to measure
           Tau/P-Tau levels before and after the surgery. The investigators will then determine
           whether urine, feces and saliva can be used for the future studies to develop Tau/P-Tau
           as the biomarker of anesthesia/surgery-associated neurocognitive impairment in children.
