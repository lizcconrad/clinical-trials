  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine how measuring strength (by squeezing a tool called a
      hand grip dynamometer) and cardiorespiratory fitness (by climbing stairs) and sharing the
      results with subjects impacts exercise.

      The Understanding Fitness Function in Determining Activity (UFFDA) Study was initiated at the
      2014 and 2015 Minnesota State Fair to determine if measuring muscular strength and CRF would
      motivate individuals to increase their physical activity. Eligible individuals consented to
      participate and were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to control or intervention groups. All
      participants provided their current Exercise Vital Sign (EVS calculated by multiplying the
      number of moderate-vigorous exercise sessions/week by the average minutes/session). The
      intervention group had VO2max estimated using a timed previously validated Step Test and
      muscular strength measured using a Hand Dynamometer. Results with age appropriate normative
      data for both grip strength and a &quot;good or superior&quot; VO2max were provided to the intervention
      group. Our hypothesis was participants who receive the intervention would increase physical
      activity (measured by EVS) compared to control participants.
