  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin self-examination for melanoma (SSE) educational materials were developed with the
      input provided by women undergoing screening mammograms. The investigators seek to evaluate
      the performance of SSE by women and find out if women seek care with a dermatologist for a
      concerning mole or for a melanoma screening examination by a dermatologist after reviewing
      the materials received during the mammogram visit. The purpose of this study is to enhance
      the early detection of melanoma among women who are engaging in health promotion by having
      mammograms. The investigators specifically aim to evaluate the performance of SSE by women,
      who receive information during their mammogram appointment, and then follow-up with
      dermatology for a melanoma screening examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is the second phase of a project assessing the feasibility and
      effectiveness of enhancing the early detection of melanomas among women, who are engaging in
      health promotion by having mammograms. The initial phase of the project framed risk messages,
      developed posters and brochures with the input provided by women undergoing screening
      mammograms, and assessed the feasibility of delivering the program during the mammogram visit
      at the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center of Northwestern Medicine/ Prentice Women's
      Hospital. The investigators seek to evaluate performance of skin self-examination (SSE) by
      women, who receive information during their mammogram appointment, and follow-up with
      dermatology for a melanoma screening examination. In the second phase, a more intensive
      intervention in which women will not only receive information about SSE, but will also
      receive a reminder to perform SSE one week after the screening mammogram and information on
      how to schedule an appointment with dermatology will be provided. The number of women who
      perform SSE at home and find a concerning mole (lesion), number who see a dermatologist, and
      number who have a concerning lesion biopsied will be compared in two arms of the study 1)
      women who receive the intensive intervention 2) women who receive the informational brochure
      about SSE alone. The hypothesis is that women who receive more the intensive educational
      intervention will be more likely to perform SSE at home and schedule a follow-up
      dermatologist appointment as compared to those who receive the information brochure alone.
      This project builds upon Robinson's successful SSE training program for melanoma patients
      that resulted in patients' accurate evaluations of suspicious lesions relative to
      dermatologists' skin examinations.
