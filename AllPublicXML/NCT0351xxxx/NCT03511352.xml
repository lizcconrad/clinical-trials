  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol &quot;Sedentary Behavior Interrupted: A randomized crossover trial of acute effects
      on biomarkers of healthy aging in the laboratory (Project 1)&quot; is part of a National
      Institutes of Aging Program Grant called &quot;Sedentary Time &amp; Aging Mortality and Physical
      Function (STAR). The overall purpose of the STAR program to is to better understand how to
      interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging in postmenopausal women. This
      protocol (also referred to Project 1 of the STAR program) is a 3-condition randomized
      crossover clinical trial of up to 86 postmenopausal women to test whether different
      interruptions to prolonged sitting improve metabolism.

      The specific aims of this protocol include:

      Aim 1. To investigate the acute effect of sitting interruption modalities on postprandial
      glucose and insulin concentrations, compared to prolonged sitting.

      Aim 2. To investigate the acute effect of sitting interruption modalities on the physiologic
      parameters of endothelial function, compared to prolong sitting.

      Aim 3. To explore the moderating effect of age.
