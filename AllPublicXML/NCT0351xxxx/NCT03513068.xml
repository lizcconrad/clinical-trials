    <textblock>
      To evaluate changes in activity based on the use of portable oxygen concentrators combined
      with standard of care (SOC) long- term oxygen therapy versus SOC long-term oxygen therapy
      alone at 12 weeks in patients with COPD who require continuous (24/7) long-term oxygen
      therapy. The study will also assess oxygen usage, quality of life, hospitalizations and
      death.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is 40 years or older.

          2. Patient has a documented diagnosis of COPD.

          3. Patient qualifies for continuous (24/7) long-term oxygen therapy.

          4. Patient is prescribed oxygen at ≤ 5 L/min.

          5. Patient is POC-naïve, i.e., has not used a POC prior to enrolling in this study.

          6. Patient is able to tolerate pulsed oxygen therapy, i.e., oxygen delivered via a POC.

          7. Patient is able to fully understand study information and provide signed informed
             consent and HIPAA authorization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient's condition is contraindicated for the use of a POC.

          2. Patient has uncontrolled or untreated sleep-disordered breathing that is uncontrolled
             or untreated.

          3. Patient is unable to complete the 6-minute walk test.

          4. Patient has a diagnosis (within less than two weeks prior to study entry) of pneumonia
             or respiratory infection, and/or acute bronchitis requiring antibiotics, or
             new/increased dose of systemic corticosteroids.

          5. Patient has had thoracic surgery or another procedure in the six months prior to
             enrollment that is likely to cause instability of pulmonary status.

          6. Patient has an open skin ulcer or rash where the activity monitor will be worn on the
             body.

          7. Patient has a life expectancy &lt; 1 year.

          8. Patient has non-COPD lung disease that may affect oxygenation or survival.

          9. Patient has a planned intervention(s) requiring hospitalization within the three
             months of study participation.

         10. Patient is pregnant or planning to become pregnant.

         11. Patient is participating in a clinical study of a medical product and has not
             completed the required follow-up period.

         12. Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, should be excluded from the study.
