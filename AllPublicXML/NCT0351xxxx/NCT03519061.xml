  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to assess the impact of a 90 day course of high volume budesonide
      irrigations for patients who have failed other medical therapy and assessing the impact of
      the budesonide irrigations on the need for sinus surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient who meet eligibility requirements will be given the opportunity to use a budesonide
      saline rinse twice daily for 90 days. At the completion of this therapy, their clinical
      situation will be reassessed and patients will either proceed to surgery or not. If eligible
      patients choose not participate, they will be offered surgery up front. The study will be
      assessing symptom scores using the SNOT-22 validated patient reported symptoms score, CT
      scans, and other measures. The study hypothesizes that a significant portion of patients that
      otherwise would have progressed to surgery will no longer need to have surgery based upon
      improvements in their overall symptoms scores after using budesonise irrigations.

    <description>Improvement in SNOT 22 scores, using a total score value. The total score can range from 0 to 110 in its composite score, with higher values indicating worse symptoms. The outcome would measure improvements beyond the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) score of 8.9 lower (lower indicating improvement of symptoms).</description>
