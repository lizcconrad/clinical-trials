  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that some of the circadian photoreceptors, the intrinsically photosensitive
      retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), project directly to the amygdala, an area of the brain
      implicated in PTSD. Thus, a self-administered morning light treatment at home (shifts clock
      earlier and stimulates ipRGCs) may be a potentially efficacious adjunctive strategy for
      reducing PTSD symptoms. This study will test a 4 week daily 1 hour morning light treatment
      (active vs placebo) in individuals with PTSD. Outcome measures include measures of PTSD and
      depression.

    <measure>Change in PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) scores over 4 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is the gold standard measure of PTSD symptom severity. Range: 0-80. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. We will assess change in PCL-5 scores over 4 weeks of treatment [Week 2 through Week 6 of the study].</description>

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) is the gold standard measure of depression symptom severity. Range: 0-27. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. We will assess change in PHQ-9 scores over 4 weeks of treatment [Week 2 through Week 6 of the study].</description>

    <description>Sleep duration will be captured using actigraphy data collected by the wrist actigraphy monitor worn by subjects throughout the intervention. We will assess change in sleep duration over 4 weeks of treatment [Week 2 through Week 6 of the study].</description>

    <description>The Retimer light device in this study is a commercially-available wearable light device. It permits ambulation while receiving light from LEDs positioned below the eyes. The LEDs emit green light (~500nm, 230 ÂµW/m2, 500 lux), close to the peak sensitivity of circadian photoreceptors.</description>
