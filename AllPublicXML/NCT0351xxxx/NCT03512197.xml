  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the preliminary evidence from early clinical trials
      that midostaurin may provide clinical benefit not only to AML patients with the
      FLT3-mutations but also in FLT3-MN (SR&lt;0.05) AML (FLT3 mutant to wild type signal ratio below
      the 0.05 clinical cut-off).

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of midostaurin in combination with
      daunorubicin or idarubicin and cytarabine for induction and intermediate-dose cytarabine for
      consolidation, and midostaurin single agent post-consolidation therapy in newly diagnosed
      patients with FLT3-MN (SR&lt;0.05) AML.

    <measure>Event Free Survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of Randomization up to 5 years of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as the time from randomization to failure to obtain a Complete Remission (CR) or Morphologic Complete Remission without hematopoietic recovery (CRi) with adequate blood count recovery(adequate for treatment continuation) in induction, relapse after CR or CRi with adequate blood count recovery or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first as assessed by the investigator</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between randomization to date of death up to 5 years of follow-up of last patients</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to any cause. Patients will enter the survival follow-up phase once they complete the safety follow up period (30 days after the last dose of midostaurin/placebo) in case of induction failure or have relapse during post-treatment follow-up. Patients will then be contacted by telephone every 3 months +/- 2 weeks or have a visit to follow up on their survival status</description>

    <description>CIR is defined for patients with CR or CRi with adequate blood count recovery and is time from achieving CR or CRi with adequate blood count recovery until the onset of relapse from CR or CRi with adequate blood recovery. Patients without relapse are censored at the last adequate response assessment. Patients who died without relapse are counted as a competing cause of failure.

    <description>The EQ5D-5L questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The patient is asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The questionnaire also included a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), where the patient is asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state.</description>
