  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of FPA150, an anti-B7H4 antibody in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. The Phase 1a, open-label, cohort will identify a recommended dose of FPA150 to use
      for Phase 1b.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed solid tumors except primary central nervous system (CNS)
             tumors.

          -  Disease that is unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic.

          -  Patients must have had progressive disease during or after, or refused, appropriate
             standard therapy for their tumor type.

          -  All patients must have at least one measurable lesion at baseline according to RECIST
             v1.1; tumor sites situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to
             other loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been
             demonstrated progression in the lesion.

          -  Adequate washout for prior anti-cancer therapy (ie, ≥ 5 half-lives or 4 weeks since
             the last dose, whichever is shorter).

          -  Availability of archival tumor tissue and consent to providing archival tumor for
             retrospective biomarker analysis, or willingness to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy
             during screening (a biopsy is required for patients in the Phase 1a Dose Exploration
             portion).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Prior radiotherapy must be completed at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Prior radiopharmaceuticals (eg strontium, samarium) must be completed at least 8 weeks
             before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria:

               -  Neutrophils ≥ 1200 cells/ µL

               -  Platelets ≥ 75 × 103/ µL

               -  Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5× ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 40 mL/ minute

               -  AST and ALT &lt; 3× ULN

               -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5× ULN (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome, who must have
                  total bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dL)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Immunosuppressive doses of systemic medications, such as steroids or absorbed topical
             steroids (doses &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent daily) must be discontinued at
             least 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug. Short courses of high dose steroids
             or continuous low dose (prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day ) are allowed.

          -  Decreased cardiac function with New York Heart Association (NYHA) &gt; Class 2 at
             screening.

          -  Uncontrolled or significant heart disorder such as unstable angina.

          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) per institutional guidelines &gt; 450 msec for
             males or &gt; 470 msec for females at screening.

          -  Current unresolved infection or history of chronic, active, clinically significant
             infection (viral, bacterial, fungal, or other) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude the patient from exposure to a biologic agent or may pose
             a risk to patient safety.

          -  Any uncontrolled medical condition or psychiatric disorder which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would pose a risk to patient safety or interfere with study
             participation or interpretation of individual patient results.

          -  Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with Type I diabetes
             mellitus, hypothyroidism requiring only hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as
             vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger, are permitted to enroll.

          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 or 2 or
             known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or detectable hepatitis C
             virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection.

          -  Ongoing adverse effects from prior treatment &gt; Grade 1 (with the exception of Grade 2
             alopecia or peripheral neuropathy) based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

          -  Symptomatic interstitial lung disease or inflammatory pneumonitis.

          -  Untreated or active CNS or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients are eligible if
             metastases have been treated and patients are neurologically returned to baseline or
             neurologically stable (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS
             treatment) for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis. Patients receiving stable therapeutic
             doses of anti-coagulants will be permitted.

          -  Transfusion of blood or platelets completed within 72 hours before the first dose of
             study drug.
