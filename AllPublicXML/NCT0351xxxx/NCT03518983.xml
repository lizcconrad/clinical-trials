  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, sham-controlled randomized, 2 parallel arms, clinical trial with a
      12-month recruitment period. All patients will be PDE5I users/responders. After 1 month
      wash-out period, ED patients will be screened, in order to randomize 70 men with vasculogenic
      ED.Patients will be randomized in 2 groups (35 subjects in each group) to receive shockwave
      treatments (12 sessions for all subjects, 5000 shockwaves at each session), twice a week
      (total of 6 weeks) either at energy level 7 or at sham-control , without treatment interval.
      The IIEF-ED domain will be evaluated at Visit 1 and, consequently, at baseline and all follow
      up visits together with the SEP diaries.
