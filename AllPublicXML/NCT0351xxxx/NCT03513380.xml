  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess if playing a newly developed videogame that require
      physical activity (e.g. exergame) can lead to health benefits. The project will include 50
      adult participants that are not particularly physically active. They will be randomized into
      two groups where one group will be given free access to the exergame for 6 months. The
      physical fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), blood markers of cardiometabolic health and
      body composition of the subjects will be tested before, mid-ways and after the intervention
      period. Also, the participants gaming frequency will be registered throughout the 6-month
      period. Aim of this study is to investigate if access to this game can provide health
      benefits for individuals who are not motivated to take part in regular physical activity.
