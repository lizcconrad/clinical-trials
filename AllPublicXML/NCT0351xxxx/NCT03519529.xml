  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sex hormone-binding globulin(SHBG) is a surrogate marker of insulin resistance. This study
      aims at the characteristic and clinical significance of SHBG and testosterone in patients
      with type 2 diabetes(T2D).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recorded clinical factors, biochemical criterion such as serum levels of
      glucose and lipids, HbA1c, SHBG, testosterone, insulin, EPO, C-peptide, glucagon,
      microalbuminuria, glycemic variation via CGM, carotid plaque, ECG and ultrasonic cardiogram
      in patients with T2D who visited in the Department of Endocrinology at the Nanjing First
      Hospital from January 2015 to Aprol 2018. The relationship between levels of SHBG,
      testosterone and glycemic variation/diabetic complications are analysed.
