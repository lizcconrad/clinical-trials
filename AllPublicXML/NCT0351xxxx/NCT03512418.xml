  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will deploy a novel, personalized, smartphone-based intervention (PrEPSteps) that
      responds to real time PrEP adherence and non adherence detected through the use of a digital
      pill. The PrEPSteps intervention will be developed and refined through a series of focus
      groups. Participants will be screened at a baseline assessment, they will then use the
      digital pill system for 2 weeks, then undergo randomization to using PrEPSteps + the digital
      pill, or the digital pill alone to measure PrEP adherence. Participants will undergo 3
      monthly study visits where the investigators will assess adherence, conduct pill counts,
      obtain dried blood spots to confirm adherence, provide substance use disorder counseling and
      obtain urine drug screens. At the final study visit, the investigators will conduct a
      semi-structured qualitative interview grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model to
      understand the user response to PrEPSteps and the digital pill.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PrEPSteps is a novel, smartphone-based behavioral intervention that delivers PrEP adherence
      messages in response to detected PrEP ingestion via an innovative digital pill. PrEPSteps
      comprises 1) an adaptation of LifeSteps, an evidence-based medication adherence behavioral
      intervention, with smartphone-delivered booster sessions, 2) messages of contingent
      reinforcement and corrective feedback, and 3) stimulant use screening, brief assessment, and
      referral to treatment. In this K23, the investigators will first refine and inform the
      specification of PrEPSteps with a series of focus groups. The investigators will next test
      the feasibility, acceptability and potential for an effect of PrEPSteps to boost PrEP
      adherence in a pilot randomized controlled trial of men who have sex with men (MSM) with
      stimulant use. Finally, the investigators will conduct qualitative interviews among
      participants who used PrEPSteps to understand the participant response to living with the
      intervention.

    <description>The digital pill comprises a standard gelatin capsule with an integrated radiofrequency emitter that overencapsulates the desired medication (Truvada). When participants ingest the digital pill, the chloride ion gradient in the stomach activates the radiofrequency emitter which transmits direct evidence of medication ingestion to a wearable reader which relays this data to the participant's smartphone and cloud server.</description>
