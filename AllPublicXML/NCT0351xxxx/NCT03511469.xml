      The rate of re-dislocation after arthroscopic bankart repair is up to 30%. The most important
      dynamic structure that prevents re-dislocation is the rotator cuff muscles. The aim of our
      study is to investigate the efficacy of contralateral training on patients with arthroscopic
      Bankart surgery. Patients with arthroscopic Bankart surgery will be included in the study.
      The patients will be randomly assigned into 3 groups and the first group will be the control
      group, the second group will be the concentric group and the third group will be the
      eccentric group. Standard rehabilitation program will be applied to all groups until 3 months
      after surgery. Between 2nd and 12nd weeks after surgery, concentric strengthening program
      will be applied to the rotator cuff muscles with isokinetic dynamometer to the 2nd group. In
      group 3, the eccentric strengthening program will be applied to the rotator sheath muscles
      with the same isokinetic dynamometer from the 2nd week until 12nd week .

      The strength of the rotator sheath muscles will be measured in pre-op period, post-op week 12
      and post-op month 6 with the isokinetic dynamometer in all patients. In addition, functional
      tests will be performed in pre-op period and post-op 6 months (Y balance test for upper
      extremity, Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test and Medicine Ball Throw Test).

      The return to sport after bankart surgery is very high. Yet, the rate of re-dislocation after
      arthroscopic bankart repair is up to 30%. The most important dynamic structure that prevents
      re-dislocation is the rotator cuff muscles. The aim of our study is to investigate the
      efficacy of contralateral training on patients with arthroscopic Bankart surgery. Patients
      with arthroscopic Bankart surgery will be included in the study. The patients will be
      randomly assigned into 3 groups and the first group will be the control group, the second
      group will be the concentric group and the third group will be the eccentric group. Standard
      rehabilitation program will be applied to all groups until 3 months after surgery. Between
      2nd and 12nd weeks after surgery, concentric strengthening program will be applied to the
      rotator cuff muscles with isokinetic dynamometer to the 2nd group. In group 3, the eccentric
      strengthening program will be applied to the rotator sheath muscles with the same isokinetic
