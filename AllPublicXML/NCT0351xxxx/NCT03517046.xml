  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of implanting bead-type
      autologous chondrocytes (CartiLife®) obtained by culturing expanded costal chondrocytes of
      the patient with a chondral defect in the knee. The patients will be assessed clinically
      using clinical, biochemical and IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) outcomes
      preoperatively as well as 4, 8, 24 and 48 weeks postoperatively to assess the relief of
      symptoms and joint function.

    <description>Biological: CartiLife® Procedure: CartiLife® is beads (1.0 to 1.5 mm in diameter) in suspension, developed from autologous chondrocytes. The beads are implanted in a volume of 1 cm3 per the capacity of the syringe to the affected area through injection with a fibrin adhesive through minimal arthrotomy.</description>
