  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to assess whether treatment adaptation based on a very
      early FDG-PET/CT results in improved efficacy while minimizing treatment toxicity in advanced
      stage Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) patients treated with brentuximab vedotin (BV)-containing
      regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm phase II study investigates the value of early FDG-PET-response adapted
      BV-based therapy for advanced HL. All patients will receive one cycle of BrAVD followed by an
      FDG-PET/CT. Patients with a negative early FDG-PET(Deauville score 1-3) will continue with
      five more BrAVD cycles (total six cycles) while patients with a positive FDG-PET should shift
      to six cycles of BrECADD.

      The hypothesis is that the efficacy will be comparable to the efficacy of BEACOPPesc and
      BrECADD, while using the intensive chemotherapy regimen only for those patients who do not
      achieve a negative FDG-PET after one cycle.

      The choice to assess the treatment sensitivity by PET after a single cycle of BrAVD is based
      on results from a recent international multicenter study comparing FDG-PET/CT after one and
      two cycles of ABVD chemotherapy in HL. There is no reason to suspect that FDG-PET1 should be
      less prognostic after BrAVD than after ABVD.

      With this trial, the investigators believe they can add important information about the
      optimal treatment of BV-containing first-line treatment for advanced HL, and thus answer
      important therapeutic questions that are likely to otherwise remain unanswered even after the
      Echelon-1 and HD21 trials reach mature results. This relatively large single-arm phase II
      trial of 150 patients will allow a meaningful comparison with the BrAVD and BrECADD regimens
      based on modified progression-free survival (primary endpoint) and progression-free survival
      (secondary endpoint) respectively.

    <description>Modified PFS (mPFS) is defined as the time interval between the date of treatment start and the date of the first of:
Progressive disease (PD)
Start of new treatment for Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) when not in Complete Response at the end of protocol treatment; in this case, the date of mPFS is the date of the FDG-PET/CT scan at the end of protocol treatment. Switching therapy prior to end of protocol treatment for reasons other than Progressive Disease is not considered an event for mPFS. &quot;End of protocol treatment&quot; refers to completion of the planned protocol treatment with no more than 1 missed cycle, including radiotherapy on PET positive lesions if administered
