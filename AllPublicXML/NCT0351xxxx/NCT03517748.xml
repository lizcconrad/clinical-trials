    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentric, comparative, randomized, investigator-blinded, in parallel
      groups study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of DM05 in comparison with Optive™, in terms
      of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score) on patients with moderate to severe ocular
      dryness, after 35 days of treatment.

      Evaluation of the non-inferiority of DM05 in comparison with OptiveTM, in terms of cornea and
      conjunctiva staining (Oxford score), on worse eye, between D0 and D35.

        -  Comparison of D35 versus D0 and D84 versus D0 for each product and comparison between
           products for the following parameters:

             -  Evolution of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score) on worse eye.

             -  Evolution of OSDI score (Ocular Surface Disease Index).

             -  Evolution of Van Bijsterveld score (Lissamine green staining) in worse eye.

             -  Evolution of Schirmer test result in worse eye.

             -  Evolution of Tear film Break-Up Time (TBUT) in worse eye.

             -  Evolution of ocular dryness severity by evaluation of each main symptom by the
                patient and total score of all symptoms

             -  Evaluation of treatment performance by the investigator and the patient.

        -  Evaluation of the average frequency of use during 84 days for DM05 and OptiveTM.

      Selection visit: D-14 to D-7

      Wash-out period: 1 to 2 weeks with preservative-free 0.9% NaCl at 3 drops per day
      (Hydrabak®):

    <intervention_model_description>Because the comparator will be in commercial packaging, the blinding of the subject is not possible.
However, the study will be blinded for the investigator: evaluations will be done by an independent investigator, different than the person who will distribute the product. Subjects will be identified by a patient number. Each patient number will be associated to a treatment number, according to a randomization list provided before the beginning of the clinical investigation, and randomized either in one of both treatment groups (DM05 or Optive®).</intervention_model_description>
