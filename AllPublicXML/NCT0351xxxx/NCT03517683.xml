  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension is the most common complication of neuraxial anesthesia in obstetric patients and
      its prevalence in cesarean section is about 50-90%. Maternal hypotension causes unpleasant
      symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression, and cardiac
      arrest. Hypotension may reduce placental perfusion and result in fetal acidosis and
      neurological injury. Several techniques have been proposed to prevent hypotension.

      The recommended spinal block height to ensure patient comfort for Cesarean delivery is T4-6.
      Clinically, it is desirable that the spread of local anesthetic through the cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) achieves a sensory level no higher than the T4 dermatome to avoid extensive
      sympathetic block. It is also important that the spinal block level be no lower than T6 to
      avoid patient discomfort during peritoneal manipulation and uterine exteriorization. The
      effect of injection speed on spread of spinal anesthesia is controversial. Several studies
      have demonstrated more extensive spread with faster injection while others report either
      greater spread with slower injection, or no difference. Slow injection of hyperbaric
      bupivacaine 10 mg over 60 and 120 sec has been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of
      hypotension during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.

      Patients admitted to undergo elective c-section under spinal anesthesia will be randomized
      using the sealed envelope technique to Group I who will receive intrathecal injection in a
      slow speed 1ml in 15 sec and group II who will receive 1ml in 5 sec.

      The baseline pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation will be
      recorded intraoperatively. The presence of preoperative hypotension, nausea and vomiting, and
      level of block at 5 and 10 mins post intrathecal injection will be assessed .
