        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be receiving treatment in an ICU or in an acute care setting (e.g.,
             Emergency Room, Recovery Room).

          2. Subjects with either compelling evidence of infection OR clinical syndromes highly
             likely to be bacterial in origin, as follows (Please refer to Appendix B):

               1. Compelling objective evidence of bacterial infection and a known site of
                  infection: objective evidence would be met if patient has Gram stain evidence,
                  confirming a bacterial pathogen from normally sterile fluids (blood, urine, CSF,
                  peritoneal fluid, etc.), having either:

                    -  White Blood Cell (WBC) count greater &gt; 12,000/mm3 or &lt; 4,000/mm3 or &gt; 10%
                       bands within 36 hours of randomization OR

                    -  Temperature &lt;36°C or fever &gt;38°C

               2. Clinical syndromes highly likely to be bacterial in origin will also be
                  acceptable (e.g. peritonitis after bowel perforation, ischemic bowel requiring
                  resection); or acute severe community-acquired pneumonia with radiographic
                  evidence of single or multiple areas of pulmonary consolidation with purulent
                  sputum (Gram stain and culture results pending).

                    -  White Blood Cell (WBC) count greater &gt; 12,000/mm3 or &lt; 4,000/mm3 or &gt; 10%
                       bands within 36 hours of randomization AND

                    -  Temperature &lt;36°C or fever &gt;38°C

          3. Current treatment with intravenous antibiotics for the acute bacterial infection (i.e.
             not prophylactic antibiotics)

          4. Subjects with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction defined by at least one of the
             following:

               1. Cardiovascular Dysfunction occurs at the time vasopressors are initiated, and is
                  defined as requiring both adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressors* to
                  maintain Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) greater than or equal to (&gt;) 65 mmHg
                  (implies fluid resuscitation alone does not raise MAP to &gt; 65 mmHg). Adequate
                  fluid resuscitation is defined as:

                  • Intravenous administration of at least 20 mL/kg crystalloid or 10 mL/kg colloid
                  infusion within 6 hours.

                  OR

                    -  Central Venous Pressure (CVP) of greater than (&gt;) 8 mmHg or Pulmonary Artery
                       Wedge Pressure (PAWP) of greater than (&gt;) 12 mmHg.

                    -  * If dopamine is the only vasopressor used, the infusion rate must be
                       greater than (&gt;) 5 μg/kg/min (i.e., must be prescribed to support
                       cardio-pulmonary perfusion). If vasopressin is used, it must be given in
                       conjunction with another vasopressor.

               2. Respiratory Dysfunction is defined as the acute need for mechanical ventilation
                  and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &lt;250 (or &lt; 200 when lung is the site of infection). For
                  the purposes of this protocol, mechanical ventilation is defined as any type of
                  ventilation administered via an endotracheal tube or nasotracheal intubation. A
                  simple administration of supplemental oxygen is NOT considered to be mechanical
                  ventilation for the purposes of this study.

          5. Subjects with coagulopathy characterized by an INR &gt;1.40 without other known etiology
             (e.g., anticoagulant therapy, chronic liver disease), and having an onset at the time
             of the local laboratory blood draw yielding the result (point of care device INR
             results must be confirmed by local laboratory).

          6. Subjects with coagulopathy characterized by platelet count that meets any of the
             below, and having an onset at the time of the local laboratory blood draw yielding the
             result.

               1. ≥ 20,000/mm3 and &lt; 30,000/mm3 that upon retesting after platelet transfusion is ≥
                  30,000/mm3

               2. &gt; 30,000/mm3 to &lt; 150,000/mm3

               3. ≥ 30% decrease in platelet count within 24 hours

          7. First and last qualifying criteria of sepsis associated organ dysfunction, platelet
             count, and INR (results from local or transferring hospital) occurring in &lt; 24 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Candidates for the study will be excluded if ANY of the following criteria are present:

          1. Subject or Authorized Representative is unable or unwilling to provide informed
             consent (as applicable per local and country regulations)

          2. Subject is pregnant (positive serum or urine human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)) or
             breastfeeding or intends to get pregnant within 28 days of enrolling into the study

          3. Subject is &lt; 18 years of age

          4. Body weight &gt; 175 kg

          6. Presence of an advance directive to withhold life-sustaining treatment except
             Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or likely to have life support withdrawn within 24
             hours of consent

          7. Subject has had previous treatment with ART-123

          8. Platelet count &lt; 20,000/ mm3 for any reason, or for platelet count ≥ 20,000/mm3 and &lt;

             30,000/mm3

          9. Elevated INR, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia that is not due to sepsis, (e.g.
             patients treated by chemotherapy agent). Please refer to Appendix C as an example of
             agents known to cause myelosuppression that should be evaluated as the cause of
             potential leukopenia or thrombocytopenia

         11. &lt; 8 hours remaining from the end of a major surgery having a high risk of
             post-operative bleeding and randomization (e.g. extensive intraabdominal or

             arising during surgery, problems with hemostasis during surgery, surgeries of long
             duration, surgeries with large estimated blood loss).

             randomization)

         12. Stroke within 3 months prior to consent, trauma or major surgery within 3 months prior
             to consent that may increase the risk of bleeding

         13. Known bleeding diatheses or anatomical anomaly that predisposes to hemorrhage (e.g.
             hemophilia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, esophageal varices, arteriovenous
             malformation)

         14. Gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., melena, hematemesis) or genitourinary bleeding within
             6 weeks prior to consent unless a corrective interventional procedure has been

             anticoagulants exceeding thromboprophylaxis doses within 72 hours prior to the first
             dose of study drug (see Appendix D for more detail)

         17. Acute liver failure not due to sepsis, sepsis associated acute liver failure in any
             patient with a history of cirrhosis, Class C Chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh score
             of 10-15); (See Appendix E)

         18. Acute pancreatitis where infection has not been documented by a positive blood or
             abdominal fluid culture or Gram stain consistent with bacterial infection. Also, in
             the opinion of the treating physician the subject is at increased risk for developing
             hemorrhagic pancreatitis over the duration of the study

         19. Acute renal failure not due to sepsis or chronic renal failure requiring chronic RRT
             (Renal Replacement Therapy)
