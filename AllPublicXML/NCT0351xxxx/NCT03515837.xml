  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed plus platinum
      chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) with or without pembrolizumab (MK-3475; KEYTRUDA®) in
      the treatment of adults with the following types of tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (TKI)-resistant, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated, metastatic non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors: 1) TKI-failures (including osimertinib [TAGRISSO®]
      failure) with T790M-negative mutation tumors, 2) T790M-positive mutation tumors with prior
      exposure to osimertinib, and 3) first-line osimertinib failure regardless of T790M mutation
      status.

      The primary study hypotheses are that the combination of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy has
      superior efficacy compared to saline placebo plus chemotherapy in terms of: 1)
      Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1
      (RECIST 1.1) based on blinded independent central review, and 2) Overall Survival (OS). This
      study will be considered to have met its success criteria if the combination of pembrolizumab
      plus chemotherapy is superior to saline placebo plus chemotherapy in terms of PFS or OS.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST 1.1. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. The PFS for participants will be presented.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 59 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up. The OS of participants will be presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who experience a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1.

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who experience a response of CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response until earliest date of PD or death from any cause, whichever comes first. DOR will be assessed per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR. The DOR of participants who experience a CR or PR will be presented.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. For Global Health Status, participants are asked &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; Individual responses are given on a 7-point scale (1=Very poor; 7=Excellent), with a higher score indicating a better outcome.
