  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research questions/hypotheses: About 15% of the population over 40 years of age are affected
      by diseases of the retina. Accurate measurement of the extent of visual field impairment is
      of highest importance for disease subtype diagnosis and severity classification. The current
      gold-standard approach for the assessment of macular sensitivity is microperimetry (MP) where
      the patient is asked to report whether or not visual stimuli presented at different positions
      within the visual field are detected. While this technique is a very straightforward approach
      and simple in its application, it is important to note that MP is psychophysical in nature
      and requires constantly high attentional performance of the patient throughout the
      examination period. As many patients suffering from retinal diseases are well over 65 years
      of age, they are unable to maintain such high levels of attention over longer periods and,
      thus, MP results may be biased. Retinotopic assessment using population receptive field (pRF)
      mapping based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers an alternative by
      allowing for objective visual field testing, independent of patient performance. We have
      shown previously in healthy subjects that pRF allows for accurate detection of simulated
      central scotomata down to 2.35 degrees radius. Also, pilot data in patients with retinal
      scotomata showed strong correspondence between pRF and MP results, i.e. macular regions with
      reduced macular sensitivity and atrophy of outer retinal layers correlated well with pRF
      coverage maps showing reduced density of activated voxels. The aim of this project is to
      determine whether pRF mapping could serve as an alternative visual field testing method by:
      (1) assessing test-retest reproducibility of pRF and MP in clinical populations with stable
      retinal diseases (Stargardt disease, geographic atrophy) over a four-week period; (2)
      assessing visual field changes over a one-year period in patients suffering from acute
      retinal scotomata (branch retinal artery occlusions, full-thickness macular holes). All pRF
      mapping will be accompanied by MP measurements to allow for a direct comparison of the two
      techniques.

      Scientific/scholarly innovation/originality of the project: The present project applies a
      novel approach for linking retinal function assessed with MP and pRF mapping in a
      representative patient population with acute and chronic retinal diseases. The project seeks
      to contribute to best practice methods for using fMRI to assess macular dysfunction both for
      documentation of the natural course of the disease and during therapy in a study setting.

      Methods: fMRI uses pRF mapping to provide retinotopic data (pRF coverage maps) that are then
      correlated with the results of conventional ophthalmic testing including MP, visual acuity
      and contrast sensitivity testing, reading performance, optical coherence tomography and
      autofluorescence imaging.

    <description>Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the correspondence between conventional functional assessment of retinal scotomata (microperimetry) and population-receptive field (pRF) mapping of the primary visual cortex measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients clinically diagnosed with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, Stargardts disease, branch retinal artery occlusions and full thickness macular holes before and after macular surgery. The microperimetry test grid (retinal sensitivity measured in Decibel, dB) willl be correlated with the pRF coverage maps calculated from fMRI data. Each dot represents the centre of a receptive field of a single voxel and every pRF centre is associated with a 2D Gaussian which together constitute the coverage map. Correspondence between coverage maps will be quantified by calculating the matching coefficient.</description>
