  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating how well a decision support tool works to improve
      clinicians' use of recommended chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) assessment
      and management strategies in participants receiving chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test a new clinician decision support tool for the assessment and
      management of CIPN. The algorithm is designed to help clinicians make decisions about which
      strategies to use for the assessment and/or management of CIPN. The investigators need to
      recruit participants receiving chemotherapy that is known to cause CIPN to determine how well
      the algorithm works to increase clinicians' use of recommended CIPN assessment and management
      strategies.

    <intervention_model_description>The study expect to enroll 142 patients, 50 clinicians, and 30 healthy controls for a total of 222.
71 patients will be recruited in Period 1 (usual care) and a separate 71 will be recruited in Period 2 (algorithm use). The 50 clinicians will be recruited prior to Period I and will participate in Periods I and II. We will use purposive sampling to recruit 30 health controls to match the age and demographic characteristics of the recruited patients. The healthy controls will receive no intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <intervention_name>CIPN Assessment and Management Algorithm</intervention_name>
    <description>The revised algorithm incorporates evidence-based CIPN assessment and management strategies and standardized CIPN/pain patient-reported outcomes measures. In terms of processes, trained study staff will administer the screening questionnaires (e.g., PRO-CTCAE, 0 - 10 numerical rating scale of worst CIPN pain intensity) to consented patients before their clinician visit (e.g., in the waiting room). Following patient completion of the screening questionnaires, study staff will provide the clinicians with a color-coded summary of the patients' responses to the screening questionnaires and the CIPN assessment and management algorithm. Clinicians may then use the algorithm at their discretion to guide the assessment and management of their patients' CIPN symptoms</description>
