  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution study enrolling women over age 25 with newly diagnosed breast
      cancer and for whom a breast MR has been ordered as standard of care. Subjects will undergo a
      hybrid dedicated Breast PET/MRI in lieu of a breast MRI alone, for evaluation of extent of
      disease prior to surgical and oncologic management. The study will investigate any
      incremental added benefit to breast MRI specificity by the addition of concurrent hybrid
      breast PET.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the combination of Breast PET/MRI, will improve specificity and
      decrease the number of false positive breast biopsies recommended based on breast MRI
      findings.

    <description>Sensitivity, PPV, and NPV for the diagnosis based on the entire PET/MRI and MRI alone will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-sided 90% confidence intervals constructed by Wilson score method.

    <description>Logistic regression and a cox proportional hazard model will be generated between hybrid FDG PET/MRI imaging features (SUV, T2 characteristics, enhancement pattern, kinetic curve, DWI) and tumor biology (pathological type, receptor status, Ki-67 and oncotype) and tumor recurrence (using a surrogate of Ki-67 and oncotyping when available), respectively.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to fill out a questionnaire at the conclusion of their breast PET/MRI exam assessing on a scale of 1 - 7 how important it was for them to save time to do the PET/MRI simultaneously knowing that they may have a negative PET/MRI for extent of disease (no additional sites of disease aside from index cancer), how valuable it is for them to potentially avoid unnecessary biopsies if the study hypothesis is correct, and how important it is to them to decrease delay to surgery.</description>
