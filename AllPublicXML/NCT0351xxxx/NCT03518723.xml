  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at improving the knowledge about resistance training for people with COPD.
      Resistance training is an important part of pulmonary rehabilitation when the goal is to
      improve muscular endurance and strength. The study will evaluate the effects and the
      feasibility of two resistance training programs for people with COPD using a parallel group
      design. One program will include a larger day-to-day variation (i.e. non-linear
      periodization) and the progression will be guided by ratings of dyspnea, muscle fatigue, and
      exertion. The other program will follow the established guidelines for resistance training
      for people with COPD. The programs will be evaluated for effects regarding muscular
      endurance, strength, intramuscular adaptions, functional preformance, dyspnea, and health
      related quality of life. The programs will also be evaluated for feasibility regarding the
      duration of training sessions, attendance rates, adverse events, and participant
      satisfaction. The hypothesis is that the non-linear periodization group will have superior
      effects and that feasibility aspects will be similar between groups.

    <description>The objective of the Non-linear Periodized Resistance Training (NLPRT) program is to increase muscle strength as well as muscle endurance. The NLPRT program will over the 8 week intervention period target several different aspects of limb muscle function, by alternating the intensity and volume of the exercises.
Progression of exercise is symptom dependent and will be based on Borg CR-10 ratings (dyspnea, muscle fatigue and exertion).
All exercises will be performed using exercise equipment that are available at each included center.
All sessions are supervised and conducted by local professionals using a group format, with approximately 2-4 participants per group.</description>
