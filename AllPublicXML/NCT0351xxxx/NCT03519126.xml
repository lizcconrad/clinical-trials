    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial whose objective is to compare the efficacy of transcutaneous
      electrostimulation of the posterior tibial nerve with intravaginal electrostimulation in the
      treatment of women with symptoms of idiopathic overactive bladder. The volunteers will be
      randomly randomized into three study groups: posterior tibial group, vaginal group and
      control group. They are evaluated at three times: before the start of treatment, at the end
      of 6 weeks of treatment and after 1 month (follow up). The evaluation will occur through a
      voiding diary and a quality of life questionnaire. For the treatment groups will be used
      depolarized biphasic current with frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 200 μs, and intensity
      according to the tolerance of the patient. The hypothesis of the study is that the two forms
      of electrostimulation for treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder will be effective, but
      transcutaneous electrostimulation of the posterior tibial nerve will be more effective than
      intravaginal.

      Objective: To compare the efficacy between intravaginal and transcutaneous electrostimulation
      of the posterior tibial nerve in the treatment of women with symptoms of idiopathic
      overactive bladder or mixed urinary incontinence.

      METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial with comparative
      analysis between study groups and a control, performed at three moments: pre and post
      clinical intervention and one month after the end of treatment. Vaginal electrostimulation
      group (GV), transcutaneous electrostimulation group of the posterior tibial nerve (GTP) and
      control group (CG - without intervention). The intervention groups will be treated with
      biphasic current with a frequency of 10 Hz and a pulse width of 200 μs for 12 sessions of 30
      minutes each. Participants will be evaluated and reevaluated by means of a general data
      questionnaire, 3-day urinary diary and an International Consultation on Incontinence
      Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB). Statistical analysis will be performed using
      SPSS version 22 and the level of significance adopted will be p &lt;0.05.

    <description>The impact of overactive bladder symptoms on the quality of life of the volunteers will be verified through the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB), which is a brief questionnaire with a high psychometric capacity to specifically evaluate overactive bladder. The ICIQ-OAB score ranges from 0 to 16 on a progressive scale, as well as an analog scale from zero to ten to quantify the discomfort caused by each symptom, the higher the score the worse the quality of life.</description>
