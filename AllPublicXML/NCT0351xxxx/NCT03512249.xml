    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial with two parallel
      groups.

        -  H56:IC31 (investigational vaccine)

        -  Placebo

           900 HIV-negative adults with a diagnosis of drug susceptible pulmonary TB are planned to
           be included, recruited from TB clinics with established relationships to the trial sites
           at the start of their TB treatment.

           4 trial sites are planned in South Africa (ZA): 1 site in Klerksdorp at the Aurum
           Institute and 3 sites in Cape Town at TASK, UCT Lung Institute and SATVI. 1 trial site
           is planned in Tanzania (TZ): 1 site in Mbeya at NIMR.

      This is a phase 2, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial with two parallel
      groups.

        -  H56:IC31 (investigational vaccine)

        -  Placebo

           900 HIV-negative adults with a diagnosis of drug susceptible pulmonary TB are planned to
           be included, recruited from TB clinics with established relationships to the trial sites
           at the start of their TB treatment. 4 trial sites are planned in South Africa (ZA): 1
           site in Klerksdorp at the Aurum Institute and 3 sites in Cape Town at TASK, UCT Lung
           Institute and SATVI. 1 trial site is planned in Tanzania (TZ): Mbeya at NIMR.

      Preclinical data suggest H56:IC31 may be more efficacious if administered while patients are
      still on treatment. Following the national guidelines for TB treatment in South Africa and
      Tanzania, we will obtain sputum samples from patients towards the end of treatment at about
      the same time they are obtained within the national TB control programmes, and if the sputum
      is smear negative, the criterion for successful treatment within TB programmes, the
      individual will be eligible for randomization and vaccination towards the end of their
      six-month treatment period.

      As this is a proof of concept TB vaccine study, HIV positive individuals have been excluded
      as it is not yet known what effect HIV infection may have on the immune response to the
      vaccine. However, HIV positive individuals are an important population to include in future
      studies should efficacy be demonstrated in this study.

    <masking_description>The unblinded persons in the study are the study vaccine manager (and designee) who manages the subject inventory log(s) at the trial site, the unblinded site staff, and the unblinded clinical trial site monitor(s) responsible for monitoring the investigational product at the trial site. All unblinded persons must take care to not reveal individual subject treatment assignments to any blinded member of the study team. There will be an unblinded contact person at the sponsor's site in order to manage queries from the unblinded site staff or the unblinded monitors in the trial.
The study vaccine manager (and designee) should be a designated site team member, such as the study pharmacist. Unblinded site staff must not participate in the evaluation of adverse events.
The randomization list will be provided by the unblinded statistician and will be implemented as a module in the eCRF.</masking_description>
