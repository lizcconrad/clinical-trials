    <textblock>
      To evaluate the impact of using virtual reality, VR, game playing on successful completion
      and reduction of distress and pain in pediatric venipuncture, and to increase adherence in
      obtaining the desired blood volume.

      Participants will be randomly assigned using a random number generator to either the virtual
      reality condition, or to the standard procedure that includes using books and/or watching
      movies as a standard method of distraction.

      Participants will take part in the study during their scheduled research venipuncture. The
      venipuncture lasts approximately 15-30 minutes. Pre and post venipuncture questionnaires for
      both participant and parent will take 15 minutes to complete. Total study time is between 30
      and 45 minutes. Questionnaires completed by research personal will take 15 minutes to
      complete.

    <description>Participants may be randomized to the virtual reality, VR, group or the standard of care group. For the VR group, we are using the Samsung VR Go (VR head set), Samsung S7 (phone) and programmed distraction (Spaceburgers, Pebbles the Penguin, and/or Happy Place). Spaceburgers and Pebbles the Penguin were designed by the Department of Anesthesiology at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford through the Stanford Chariot Program (Childhood Anxiety Reduction Through Innovation and Technology). Happy Place is a nongame immersive experience that will be offered to children uninterested in the previously mentioned game. Happy Place was designed by a Swedish Pharmacy Chain, Apotek Hjartat, aimed to distract patients from their pain with a peaceful, interactive environment. Each of the video games runs for the length of time needed to complete the venipuncture.</description>

    <description>Participants may be randomized to the virtual reality, VR, group or the standard of care group. The standard of care group will use various distractions. Distraction tools include books and movies using a wall mounted TV as standard practice.</description>
