  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to investigate the safety and potential ability of relocated
      autologous SVF (stromal vascular fraction) to restore erectile function in men with ED
      (erectile dysfunction).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, two-arm, blinded, randomized treatment. Covariate adaptive
      randomization will be used. Covariates included in the adaptive randomization process will be
      investigational center, history of diabetes, and radical prostatectomy. The two randomized
      study arms are:

        1. Treatment with SVF followed six months later with sham treatment (ARM 1)

        2. Sham treatment followed six months later by treatment with SVF (ARM 2) Study population
           is 60 adult male subjects with organic erectile dysfunction (IIEF-EF score 11-22) of
           greater than 6 months' duration due to radical prostatectomy, diabetes mellitus, and/or
           vascular disease. Subjects will be followed for 12 months after initial treatment.
