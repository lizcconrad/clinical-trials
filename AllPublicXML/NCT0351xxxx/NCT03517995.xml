  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if Prostaphane is effective and can help reduce the
      progression of bladder cancer. Researchers also want to find out if Prostaphane is safe and
      tolerable, and to evaluate how Prostaphane works to reduce the progression of bladder cancer.
      This study will compare Prostaphane with a placebo to see if taking Prostaphane is better
      than taking a placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks like Prostaphane but has no drug or
      other active ingredients in it.

      The study will be presented to eligible patients by the patient's surgeon at the time when an
      appointment is made for cystoscopy for suspicion of bladder cancer (BC) or to confirm BC
      diagnosis.

      The study will be presented to eligible patients by the patient's surgeon at the time when an
      appointment is made for cystoscopy for suspicion of bladder cancer (BC) or to confirm BC
      diagnosis.

      Participants will be asked to spend 21 to 30 days in this study. The study will be conducted
      during the time from when the participant is diagnosed with bladder cancer to when they
      undergo a surgical procedure for the treatment or removal of their bladder cancer. The
      surgical procedure is done as a part of their regular medical care. Participants will be
      asked to come for 1 additional visit as part of this research study at the midpoint between
      their biopsy and surgery.
