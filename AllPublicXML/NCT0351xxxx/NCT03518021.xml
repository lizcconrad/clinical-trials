  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare the clinical response to intramuscular and intranasal naloxone in
      pre-hospital opioid overdoses. Objective of the study is to measure and evaluate clinical
      response (return of spontaneous respiration within 10 minutes of naloxone administration) to
      a new nasal naloxone formulation in real opioid overdoses in the pre-hospital environment.
      The aim is to demonstrate that intranasal administration of naloxone is not clinically
      inferior to intramuscular administration, which is now standard treatment of care.

    <masking_description>The whole study team, including the statistician, will be blinded until after database lock and the primary analysis are done. The allocation list will be stored by by the Hospital Pharmacy Trondheim. There will not be automatic unblinding of SAEs. Study personnel do not have any access to the allocation list. An emergency option for individual unblinding is available to medical monitor in case of SAE/ SUSAR Study workers are blinded to the different preparations. This is carefully performed by covering the vials with neutral and opaque labels for &quot;study drug&quot;. The risk of for unintentional unblinding is very small. The procedure for securing credible blinding is described in the study protocol and approved by the Norwegian Medicines Agency.</masking_description>

    <description>Active compound naloxone 14 mg/ml, (±10%). Nasal spray will be administered with one puff (100 microL ±10%) in one nostril (1.4 mg dose) using the Aptar Unitdose device.
The spray device should be inserted about 1 cm into a nostril, pointing towards the ipsilateral ear and the plunger pushed in a firm and gentle manner for the formulation to be sprayed into the nose. After the plunger is inserted the device is immediately removed from the nose and assisted ventilation continued.</description>
