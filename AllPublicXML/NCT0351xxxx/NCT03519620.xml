      The present research aims to verify if there are differences in body composition and
      spirometric values in children aged between 6 and 12 years who practice swimming complemented
      with water walking at the end of each session and those who only practice swimming. The
      sample consisted of 28 individuals aged 6 to 12 years and was divided into two groups:
      swimming group (SG) with 9 children and swimming complemented with water walking group (SWWG)
      of 19 children. In this study, the investigators wanted to know which were the benefits in
      body composition and for that purpose used a bio-impedance scale Targa Silvercrest Z29777A
      (Germany), and an anthropometric tape to measure the waist circumference. To calculate the
      spirometric values, namely forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1) and even peak expiratory flow (PEF) a Cosmed Microquark spirometer was used. In terms
      of statistical procedures, the investigators used the program Statistical Package for the
      Social Sciences version number 20 (SPSS 20.0). The investigators used descriptive statistics
      (minimum, maximum, means and standard deviations), the Shapiro Wilk test for testing the
      normality of the sample, inferential statistics (non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests,
      Friedman's Anova, and for the calculation of the effect magnitude the d-Cohen test). After
      the data treatment, regarding the inter-group analysis (comparison between the swimming group
      and the swimming group with water walking) the investigators observed that there were
      significant differences in three variables at the end of the study, that is, at the end of
      the 3 moments. These variables were weight relative to body composition, forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF), these values are relative to the
      spirometry evaluation. Concerning intra-group differences (improvement in the swimming group
      and the swimming with water walking group in the three moments evaluated), the SWWG showed
      significant improvements in the variables of weight, muscle mass, fat mass, percentage of
      water, body mass index (BMI), body percentiles, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).
