  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1894, Devic first proposed the concept of neuromyelitis optica(NMO). NMO is an
      inflammatory demyelinating disease that selectively affects the central nervous system of the
      optic nerve and spinal cord.In 2004, Lennon and other persons found highly specific
      AQP4（aquaporin 4）antibodies in NMO patients'sera, and further differentiated between NMO and
      MS, confirming that NMO is an independent disease.At present, NMO has been widely recognized
      as an idiopathic and severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.In 2015, the
      international NMO diagnostic team developed the diagnostic criteria based on highly specific
      AQP4 antibodie.Up to now, in China, there is no data on the number of NMOSD patients, the
      rate of misdiagnosis, the treatment methods, and the prognosis.This study is committed to
      build China's NMOSD big data platform to provide the basis for diagnosis, treatment and
      prognosis of the disease.
