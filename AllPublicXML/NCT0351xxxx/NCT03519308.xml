  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to look at the potential effects of paricalcitol (a drug
      similar to vitamin D) and nivolumab on pancreatic tumors in patients who are treated with
      gemcitabine and abraxane. The study will also look at the safety of including paricalcitol
      and nivolumab as part of the gemcitabine and abraxane chemotherapeutic regimen.

          -  Subjects who are currently pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breast-feeding

               1. Females participants of child-bearing potential are required to use an effective
