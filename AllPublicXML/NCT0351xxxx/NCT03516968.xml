  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity prevalence is increasing and is a serious public health challenge. Indeed,
      according to INPES in 2006, overweight and obesity were affecting 18 % of French children
      between 3 and 17 years. 3 % of the boys and 4 % of the girls were classified as obese. Obese
      children are likely to develop chronic disease, starting at paediatric age, as cardiovascular
      or bone diseases, or type 2 diabetes.

      Vitamin D deficiency is recognized to play an essential role in bone metabolism and arterial
      hypertension and type 2 diabetes development.

      Obesity, in adults like in children, is associated with vitamin D deficiency. Common
      explanations for this low serum concentration of 25(OH)D in obese are the sequestration
      and/or the volumetric dilution of this lipid-soluble vitamin by adipose tissue. Therefore,
      obese population is at higher risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic complications.

      The nutrition comity of French Pediatric Society (SFP) edit vitamin D supplementation
      recommendations (2012) for adolescents at risk of deficit: supplementation by trimestral
      loading dose of 80 000 to 100 000 UI of vitamin D. However, for obese patients, the deficit
      is difficult to cure with classical loading doses. It seems that these patients need higher
      dose of Vitamin D (two to three times higher). Likewise, the optimum scheme of administration
      (daily vs monthly) was never evaluated.

      Given new physiopathological data on pleiotropic role of vitamin D (on bone, cardiovascular
      system, adipose tissue) and in light of consequence of obesity on these systems, it seems
      essential to obtain data on vitamin deficit correction in obese children and adolescents and
      to evaluate bone status of these patients using modern imaging technics (high resolution
      peripheral quantitative computed tomography, HRpQCT).

      In this context, the OBEVIDOS study, randomised multi-centre prospective in 156 obese
      children and adolescent will allow us for :

        -  evaluate vitamin D correction effect by two scheme of administration

        -  establish an inventory of vitamin D status in this population

        -  Modeling and simulation of vitamin D concentration in obese children and adolescents
           using a mathematical PBPK model

        -  study, in a patient sub-group, the impact of vitamin D deficit and of obesity by itself
           on bone, by analysing bone micro-architecture

          -  Aged between 5 to 18 year-old

          -  Being obese (BMI &gt;97th percentile for age and gender using the WHO references)

          -  Patients (parents) having given their informed consent

          -  Patient having insurance from the national health system

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children will be excluded from the study if:

          -  They suffer from symptomatic vitamin D deficiency (tetany, muscular hypotonia,
             hypocalcaemic seizure) or present signs of rickets at the X-ray (osteopenia and

             hypercalcaemia, liver/kidney disease, malabsorption diseases.

          -  They are under treatment of anticonvulsivants/barbiturates or steroids which increase
             the catabolism of 25(OH)D.

             allergy to class of drugs or the investigational product.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems,
