  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine alterations in the skin microbiome that occur during
      radiation therapy. The study design will examine changes secondary to ionizing radiation, and
      correlate these changes with the development and severity of radiation dermatitis. The goal
      is to improve understanding of the mechanism of radiation dermatitis.
