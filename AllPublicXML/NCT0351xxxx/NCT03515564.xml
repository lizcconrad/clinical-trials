  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conflict in Syria and Iraq has created a humanitarian crisis that includes hundreds of
      thousands of refugees who have experienced trauma and suffer from a greater incidence of
      trauma-related disorders as compared to the general population. The need for intervention is
      clear: our research team has determined prevalence of probable PTSD, anxiety, and depression
      in adults at rates of 32.2%, 40.3% and 47.7%, respectively and children at rates of 6.3% for
      PTSD and 52.9% for anxiety. Barriers to treatment include cultural ideations surrounding
      psychiatric treatment, language barriers posed to psychotherapy, and high dropout associated
      exposure therapy—the standard treatment for PTSD. To overcome these challenges, the
      investigators developed a behavioral health program that addresses not only the psychological
      but also the somatic components of trauma-related disorders which are common but often less
      addressed by traditional treatment. This 12-week family-based program offers weekly, 90
      minute sessions in Dance/Movement Therapy (DMT) or Art Therapy for children, mindful yoga for
      mothers, and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) for fathers as well as complimentary
      transportation to and from sessions. Self-report questionnaires and biological specimens
      (hair cortisol; saliva or blood inflammation markers) are collected at the beginning, middle,
      and end of the intervention phase, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months afterwards to measure acute
      and long-term effects of these treatments. By collecting psychological and biomarker data the
      investigators seek concrete scientific evidence supporting these non-pharmacological, cost
      effective, and accessible programs as reliable treatment options.

      Exposure to traumatic events can lead to a spectrum of mental health conditions which
      includes but are not limited to acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
      depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Until recently, the prevalence of anxiety,
      depression, and trauma in Syrian and Iraqi refugees resettling in Southeast Michigan was
      unknown—leaving hundreds of individuals lacking proper care.The need for treatment is high,
      yet most refugees are unable to acquire pharmacological treatment due to lack of access to
      health care, or cultural beliefs. Current mainstream treatments for PTSD and anxiety
      disorders are focused on psychopharmacological interventions and exposure-based
      psychotherapies. Being at a greater risk for mental illness and facing a variety of
      challenges in a new country, refugees require quality and affordable care. However,
      traditional pharmacotherapy is not always right for every individual, and is not always
      culturally acceptable, nor is it affordable or accessible to everyone. Since the founding of
      the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the NIH in 1998,
      scientific research on and clinical application of CAMs has been increasingly conducted. As
      the results of longitudinal pharmacological studies become available, it seems more and more
      pertinent to examine the efficacy of various CAMs, such as Dance/Movement Therapy, art
      therapy, and yoga, to provide safer and alternative long-term treatment options to patients.
      Because of this, creative interventions are becoming increasingly common in psychotherapy,
      namely art therapy—which has been implemented in refugee populations as well as in war-torn
      countries but has not been clearly evaluated for its effectiveness. With a focus on the
      mind-body connection, these interventions may also particularly effective in addressing
      somatic symptoms aspects of mental illness such as pain and fatigue.

    <description>Evaluation of PTSD related symptoms. UCLA Trauma Questionnaire administered to children. 33 items ranked from 0-4, with 0 = none of the time to 4 = most of the time. Scores can be summed for a composite score, with a maximum of 132 and a minimum of 0, or determination of PTSD criteria met utilizing responses to individual questions.</description>

    <description>PCL-c for DSM V (Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist for civilians). 20 questions ranked from 0 to 4 for &quot;Not at all,&quot; &quot;A little bit,&quot; Moderately,&quot; &quot;Quite a bit,&quot; and &quot;Extremely.&quot; Maximum score = 80, minimum score = 0. A score of 33 or higher appears reasonable to propose possible PTSD. Diagnostic criteria can also be evaluated by assessing responses to individual questions.</description>

    <description>Hopkins Symptoms Checklist - 25. Evaluates depressive and anxiety related symptoms in adults. Responses: (&quot;Not at all,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; &quot;Quite a bit,&quot; &quot;Extremely,&quot; rated 1 to 4, respectively. Anxiety score is the average of the first ten questions; depressive score is the average of the last 15 questions. For either measure, scores greater than 1.75 are said to be symptomatic. Highest score = 4; lowest score = 0.</description>
