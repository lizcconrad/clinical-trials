    <intervention_model_description>This is a three-arm parallel-group, randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of consumption of beer with or without alcohol (5.20 %, 0.45 % and 0.00 %), during 4 weeks, on healthy individuals.
The study will focus on the effects of beer on microbiota and biochemical biomarkers in healthy human volunteers.</intervention_model_description>
