    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 and carboplatin with or
      without docetaxel works in treating participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer
      that has spread to other places in the body. ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Giving ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970, carboplatin and docetaxel may work better
      in treating participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the difference in response rate (either achievement of prostate specific antigen
      [PSA] reduction of greater than 50% or radiographic response by Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) of the combination of M6620 (ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970) and
      carboplatin as compared to the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the difference in time to PSA progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group
      (PCWG)2 criteria of the combination of M6620 and carboplatin as compared to the combination
      of docetaxel and carboplatin.

      II. To describe radiographic progression-free survival and progression-free survival by PCWG3
      criteria in both arms of the study.

      III. Assess the relationship with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detected from
      baseline tumor biopsy with response to the combination of M6620 and carboplatin and the
      combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.

      IV. To describe the safety and adverse events from the combination of M6620+carboplatin as
      well the combination of docetaxel+carboplatin.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of overall survival in the two arms of the study. II. Explore response rate,
      time to PSA progression, radiographic progression-free survival, and progression-free
      survival by PCWG3 criteria in patients who initially receive docetaxel+carboplatin after
      crossover to M6620+carboplatin.

      III. To assess the relationship with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detected from
      baseline circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) with response to the
      combination of M6620 and carboplatin and the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin, and
      describe alterations seen in cfDNA (and optional tumor biopsy) at end of study.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      ARM A (docetaxel, carboplatin): Participants receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or carboplatin alone on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Participants have PSA progression or radiographic progression may crossover to Arm B.

      ARM B (carboplatin, ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970): Participants receive carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1 and ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up between 30-42 days.

             performance status (PS) = 2 are allowed on study, but if randomized to Arm A will
             receive carboplatin as a single agent (AUC 5) rather than docetaxel+carboplatin

          -  Willing to undergo core biopsy of a recurrent/metastatic lesion adequate for next
             generation sequencing prior to trial entry

          -  Men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth

             should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after
             completion of carboplatin and M6620 administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1), except for grade 2 anorexia, alopecia,
             neuropathy, and fatigue, for which resolution is not required

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease should be excluded from
             this clinical trial

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to M6620 or carboplatin; (patients with allergy to docetaxel will be
             allowed on study, but docetaxel will be excluded from their treatment regimen)

          -  Subjects receiving treatment with ototoxic or nephrotoxic medications that cannot be
             discontinued at least 7 days before first dose of carboplatin and for the duration of
             the study; inadvertent or short-term use on study will not cause a subject to be
             ineligible; if a short course of therapy with nephrotoxic or ototoxic medication is
             anticipated and required, carboplatin should be discontinued until 7 days after this
             course is completed

               -  M6620 is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant administration
                  with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole,
                  clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or inducers of
                  CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort)
                  should be avoided; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it
                  is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a
                  list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of; (patient Drug Information Handout and
                  Wallet Card) should be provided to patients; as part of the enrollment/informed
                  consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions
                  with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if
                  the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive participants on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible; appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Prior treatment with platinum-containing regimen or ATR inhibitor for prostate cancer
