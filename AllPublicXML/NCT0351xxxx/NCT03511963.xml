    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in patients with the recurrent lesion(s) post-surgery or the
      untreated mCRC. After stratification with respect to ECOG PS score, chemo regimen, primary
      tumor location and KRAS and BRAF genotype (complete wild-type/primal type), eligible patients
      are randomized into two arms at 1:1 ratio to receive HLX04 (Arm A) or Bevacizumab (Arm B) in
      combination with one of the protocol-defined chemotherapies, modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) or
      XELOX for mCRC until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity or achieving an
      operable contingency, whichever occurs first. Study evaluation time is defined as up to 40
      weeks after the first dosing of the last randomized patient.
