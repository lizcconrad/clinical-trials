      Background: To prevent and control the epidemic of HFMD and related diseases caused by EV71
      infection, the development of EV71 vaccine has been developed in many countries or regions.
      According to the requirements of drug registration approval, we need to evaluate
      immunogenicity and safety effect on combined immune effect of EV71 inactivated vaccine and
      other vaccines (HepB、MPSV-A、MR、JE-L).

      Method: Four experimental groups (HepB:3+EV71, MPSV-A:1+EV71, MR+EV71, JE-L+EV71) were
      included in this clinical trail. In addition to the meningococcal vaccine research group, the
      other three groups were followed up for the 4 times. The initial blood samples were
      collected, and the first dose vaccine was inoculated at the same time. EV71 second doses of
      vaccine were inoculated at 30 day, the blood was collected after 30 days of immunization with
      second doses. 6 months of safety follow-up was carried out in the whole clinical trial after
      vaccination. The meningococcal vaccine research group increased 1 follow-up after the second
      dose of MPSV-A vaccine. The index of immunogenicity and safety effect in four experimental
      groups need to be evaluated.
