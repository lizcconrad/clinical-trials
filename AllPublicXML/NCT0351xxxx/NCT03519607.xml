  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a new app, FertiStrong, is associated
      with decreased levels of anxiety and depression in men who have infertility or whose partner
      has infertility.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who are experiencing infertility report high levels of anxiety and depression. A
      recent study (1) documented that both men and women involved in the treatment of infertility
      expressed emotional distress. Research on the female partner of an infertile couple documents
      that psychological interventions, especially those with a cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)
      focus, are associated with significant decreases in levels of anxiety and depression (2).
      Subsequent research has also shown that both members of the infertile couple definitively
      underutilize the psychological services offered to them. Thus, new ways to provide
      psychological relief to these individuals is needed. This has lead to the development of a
      new app, FertiStrong. This app is targeted at men- either men with infertility or men whose
      partner has infertility.

      Study Requirements:

        1. Study participants will be asked to complete an on-line questionnaire.

        2. Once completed, the study participant will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
           One group will be provided the mobile app to use for 30 days. The second group will be
           provided the app after 30 days.

        3. After the 30 day period, each group will be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire.
           Each questionnaire will take approximately 15-20 minutes to compete.

      Men who are directly seeking care or whose partners is seeking care at any Fertility Center
      of Illinois location are invited to participate.

    <description>The FertiStrong mobile app is similar to FertiCalm, which is designed for women with infertility. FertiCalm (www.FertiCalm.com) can be downloaded for free anywhere in the US, for both Apple and Android phones. Each app contains twelve main categories and each main category contains up to five tailored situations. For each situation, there are six options. Three of the options are the same for all situations (humor, self-nurture, relaxation) and three are unique (cognitive solutions, behavioral solutions, social solutions).</description>
