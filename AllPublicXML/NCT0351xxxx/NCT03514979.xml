      This study will address the following hypothesis: Rituximab therapy leads to an acquired
      immune deficiency, as demonstrated by impaired vaccine responses, in AAV patients.

      Aims:

        1. To investigate whether rituximab leads to immune deficiency in patients with AAV when
           compared to both disease and healthy controls.

        2. To investigate whether the degree of immune deficiency is associated with the degree of
           B cell depletion.

        3. To investigate whether T-independent vaccine responses are more severely affected than
           T-dependent vaccine responses after rituximab and whether a conjugated vaccine will
           overcome this postulated deficit in T independent vaccine responses.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase IIb, open label study to evaluate the responses of patients with ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) to pneumococcal vaccination. It has been designed primarily to assess the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccines in patients with AAV treated with rituximab compared to disease controls, but also to provide mechanistic information on vaccine response by comparing AAV patients and healthy controls.</intervention_model_description>
