  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of 2 different smartphone
      applications (apps). The apps are designed to help you quit smoking in combination with
      tobacco cessation (quitting) counseling.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are eligible and agree to take part, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of
      a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is
      better, the same, or worse than the other group. Each group will receive a different app
      designed to help you quit smoking:

        -  If you are in Group 1, your app is designed to help you learn relaxation skills.

        -  If you are in Group 2, your app is designed to help you improve your mood and increase
           your level of enjoyable activities.

      The study staff will help you download your assigned app and will instruct you in how to use
      it. There is no charge for this app but data rates may apply as you use it, depending on your
      phone plan. You may also receive text messages reminding you to use the app.

      Study Procedures:

      The study staff will call you every 2 weeks. The last call will be about 6 weeks from today.
      Each call will take about 15 minutes, and you will be asked to provide honest answers to
      questions about your mood and your cigarette smoking. You may be able to complete some
      questionnaires electronically in advance of the visit with a secure link that will be sent to
      your email address or phone.

      About 8 weeks from today, you will return to complete an interview with the study staff and
      complete questionnaires. Topics included will be depression, your emotions, your activity
      levels, your smoking patterns, your satisfaction with the app, and your dependence on
      smoking. This visit is expected to last about 60-75 minutes.

      If you report that you are not smoking, you may be asked to take a carbon monoxide test like
      you did at screening.

      Length of Study Participation:

      After your 8-week visit, your participation in this study will be complete.

      If at any point the study staff or a member of the Tobacco Treatment Program believes you are
      serious danger of hurting yourself or someone else, they may take steps to ensure your safety
      with the help of the Tobacco Treatment Program medical team.
