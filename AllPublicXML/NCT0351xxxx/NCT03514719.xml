      In this feasibility study, a 89Zr-avelumab PET scan will be performed in 37 patients prior to
      treatment with avelumab to:

        1. assess the tumor and systemic tissue uptake 89Zr-avelumab

        2. assess the potential to predict avelumab treatment response

    <textblock>
      The programmed death 1 (PD1)/ pogrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway plays an important
      role in regulating the T-cell anti tumor response. Blocking this interaction with the anti
      PD-L1 monoclonal antibody avelumab is effective in patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) resulting in durable disease control rates. Currently, PD-L1 expression
      as determined by immune histochemistry (IH) is the best available biomarker for treatment
      response, but standardized scoring criteria are lacking and the risk for sampling errors
      exists. Molecular imaging using 89Zr-labeled antibodies may overcome these limitations,
      enabeling the visualization of PD-L1 expression in primary and metastatic tumor lesions and
      providing information on the in vivo accessibility of the PD-L1 target following intravenous
      administration.

          3. Karnofsky performance score ≥ 70

          4. At least one lesion with a tumour size ≥ 1 cm

          5. Haematologic function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥
             100 × 109/L, and haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (may have been transfused)

          6. Hepatic function: total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) range
             and AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 × ULN for all subjects or AST and ALT levels ≤ 5 x ULN
             (for subjects with documented metastatic disease to the liver).

          7. Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula
             (or local institutional standard method)

          8. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing
             potential.
