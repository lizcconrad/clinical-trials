  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volume controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) are the common
      ventilatory modes during OLV undergoing thoracic surgery. A controversy regarding which
      ventilation mode is better for oxygenation during OLV with PCV enhances oxygenation more than
      VCV ;given its initial high peak inspiratory flow rates and its rapidly decelerating flow
      pattern. However, this high peak inspiratory flow rate might also provoke lung injury via
      shearing and traction forces on the alveoli. Extravascular lung water describes water within
      the lungs but outside pulmonary vasculature. Lung ultrasound (LUS) assessment of EVLW by
      B-lines provides a reliable and easy alternative.

    <measure>Lung ultrasound score</measure>
    <time_frame>change of lung ultrasound scores introperatively during double lung and single lung ventilation and after 2 hours postoperatively compared to baseline scores before anesthesia induction</time_frame>
    <description>The sum of B lines reflects the extent of lung water accumulation. The lung ultrasound score(LUS) will be obtained by scanning 12-rib interspaces. The dependent lung will be divided into six areas: two anterior areas, two lateral areas, and two posterior areas. The anterior chest wall (zone 1) will be delineated from the parasternal to the anterior axillary line and will be divided into upper and lower halves, from the clavicle to the third intercostal space and from the third to the diaphragm. The lateral area (zone 2) will be delineated from the anterior to the posterior axillary line and was divided into upper and basal halves. The posterior area (zone 3) will be considered as the zone beyond the posterior axillary line. The sum of B-lines on each scanning site (0: absence; 1: B7 lines: multiple B-lines 7 mm apart; 2: B3 lines: multiple B 3 mm apart; 3: consolidation) yields a score from 0 to 36(10) score for the ventilated lung is only from 0-18.</description>
