    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D) for a continuous treatment with EGF816 and trametinib in patients with epithelial
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) p.T790M-positive resistance to EGFR inhibition.

    <textblock>
      The population of interest for this trial is defined by patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer harbouring the sensitizing EGFR mutations del19 or p.L858R, who developed resistance
      to the treatment with 1st or 2nd generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (i.e.
      gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib). The detection of the EGFR p.T790M resistance mutation in
      rebiopsy tumour tissue prior to the start of treatment within this trial is mandatory. A
      high-level amplification of MET, however leads to the exclusion from the participation.

      The aim of the trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D) for a continuous treatment with the 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor EGF816 and the
      MEK inhibitor trametinib.

      The recommendations for dose level escalations will be based on an &quot;up and down&quot; design
      proposed by Storer, 1989. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period comprises the first 28 days
      of treatment with EGF816 and trametinib at the designated dose level (Cycle 1).

      Preliminary efficacy data of EGF816 and trametinib in the trial population will be generated
      according to RECIST v1.1.

      Throughout the study blood samples will be collected to monitor cell free plasma DNA (cfDNA).

      Patients who develop resistance upon treatment with the study drugs will undergo a rebiopsy
      to identify potential mechanisms of resistance.

             (newly obtained biopsy).

          8. EGFR p.T790M mutation must have been detected by local testing in the tumour sample
             fulfilling the requirements of inclusion criterion 7.

          9. Documented progression of disease according to RECIST v1.1 while on continuous
