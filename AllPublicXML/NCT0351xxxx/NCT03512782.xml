  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      What is proposed in this project is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an online
      remote monitoring system that is easily accessible to patients so that professionals with
      experience in monitoring patients with heart failure (HF) can monitor signs and symptoms of
      decompensation of the disease, as well as self-care actions. A randomized, blind trial for
      outcome evaluation was designed that will include patients hospitalized for acute HF at a
      referral institution in cardiology in southern Brazil. Patients in the intervention group
      will be followed up with a remote monitoring system, accessible by device (computer, tablet
      and cell phone) connected to the internet, by checking for signs, symptoms and self-care
      actions in three moments during 30 days after hospital discharge. Patients in the control
      group will follow up according to the routine of the hospital or physician assistant. The
      primary endpoint for assessing the efficacy of the system will be hospital readmission within
      30 days (follow-up period). The information regarding the signs, symptoms and self-care of
      the patients will be monitored by the research team through an access schedule. The sample
      calculation points to the need to include a total of 142 patients (71 in each group). The
      data will be analyzed through descriptive and analytical statistics. It is hoped that the
      development of a remote monitoring system could be characterized as a strategy for the early
      detection of signs and symptoms of acute decompensation in HF patients, impacting on hospital
      readmission rates within 30 days after discharge. In addition, remote monitoring of signs and
      symptoms may promote improved adherence and self-care of patients. The scientific
      contribution will occur to the extent to which there is innovation in patient follow-up and
      feedback obtained from the patient's interaction with the system.

    <description>The patients listed in interventional group will have access to software Cardioenf that is a app used in a device (cel phone, tablet) to monitoring signs and symptoms of the heart failure patients after discharge from hospital. In this software, their signs and symptoms will be inserted in three moments during the first 30 days after discharge. Nurses will monitor these data in the follow-up period.</description>
