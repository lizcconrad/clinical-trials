  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a blinded randomized controlled study of the effects of BB-12 with LGG at
      different doses in 70 healthy children with autism spectrum disorders at lower and higher
      doses over an 56-day period and a 28- day observation period. The study is being conducted in
      order to assess safety and tolerability of the probiotic (BB-12 with LGG) at 2 different
      doses of BB-12 with LGG. Identifying effects on behaviors in healthy children with ASD using
      SRS-2 and ABC, GI symptoms using GI symptom severity index, and relevant biomarkers of
      inflammation, microbiota, and metabolites. Primary testing and procedures will be conducted
      at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Memorial Hermann Clinical
      Research Center.

      Biomarker identification includes Integrative analysis of plasma metabolome and stool
      microbiota will be conducted with the collaboration of Dr. Ruth Ann Luna and Dr. Jim
      Versalovic at Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research, Department of Molecular
      Virology &amp; Microbiology of Baylor College of Medicine.

    <intervention_model_description>After psychological screening, the subjects will be randomize children to one of 3 groups. The total number of subject to be enrolled will be 70 healthy children with confirmed ASD status, randomizing each child to placebo (maltodextrin), low daily dose (1 billion cfu's), and higher daily dose (10 billion cfu's) of BB-12+LGG once daily at 1:2:2 ratio. Data will be combined with 30 patients obtained from two funding sources: Texas (THECB) and U.T. pilot project. The data will be combined and an identical design of the placebo and 1 billion cfu dose arms.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>The head statistician and study pharmacist will be aware of randomization scheme. The investigators will use an adaptive minimization program for randomization that balances the 3 study arms with respect to distributions of sex and age (4-10 vs. 11-15 y.o.). Patients will be randomized to placebo, 1 billion CFU, and 10 billion CFU study arms at a ratio of 1:2:2. (Currently marketed over-the-counter probiotics typically contain 0.1-50 billion CFUs per dose.) The performance of our covariate adaptive randomization algorithm will be verified through simulation studies before implementation.</masking_description>
