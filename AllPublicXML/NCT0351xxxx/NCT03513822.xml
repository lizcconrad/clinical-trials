  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The kynurenine pathway is involved in hyperalgesia. This pathway is activated by
      inflammation. Ketamine would interact with the kynurenine pathway and inflammation. Our
      working hypotheses are: the clinical effects of ketamine on neuropathic pain are greater in
      the presence of systemic inflammation and the mechanism of action involves an interaction on
      the kynurenine pathway.

      Study design: Interventional randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      ￼Main goals:

        1. To show a better clinical efficacy of ketamine in chronic pain in patients with an
           inflammatory component.

        2. Explore the anti-inflammatory activity of ketamine through the Kynurenine pathway.

      ￼ Primary judgment criterion Decrease by more than 30% the intensity of neuropathic pain
      evaluated at the moment on a numerical scale of 10 points between H0 and H4. Comparison of
      groups two by two.

      Secondary judgment criterions:

      IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α before perfusion and H4 perfusion.

      In parallel blood samples will be collected to study the activation of the kynurenine pathway
      in response to inflammation due to a pressure ulcer.

    <masking_description>The randomisation is done with R software. Each randomisation card is put in a sealed opaque envelope. The two products being transparent, it's impossible to differentiate the two products with identical packaging is a syringe of 50 cc Luer Lock Plastipack BD with a standard extension for syringe Luer Lock.
Both products will be prepared by an SSPI nurse who opens the envelope, the nurse does not participate in the study, the patient assessment investigator as well as the patient will remain blind about the administration of the product. Each syringe will be labeled for each patient with a special label without indication of the product The outcomes assessor, investigator and participant are blinded.</masking_description>
