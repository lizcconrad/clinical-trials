    <textblock>
      The aim of the prospective, multicentre, single-arm study is to assess safety and efficacy of
      a drug eluting stent in Nitinol alloy (NiTiDES) in term of vessel patency and composite
      event-free survival rate up to two years follow-up in focal/medium length lesions in patients
      with ischemic obstruction of superficial femoral arteries or/and proximal popliteal arteries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Clinical

          -  Patient must be over 18 years inclusive at the time of consent prior to participation
             in the study and must understand the purpose of this study and be willing to adhere to
             the study procedures described in this protocol;

             pregnancy test at screening;

          -  Patient has signed and dated the informed consent;

          -  Patient has symptoms of peripheral arterial disease classified as Rutherford Category
             (2-4); patients with Rutherford Category 2 can be included only if a conservative
             and/or medication therapy was unsuccessful.

          -  Patient has a resting ABI &lt;0.9 or at exercise if resting ABI is normal; patient with
             incompressible arteries (ABI &gt;1.2) at rest or at exercise must have a toe-brachial
             index (TBI) &lt;0.8.

        Angiographic

          -  Patient has one documented stenotic or occluded atherosclerotic lesion (lesion length
             ≤ 14 cm) of the above-the-knee femoropopliteal artery, in one limb, that meet all of
             the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria;

          -  Patient has a de novo or restenotic lesion with &gt;50% stenosis documented
             angiographically and no prior stent in the target lesion;

          -  The target lesion must be appropriately covered (margin of 5.0 mm on both sides of the
             stent) by one or two study stents (NiTiDES). Any occurred dissection of the target
             vessel must be treated with an additional stent (NiTiDES);

          -  Tandem lesions are allowed if the distance between 2 lesions is ≤ 3 cm and the total
             length of all lesions ≤ 14 cm;

          -  Guidewire successfully passed the lesion through the lumen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Clinical

          -  Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding;

          -  Patient is simultaneously participating in another investigational drug or device
             study;

          -  Patient has any planned surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days after the
             study procedure;

          -  Clinical conditions, disorders or allergies that limit the use of anti-platelet and/or
             anticoagulant therapy;

          -  Severe allergy to the contrast medium or drugs used during the procedure;

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity or allergies to Sirolimus, fatty acids (such as

             as Nickel, Titanium and Tantalum);

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl;

          -  Myocardial infarction within the 90 days prior to enrollment;

          -  Hypercoagulable state;

          -  Uncontrollable hypertension;

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 12 months;

          -  Aneurysmal disease of abdominal aorta, iliac artery and popliteal artery;

          -  Patient has had previous stenting of target vessel;

          -  Patient lacks at least one patent vessel of runoff with &lt;50% stenosis throughout its

          -  Patient has untreated angiographically-evident thrombus in the target lesion;

          -  Patients intended to be treated with more than two stents in the target lesion unless
             additional stent required in case of dissection;

          -  Patient intended to receive different stent from NiTiDES in target lesion;

          -  Technically unsuccessful Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) procedure, for
             example due to the impossibility of accessing the stenotic site with a delivery system

          -  Lesions considered untreatable with PTA or other interventional techniques;

          -  Inflow lesion ≥15 cm long or occlusion (any length) in the ipsilateral Iliac artery;

          -  Not successfully treated &lt; 15 cm long inflow lesion in the ipsilateral iliac artery
             [Treatment of inflow lesion must precede patient enrollment and target lesion
             treatment. No Drug Eluting Stents (DES) and / or Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) allowed
             for the treatment of inflow lesions];

          -  Lesions in contralateral Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) that require intervention
             during the index procedure, or within 30 days after the index procedure. Lesions in
             contralateral SFA can be treated either &gt;30 days prior to or &gt; 30 days after the index
             procedure;

          -  Patient with stenosis adjacent to an aneurysmal lesion of diameter at least twice the
             lumen of the native vessel;

          -  Lesions localized in the two distal thirds of the popliteal artery (or at the knee
             joint, generally considered).

        Others.
