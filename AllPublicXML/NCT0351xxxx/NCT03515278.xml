  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the effect of ultrasound-guided suprascapular nerve block
      and intra-articular corticosteroid injection for frozen shoulder in pain control, improvement
      of range of motion, quality of life, and function.

      The inclusion criteria is: 1. unilateral side involvement; 2. ≥50% loss of passive ROM
      (external rotation or abduction) in the glenohumeral joint comparing to the unaffected side;
      3. duration of symptoms ≥3 months. 4. age≥ 20year old.

      The exclusion criteria include: 1. ever received manipulation of the affected shoulder
      with/without anesthesia; 2. systemic disease, severe degeneration, or trauma involving the
      shoulder (ie, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, history of injury to the labrum or
      articular cartilage or malignancies in the shoulder region, etc.); 3. neurologic diseases
      such as stroke or peripheral nerve neuropathy that have already affect the activity of
      shoulder; 4.pain or disorders of the cervical spine, elbow, wrist, or hand; 5.a history of
      drug allergy to local or corticosteroids; 6. Pregnancy or lactation; and 7. Received
      corticosteroids, or hyaluronic acid intra-articular injection into the affected shoulder
      during the preceding 4 weeks 70 participants will be randomly divided to SCNB group and IACI
      group. Each subject in either group will receive 2 times of injection in a two-weekly
      interval. After injection, each subject in either group will receive the same protocol of
      physiotherapy program for 2 months. Outcome measures include the SPADI, the SDQ, active and
      passive ROM of the affected shoulder, and SF-36. Evaluation will be performed at baseline and
      at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Statistics will be performed
      after completing the patients' treatment and evaluations.

      A Shapiro-Wilk test will be applied to ensure that all the calculated variables followed a
      normal distribution. Subsequently, a 2-by-3, 2-way mixed-model analysis of variance, which
      has 1 between-subject factor (group: SCNB and IACI) and 1 within-subject factor (evaluation
      time: pretreatment, 4 weeks after beginning treatment, and 12 weeks after the beginning of
      the treatment), will be performed. Pair-wise comparisons between groups will be performed
      using an independent t test when a significant interaction is found; otherwise, the main
      effects are reported. When a time effect is found, a post hoc analysis will be performed
      using a polynomial test to determine the trend (linear or quadratic). All significance levels
      are set at alpha=.05, and SPSS version 15.0a will be used for all the statistical analyses.

    <time_frame>baseline and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The total SPADI score, which ranges between 0 and 100, is calculated by averaging the scores from the pain and disabilities subclasses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the active ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The maximal active ROMs of the affected shoulder will be measured using a goniometer under the guidelines of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. These measurements included abduction in the frontal plane, forward flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation with the arm at 0 degrees of abduction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The SDQ is a symptoms-related questionnaire containing 16 items describing common situations that may induce symptoms in patients with shoulder disorders. By responding 'yes', 'no', or 'not applicable', the final score is obtained by dividing the number of positively scored items by the total number of applicable items and then multiplying this number by 100, which results in a final score ranging between 0 (no disability) and 100 (the worst situation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire that evaluates the quality of life. It is composed of 8 subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each subscale has a score range of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better health status.Patient's evaluation of the treatment effect. Patient's evaluation of the treatment effect consists of the answer to one question: &quot;Is the treatment effective?&quot; scored on a Likert scale (very effective=1, effective=2, not effective=3, worse=4, much worse=5).</description>
