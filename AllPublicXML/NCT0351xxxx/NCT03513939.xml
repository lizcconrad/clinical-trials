  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cell Pouch™ is a novel implantable device, that is transplanted with therapeutic cells
      such as insulin producing islets. This combination product is designed for the treatment of
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) with hypoglycemia unawareness and a history of severe
      hypoglycemic episodes. Upon implantation, the Cell Pouch™ is designed to form a natural
      environment, rich in tissue and microvessels for the transplant and function of therapeutic
      cells. The Cell Pouch™ is designed as a scaffold made of non-degradable polymers, formed into
      small cylindrical chambers which, when placed in the subcutaneous site, becomes incorporated
      with tissue and microvessels to the circumference of removable plugs within as early as two
      weeks as demonstrated in preclinical studies. After the tissue incorporation, the plugs are
      removed, leaving fully formed tissue chambers with central void spaces for the
      transplantation of therapeutic cells including Islets of Langerhans (islets). The Cell Pouch™
      forms a natural environment, rich in microvessels that allows the transplanted islets to
      engraft with intravascular microvessels. It is believed this engraftment will enable
      long-term survival and function of transplanted islets. This study aims to demonstrate the
      safety and tolerability of islet transplantation into the Cell Pouch™ for the treatment of
      T1DM in subjects with hypoglycemia unawareness and a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes.
      The study also aims to establish islet release criteria that accurately characterize the
      islet product and are predictive of clinical transplant outcomes into the Cell Pouch™, which
      will be demonstrated through defined efficacy measures.

      The Sernova Cell Pouch™ will be implanted under the skin. A minimum of three weeks after Cell
      Pouch™ implantation, immunosuppression will be initiated and optimized for another 3 weeks.
      This will allow for proper vascularization of the Cell Pouch™ chambers and the patient to be
      stabilized on immunosuppression prior to transplantation. A mass, &gt;3,000 islet equivalent
      (IEQ) numbers per kg of patient body weight (IEQ/kg), of highly purified islets will be
      transplanted in the Cell Pouch™. The Cell Pouch™ will be assessed for safety and tolerability
      for up to one year following transplant. Data for the primary and secondary endpoints will be
      summarized using descriptive statistics (such as counts and percentages).
