  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeping medications, called hypnotics, are often prescribed for insomnia. About one-quarter
      of Veterans use hypnotics (or bedtime alcohol). Older patients who use hypnotics fall more
      often and have worse memory than those who do not use them. Stopping hypnotics often reverses
      these problems. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is trying to reduce hypnotic use
      among older adults. Currently, there are two main treatments to help patients stop using
      hypnotics. The first treatment involves a slow decrease in the daily dose until the hypnotic
      is ultimately discontinued. For safety, the process of decreasing the daily dose is usually
      supervised by a physician. The second is a treatment for insomnia called cognitive behavioral
      therapy for insomnia (CBTI).

      This study will compare a novel hypnotic tapering method to the usual tapering method offered
      to older Veterans. The purpose of the study is to determine if the novel tapering method is
      more effective than the usual tapering method, both in terms of hypnotic discontinuation and
      improvement in insomnia severity.

      Participants will be recruited from among Veterans 60 years and older who receive care from
      one VA Healthcare System. Following a baseline assessment, participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two 8-week treatment groups (66 participants per group). Each
      treatment group will receive CBTI, however, one group will receive the novel tapering program
      and the other group the usual tapering program. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at
      post-treatment and at 6-months after completion of the treatment.

      If the novel tapering program is effective, it will represent a treatment option that can be
      offered to older Veterans who want to discontinue hypnotics. This tapering program could help
      VA healthcare providers adhere to clinical guidelines that recommend benzodiazepine
      discontinuation among older adults. A reduction in chronic hypnotic use may in turn reduce
      the risk of falls and hip fractures, which ultimately may improve the health and quality of
      life of older Veterans who receive healthcare at the VA.

    <textblock>
      Hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are often prescribed
      for insomnia. Among Veterans attending outpatient clinics, approximately one-quarter use
      hypnotics (or bedtime alcohol). Hypnotics use is associated with an increased risk of falls
      and worse cognition in older adults. Discontinuing hypnotics often attenuates or reverses
      these negative effects, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has initiatives to reduce
      hypnotic use among older adults. Current discontinuation strategies focus on tapering off the
      hypnotic and/or treating insomnia symptoms. Common strategies include supervised gradual
      taper (SGT), cognitive behavioral therapy targeting hypnotic withdrawal (CBT-HW), cognitive
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), and combination therapy (SGT+CBTI). Yet up to 40% of
      patients eventually resume use of hypnotics with these strategies, suggesting that other
      mechanisms need to be targeted to achieve and sustain high rates of non-use.

      Objectives: 1) To assess the efficacy of a novel taper plus cognitive behavioral
      therapy-augmented program on hypnotic discontinuation among older Veterans, 2) to determine
      the impact of the the novel taper intervention on insomnia severity, 3) to assess the impact
      of the novel taper intervention on participants' beliefs and expectancies for using hypnotics
      to improve sleep quality and daytime function, and 4) to assess the efficacy of the novel
      taper intervention on balance and cognition.

      To achieve these objectives, the investigators propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial
      in older Veterans recruited from a single VA site. Veterans will undergo a 3-step screening
      process (letter with opt-out card, telephone screen, and in-person screen). Eligible
      participants (N = 132) will be randomized to 8 weeks of the novel taper intervention
      (CBTI+taper method A) or CBTI+taper method B. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at
      post-treatment and 6-months. Key 6-month outcomes will include hypnotic discontinuation and
      use (measured objectively through lab testing and medical record review/state prescription
      monitoring database query, and subjectively through sleep diary), insomnia severity, beliefs
      and expectations about hypnotics, balance, and cognition.

      This hypnotic discontinuation program could be an important tool to help older Veterans who
      want to discontinue hypnotics to achieve this goal.
