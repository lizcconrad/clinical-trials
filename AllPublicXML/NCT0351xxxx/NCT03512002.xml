      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of a technique called
      High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM®), for hot
      flashes. HIRREM uses scalp sensors to monitor brain electrical activity, and computer
      software algorithms translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones in real time.
      Those tones are reflected back to participants via ear buds in as little as four to eight
      milliseconds, providing the brain an opportunity for self-adjustment of its electrical
      pattern.

      This study will compare acoustic stimulation linked to brainwave activity (HIRREM, along with
      continued current care, HCC), with continued current clinical care alone (CCC). Both groups
      will continue their other current care throughout, including non-pharmacological, and
      lifestyle modification therapies.

    <measure>Reduction in frequency and severity of hot flashes score based on diary data</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and V3 (12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC).</time_frame>
    <description>Both groups will maintain a hot flash diary for 7-14 days, after which the intervention will begin for the HCC group. Post-intervention data collections will include an intermediate post-intervention visit (V2, primary outcome, 4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, and 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and a final follow up visit (V3, 12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, and 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC). Both groups will maintain a hot flash diary for 1-2 weeks prior to the V2 and V3 visits. The primary outcome will be reduction in frequency and severity of hot flashes score from V1 to V2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and V3 (12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC).</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate are acquired from 10 minute recordings of noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG with participants lying quietly, supine. Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system (BIOPAC acquisition system and Acknowledge 4.2 software, Santa Barbara, CA), at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard BRS software (Nevrokard BRS, Medistar, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch that is considered to be acceptable for analysis. Heart rate variability is measured in the time domain as standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval (SDNN, milliseconds). For calculation of SDNN, the R-R intervals are visually inspected, and data considered as artifact is manually removed.</description>

    <description>The QOLS is a 16-item scale that was modified from a 15-item scale used in chronic disease patients. Topics include different components of daily life such as relationships, community engagement, personal fulfillment, and recreation. Each item is scaled from 1 to 7 and a sum score is calculated to represent higher levels of satisfaction in life (range is 16-112).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Drop Stick Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and V3 (12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC).</time_frame>
    <description>Reaction testing will be evaluated by a drop-stick, clinical reaction time apparatus. The apparatus is placed between the thumb and index finger of the subject and released at a random time during a countdown. The subject catches the apparatus and the distance fallen (cm) is converted to reaction. Following two practice trials, participants perform eight trials, and a mean distance value is calculated. This is repeated with a second set of 8 trials later during the enrollment visit, and the mean distance value from the second trial will be used as the baseline value. Use of the average distance from the second set of trials will be used as the baseline value so as to avoid the impact of learning effect for this test. Only one set of trials will be used for comparison at follow up data collections. A lower average indicates a faster reaction time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and V3 (12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC).</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength will be evaluated using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer). Participants will squeeze the dynamometer three times in each hand. The scores from each hand will be averaged separately. A higher score indicates stronger grip strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and V3 (12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC).</time_frame>
    <description>The HFRDIS is a 10 item measure to capture the daily impact of vasomotor symptoms in a variety of domains within the past week. These domains include work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep, mood, concentration, relation with others, sexuality, enjoyment of life, and overall quality of life. Items are scored from 0 (do not interfere) to 10 (completely interfere). A higher score indicates that the symptoms are interfering with daily life more.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Menopause Rating Scale (MRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and V3 (12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC).</time_frame>
    <description>The MRS is a survey that generates a score between 0 and 44 based on the individual's symptom severity rankings. There are 11 symptoms listed related to perimenopause that are each assigned a score of 0 to 4 by the individual. A score of 0 indicates none, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, 3 is severe, and 4 is very severe. After completion, the individual's score is tallied to create an overall score. Scores from 0-4 are considered zero to little, scores from 5-8 are considered mild, scores from 9-16 are moderate, and scores 17 or greater are considered severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alcohol Intake Screening (Audit-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (4-6 weeks after intervention completion for HCC, 10-12 weeks after V1 for CCC), and V3 (12-14 weeks following completion of the intervention for HCC, 18-20 weeks after V1 for CCC).</time_frame>
    <description>The AUDIT-C is a short, 3-item alcohol screening for hazardous drinkers or active alcohol use disorders. This measure consists of 3 questions to assess an individual's alcohol use. Each question has five possible answers ranging from of 0-4 with a total scoring scale of 0-12. A total score of three or more in women and a score of four or more in men is suggestive of hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders.</description>
