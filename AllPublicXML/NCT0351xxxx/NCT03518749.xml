  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficient cognitive control (CC) is one of the central characteristics of major depression
      (MD). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked with this
      deficit. Antidepressants and cognitive-behavioral therapies modify CC most-likely as a common
      mechanism of treatment. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, simple and
      effective non-invasive method to modulate the cortical excitability. It has been shown, that
      the activity of the dlPFC can be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      with polarity-dependent learning-phase specific effects on performance that, when combined
      with training, can outlast the stimulation.

      The goal of this randomized, sham-controlled, rater blind clinical trial is to investigate
      the effect of a tDCS-enhanced CC Training (CCT) on depressive symptom severity and compare
      the stimulation intensities 1mA, 2mA and sham tDCS. Overall, the study will include 57
      participants (n = 19 per group). Each participant will complete 12 training sessions with
      online sham/ anodal tDCS.

      As a training task we will use an adaptive version of the paced auditory serial addition task
      (PASAT). In the PASAT, digits are presented auditive and participants have to add the current
      digit to the digit they heard before. In the adaptive version the interstimulus-intervals
      decrease (increase) when four consecutive trials are correct (incorrect). The PASAT is known
      to elicit frustration. Participants have to exert cognitive control over these emotions to
      complete the task successfully.

      Before, during and after the training symptom severity will be assessed. Baseline and
      post-training performance in the PASAT and in a transfer task (delayed working memory task,
      DWM) will be measured.

      To further explore variables that influence the effect of tDCS on depressive symptom severity
      we will measure brain activity (EEG, NIRS), heart rate, global functioning (GAF), emotion
      regulation strategies, self-esteem, mood ratings and subjective performance ratings before
      and after the training and collect genetic factors.

      Sustainability of the training effects will be measured at a follow-up visit (3 months
      later).
