      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy beyond progression of vemurafenib
      combined with cobimetinib associated with local treatment compared to second-line treatment
      in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma in focal progression with
      first-line combined vemurafenib and cobimetinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is a heterogeneous skin tumor, characterized by mutations of different oncogenes.
      Almost half of patients with advanced melanoma have a gene mutation of BRAF serine-threonine
      kinase. Over the past 5 years, two BRAF inhibitors targeting these mutations, vemurafenib and
      dabrafenib, have shown high rates of rapid response in phase II and III studies. However, the
      duration of responses is limited in most patients due to the development of acquired
      resistance. Mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy are diverse and include the
      reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in over two-thirds of
      tumors, along with promotion of parallel signaling networks.

      Recently, the combination of drugs was superior in terms of responses, Progression Free
      Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) compared to monotherapy.

      The data from recent studies confirm the clinical benefit of the combination of Vemurafenib
      with cobimetinib and support the use of the combination as a standard first-line approach to
      improve survival in patients.

      The aim of this randomized, open-label, phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy, in terms
      of overall survival, of vemurafenib combined with cobimetinib associated with local treatment
      compared with second-line therapy, in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic
      melanoma in focal progression with first-line combined vemurafenib and cobimetinib.

    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival of patients with focal progression is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date of death from any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival time will be censored at the date of last contact (&quot;last known date alive&quot;). Overall survival of patients with focal progression will be compared between treatment groups using a log-rank test procedure with a two-sided α =0.2 level. The OS function for each treatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Median and corresponding two-sided 80% confidence intervals will be computed by treatment group. A Cox proportional hazard model for OS with treatment arm as single factor will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of vemurafenib and cobimetinib plus local treatment to Standard of Care (SOC) second-line treatment and its corresponding 80% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>PFS of patients with focal progression is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. Clinical deterioration will not be considered progression. For subjects who neither progress nor die, time will be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. For subjects who start a new anti-tumor treatment, time will be censored at the start of the new treatment. For a randomized subject who does not have any post-randomization tumor assessments and who has not died, time will be censored at the randomization date. PFS will be compared between treatment groups using a log-rank test procedure with a two-sided α =0.2 level. The PFS function for each treatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Median and two-sided 80% confidence intervals (CI) for median PFS will be computed by treatment group. A Cox proportional hazard model for PFS with treatment</description>

    <description>Overall survival of patients with non-focal progression is defined as the time, in months, from date of non-focal progression to first-line to the date of death from any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival time will be censored at the date of last contact (&quot;last known date alive&quot;). The OS function will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Median and corresponding two-sided 80% confidence intervals will be computed.
