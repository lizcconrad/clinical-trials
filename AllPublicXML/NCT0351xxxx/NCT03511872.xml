      An Evaluation of Peer-led basic life support training course compared with professional-led
      course in a limited resource environment; A randomized controlled trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peer training has been identified as a useful tool for delivering undergraduate training in
      basic life support (BLS) which is fundamental as an initial response in cases of emergency.

      This study aimed to (1) Evaluate the efficacy of peer-led model in basic life support
      training among medical students in their first three years of study, compared to
      professional-led training and (2) To assess the efficacy of the course program and students'
      satisfaction of peer-led training.

      A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessors will be conducted on 72 medical students
      from the pre-clinical years (1st to 3rd years in Syria) at Syrian Private University.
      Students will be randomly assigned to peer-led or to professional-led training group for
      one-day-course of basic life support skills.

      Analysis will be done on students who underwent checklist based assessment using objective
      structured clinical examination design (OSCE) (practical assessment of BLS skills) and
      answered BLS knowledge checkpoint-questionnaire.

    <description>36 students are allocated randomly to professionals' group where they are trained on BLS skills by professional trainers in emergency. Four professionals (2 emergency doctors, cardiologist and anesthesiologist) are leading training to the control group to deliver the basic life support training course with the same duration and content as the intervention group.</description>

    <description>A course design was made to be consistent with ERC guidelines with local modifications made by emergency professionals in duration, instructor-to-trainee ratio, course materials, methods to deliver these materials theoretically, and the type of the manikin used to practice CPR. One-day-course consisting of 75, 20, 20, 20 minutes for theoretical BLS, chocking, recovery position, the practical representation of BLS scenario respectively followed by 40-minute practical training on BLS skills for each subgroup. Both arms of the study follow the same timeline and no extra time is given to any group.
Same manikins were used for the training and the assessment. On the day of the experiment students in each arm are divided into 4 subgroups of maximum 9 students, each led by two trainers of BLS skills with a maximum ratio of 2 instructors to 9 students per group.</description>
