  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the recovery after cesarean section in
      patients who will receive Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB) as a part of multimodal analgesia
      using Postoperative quality of recovery scale.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several researchers had evaluated the effectiveness of QLB in controlling postoperative pain
      in different patient populations. In these studies, the effectiveness of the QLB was mainly
      assessed by postoperative pain scores and analgesia consumption, rather than adapting any of
      the more comprehensive recovery scales .

      Postoperative quality of recovery scale (PostopQRS) is a relatively new recovery score, which
      was first published on 2010, and was designed to be a tool for assessment of multiple domains
      in recovery. In this assessment tool, recovery was defined as return to the pre-surgery base
      line scores or better.

      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the recovery after cesarean section in
      patients who will receive Quadratus Lumborum Block QLB as a part of multimodal analgesia
      using Postoperative quality of recovery scale.
