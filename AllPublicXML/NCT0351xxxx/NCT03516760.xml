    <textblock>
      This dose-escalating phase I trial assesses for the first time the safety, the side effects
      and the harmlessness, as well as the therapeutical benefit of the new study drug GEM333 in
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This AML was relapsed after previous therapy or
      was refractory to the standard therapy.
