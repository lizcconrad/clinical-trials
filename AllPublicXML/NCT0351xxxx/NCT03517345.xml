  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is aimed to evaluate whether the addition of prebiotics to patients'
      post-operative diets increases Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery effects. Half of the
      participants were randomized prebiotic with conventional yogurt, while the other half were
      randomized only conventional yogurt as a snack

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following bariatric surgery, positive alterations are observed in gut microbiota, intestinal
      peptides, and inflammatory cytokines. Previous studies demonstrate that prebiotic use alone
      in a tolerable dose (which is 10 g/day) among obese, overweight, or diabetic individuals
      accelerated the weight loss by reducing hunger and food intake. Furthermore, it could also
      contribute to the improvement of glucose homeostasis by increase postprandial PYY and GLP-1
      levels. Prebiotics feeds healthy intestinal bacteria and enhances their positive effects. The
      present positive effects appear with SCFAs that stimulates PYY and GLP-1 release and produced
      by fermentation of prebiotics by bacteria. From this point forth, it was hypothesized that
      post-operative pre-probiotic usage may enhance the effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass
      (RYGB). In addition, administration of pre-probiotics following RYGB may be considered as a
      simple and cheap treatment support, especially for protecting patients with poor medicine
      compliance against nutritional deficiencies, as well as for diabetic patients whose glucose
      regulations deteriorate in the long term, and for those who regain weight.

      With the result that the effects of prebiotic supplementation on metabolic results of RYGB
      surgery in this prospective, randomized, controlled study with a duration of 24 weeks were
      tested.
