  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with C5 or C6 tetraplegia have paralysis of the triceps brachii. Elbow extension can
      be surgically restored by transferring the tendon from a preserved muscle onto the tendon of
      the paralyzed triceps brachii.

      The most frequently used method transfers the posterior deltoid tendon. However, transferring
      the posterior deltoid can create an imbalance in the shoulder joint and this technique is not
      recommended when the clavicular head of the pectoralis major is weak.

      In such cases, a preferred method is a biceps brachii tendon transfer. The success of this
      intervention relies on the ability of the patient to dissociate the drive between the
      transferred biceps brachii and the other elbow flexor muscles.

      Even though tendon transfers are widely used, the subsequent reorganization of muscle
      coordination strategies remains largely unknown. The identification of muscle synergies and
      co-coactivations from electromyography (EMG) signals, defined as groups of muscles activated
      in synchrony, may help to provide a deeper understanding of changes in muscle coordination.
      The objective of this study is to investigate for the first time the reorganization of muscle
      coordination after surgical restoration of elbow extension through the identification of
      muscle synergies and the quantification of muscle co-activations.

      Four participants with tetraplegia will take part to this study. The experimental procedure
      will be conducted before their surgery and once a month during 6 months after their surgery.

      The procedure consists of performing consecutive elbow extension-flexion cycles with the
      shoulder abducted at different angles. Surface and intramuscular EMG measurements will be
      collected for several upper limb muscles. Muscle synergies and co-activations will be
      extracted from the EMG measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for a detailed and quantified follow-up during rehabilitation after an elbow
      extension restoration in people with tetraplegia. Surface or intramuscular electromyography
      (EMG) gives information on muscular activation, and can detect small but clinically relevant
      modifications in muscular activation of patients with tetraplegia. To this day, no study
      measured the evolution of muscular activation in the upper limb of people with tetraplegia
      who underwent an elbow extension restoration surgery. The objective of this study is to
      investigate for the first time the reorganization of muscle coordination after surgical
      restoration of elbow extension through the identification of muscle synergies and the
      quantification of muscle co-activations.

      Four participants with tetraplegia will take part to this study. The experimental procedure
      will be conducted before their surgery and once a month during 6 months after their surgery.

      The 1h procedure consists of performing consecutive elbow extension-flexion cycles with the
      shoulder abducted at different angles. Surface and intramuscular EMG measurements will be
      collected for several upper limb muscles. Kinematic markers will be placed in order to
      measure the upper limb range of motion and movement velocity.

      Surface EMG signals will be band-pass filtered (10-450Hz), full wave rectified, and smoothed
      with a low-pass filter (10Hz). Onset and offset times will be defined through the calculation
      of an activation threshold. For each session and each muscle, EMG amplitude will be
      normalized to its peak value across all trials. Each elbow extension-flexion cycle will be
      interpolated to 100 time points: 0-50% was extension; 50-100% flexion.

      For each participant and each movement, all combinations of muscle synergies will be
      identified using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) from the EMG data and data will then
      be averaged across the cycles. Co-activations will be directly identified from the EMG data.

    <description>The objective measurement of human movement through the use of kinematic markers and electromyography is a clinical exam commonly performed to analyze the movements of patients with motor control disorders. The different steps are the following:
A clinical exam is performed by the Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation clinician (passive range of motion , spasticity, muscular force, etc.).
Intramuscular and surface electromyography and kinematic markers are placed on the upper limb of the participant. A maximum of two intramuscular electrodes will be inserted with guiding of an echography system.
The participant will be asked to perform several upper limb movements: specifically, he will be asked to perform consecutive cycles of elbow extension-flexions with the shoulder at different levels of abduction. Times of rest will be given to the participants.
Time of the procedure is estimated to 1h, with only about 2 minutes of active effortless movements from the participants.</description>
