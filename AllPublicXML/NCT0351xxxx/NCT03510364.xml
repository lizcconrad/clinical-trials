      Investigators examined the associations between SSS, energy balance, food intake and changes
      in body composition following a high calorie lunch for 2 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjective social status (SSS) is inversely associated with body fatness. The physiological
      and psychological effects of low social status may spur increased energy intake as a strategy
      to buffer against future food scarcity. Investigators' central hypothesis is that females
      with low SSS will not compensate for excess calorie consumption in a single large meal as
      well as individuals with high SSS, and will therefore remain in positive energy balance
      leading to body fat gain in response to daily large meals. Investigators' objective is to
      understand the influence of SSS on eating behavior, weight gain, and energetic compensation.
      Investigators conducted a 14-day feeding protocol that consisted of consumption of a
      lunch-time meal that was 60% of participants' estimated 24-hour energy requirements each day
      in female participants between 20-50 years, with a body mass index between 25- 30 kg/m2.
      Free-living food intake was recorded using the Remote Food Photography Method outside of the
      lab on days 1-2 (early), 7-8 (middle), and 12-13 (late), to measure compensation in response
      to the large lunch. 24-Hour energy balance, 24 hour intake and post-lunch energy intake were
      calculated for those days. Investigators measured body composition using Dual energy x ray
      absorptiometry (DXA), weight and resting energy expenditure at the baseline and at the end of
      the 14 days of the intervention.

    <description>We measured 24-hr energy balance to assess the association of SSS with positive energy balance in response to a daily large meal perturbation. Twenty four hour energy balance was calculated for each time point as follows, and all six time points were averaged to get an average energy balance over the 2-week period:
24 hr Energy balance = Average 24 hr Energy intake / Resting Energy Expenditure *1.4 For the early and middle time point 24EB calculations, baseline resting energy expenditure (REE) was used and for late 24hr EB, final REE obtained at the end of the study was used.</description>

    <description>For the feeding intervention, participants consumed a meal that contains 60% of their energy daily energy requirement as a lunch time meal for 14 consecutive days under observation except during the weekends. To ensure the participant receives 60% of the daily energy requirement as a lunch meal we added a supplemental shake to the standard 1200 kcal meal.</description>
