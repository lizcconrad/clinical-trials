      This study proposes ischemic preconditioning (IPC) as a novel intervention to improve walking
      distance in patients with intermittent claudication. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a
      circulatory condition in which large supply blood vessels narrow, reducing oxygen and
      nutrient distribution to peripheral tissues. IPC protects against tissue damage caused by
      ischemia and can improve functional capacity in patients recovering from stroke; however, the
      benefit of ischemic preconditioning in patients with peripheral arterial disease remains
      unclear.

      The investigators predict that ischemic preconditioning (IPC) will delay claudication onset
      time (COT), increase peak walking time (PWT) and improve muscle strength in patients with
      intermittent claudication.

      The investigators will determine whether IPC improves claudication onset time (COT) and peak
      walking time (PWT) in patients with intermittent claudication. A motorized treadmill will be
      employed to assess COT and PWT.

      The investigators will determine whether IPC can improve muscle strength and time to pain
      onset in the affected leg of patients with intermittent claudication. These metrics will be
      assessed quantitatively using a Biodexâ„¢ dynamometer.

    <description>Subjects will perform muscle contractions for muscle groups of interest (knee extensors/flexors and dorsiflexors/plantarflexors). Contractions will be measured in newton-meters. The duration will be determined by the time subjects first feel pain and when the pain becomes too great to continue. The investigators will provide subjects with visual feedback on the monitor throughout the testing.</description>

    <description>A standard blood pressure cuff will be placed on the right or left thigh, depending on the affected side, to occlude blood flow. The cuff will be inflated to 225 mmHg to prevent blood flow. Each session will consist of 4 cycles of 5 minute IPC applications, followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion for a total of 35 minutes.</description>
