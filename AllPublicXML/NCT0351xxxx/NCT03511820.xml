  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal drug used for the treatment of many systemic fungal
      infections. It is associated with many side effects which in some cases can be very severe
      and potentially lethal. Lipo-AB® is a true single bilayer liposomal drug delivery system,
      consisting of unilamellar bilayer liposomes with amphotericin B intercalated within the
      membrane. Prior studies showed that the liposomal formulation of amphotericin B greatly
      reduces the side effects of the parent drug, such as nephrotoxicity. This study is designed
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lipo-AB® in neutropenic patients with persistent fever
      in routine clinical practice in Taiwan.

        1. Primary objective:

           • To evaluate the nephrotoxicity of Lipo-AB® (amphotericin B) treatment in neutropenic
           patients with persistent fever in Taiwan clinical practice.

        2. Secondary objectives:

      (1) To evaluate the safety profile of Lipo-AB® (amphotericin B) in neutropenic patients with
      persistent fever in Taiwan clinical practice.

      (2) To evaluate the treatment efficacy of Lipo-AB® (amphotericin B) in neutropenic patients
      with persistent fever in Taiwan clinical practice.
