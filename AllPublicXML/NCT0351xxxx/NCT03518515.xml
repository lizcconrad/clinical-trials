  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, clinical trial will be performed to assess changes in body weight and fat mass
      with daily potato consumption versus a calorie-matched snack of almonds.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 30-day randomized, controlled trial with 3 arms: 1) non-potato food (almonds), 2)
      standard white potato French fry, 3) standard white potato French fry with potential
      glycemia-modulating spice/seasoning mix added.

      Free-living study participants will be assigned to consume one of the 3 foods (calorie
      matched) each day for a 30-day period. Body composition (via dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry; DXA), and blood chemistry will be assayed at baseline and study completion,
      along with a sub-sample of subjects participating in a meal-based tolerance tests at study
      completion.
