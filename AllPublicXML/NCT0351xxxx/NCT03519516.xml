      Phase I clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ophthalmic solution
      PRO-174 versus Sophixín Ofteno®, elaborated by Laboratorios Sophia, S.A. of C.V. on the
      ocular surface of ophthalmologically and clinically healthy subjects.

      Goals:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the formulation PRO-174 manufactured by
      Laboratorios Sophia, S.A. of C.V. on the ocular surface of clinically healthy subjects.

      Hypothesis:

      The ophthalmic solution PRO-174 presents a safety and tolerability profile similar to the
      comparator in healthy subjects.

      Phase I clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ophthalmic solution
      PRO-174 versus Sophixín Ofteno®, elaborated by Laboratorios Sophia, S.A. of C.V. on the
      ocular surface of ophthalmologically and clinically healthy subjects.

      Goals:

      Methodology:

      Phase I clinical trial, controlled, of parallel groups, double blind, randomized,
      exploratory.

      Number of patients:

      30 subjects, divided into 2 groups [15 subjects (30 eyes) exposed per group]

      Test product, dose and route of administration, lot number:

        -  PRO-174. Levofloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution. Prepared by Laboratorios Sophia, S.A. of
           C.V., Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico.

        -  Dosage: 1 drop every 2 hours during the waking period (8 daily applications), on day 1
           and 2; continuing with 1 drop every 4 hours during the waking period (4 daily
           applications) from day 3 to 7. Both eyes.

        -  Route of administration: ophthalmic

      Duration of treatment: 7 days

      Statistical methodology:

      The data will be expressed with measures of central tendency: mean and standard deviation for
      the quantitative variables. The qualitative variables will be presented in frequencies and
      percentages. The statistical analysis will be carried out through the Mann-Whitney U test for
      the quantitative variables for the difference between the groups. The intra-group difference
      will be made with the Wilcoxon rank test. The difference between the qualitative variables
      will be analyzed by means of X2 (Chi2). An alpha ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant.

    <masking_description>The blinding will correspond to the research subject and the principal investigator. In addition, the statistical analysis will be carried out in a blinded manner for the partial and final analysis.
The masking will be done using boxes in the primary packaging identical in the two groups. Blinding for the research subject and the researcher will be done by replacing the commercial labels in the case of the comparator in the bottles and the use of identical labels that contain the allocation number.
Blinding may be opened in the following cases:
Presence of a serious adverse event.
Safety alarm due to the use of the drugs under study.
In case the sponsor determines it for any reason of security or other reason that considers pertinent.</masking_description>
