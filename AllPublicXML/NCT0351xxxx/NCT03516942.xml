      This research trial studies the financial burden in patients with stage I-III colon or rectal
      cancer who are undergoing treatment. Collecting data from patients about their cost and
      quality of life may help doctors to better understand the impact of cancer treatment on a
      patient?s employment and finances.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden from baseline (within 60
      days of diagnosis) to 12 months after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with
      curative-intent.

      SECONDARY OBJECTVIES:

      I. Evaluate reported access and utilization of financial services (i.e. financial counselor,
      navigator, social workers) and its association to financial burden in the first 12 months
      after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent.

      II. Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden and employment limitations
      from baseline (within 60 days of diagnosis) to 3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis of colon
      or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent.

      III. Evaluate long term outcomes at 24 months after diagnosis including financial burden,
      employment limitations and adherence to clinical follow-up guidelines.

      IV. Evaluate the change of quality-of-life outcome (QoL) from baseline to 12 months and its
      association with predictors.

      V. Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden from baseline to 12 months
      using alternate measures of financial burden (i.e. impact of cost questions and single item
      from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] questionnaire [Q]30).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires over 20-60 minutes at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24
      months after cancer diagnosis.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months after cancer diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Will calculate the difference of Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) measurements from baseline to 12-month follow up for the completers who provide data at both time points, and use the paired t-test to assess if the mean difference is significantly different from zero. In case the data are not normally distributed, nonparametric methods (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test) will be used instead to assess the difference. In addition, linear regression models with the change of COST from baseline to 12-month follow up as the response variable will be fit to investigate the impact of other factors, including demographics variables (e.g., age, sex, marital status), clinical variables (e.g., stage of disease, malignancy type, chemotherapy status), baseline questionnaire variables (e.g., self-efficacy,). The three-level treatment status (intravenous [IV] chemotherapy, chemotherapy without IV, and no chemotherapy) will also be evaluated as a predictor.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reported access and utilization of financial services</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will evaluate reported access and utilization of financial services (i.e. financial counselor, navigator, social workers) and its association to financial burden in the first 12 months after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent. Will be assessed by Consumer Based Cancer Care Value Index (CCVI). For the continuous item variable, will conduct the paired t test to examine the difference if the distribution is normal. If not normally distributed, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used. For the categorical item variable, the paired proportion test (e.g., McNemar test) will be used instead. The association between CCVI and COST measures will be evaluated using the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of self-reported financial burden and employment limitations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months after cancer diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire, Work Ability Index, and Work after cancer survey. If the distributions are normal, will conduct the paired t tests to examine the differences of these variables. If not normally distributed, Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used. The association with COST measures will be evaluated using the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Long term outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will evaluate long term outcomes at 24 months after diagnosis including financial burden, employment limitations and adherence to clinical follow-up guidelines. Specially, linear (or generalized linear) mixed model will be fit to study the change in the mean response over time and also the effects of cancer type, stage, treatment plan and demographics, etc. on financial burden. In case the changes in the mean response over time are not linear, the quadratic trends or non-linear trends via spline may be considered in the modeling. Interactions will be evaluated as well.</description>
