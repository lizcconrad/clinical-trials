  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer will be resistant to Chemotherapy drugs after treated for a period of time
      .In the past, the classical treatment regiment was to change other drug after tumor
      progressed. In theory, the continuous use of such a drug could shortening the patient's drug
      resistance time. It has been shown that the alternate use of the two drug combinations is
      reasonable in clinical. This application can not only further improve the curative effect but
      also significantly reduce the side effects. So the investigators are going to carry out a
      prospective phase II clinical study. The control group change to second-line treatment after
      progression of first-line drugs. The experimental group use the first line and the second
      line,alternately, for every two cycles. The combination of bevacizumab is a first line
      development, and the second line can still be used .Objective to compare the clinical value
      of XELOX and XELIRI alternation regimen in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal
      cancer.
