  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of essential oils on nausea, vomiting, and quality of life
      scores among pregnant women. Participants will receive either an essential oil roll-on
      product or a placebo product to apply to their temples and jaw line daily for 6 days.

    <textblock>
      The inhalation of certain essential oils has been found to reduce feelings of nausea and to
      improve quality of life during pregnancy.

      The essential oils used in this study are applied topically to the temples and jaw line every
      4-6 waking hours over a 6-day period. Each application will produce an exposure that lasts up
      to 30-45 minutes before fading. At the end of each day, nausea and vomiting levels will be
      assessed using a validated measurement instrument.

      Quality of life is measured using a 30-question tool that measures both pregnancy-related
      quality of life and pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting.

    <measure>Change from Nausea and Vomiting 6-part Quantification of Emesis scale</measure>
    <time_frame>daily for 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea and vomiting are measured once per day using the 6-item Quantification of Emesis 24-hour scale (PUQE) scale. This scale includes 3 questions which are ranked on a scale of 1-5, with higher scores indicating higher levels of pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. The other 3 questions are open-ended questions which ask participants about perceived well-being.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life for Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy 30-part scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured twice, at the start of the study and at the end of the study, using the Health Related Quality of Life for Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy (NVPQOL) instrument. This instrument includes 30 questions which are ranked on a Likert scale with 1 indicating &quot;none of the time&quot; and 7 indicating &quot;all of the time.&quot; Higher scores indicate higher levels of nausea and vomiting, with reduced quality of life.</description>
