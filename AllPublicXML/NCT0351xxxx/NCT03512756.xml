    <textblock>
      A prospective, open-label phase 2 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer subjects who have
      failed at least one line of any prior chemotherapy. The trial is designed to evaluate the of
      SM-88 therapy on pancreatic cancer and will measure multiple efficacy and safety endpoints,
      including overall response rate, overall survival, progression free survival, relevant
      biomarkers, quality of life and safety. In the initial stage of the trial (36 subjects), two
      dose levels of SM-88's metyrosine-derivative will be evaluated.

          1. Biopsy-proven metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented radiographic
             disease progression on or after one or more systemic therapies. Chemotherapy given as
             part of prior chemoradiation in the setting of non-metastatic pancreatic cancer does
             not count as a line of therapy. Chemotherapy given for at least 4 months as adjuvant
             after complete response is considered as a first line therapy.

             chemotherapy.

          3. Subjects must have measurable lesions (according to standard RECIST 1.1).

         15. Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential, not breast-feeding or
             must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment,
             confirmed prior to treatment on day 1.

         16. Subjects of fertile potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse with partners of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any screening laboratory, electrocardiogram (ECG), or other findings that, in the
             opinion of the investigator or the sponsor, indicate an unacceptable risk for the

         17. Subjects must not have any clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical
             condition(s) including, but not limited to uncontrolled nausea/vomiting/diarrhea;
             active uncontrolled infection; symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart
             Association [NYHA] class &gt;= II); unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia;

             schizophrenia, uncontrolled depression or other uncontrolled disorders.

         23. Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to phenytoin, its inactive ingredients, or

             phenytoin.

         24. Subjects exhibiting idiosyncratic reactions to psoralen compounds.

         25. Subjects with a hypersensitivity to sirolimus.

         26. Subjects with a history of the light sensitive diseases for which methoxsalen would be
             contraindicated. Diseases associated with photosensitivity include lupus
             erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, variegate
             porphyria, xeroderma pigmentosum, and albinism.

         27. Subjects treated, or anticipated to be treated, with delavirdine (due to potential for
             loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of
             non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors caused by phenytoin).

         28. Subjects with melanoma or with a history of melanoma, invasive squamous cell
             carcinomas, or aphakia (due to contraindication for use of methoxsalen).

         29. Subjects with prior organ transplant or being treated, or anticipated to be treated,
             with cyclosporine (because long-term administration of the combination of cyclosporine
             and sirolimus is associated with deterioration of renal function).

         30. Subjects with a seizure disorder that is not well controlled or who have required a
             change in seizure medications within 60 days of enrollment to the trial.

         31. Subjects treated, or anticipated to be treated, with a calcineurin inhibitor (because
             concomitant use of sirolimus and a calcineurin inhibitor increases the risk of
             calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic
             purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy [HUS/TTP/TMA]).

         32. Subjects with interstitial lung disease (ILD) (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis
             obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis).
