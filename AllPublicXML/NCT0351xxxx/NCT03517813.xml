  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, prospective screening trial of women at high risk for
      developing breast cancer, enriched with women with suspicious lesions on breast MRI which
      have been recommended for biopsy.

      Primary Aim: Measure and compare the diagnostic performance of CESM, ABMR, and standard
      breast MRI, using the following performance measures: cancer detection rate (CDR), biopsy
      rate, and cancer yield of biopsy (also known as positive predictive value 3 or PPV3).

      Secondary Aims:

        1. Compare screening performance outcome measures of sensitivity, specificity, and area
           under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for CESM, ABMR, and standard
           breast MRI. This will determine the feasibility of each modality as an alternative to
           standard breast MRI and provide valuable pilot data for designing a larger clinical
           trial to evaluate non-inferiority of either or both modalities.

        2. Breast cancer characteristics (size, histologic subtype, node-positivity, AJCC stage)
           will be assessed in the overall cohort, and stratified by mode of detection for each
           modality(screen-detected versus interval).
