  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Utilization of circulating-tumor-cell (CTC) and cell free DNA (cfDNA) as novel and
      noninvasive tests for diagnosis confirmation, therapy selection, and cancer surveillance is a
      rapidly growing area of interest. In the wake of FDA approval of a liquid biopsy test, it is
      important for clinicians to acknowledge the obvious clinical utility of liquid biopsy for
      cancer management throughout the course of the disease.
