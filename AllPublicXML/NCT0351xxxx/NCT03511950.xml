  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritonitis is a common and devastating complication in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
      It is a known fact that persistent inflammatory state and nutritional deterioration are
      closely associated with increased mortality in PD patients.And resting energy
      expenditure(REE) is significantly increased in acute and chronic inflammation in patients
      with chronic kidney disease (including dialysis patients).However,it is limited to the
      changing trend and duration of REE in peritonitis.Investigators hypothesize that the increase
      in total energy consumption resulting from the increase of REE which may accompany with
      decreased energy intake will lead to negative energy balance and nutritional deterioration,
      which may affect the prognosis of patients.Therefore,a prospective cohort study will be
      designed to dynamically research the change of REE accompanied with the nutrition status in
      peritonitis and provide the basis for peritonitis management in the future.
