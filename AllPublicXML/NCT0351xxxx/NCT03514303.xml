  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential correlation of the results of
      allergen-specific skin prick tests (SPT) to that of allergen-specific microarray
      determination (microassay test). Subjects who meet enrollment criteria, after signing an IRB
      approved consent form, will perform a minor finger prick blood draw and blot to be mailed off
      for microassay analysis. Specific statistical analysis will be done to assess all potential
      correlations between SPT and microassay. This study design should enable assessment of the
      level of correlation between SPT results and microassay results for specified allergens
      within a cohort of subjects with allergic rhinitis.

    <textblock>
      Prospective subjects for study entry will initially be screened by the results of their
      allergy skin test that were acquired within the past two years. In order to be a prospective
      subject positive SPT results of five of the following ten allergens will be required: Dust
      Mite, Ragweed, Cat Dander, Johnson Grass, Bermuda Grass, Timothy Grass, Oak, Cladosporium,
      Dog Dander, and Cockroach. After signing an IRB approved consent form, these patients will
      undergo a finger prick blood draw and blot. This study will be conducted in compliance with
      the protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.

      Subjects 18 years of age or over who have never initiated a course of allergy immunotherapy
      or have not completed more than three months of SCIT immunotherapy will be enrolled.

      Sub-investigator(s) will screen patient charts from a database of patients previously tested
      using the UAS protocol. Patients that qualify based on inclusion criteria will be contacted
      by phone and asked if they would be willing to participate in this study.

      Subject arrives to the clinic and all inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified by their
      primary physician and the sub-investigator. Sub-investigator insures that the IRB verified
      consent form is signed and that the patient has no questions. Subject or sub-investigator
      will perform the finger prick and blot using the instructions listed on the Allergenex sample
      collection packet. The sample will be mailed to Spiriplex to be analyzed using their
      microarray device. The microassay results will be sent to the primary investigation site for
      correlation analysis with the previously logged SPT results. These results will be blinded to
      the statisticians and researchers that will be determining potential correlation between SPT
      and microassay results.
