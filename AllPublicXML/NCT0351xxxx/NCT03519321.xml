    <textblock>
      Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) is defined as scoliosis with onset under the age of ten years,
      regardless of etiology. It is a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spine which can
      cause significant physical and psychological problems. Currently there are two basic
      treatment options available for EOS: non-surgical and surgical. ApiFix Ltd. has developed a
      novel growing rod system for surgical treatment of EOS, the MID-C system. It is indicated for
      patients with a scoliosis of 35 to 75 degrees Cobb angle
