      Search location: Urogynecology Ambulatory Care of Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital (HCPA)

      Patients or participants: Women will be included in aged 35-70 years who have had sexual
      intercourse in the last 12 months and who are able to understand the instruments, besides
      signing an informed consent form. Women will be excluded with latex allergy, who have made
      pelvic radiotherapy, or be undergoing chemotherapy, puerperal a year, or who use
      antidepressants and / or anxiolytics.

      Intervention and measures: The evaluation consists of a medical history form, which will
      include personal data; the assessment of the MAP function is performed by the pressure
      biofeedback; for assessment of quality of life will use the questionnaire ICQI-SF and sexual
      function the PISQ-12 before and after Pelvic Floor Muscle Training.

      Expected results: To estimate effectiveness of Pelvic Floor Muscle Training in the quality of
      life and functionality of these muscles in women with urinary incontinence.
