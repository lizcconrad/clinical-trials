    <textblock>
      This study explores the levels of daily physical activity and sedentary behaviour in
      Maastricht University's undergraduate first year students. Furthermore, this study explores
      the correlations between the students' demographical background information with their levels
      of physical activity and sedentary behaviour.

    <textblock>
      Participants are randomly recruited from the student population. The participants are invited
      to complete a demographics questionnaire, wear an ActivPAl accelerometer for 7 days, and
      complete daily diaries (modified International Physical Activity Questionnaire) throughout
      the 7 days.

    <measure>Time (minutes) spent in various activities (sleeping, being sedentary, standing and stepping) measured by the ActivPAL accelerometer</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ActivPAL accelerometer senses limb position and activity. From this information, it can reliably discriminate periods of upright activity from seated or lying activities. Furthermore, the cadence (stepping rate) of upright activities can be accurately recorded. Energy expenditure (estimated by the ActivPAL accelerometer using Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)) and cadence (step frequency, i.e., steps per minute) will be used to distinguish between sleeping, being sedentary, standing and stepping. The time spent sleeping, being sedentary, standing and stepping will be measured and compared against global recommendations of physical activity (e.g., WHO recommendations).</description>
