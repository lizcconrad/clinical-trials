  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to use patient-centered in vitro and in vivo models to
      answer the fundamental question of whether or not pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 result in
      an increased risk of CV disease

    <intervention_name>echocardiography</intervention_name>
    <description>Resting echocardiograms (Vivid E9 or E95, GE Healthcare) with conventional measures of systolic and diastolic function, in conjunction with posthoc quantitation of novel measures of strain and strain rate will be obtained at each study time point.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cardiopulmonary Exercise Training</intervention_name>
    <description>A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET, also called V02 test) will be completed at each study time point utilizing a standard clinical protocol, on either a stationary bike or treadmill. The purpose of this test is to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (V02 max) as in index of cardiopulmonary fitness. Resting ECG, heart rate, and BP will be obtained prior to beginning the test, during each stage of the test and for 5 minutes after the test is stopped.</description>

    <intervention_name>Blood Collection</intervention_name>
    <description>We will obtain blood samples (approximately 16mL) at baseline and (approximately 12mL) at each follow-up visit. Typically these will be drawn via peripheral venipuncture, however if patients have a port-a-cath in place, blood may be drawn from the port instead.</description>

          -  Initial diagnosis of Breast Cancer in 2005 or later BRCA testing documented and
             scanned into patient's electronic medical record showing confirmation of a germline
             mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that is predicted or suspected to be deleterious.

          -  Results from a local laboratory are acceptable for study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Stage IV Breast Cancer

          -  V02 Testing contraindicated for any reason, including:

          -  Myocardial infarction (within past 3 months)

          -  High-risk unstable angina;

          -  High-risk or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias;

               -  Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis;

               -  Uncontrolled symptomatic heart failure;

               -  Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction;

               -  Known aortic aneurysm; or

               -  Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may impede testing
                  of the study hypothesis or make it unsafe to engage in the V02 test

                    -  Women who are pregnant

                    -  Any other clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the
                       investigator's opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's
                       ability to give informed consent
