      The purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of the study drug nintedanib when
      combined with azacitidine and the associated side effects of the combination in older adults
      with AML characterized by HOX gene overexpression who are not interested in or not considered
      fit for standard intensive chemotherapy. The use of the study drug nintedanib in this study
      is investigational. Investigational means that this medication has not yet been approved by
      the FDA to treat this type of cancer. Azacitidine received FDA Approval in 2004 for
      myelodysplastic syndrome (a blood cancer related to AML) and has a National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommendation for treatment of older adults who are not
      candidates for or decline intensive remission induction therapy. We expect participation to
      continue in this study based on each participant's response to the drug, and ability to
      tolerate treatment. Participants may continue to receive study treatments for 6 cycles (one
      cycle is 28 days long). If the 6 cycles of treatment is completed, participants may be moved
      on to a maintenance phase of treatment. Treatment will continue until the participant's
      leukemia gets worse, or they experience serious side effects, have a break in treatment for
      more than 56 days or the study doctor feels it is best for study treatments to stop.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nintedanib for combination treatment of
      nintedanib and azacytidine (5-azacitidine) in the treatment of newly diagnosed and
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia with HOX overexpression and who are ineligible for
      intensive chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Adverse events (AEs) including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed according
      to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      4.03.

      II. To determine median overall survival. III. To determine complete remission (CR) rate.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine composite CR rate (CR + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery
      [CRp] + complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery [Cri]).

      II. To determine duration of confirmed response. III. To determine event free survival. IV.
      To determine leukemia free survival. V. To establish correlation between response and
      pre-treatment Fgf2 levels and change in Fgf-2 levels during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of azacitidine.

      Participants receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and azacitidine
      intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion
      of 6 courses, participants may discontinue treatment, receive nintedanib every 4-8 weeks, or
      receive nintedanib and azacitidine every 4-8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at every 3 months for 12
      months and then every 6 months for up to 24 months.
