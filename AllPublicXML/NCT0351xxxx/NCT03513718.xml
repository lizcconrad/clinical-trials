    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to determine the incidence and severity of acute
      kidney injuries (AKI) after heart surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in the pediatric
      intensive care unit (PICU) in Lausanne, Switzerland.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will review in a retrospective way, all patients aged between 0 and 16
      years, admitted in the PICU after cardiac surgery on CPB from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2016. They
      will asses for AKI. The first step is to determine the incidence and severity, the second
      step is to determine the risk factors for AKI and/or protecting factors.
