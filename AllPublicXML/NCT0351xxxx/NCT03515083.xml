  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to determine actual compliance of direct oral anticoagulants and how to
      improve this to reduce risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Mobile health
      tools have been implemented world-wide in various patient populations as means of reducing
      cardiovascular risk and improving disease management. Results of these interventions have
      been mixed with some interventions demonstrating significant improvement while others
      demonstrated no difference between the intervention group and the control group. More
      importantly, these studies indicate that implementation of mobile health tools is feasible in
      various patient populations and it may just be a matter of finding the correct intervention
      for a given disease state. The aim of this study is to increase awareness of atrial
      fibrillation as a means of improving compliance with anticoagulant medication.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that patients with atrial fibrillation will have
      improved compliance with apixaban therapy if they complete a daily measurement of heart
      rhythm via a smartphone electrocardiogram monitor, as compared to patients managed in a
      conventional manner.

      Primary Endpoint

        1. Primary Endpoint 1: is the percent compliance with apixaban therapy as measured by the
           amount of apixaban medication that was consumed per month. Compliance is defined as &quot;the
           extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the prescribed interval and dose of a
           dosing regimen.&quot; Percent compliance will be measured as a continuous variable and strict
           cutoffs for 'compliant' and 'non-compliant' status will not be imposed.

           Secondary Endpoints

        2. Secondary Endpoint 1: is the number of deaths from any cause, stroke, and
           hospitalization for atrial fibrillation and/or congestive heart failure. Given the low
           numbers of patients in this study, this will be a composite endpoint of all of these
           outcomes, since there is insufficient sample size to examine each outcome individually.

        3. Secondary Endpoint 2: is the self assessment of atrial fibrillation symptom severity
           through the use of a standardized scale.

      While the secondary endpoints are not directly related to the primary endpoint, there is a
      possibility that the intervention may lead to changes in health maintenance behavior, which
      may lead to differences in the secondary endpoints. While this study may not be powered to
      differentiate between these secondary endpoints, if a trend is noted, this may be hypothesis
      generating for future studies.

    <description>self assessment of atrial fibrillation symptom severity through the use of a the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of Life (AFEQT) Questionnaire. Section 1 of the scale gathers details about whether or not the patient is symptomatic and how often they are having symptoms. Section 2 is evaluated as a score from 14-98 indicating the total effect of atrial fibrillation on quality of life. Lower values represent a better outcome. Subscales are not combined.</description>

    <description>In the experimental group, each patient will be issued an AliveCor Kardia electrocardiogram monitor that is compatible with their smartphone. Patients will be instructed on the use of the monitor at the initial visit with the study nurse. The patient will submit daily electrocardiogram transmission via on online portal. The study nurse may contact them via text message to remind them to submit their recordings, if they forget.
The remainder of the treatment of the experimental group will be identical to the control group. At the conclusion of the study, the patient will complete their final atrial fibrillation symptom assessment scale. Their smartphone electrocardiogram monitor will be reviewed to ensure that all of the recordings were retrieved successfully.</description>

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the control group would receive the standard of care treatment for atrial fibrillation, including cardioversion and ablation as indicated. At monthly visits with the study nurse, a smartphone electrocardiogram monitor will be used to record patient's heart rhythm. No other intervention would be performed during the monthly visit. It is necessary to meet the subject at least once per month to receive the previous month's supply of pills and provide them with the next month's supply of pills. If these subjects were met less frequently, it is possible that the previous month's supply of pills might be lost by the end of the study.
During the study, if the patient is taken off anticoagulation due to medical contraindication or after an ablation, they will continue to be followed monthly but will not receive apixaban medication.</description>
