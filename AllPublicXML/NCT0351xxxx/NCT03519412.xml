  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with RAS-extended mutations who
      failed standard therapies will be tested for MMR-deficiency. MMRd patients will undergo
      treatment with pembrolizumab while MMR-proficient patients will be tested for
      o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) expression (IHC) and then for MGMT promoter
      methylation. MGMT IHC-negative, promoter methylation positive patients will be treated with
      temozolomide (TMZ). Patients progressing under temozolomide will be tested for tumor
      mutational burden (TMB) and proceed to pembrolizumab if TMB is &gt; 20 mutations/Mb. The primary
      study hypothesis is that tumors with acquired resistance to temozolomide become hypermutated
      and are sensitive to pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arethusa consists of three different phases - SCREENING Phase, PRIMING phase, and TRIAL
      Phase.

        -  SCREENING PHASE: RAS-mutated metastatic CRC patients who have failed standard therapies
           are tested for MMR status. MMR-Deficient (MMR-D) patients proceed directly to TRIAL
           Phase and are treated with pembrolizumab. MMR-Proficient (MMR-P) patients are further
           tested for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression by
           immunohistochemistry and promoter methylation analysis. MGMT negative patients proceed
           to PRIMING phase. MGMT positive patients go off-study.

        -  PRIMING PHASE: MMR-P MGMT-negative patients receive TMZ therapy until progression. At PD
           (disease progression) patients are biopsied to determine the tumor mutational burden
           (TMB). Patients with TMB &lt; 20 mutations/megabase go off-study. Patients with TMB &gt;20
           mutations/megabase, proceed to trial phase.

        -  TRIAL PHASE: Eligible patients are treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression,
           unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
