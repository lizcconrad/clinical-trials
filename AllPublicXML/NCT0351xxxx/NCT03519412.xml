  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with RAS-extended mutations who
      failed standard therapies will be tested for MMR-deficiency. MMRd patients will undergo
      treatment with pembrolizumab while MMR-proficient patients will be tested for
      o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) expression (IHC) and then for MGMT promoter
      methylation. MGMT IHC-negative, promoter methylation positive patients will be treated with
      temozolomide (TMZ). Patients progressing under temozolomide will be tested for tumor
      mutational burden (TMB) and proceed to pembrolizumab if TMB is &gt; 20 mutations/Mb. The primary
      study hypothesis is that tumors with acquired resistance to temozolomide become hypermutated
      and are sensitive to pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arethusa consists of three different phases - SCREENING Phase, PRIMING phase, and TRIAL
      Phase.

        -  SCREENING PHASE: RAS-mutated metastatic CRC patients who have failed standard therapies
           are tested for MMR status. MMR-Deficient (MMR-D) patients proceed directly to TRIAL
           Phase and are treated with pembrolizumab. MMR-Proficient (MMR-P) patients are further
           tested for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression by
           immunohistochemistry and promoter methylation analysis. MGMT negative patients proceed
           to PRIMING phase. MGMT positive patients go off-study.

        -  PRIMING PHASE: MMR-P MGMT-negative patients receive TMZ therapy until progression. At PD
           (disease progression) patients are biopsied to determine the tumor mutational burden
           (TMB). Patients with TMB &lt; 20 mutations/megabase go off-study. Patients with TMB &gt;20
           mutations/megabase, proceed to trial phase.

        -  TRIAL PHASE: Eligible patients are treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression,
           unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.
