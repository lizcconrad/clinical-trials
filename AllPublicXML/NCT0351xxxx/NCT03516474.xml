      In this study the investigators are testing a device that may help us tell how well the
      participants' wound is healing. This device is called the MIMOSA, and it shines different
      &quot;colours&quot; of light on the participants' skin. It will not touch the participants' skin, or
      change how the participants' wound is healing. The MIMOSA is designed to be used alongside
      the camera that is built into the participants' cell phone, and the investigators will use a
      cell phone to take a picture of the participants' skin. This picture will tell us how much
      oxygen is getting to the participants' wound, which can tell us more about how the
      participants are healing. The MIMOSA device is an experimental diagnostic tool, and will not
      influence how the participants' wound is healing.

      The investigators have developed a tool called the MultIspectral MObile TiSsue Assessment
      (MIMOSA) Device, which attaches to a smartphone and assesses tissue health parameters in a
      quick, non-invasive way using near-infrared light. This study will use MIMOSA to monitor
      patients at 4 sites in Toronto (St. Michael's Hospital, Women's College Hospital, South
      Riverdale Community Health Centre and at Westpark Healthcare Centre). These study sites were
      chosen to cover patients from diverse clinical backgrounds: St. Michael's Hospital is an
      Acute care centre for the diabetic lower extremity, Women's College Hospital is an outpatient
      wound clinic focused on the management of DFUs, South Riverdale is a Community Health Centre
      focused on prevention, and Westpark is a rehabilitation site focused on
      post-operative/amputation care and preservation of the opposite limb. conducted on patients
      who present with a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer and are already receiving standard best
      practice as prescribed by the diabetic foot multi-disciplinary team.

        Adult diabetic subjects will be identified as candidates for our study if they present to
        the outpatient clinic, emergency department, inpatient or wound care team with or without a
        DFU. A subject is considered a patient with a DFU on one foot. If the patient has 2 wounds
        on the same foot, they are still considered one subject and both wounds are imaged. If the
        subject has a wound on the opposite foot they are considered a new subject.
