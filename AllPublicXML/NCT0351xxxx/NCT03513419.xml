  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate whether a resilience training program which includes group and individual
      parent training will be effective in improving optimism and resiliency in parents of young
      children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). By observing the level of parent optimism and
      resiliency before and after intervention, we will be able to determine whether the
      intervention is effective in improving parent resilience.

    <description>The AMOR Method: The parent resilience training involves a series of eight weekly 90-minute group sessions, as well as three individual sessions. Group session content includes training in mindfulness, grief and loss processing, acceptance and committed actions, optimistic thinking, and resilience through the use of didactic training, group discussions, and homework assignments. Individual session content will center on additional and individualized training in grief and loss processing, optimistic thinking, and maintaining resilience over time.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Parents eligible to participate include parents: a) English-speaking, b) of a child aged
        4:0 to 10:11 years, c) with a previous diagnosis of ASD and evidence of current social
        impairment (SRS-2) and repetitive behaviors (RBS-R), and d) who are able to consistently
        participate in sessions. Given budgetary constraints, direct diagnostic testing will not be
        feasible. Instead, child diagnostic status will be confirmed through review of the child's
        medical record for evidence that the child previously met ADOS criteria for ASD and shows
        clinically significant social impairment at baseline (SRS-2 T&gt;65).

        Parents who are not eligible to participate include parents: a) with severe psychiatric,
        genetic, or medical disorder among parents and/or children, b) taking psychiatric
        medication, and c) with elevated resilience scores at baseline (Total Score &gt;80 on
        CD-RISC). The DSM-5 CCSM will be administered to parents to screen for parent mental
        illness. Any identified issues on the DSM-5 CCSM will be investigated further by the PI to
        rule out severe psychiatric disorders.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        a) Severe psychiatric, genetic, or medical disorder among parents and/or children, b)
        parents taking psychiatric medication, and c) parents with elevated resilience scores at
        baseline (Total Score&gt;80 on CD-RISC). The DSM-5 Cross Cutting Symptom Measure (DSM-5 CCSM)
        will be administered to parents to screen for parent mental illness. Any identified issues
        on the DSM-5 CCSM will be investigated further by the PI to rule out severe psychiatric
        disorders. These families will be referred for behavioral consultation (available in our
        clinic) and then be reconsidered for group participation.
