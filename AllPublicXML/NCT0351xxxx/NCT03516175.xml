  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange
      used during preoxygenation for emergency surgery is at least equally effective as
      preoxygenation compared to standard tight fitting mask. Data from a recent study indicates
      that Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange might decrease the risk of
      clinically relevant desaturation below 93% of arterial oxygen saturation. The limitations
      with our previous study is that it was done only during office hours (Mon-Friday 8 am to 4
      pm) and that the power to detect the occurrence of desaturation was too low.

      Based on the above, the aim is now to conduct a clinical international multicenter study 24/7
      with 450 patients and with a simplified protocol that allows the study to be done 24/7. This
      study is done with the aim of evaluation before implementing this novel technique of
      preoxygenation into clinical practice.

      The general purpose of this project is to compare a the preoxygenation technique based on
      Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange with traditional preoxygenation
      with a tight fitting mask during rapid sequence induction (RSI) intubation in patients
      undergoing emergency surgery.
