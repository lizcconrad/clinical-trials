  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy is a syndrome of reduced motivation, characterized by diminished goal-directed
      behaviours (e.g., lack of effort), decreased goal-oriented cognitions (e.g., lack of
      interest) and blunted affect. Apathy is present in 20-50% of individuals after experiencing a
      stroke. Despite the detrimental impact of reduced goal-directed behaviours and cognitions on
      activities of daily living and cognition in stroke patients, interventions for increasing
      motivation (reducing apathy) have yet to be examined in this population. This study will
      examine the effect of goal-setting instructions on cognitive performance in stroke patients.
      The investigators hypothesize that in stroke patients, goal-setting instructions will improve
      cognitive performance relative to standard instructions. If goal-setting instructions are
      effective in improving cognitive performance, it may indicate that treatments targeting
      apathy could serve as a novel way to improve cognitive outcomes and enhance patient quality
      of life post-stroke.

      The study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. It employs a mixed design, with a
      between-subjects variable (goal-setting instructions versus standardized instructions) and a
      within-subjects variable (pre-post instructional manipulation). It is a one-time intervention
      lasting 1-2 hours. Investigators plan to enroll 72 patients in this study. All participants
      will complete neuropsychological measures to assess their baseline performance. The baseline
      measures include Trial 1 of the CVLT-II Alternate Form, the Digit Span Test, Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Semantic
      Fluency Test, Apathy Evaluation Scale and Trail Making Test. After the baseline measures are
      completed, all participants will rate their level of motivation on a scale from 1 (extremely
      unmotivated) to 100 (extremely motivated), which will act as a pre-manipulation check
      measure, their level of fatigue on a scale from 1 (extremely not fatigued) to 100 (extremely
      fatigued), and their level of anxiety from 1 (extremely not anxious) to 100 (extremely
      anxious; 1 minute).

      After completing the baseline measures and rating scales, half (n = 36) of the participants
      will be randomly assigned to the goal-setting instruction group (&quot;goal-setting group&quot;).
      Motivation will be enhanced by asking participants to perform 20% better than their previous
      performance on a similar task, and translating that into a number (e.g., &quot;On this task, you
      generated 10 words when I asked you to name as many words as you could that start with the
      letter &quot;F.&quot; Now, for the next letter, I want you to generate 12 words.&quot;). The remainder of
      the participants (n = 36) will be assigned to the &quot;standard instruction group,&quot; where they
      will only receive the standardized instructions for completing the tests.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. It employs a mixed design, with a between-subjects (instruction type: goal-setting or standard instructions) and a within subjects (pre- and post-instruction manipulation) variable. Seventy-two stroke patients will undergo baseline cognitive testing to assess their verbal ability, learning, memory, attention, visuospatial ability, and exective functioning, with standardized instructions. After completing baseline testing and ratings of apathy (AES), depression (CES-D), anxiety, motivation, and fatigue, participants (N = 72) will either be assigned to the standardized instruction condition (n = 30) or the goal-setting instruction condition (n = 30).</intervention_model_description>
