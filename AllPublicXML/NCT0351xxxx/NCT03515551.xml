  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMCnyeso is a new biological therapy designed for the treatment of cancers which express
      NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1A. This is a first-in-human trial designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of IMCnyeso in adult patients who have the appropriate HLA-A2 tissue marker and
      whose cancer is positive for NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-A1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, dose finding Phase 1/2 study of single agent IMCnyeso
      administered in patients with NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-A1 positive tumors. The study consists of
      2 Arms. In the first Arm (the dose escalation phase), IMCnyeso will be evaluated in 4
      diseases (advanced non-small cell cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, and
      synovial sarcoma). The primary objective of this Arm is to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of IMCnyeso. The second Arm is an
      expansion phase in which the dose determined in Arm 1 will be tested in 3 diseases (advanced
      NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma and synovial sarcoma) to further evaluate the safety and assess
      the anti-tumor activity of IMCnyeso
