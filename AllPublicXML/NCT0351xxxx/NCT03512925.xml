  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at exploring the impact of a standardized debriefing session of
      coercive measures that took place in the psychiatric inpatient setting in reducing the use of
      coercive measures and the subjective perception of coercion. It is well known that coercive
      measures have a major negative impact on the health, well-being and the course of treatment
      of patients suffering from mental health issues. Many interventions have been implemented in
      the last years to reduce the use of coercion and limit its consequences.

      The investigators developed a standardized debriefing intervention of coercive measures. This
      debriefing session takes place as soon as possible after the concerned coercive measure and
      is moderated by a member of staff who has not been involved in the use of coercion. Other
      persons involved are the patient, a staff member who took the decision leading to the use of
      the coercive measure, and a one of the patient's relatives.

      Hypothesis is that the use of this standardized intervention can reduce the use of subsequent
      coercive measures and level of perceived coercion, prevent the development of post-traumatic
      symptoms, help preserving a trustful therapeutic relationship and positively change the
      attitude of staff regarding the use of coercion. This intervention has been proven to be well
      accepted by patients and staff members in a previous pilot study.

      The present study is designed as a randomised-controlled study that compares the standardized
      debriefing intervention with the usual form of debriefing in 7 hospitals.

      is moderated by a member of staff who has not been involved in the use of coercion. Other
      persons involved are the patient, a staff member who took the decision leading to the use of
      the coercive measure, and a one of the patient's relatives. The guidelines define important
      themes and questions that should be addressed during the debriefing session. These guidelines
      have been developed with the help of psychiatrists, nurses and a peer worker.

      Hypothesis is that the use of this standardized intervention can reduce the use of subsequent
      coercive measures and level of perceived coercion, prevent the development of post-traumatic
      symptoms, help preserving a trustful therapeutic relationship and positively change the
      attitude of staff regarding the use of coercion. This intervention has been proven to be well
      accepted by patients and staff members in a previous pilot study. The methods combine
      quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

      The present study is designed as a randomised-controlled study that compares the standardized
      debriefing intervention with the usual form of debriefing in 7 hospitals.

    <description>Subjective experience coercion assessed by the German version of the Perceived Coercion Subscale (PCS) of the MacArthur Admission Experience Survey (AES). The AES comprises 16 dichotomous items (yes-no answers) divided in 4 subscales. The PCS comprises 5 items. A higher score (range 0-5) indicates a high level of perceived coercion.</description>

    <time_frame>At the time of discharge from the hospital by every included patient, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective experience coercion assessed by the Coercion Ladder (CL). The CL is an analog scale ranging from 1 to 10 and assessing the level pf perceived coercion. Higher values indicate a higher level of perceived coercion.</description>

    <time_frame>At the time of discharge from the hospital by every included patient, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective experience coercion assessed by the German version of the Coercion Experience Scale (CES). The CES is a scale used to measure the impact of coercive measures. It comprises 29 items related to perceived stressors during a coercive intervention with a 5-point Likert-scale. A total score is used with higher values indicating higher perceived coercion.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the quality of the therapeutic relationship assessed by the German version of the Work Alliance Inventory-Short Form (WAI-SR). The WAI comprises 12 items divided into 3 subclass (goal, task, bond). each subscale comprises 4 items with a 5-point Likert-scale. The score range for each subscale ranges from 5 to 20. Higher scores indicate a better therapeutic alliance.</description>

    <time_frame>At the time of discharge from the hospital by every included patient, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Development of post-traumatic symptoms assessed by the German version of the Peri-Traumatic Distress Inventory (PDI). The PDI assesses the reactions during the traumatic event. It comprises 13 items with a 0-4 Likert-scale. Scores of all items are summed up and so the total score ranges from 0 to 52. A score higher than 26 indicates a high risk of developing a post traumatic stress disorder.</description>

    <measure>Post-traumatic symptoms (2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of discharge from the hospital by every included patient, up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Development of post-traumatic symptoms assessed by the German version of the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R). The IES-R comprises 22 items with a Likert-scale ranging from 0 to 3. Items are divided into 3 sub scales (Intrusion (7 items), Avoidance (8 items), and Hyperarousal (7 items)). Scores for each sub scales are built by adding the answers to each item. Higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms. A total score ranging from 0-88 is built with higher values indicating a higher probability of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the staff attitude towards coercion assessed by the German version of the Staff Attitude to Coercion Scale (SACS). The SACS comprises 15 items with a LIkert-scale ranging from 1 to 5 and assesses 3 dimensions of attitude to coercion with 3 different subscales: coercion as offending (6 items), coercion as care and security (6 items) and coercion as treatment (3 items). Subscores are yielded by adding the answers to each item. Higher scores indicate higher agreement with the assessed dimension.</description>
