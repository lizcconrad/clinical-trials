      As few is known about the oral health of bariatric patients, this study aimed to analyze the
      prevalence and severity of erosive tooth wear, dental caries and periodontal diseases of
      obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery in comparison to obese patients without
      bariatric procedures.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing since the 1980s. Being associated with
      several risk factors such as hypertension, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia, obesity
      presents an immediate and long-term health risk for diabetes mellitus, heart diseases,
      osteoarthritis and certain forms of cancer. For the control of obesity several therapy
      options have been developed: Beside conservative treatments including change of diet and
      lifestyle, bariatric surgery is considered as a promising option for patients with severe
      obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2). Allowing impressive weight loss from 40 to 80% and effective
      reduction of comorbidities, bariatric surgery shows some negative/adverse effects as well,
      like kidney problems, hyperparathyroidism, anemia and metabolic bone diseases. For oral
      health, two facts are particularly important to consider: Firstly, chronic regurgitation
      reaching the oral cavity is an important risk factor for erosive tooth wear which initially
      appear as smooth silky-shining glazed surfaces. Further progress is often associated with
      hypersensitivities and aesthetic deficits. Over time, often substantial loss can been
      observed, provoking hypersensitivities and aesthetic deficits. Secondly, depending on the
      type of bariatric surgery, pronounced postoperative metabolic and nutritional changes can be
      observed which also might influence oral health. Aim of this study is to analyze the
      prevalence and severity of erosive tooth wear, dental caries and periodontal diseases of
      obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery in comparison to obese patients without
      bariatric procedures.
