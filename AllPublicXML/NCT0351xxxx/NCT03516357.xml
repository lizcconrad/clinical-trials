      1.The primary objective of the current study is to investigate changes in uncorrected visual
      acuity, diopter, accommodation, peripheral refraction, IOP, tear film quality, corneal
      thickness, corneal topography, corneal biomechanical parameters, objective optical quality,
      corneal and conjunctiva sensitivity and choroidal thickness for children with different
      diopters after wearing orthokeratology lenses; 2. Through measure long-term changes of these
      parameters, including corneal topography, axial length, peripheral refraction, objective
      optical quality and choroidal thickness, to explore occurrence and development regularity of
      myopia.
