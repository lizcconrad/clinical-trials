    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if blinatumomab given in combination
      with low-intensity chemotherapy can help to control Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-ALL).

      The safety and effectiveness of this combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Blinatumomab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of other types of ALL. The chemotherapy used in this study is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of ALL. It is considered investigational to use
      blinatumomab in combination with chemotherapy to treat Ph- ALL.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 44 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      This study has 3 parts:

        -  Induction--the part of the study in which the study drugs are designed to create a
           response from the disease. Induction will take place during Cycle 1 of the study. An
           Induction cycle is about 42 days (6 weeks).

        -  Consolidation--the part of the study in which the drugs are designed to continue to
           cause the disease to respond. Consolidation will take place during Cycles 2-4. Each
           consolidation cycle is about 42 days (6 weeks).

        -  Maintenance--the part of the study in which chemotherapy is given to help keep the
           disease under control. Maintenance will take place after Consolidation and will last for
           up to 2 years. Each maintenance cycle is 4 weeks.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive a
      central venous catheter (CVC) if you do not already have one. A CVC is a sterile flexible
      tube that will be placed into a large vein while participant is under local anesthesia.
      Participant's doctor will explain this procedure to participant in more detail, and
      participant will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

      Negative days are the days before the start of a cycle. While on this study, participant will
      need to be hospitalized on Days -3 to 6 of each cycle. In addition, participant will need to
      stay in the hospital on Day 21 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2.

      Participant will receive blinatumomab by vein continuously (nonstop) on Days 1-28 of Cycles
      1-4. Participant will not take blinatumomab on Days 29-42. Blinatumomab will be delivered by
      a small pump, which participant will carry with participant for the whole time participant
      receives the drug. This allows participant to receive the drug constantly over a long period
      of time. Participant will be given a shoulder or belt bag to hold the pump and infusion bag.
      Participant will be able to wear regular clothes, walk around, and perform daily living
      activities. Participant will be given instructions for taking a shower and other activities.
      However, because the line must be kept free of infection and connected to the pump at all
      times, some activities (like swimming) are not allowed during the study. The study staff will
      give participant more information on activities participant should not do while receiving the
      drug.

      For blinatumomab doses where participant is not hospitalized, participant will need to return
      to the clinic at certain times to have the infusion bag changed. Participant may instead have
      a well-trained home care service member visit participant at participant's home to change the
      infusion bag. The study staff will tell participant how often the infusion bag must be
      changed. If the infusion is stopped for more than 4 hours, participant may need to return to
      the clinic to have the infusion started again.

      Participant will receive dexamethasone on Days -3 to 0 and Days 7-10 of Cycle 1 and on Days
      1-4 and 11-14 of Cycles 2-4 to prevent side effects associated with blinatumomab treatment.
      If side effects do occur, participant will receive dexamethasone by mouth or by vein for 3 to
      7 days. When participant is hospitalized, participant will receive dexamethasone by vein over
      about 30 minutes. When participant is at home, participant will take it by mouth.

      Participant may be given other drugs to help prevent side effects. The study staff will tell
      participant about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

      Cycles 1-4 will take place in 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will take place from Days 1-
      21 of each cycle. Part B will take place from Days 22-42 of each cycle. All participants will
      receive this treatment.

        -  During Part A, participant will receive mini-hyper-CVD chemotherapy. This is a
           combination of the drugs G-CSF or pegfilgrastim, cyclophosphamide, mesna, dexamethasone,
           methotrexate, cytarabine, and vincristine.

        -  During Part B, participant will receive MTX-ARA-C chemotherapy. This is a combination of
           the drugs methotrexate and cytarabine. If needed, participant will also receive
           leucovorin and rituximab.

      Part A Dose Administration:

      During Cycle 1:

        -  Depending on what participant's insurance allows, participant will either receive G-CSF
           each day as an injection under the skin or on Day 1 participant will receive
           pegfilgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time each cycle.

        -  On Days -3 to -1, participant will receive cyclophosphamide 2 times each day (about 12
           hours apart) by vein over about 3 hours.

        -  On Days -3 to -1, participant will receive mesna by vein continuously (nonstop) for
           about 36 hours to help prevent side effects related to cyclophosphamide.

        -  On Day 2, participant will receive methotrexate intrathecally (by spinal tap).

        -  On Day 7, participant will receive cytarabine intrathecally.

        -  On Days 0 and Day 7, participant will receive vincristine by vein over 15 minutes.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, on Days -3 and 0, participant will receive rituximab
           by vein over 4-6 hours.

      During Cycles 2-4:

        -  On Days 1-3, participant will receive cyclophosphamide 2 times each day (about 12 hours
           apart) by vein over about 3 hours.

        -  On Days -3 to -1, participant will receive mesna by vein continuously (nonstop) for
           about 36 hours to help prevent side effects related to cyclophosphamide.

        -  On Day 1 and Day 11, participant will receive vincristine by vein over 15 minutes.

        -  On Days 1-4, participant will receive G-CSF as an injection under the skin or, on Day 5,
           participant will receive pegfilgrastim as an injection under the skin.

        -  On Days 2, participant will receive methotrexate intrathecally.

        -  On Days 7, participant will receive cytarabine intrathecally.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, on Day 1 and Day 8, participant may receive
           rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours.

      Part B Dose Administration:

      During Cycles 1-4:

        -  Depending on what participant's insurance allows, participant will either receive G-CSF
           each day as an injection under the skin or participant will receive pegfilgrastim as an
           injection under the skin on Day 25.

        -  On Day 22, participant will receive methotrexate by vein over about 24 hours.

        -  On Days 23 and 24, participant will receive cytarabine by vein 2 times each day (about
           12 hours apart) over about 3 hours.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant may receive leucovorin by vein over about
           15 minutes or by mouth 4 times a day for up to 8 doses, beginning 12 hours after the
           methotrexate dose ends to help reduce the risk of side effects. The study staff will
           tell participant which way participant will receive leucovorin.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, On Days 22 and 29, participant may receive
           rituximab by vein over about 4 to 6 hours.

      Maintenance Therapy (Cycles 1-24):

      Each maintenance cycle will last about 28 days. The exact length will depend on how
      participant's body responds to the chemotherapy.

      After participant's last consolidation cycle (Cycle 4), if the disease has not gotten worse,
      participant will start Maintenance Therapy. During Maintenance Therapy, participant will
      receive the following drugs for about 2 years:

        -  On Days 1-5 of Cycles 1-5, 7-11, and 13-24 participant will take prednisone by mouth.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 1-5, 7-11, and 13-24 participant will receive vincristine by vein 1
           time over about 15 minutes.

        -  On Days 1-28 of Cycles 1-5, 7-11, and 13-24, participant will receive 6-MP twice a day

        -  Participant will receive methotrexate by mouth 1 time each week for 2 years.

        -  On Days 1-28 of Cycles 6 and 12, participant will receive blinatumomab by vein
           continuously. Participant will need to return to the hospital for days 1-6 of Cycle 6.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may receive up to 4 cycles of mini-hyper-CVD, MTX-ARA-C, and blinatumomab
      followed by 24 months of chemotherapy-based maintenance treatment. Participant will no longer
      be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,
      or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation in this study will be over after follow-up (described below).

      Study Visits:

      If it is more convenient for participant, participant may have some of the following
      tests/procedures performed at participant's local doctor's office or clinic. Participant's
      local doctor will tell the study doctor at MD Anderson the results of the testing. The study
      doctor and/or study staff will discuss this option with participant.

      At least 1 time each week during Cycles 1 and 2, then every 4-6 weeks during Maintenance,
      blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 1 and 14 of Cycles 1-4 and Maintenance Cycles 6 and 12, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will
      be drawn to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 22 of Cycles 1-4, participant will have a chest x-ray.

      On Days 21 and 42 of Cycle 1, and at any point during Maintenance that participant's doctor
      thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration to check
      the status of the disease.

      On Day 42 of Cycle 2:

        -  Participant will have an ECHO or a MUGA scan to check participant's heart function.

        -  Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration to check the status of the
           disease.

      Every 3-6 months during Maintenance Cycles, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be draw to check
      the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drugs, participant may be called by a
      member of the study staff and asked how participant is doing and if participant has started
      any new medications. This call should last about 10 minutes.

             have had a hysterectomy or are postmenopausal without menses for 12 months. In
             addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner
             of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control.
