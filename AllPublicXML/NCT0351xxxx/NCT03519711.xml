  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PBD-001 study has been designed to demonstrate the safety, pharmacokinetics and
      preliminary efficacy of CNSA-001 in reducing blood phenylalanine concentrations in adult and
      adolescent patients with hyperphenylalaninemia due to primary tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
      deficiency.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine
      hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, fatty acid glycerylether oxygenase, and nitric oxide
      (NO) synthase. Primary tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (PBD) is caused by deficiency of GTP
      cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CH), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), or sepiapterin
      reductase (SR) that impairs the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) or by defects in
      BH4 recycling (pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase [PCD] or dihydropteridine reductase [DHPR]
      deficiency).

      Study PBD-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, randomized, open-label, intra-patient dose
      titration study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence
      of efficacy of CNSA-001 in male and female patients with hyperphenylalaninemia due to PBD.
      Study PBD-001 will enroll patients with defects in de novo biopterin biosynthesis due to PTPS
      or recessive GTP-CH deficiencies. Approximately 6 to 10 patients will be enrolled in this
      study at 5 to 6 study centers.

      Patients will be screened for participation. Eligible patients who are taking BH4 [Kuvan®
      (sapropterin dihydrochloride)] will discontinue the medication following screening and will
      remain off this medication during the entire study. Patients will receive treatment with
      CNSA-001 for a total of 14 days (i.e., two 7-day treatment periods separated by a 3- to 4-day
      washout). Patients will be randomized into one of 2 cohorts, with each cohort assessing 2
      dose levels of CNSA-001 via intra-patient titration.

      Initially, only adult patient(s) (≥18 years) will be enrolled. After the first adult
      patient(s) have completed the study, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety
      and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data, including preliminary efficacy, for the
      adult patient(s). If the data display no safety issues and provide for the prospect of
      clinical benefit in patients ≥12 to &lt;18 years old, then the eligibility criterion for age at
      time of enrollment will be expanded to include adolescents (≥12 years).
