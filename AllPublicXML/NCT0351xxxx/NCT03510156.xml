  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disruptive behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, and property destruction pose
      significant health-related issues to children diagnosed with fragile X syndrome (FXS),
      impacting the child's quality of life and causing significant distress to families.

      Access to appropriate treatment for families is severely limited by factors such as cost of
      care, shortages of qualified treatment providers, and geographic spread of children with FXS
      across the country. To address these potential issues, the effectiveness of administering a
      standardized function-based behavioral treatment for problem behaviors in FXS will be
      evaluated using telemedicine. The proposed study intervention therefore offers a tremendous
      step forward in clinical research both in the field of FXS and in the field of developmental
      disabilities more broadly, and thus will have a significant impact on public health.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Child has a confirmed diagnosis of FXS (&gt;200 CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene with
             evidence of aberrant methylation)

          2. Child is male, between the ages of 3-10 years old

          3. Child is reported to show self-injury, property destruction and/or aggression on at
             least a daily basis

          4. The caregiver agrees to keep any therapies that the child receives (i.e., medications
             or other treatments) as stable as possible throughout involvement in the study

          5. The family has a high-speed internet connection at home or lives in an area with 4G
             network coverage

          6. Availability for one-hour daily telemedicine treatment sessions

          7. Availability for in-home assessment totaling 8 hours across two consecutive days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The child or caregiver has significant sensory impairments (e.g., blindness or
             deafness)

          2. Non-English speaking

          3. The child receives Applied Behavior Analysis services in excess of five hours per week

          4. The child has a significant neurological condition (e.g., frequent seizures, brain
             injury, Tourette's syndrome) that would preclude participation

          5. The child or caregiver has significant mobility issues

          6. The child is currently participating in another research study that would preclude
             participation in the study
