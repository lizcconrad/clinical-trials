      Patients will be assigned to receive either Depo Medrol or Acthar treatment. A synovial
      biopsy, blood draws, synovial fluid aspiration, and physician assessments will be performed
      before and after initiating treatment. At screening visit, inclusion and exclusion criteria
      will be assessed. If assessments have not been completed to verify these criteria, they will
      be performed at this visit. After patients are confirmed to meet criteria, patient disease
      activity will be assessed and blood draw, synovial aspiration, and biopsy will be performed
      before first treatment injection. About 5 days after this first treatment injection, these
      assessment and samples will be performed again. About 5-6 weeks after first treatment
      injection, a final physician assessment will be performed. Patients will have the option of
      consenting to allow storage of samples for future research.

    <description>In DAS28, a clinician assesses 28 specified joints for tenderness and swelling. A blood draw is performed at time of assessment to measure Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (in mm/h). The patient global health assessment (from 0=best to 100=worst) is also used. A specific algorithm is used to calculate the DAS28 score, using the measurements obtained as variables that plug into the algorithm.</description>

    <description>The Westergren method requires collecting 2 ml of venous blood into a tube containing 0 .5 ml of sodium citrate. It should be stored no longer than 2 hours at room temperature or 6 hours at 4 °C. The blood is drawn into a Westergren-Katz tube to the 200 mm mark. The tube is placed in a rack in a strictly vertical position for 1 hour at room temperature, at which time the distance from the lowest point of the surface meniscus to the upper limit of the red cell sediment is measured. The distance of fall of erythrocytes, expressed as millimeters in 1 hour, is the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate.</description>

          -  moderate to severe disease activity as measured by the Clinical Disease activity index
             (CDAI), or DAS28 (Disease Activity Score) within 30 days of starting the study

          -  Patients must have at least one joint with the following features within 30 days of
             starting the study:

               1. Joint must be tender

               2. Joint must be swollen

               3. Joint must have +2 or +3 doppler signal by ultrasound exam

               4. Joint must have +2 or +3 gray scale synovitis by ultrasound exam e. Joint must be
                  amenable to synovial biopsy.

             f. Clinician assessing the joint must conclude, with a reasonable degree of certainty,
             that the swelling and tenderness observed in the joint is caused by rheumatoid
             arthritis, and not by another arthritic condition such as osteoarthritis, crystal
             arthritis, or infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on anti-coagulation therapy

          -  Patients with an active infection

          -  Patients receiving oral corticosteroids within 5 days of enrollment, or parenteral
             corticosteroids within 3 weeks of enrollment (unless deemed able to taper off
             medication under investigator oversight and supervision)

          -  Patients with any history of joint infection

          -  Patients with a history of tuberculosis or coccidioidomycosis
