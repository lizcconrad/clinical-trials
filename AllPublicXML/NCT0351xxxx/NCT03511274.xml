  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evidence to date indicates that educational strategies may be effective at reducing
      antenatal CMV infection, however these have not been tested in the UK.

      In phase 1 of the study, the investigators will co-design an educational intervention with
      pregnant women and families affected by congenital CMV with the aim of reducing the risk of
      acquisition of CMV in pregnancy. In phase 2 of the study, the investigators will use this
      educational intervention in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) as part of a feasibility
      study to generate the data required for the design of a future main RCT. Should the future
      main RCT show that the educational intervention is effective in reducing the risk of primary
      CMV infection in pregnancy, the intervention could be rolled out in the National Health
      Service (NHS). This would have significant benefits to patients and the NHS. No other single
      cause of congenital defects and long-term developmental disability currently provides greater
      opportunity for improved outcomes than the prevention of congenital CMV, therefore trials
      designed to test prevention strategies should be a research priority for the NHS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common infection to be contracted before birth (a
      congenital infection); overall, about 20% of babies infected in this way have permanent
      health problems, such as hearing loss, learning delay or physical impairments. CMV is not a
      well-known infection, despite the health problems it can cause. It is actually more common
      than Down's syndrome or spina bifida. Simple hygiene measures may reduce the risk of catching
      CMV infection whilst pregnant and therefore also the risk of congenital infection in the
      infant. In the UK, pregnant women are not routinely counselled about these hygiene measures.

      Before a large-scale study can be performed in the UK to determine the effectiveness of an
      educational intervention in reducing CMV infection in pregnancy, educational materials need
      to be developed and tested to ensure the feasibility of such a large study.

      In this feasibility study, the investigators will work with pregnant women and families
      affected by CMV to design and produce a short film appropriate for use in the NHS to educate
      women about these simple hygiene measures (phase 1 of the study). Working in partnership with
      members of the public will help us ensure the content is relevant, clear and sensitive.The
      film will subsequently be tested in a study where women are assigned by chance to the
      educational intervention or to continue with treatment as usual with information about
      vaccines already recommended within the NHS. This ensures both groups will get some benefit
      from the study.

      This study will enable the investigators to work out the number of pregnant women who are at
      risk of contracting CMV, how many of these women would agree to take part and to calculate
      the number of people needed in a future main trial in order to come to a reliable answer.
      This feasibility study is therefore essential to the design of a large-scale future trial.

Seroconversion is the appearance of anti-CMV IgG antibodies in the serum of a person who did not have such antibodies previously.

    <description>Women randomised to receive the CMV educational intervention will fill in a questionnaire and view the film. The website will also contain interactive information about CMV and how to prevent it. After watching the film and reading the information, women will be asked to fill in a post-intervention questionnaire. The website will be accessible via the participants' own mobile device or computer or dedicated study tablets or computers on-site. Using a web-based intervention, we will be able to monitor use of the educational intervention and also collect data in real time.</description>

    <description>Women who are randomised to the TAU group will also be asked to log-on the website. Instead of receiving specific information about prevention of CMV in pregnancy, they will receive information about routine antenatal immunisation. In the UK, the Department of Health recommends that all pregnant women should be offer immunisation against pertussis (whooping cough) and influenza (if pregnant during the influenza session). This will ensure that participants in the TAU arm of the study also derive benefit from the study.</description>
