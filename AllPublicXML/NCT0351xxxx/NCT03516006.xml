  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an idiopathic condition with intrahepatic cholangitis
      and fibrosis, leading to multifocal bile duct stricture. Its main clinical manifestations are
      chronic cholestatic lesions and is deemed as autoimmune liver disease. PSC are immune
      abnormalities that occurs in patients with genetic susceptibility. No other pathogenesis is
      revealed yet. Ursodeoxycholic acid is used as an empirical treatment, and there is no
      approved drug or a acceptable treatment regimen. The disease often progresses to liver
      decompensation and requires liver transplantation. In recent years, the clinical application
      of stem cell therapy has seen many important advances. Stem cells are characterized with
      properties of multiple differentiation, repair of damaged tissue and immuno-modulation. This
      study aims to employ UCMSCs to treat PSC patients and observe its efficacy and safety, and to
      explore the possible therapeutic mechanisms.
