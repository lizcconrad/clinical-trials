    <textblock>
      A retrospective review of patients who developed hematoma following breast surgery from 2003
      to 2018 in a single institution was performed. The study investigated the value of
      closed-suction drains regarding the quantity and quality of fluid secretion for the
      prediction of subcutaneous hematoma in patients undergoing breast surgery procedures.

        We enrolled 20 subjects who developed unilateral hematoma requiring evacuation following
        bilateral breast surgery between January 2008 and January 2018 at our institution. Gender,
        age, breast surgery subtype, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin values as well as
        perioperative heparinization were recorded.
