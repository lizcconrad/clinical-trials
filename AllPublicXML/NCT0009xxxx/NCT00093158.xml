      The purpose of this study is to show that, when compared with heparin (enoxaparin or
      unfractionated heparin) and routine GPIIb/IIIa inhibition (either started upfront or at the
      time of percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]; Arm A):

        1. Bivalirudin with routine GPIIb/IIIa inhibition (either started upfront or at the time of
           PCI; Arm B) provides non-inferior or superior overall clinical outcomes and

        2. Bivalirudin alone (Arm C) reduces clinically significant bleeding. An important
           secondary objective for this comparison is to show that bivalirudin is not inferior for
           ischemic complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be aged &gt;=18 years at the time of randomization.

          2. Have symptoms which include at least 10 minutes of angina or anginal equivalent that
             the investigator believes has a high likelihood of being ischemic in origin within the
             24 hours prior to randomization consistent with a diagnosis of Unstable Angina/Non-ST
             Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) (patients with symptoms atypical for
             cardiac ischemia should not be enrolled).

          3. Meet at least one of the following criteria for UA/NSTEMI:

               1. All of the following four features: *Age &gt;= to 65 years; *aspirin taken within
                  the last 7 days; *two or more episodes of angina in the last 24 hours; *three or
                  more of the following risk factors: hypertension, high cholesterol, family
                  history, diabetes, current smoker OR

               2. ECG changes: New or presumably new ST-segment depression &gt;=0.1 MV (&gt;=1mm), or
                  transient (&lt;30 minutes) ST-segment elevation &gt;=0.1MV (&gt;=1mm) in at least 2
                  contiguous leads, OR

               3. Abnormal cardiac enzymes within the 24 hours before enrollment defined as
                  elevated troponin I, T or creatine phosphokinase-MB isoenzyme (CPK-MB) level
                  greater than the site's upper limit of normal (ULN) OR

               4. History of coronary artery disease with documentation of one of the following:
                  *prior angiography (coronary stenosis of &gt;50%); *prior PCI or Coronary Artery
                  Bypass Grafting (CABG); *prior definite, documented myocardial infarction.

          4. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anticipated inability to perform angiography within 72 hours of randomization and
             anticipated inability to perform any intervention required (PCI or CABG) within the
             index hospitalization.

          2. ST segment elevation of &gt;1 mm in 2 contiguous ECG leads lasting for &gt;30 minutes, or
             new left bundle branch block, or a clinical syndrome consistent with acute evolving
             transmural MI requiring immediate thrombolytic or interventional reperfusion therapy.

          3. Cardiogenic shock (systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg for &gt;30 minutes not responding to
             intravenous fluids, or requiring intravenous pressor agents or an intra-aortic balloon
             pump).

          4. Bleeding diathesis or any history of hemorrhagic stroke or other intra-cerebral bleed,
             cerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral aneurysm or prior ischemic stroke within
             the last 2 years, or any prior stroke with residual neurologic deficit.
             Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the last 2-weeks.
