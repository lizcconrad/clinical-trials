    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effects of twice-daily exenatide plus oral antidiabetic
      (OAD) agents and twice-daily placebo plus OAD with respect to glycemic control, as measured
      by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), in patients with type 2 diabetes who experience inadequate
      glycemic control with OAD alone.
