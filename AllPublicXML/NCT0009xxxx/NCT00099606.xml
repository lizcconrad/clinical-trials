      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, effect
      of food, and continue exploratory research of BMS-354825 in patients with solid tumors not
      responding to standard treatment, or for which no effective standard treatment exists.

             period of at least 7 days for low-dose aspirin (&lt;=325 mg/day) or 14 days for
             higher-dose aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) prior to the first dose of BMS-354825. Patients who
             have discontinued other antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications must have a wash-out
             period of at least 5 days or at least 5 half lives of the drug (whichever is greater)
