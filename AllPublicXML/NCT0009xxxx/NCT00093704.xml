      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth. The Epstein Barr virus can cause cancer and lymphoproliferative disorders.
      Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug that acts against the Epstein Barr virus. Giving ganciclovir
      together with bortezomib may kill more Epstein Barr virus-infected cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with ganciclovir
      works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Epstein Barr virus-positive lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory
           Epstein Barr virus-positive lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the antitumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, open-label, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. Patients also receive
      ganciclovir IV twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 3
      courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-9 patients will be accrued for this study.
