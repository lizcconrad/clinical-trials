  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients who receive an organ transplant, their body considers this organ as foreign and
      attempts to destroy it. This is called rejection. All patients who receive an organ
      transplant, will take a combination of anti-rejection medications. These medications prevent
      the new organ from being rejected from the body. FTY720 is a new compound that helps prevent
      organ rejection.
