        Inclusion Criteria: Chronic Kidney Disease patients not receiving dialysis with: - An iPTH
        greater than 100 pg/mL [10.6 pmol/L] for subjects with stage 3 CKD or greater than or equal
        to 160 pg/mL [17.0 pmol/L] for subjects with stage 4 CKD; - A serum calcium greater than
        9.0 mg/dL [2.25 mmol/L]; - An estimated GFR less than or equal to 59 mL/min and greater
        than or equal to 15 mL/min. Exclusion Criteria: - Have an unstable medical condition,
        defined as having been hospitalized within 30 days before day 1, or otherwise unstable in
        the judgment of the investigator. - Experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) within 3
        months before day 1. - Likely to initiate dialysis (in the opinion of the investigator) or
        are scheduled to undergo renal transplantation within 28 weeks after day 1. - Received
        active vitamin D therapy (i.e., 1-hydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D) for less than 30
        days before day 1 or required a change in active vitamin D brand or dose level within 30
        days before day 1 (for patients prescribed active vitamin D).
