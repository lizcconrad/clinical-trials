      The goals of this study are to:

      Determine the blood levels of intramuscular (IM) olanzapine depot in patients at different
      points in time after an injection, and compare these levels to the amount of olanzapine in
      the blood of patients after treated by oral administration with Zyprexa (olanzapine) tablets
      or by intramuscular administration with Zyprexa IntraMuscular (olanzapine for injection).
