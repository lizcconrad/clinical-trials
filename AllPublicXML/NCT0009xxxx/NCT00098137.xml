      Hypothesis:

      Blocking the angiotensin (AT) II type 1 receptor (Olmesartan) reduces the incidence of
      episodes of atrial fibrillation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during 12
      months by more than 25% compared to standard medication without angiotensin II type 1
      receptor.

      A total of 422 subjects will be included in the two study groups. The treatment arm will
      receive 40mg Olmesartan per day, the remaining patients will receive placebo. Follow-up is 12
      months. Daily Tele-ECG recordings will determine the cardiac rhythm and asymptomatic episodes
      of atrial fibrillation (AF) every day. Concomitant therapy with AV-nodal blocking drugs are
      allowed during the study. In case of severe AF-induced symptoms, an antiarrhythmic &quot;recovery
      medication&quot; (amiodarone) is allowed during follow-up.
