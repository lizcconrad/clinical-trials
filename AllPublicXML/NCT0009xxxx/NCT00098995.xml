      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tirapazamine and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Tirapazamine may help cisplatin kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more
      sensitive to the drug. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Tirapazamine may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving radiation
      therapy in different ways together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tirapazamine when
      given together with cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage IB, stage
      II, stage III, or stage IVA cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II and III dose of
           tirapazamine when combined with cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with Stage IB-IVA
           squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine failure-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to locoregional failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine patterns of failure for the site of first failure in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the 12-week post-treatment complete response rate in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tirapazamine.

      Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours on day 1 of weeks 1-5 and on days 3 and 5 of
      weeks 1 and 2 (cohort 2 only), OR days 3 and 5 of weeks 1-4 (cohort 3 only). Patients also
      receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1-6. Patients concurrently undergo
      external beam radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5 for 5-5.5 weeks. After completion of
      chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo low-dose brachytherapy (up to 2 implants within an 8-week
      period) OR high-dose brachytherapy twice weekly for 5 treatments. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tirapazamine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years,
      and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-22 patients will be accrued for this study.
