      The purpose of the study is to determine if the combination of cetuximab, carboplatin and
      paclitaxel will shrink a specific type of lung cancer known as non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). The safety of this combination will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed for both genders in the United States.
      Approximately 173,770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer
      deaths in both men and women, with approximately 160,440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis
      for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage, and therapy for advanced disease is
      limited. The study will test two chemotherapy agents, carboplatin and paclitaxel, in
      combination with a newly approved drug called cetuximab, which is continuing to be tested in
      colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody, which is believed to
      work by attaching to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby
      blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung
      cancers overexpress EGFR.

      Rationale:

      The present study is built upon the data from previous studies, incorporating cetuximab into
      each of two regimens of paclitaxel plus carboplatin. The results of prior studies using
      paclitaxel and carboplatin demonstrate that these drugs in combination, using a variety of
      schedules, are both safe and effective as therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The
      addition of biologic therapy with the anti-EGFR agent cetuximab to the combination will
      presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping toxicity to a minimum in patients
      with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.

      Research Hypothesis:

      Subjects with previously-untreated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who receive a combination of
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab will have a progression-free survival rate greater
      than that previously reported for subjects receiving the combination of paclitaxel and
      carboplatin.
