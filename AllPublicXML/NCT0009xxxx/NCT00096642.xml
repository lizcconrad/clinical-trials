    <textblock>
      Depression is a debilitating illness affecting large numbers of young people. In this study,
      children and adolescents ages 10 to 17 meeting criteria for clinical depression will
      participate in a 15-session group therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT) that teaches
      strategies for overcoming depressed mood. For half the participants, their parents will also
      participate in a parent group. By studying the role of parental involvement, we hope to
      develop more effective treatments for depressed children and teens in the future.

      Depression is a debilitating illness affecting large numbers of young people. Psychotherapy
      approaches have shown some promise in teens, but few studies have examined these
      interventions when offered in a group format. The role of parents in treatment outcome has
      also received little attention.

      In this study, children and adolescents ages 10 to 17 meeting criteria for clinical
      depression will participate in a 15-session group therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy or
      CBT) that teaches strategies for overcoming depressed mood. For half the participants, their
      parents will also participate in a parent group to help them better manage their depressed
      children and teens. We will randomly assign children to CBT with or without parental
      involvement. We hope to show that involving parents results in additional improvements in the
      children. We will also study factors that predict which children do best in treatment, and
      maintenance of gains at 6 month and 1 year follow-up. These findings will allow us to provide
      more effective treatments to depressed children and teens in the future.
