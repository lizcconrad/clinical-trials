      The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of cranberry juice that is most
      effective in preventing a condition in pregnant women that often leads to urinary tract
      infections (UTIs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) infection, a condition in which a large number of bacteria are
      present in the urine, often precedes the development of symptomatic UTIs. UTIs are common
      among women and may create complications during pregnancy. By incorporating cranberry juice
      into their diets, pregnant women may be able to lower their risk for UTIs caused by ASB, and
      cranberry juice may also prevent preterm labor and birth. This study will determine the
      cranberry juice-containing regimen that will work best for preventing ASB in pregnant women.

      For the duration of their pregnancy, participants in this study will be randomly assigned to
      one of three treatment arms: cranberry juice once a day, cranberry juice three times a day,
      or a placebo beverage three times a day. The level of bacteria in their urine will be
      measured at monthly study visits. Women who test positive for a UTI will receive oral
      antibiotic therapy. All women will be monitored throughout their pregnancies for UTIs and
      other related complications.
