  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, and multicenter study consisting of a
      first treatment (FT) period followed by either an observation (OB) period and a re-treatment
      (RT) period or an open-label (OL) treatment period, depending on FT period response, and a
      4-week safety follow-up (FU) period. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of onercept, to be administered as 150 milligram (mg) three times a week, compared
      to matching placebo, for the induction of remission in subjects with moderate to severe
      plaque psoriasis.

    <description>Onercept will be administered subcutaneously three times a week at a dose of 150 mg, for 12 weeks of first treatment (FT) period. Subjects showing 75 percent improvement in PASI score at Week 12 will be observed for 24 weeks without treatment or until relapse, whichever occurs first. Subjects then will be reassigned to either Onercept (150 mg) or placebo, subcutaneously three times a week, for 16 weeks. Subjects not showing 75 percent improvement in PASI score at Week 12 will receive only Onercept (150 mg) subcutaneously three times a week, for 40 weeks as open-label treatment.</description>
