  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of poorly absorbed rifaximin in
      the prevention of travelers' diarrhea among U.S. college students in Mexico for five weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated proposal wherein 220 male and female subjects &gt;17 years of
      age from industrialized regions were randomized to receive a poorly absorbed antibiotic,
      rifaximin, in one of three doses at mealtime (when they are exposed to diarrhea-causing
      bacteria), 200 mg once a day, 200 mg twice a day or 200 mg three times a day versus a placebo
      starting on arrival (within the first 72 hours) to Mexico and continuing for two weeks with
      diaries of symptoms recorded for three weeks. Adverse events in the subjects were followed
      for five weeks. If mild diarrhea (1 or 2 unformed stools/24 hours plus an enteric symptom) or
      diarrheal illness (&gt;2 unformed stools/24 hours plus an enteric symptom) developed, subjects
      provided a stool sample to determine cause of illness. Forty subjects provided stool samples
      after 7 days and 14 days treatment to see if their intestinal bacterial flora had developed
      resistance to rifaximin and to see the level of drug achieved. Stool samples from these forty
      subjects were studied for enteric pathogens to look for asymptomatic infection during the
      period of prophylaxis. The stool samples collected were initially processed in our enteric
      laboratories in Guadalajara, Mexico. Specialized tests such as studies of toxigenicity for
      enterotoxigenic E. coli and enteroadherence for enteroaggregative E. coli were done in
      Houston.

               -  Double barrier method of contraception.

               -  Oral birth control pills for at least two cycles before enrollment and continuing
                  during therapy – subjects will be told they should use a barrier contraception
                  method during the study as well.

               -  Norplant inserted at least one month before enrollment.

               -  An intrauterine device inserted by a qualified clinician.

               -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate for a minimum of one month before study and
                  administered for one month following study completion.

               -  An approved birth control patch for at least two cycles before enrollment and
                  continuing during therapy. OR

               -  Complete abstinence from intercourse for the two weeks of medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute diarrhea (criteria for travelers’ diarrhea above) within the past week

          -  Diarrhea developing within 24 hours of study enrollment

          -  In Mexico for more than 72 hours

          -  Receipt of one of the following classes of drugs: fluoroquinolone (any drug in class),
             macrolide or azalide or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole within the past week or during
             the three week study

          -  Receipt of other medication to decrease the occurrence of diarrhea (e.g. bismuth
             subsalicylate or lactobacillus preparations)

          -  For females, pregnancy or breast feeding during the three week study

          -  Receipt of antidiarrheal medication (loperamide, bismuth subsalicylate, kaopectate)
