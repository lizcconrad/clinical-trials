  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept) has been approved to treat symptoms associated with mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aricept has been shown to improve the memory and thinking
      abilities, activities of daily living and global function in patients. The purpose of the
      study is to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of donepezil in patients with
      severe Alzheimer's disease.

      Donepezil is thought to work in the brain by increasing the levels of an important brain
      chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical helps a person's memory to work better.
