  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PI-88 is a new experimental drug that inhibits tumour growth by reducing the formation of new
      blood vessels into tumours. Docetaxel is a standard second-line treatment offered to patients
      with non-small-cell lung cancer who haven't responded to first-line therapies (platinum-based
      drugs or radiotherapy). Of this group of patients, only 20% remain progression-free 6 months
      after starting docetaxel treatment. The PR88202 study has been designed to compare two
      different cancer treatments (docetaxel only, and docetaxel plus PI-88) and to work out which
      is more effective against the cancer. It is hoped that the combination of PI-88 with
      docetaxel will allow patients to extend the time it takes for their disease to progress, and
      also to improve their quality of life.

      PR88202 is an open-label randomized study. In the initial phase of the study, patients will
      be randomized to receive weekly docetaxel alone, or PI-88 in combination with weekly
      docetaxel. Both groups will receive docetaxel (30 mg/m2), administered by intravenous
      infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The second group only will receive PI-88 (250
      mg/day) in addition to docetaxel; PI-88 will be administered by subcutaneous injection on
      days 1-4, 8-11 and 15-18 of each cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint is the non-progression
      rate at 6 months. In the extension phase of the study, patients in the combination arm who
      have stable disease or an objective response after up to six treatment cycles will remain on
      PI-88 alone as maintenance therapy. Patients who initially receive docetaxel alone and who
      have disease progression or unacceptable toxicity before the completion of six cycles will be
      eligible to receive PI-88 alone as third-line therapy.
