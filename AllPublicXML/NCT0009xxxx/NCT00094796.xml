      This study will examine whether the anti-diabetes medicine rosiglitazone can safely and
      effectively reverse the early problems of type 2 diabetes and delay the onset of disease in
      people with pre-diabetes. The underlying problem in people with diabetes or pre-diabetes is
      insulin resistance (lowered sensitivity to insulin) resulting in poor glucose (sugar)
      regulation. Rosiglitazone improves the body's sensitivity to insulin.

      Patients 21 years of age and older who have type 2 diabetes or who are pre-diabetic (glucose
      intolerant/insulin resistant) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a
      medical history, physical examination, blood tests, echocardiography (heart ultrasound),
      exercise test, brachial artery reactivity test (see below), and possibly a muscle biopsy.

      Participants take one rosiglitazone tablet daily by mouth for 2 weeks. The dose is then
      increased to two tablets daily for another 2 weeks and then to 4 tablets daily for the
      remainder of the 12-week treatment period. In addition to treatment, patients undergo the
      following tests and procedures:

        -  Resting and exercise metabolic testing: The amount of oxygen taken in and carbon dioxide
           exhaled during breathing is measured while the patient rests in a chair and then while
           he or she exercises on a stationary bicycle or treadmill. Both at rest and during
           exercise, the patient wears a facemask that measures the amount of oxygen used. During
           exercise, heart rate is monitored with electrodes on the chest, arms, and thighs. The
           exercise test is repeated three times, once to become familiar with the test, again the
           next day to measure exercise capacity, and again 3 days later. The third test is less
           strenuous and is optional.

        -  Muscle biopsy (optional): A small area of skin over a calf muscle is numbed with a local
           anesthetic and a 1-inch incision is made over the muscle. A small amount of muscle
           tissue is taken and the incision is closed with stitches.

        -  Brachial reactivity study: This ultrasound study tests how well the patient's arteries
           widen. The subject rests on a bed for 30 minutes. An ultrasound measuring device is
           placed over the artery just above the elbow. The size of the artery and blood flow
           through it are measured before and after inflating a pressure cuff around the forearm.
           The pressure cuff stops the flow of blood to the arm for a few minutes. After a
           15-minute rest, a nitroglycerin tablet (medicine that causes blood vessels to relax) is
           placed under the patient's tongue. Before and 3 minutes after the nitroglycerin is
           given, the size of the artery and blood flow through it are measured again.

        -  Blood samples: Blood samples are collected at the beginning and end of the study and at
           study visits in between.

        -  Study visits: Patients come to the Clinical Center biweekly or monthly for a follow-up
           history, physical examination, and blood tests. At the end of the3-month treatment
           period, they receive recommendations about possible treatment modifications to best
           maintain glucose tolerance. Their physicians are informed of how their blood sugar was
           controlled. Six months after completing the study, patients undergo a final study
           evaluation and blood tests, and are then invited to return for yearly checkups after
           that.

      The majority of insulin resistant individuals (predominantly individuals with type 2 diabetes
      - T2DM) develop a disproportionate incidence of cardiovascular disease burden including
      hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and heart failure. The
      underlying pathophysiology is multifactorial but is primarily driven by insulin-resistance
      mediated regulatory events. These include augmented oxidative stress, upregulation of
      pro-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic signaling pathways, detrimental effects of advanced
      glycosylation end-products and perturbations in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Evidence is
      emerging to support a role of perturbed mitochondrial respiratory regulation and subsequent
      endothelial dysfunction as early events in the insulin-resistance syndrome. These in turn,
      are proposed to result in the subsequent development of the cardiovascular clinical sequelae.

      In the last few years, pharmacologic compounds have been developed that directly modulate
      insulin resistance/sensitivity. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
      (PPAR) family of transcription factors has been shown to augment insulin sensitivity. Agents
      that activate numerous PPAR family members, i.e. pan-PPAR agonists and PPAR gamma (PPAR
      gamma) specific agonists, promote improved insulin sensitivity. Whether these compounds
      modify the underlying mitochondrial and endothelial pathophysiology, with the potential of
      preventing progression of cardiovascular disease in insulin-resistant subjects has not been
      systematically investigated.

      The hypothesis intrinsic to this proposal is that PPAR activation will improve mitochondrial
      respiratory and endothelial cell function in parallel with improved insulin sensitization in
      insulin-resistant and T2DM subjects. The primary objective of this study is to establish the
      effects of the PPAR gamma agonist (rosiglitazone) on exercise-modulated
      cardiopulmonary-metabolic function (functional measures of mitochrondrial respiratory
      function) in insulin resistant and T2DM subjects that are either naive to hypoglycemic
      therapy or are on current therapy with other established classes on anti-diabetic agents with
      or without associated cardiovascular disease. As secondary end points we will evaluate
      numerous biological assays of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, endothelial function
      and changes in parameters of insulin sensitivity. These include: 1) skeletal muscle
      mitochondrial respiration, 2) skeletal muscle expression profiles of genes encoding
      mitochondrial biogenesis program and mitochondrial respiratory control, 3) brachial artery
      reactivity, 4) endothelial progenitor cell number and colony-forming capacity, 5) monocyte
      gene expression profiling to evaluate insulin and inflammatory-mediator regulatory events and
      6) serological evaluation in change in insulin sensitivity and inflammation. The study is
      designed as a phase II clinical trial where subjects will receive rosiglitazone for three
      months duration. Baseline and 3 month laboratory studies will include: 1) rest and exercise
      cardiopulmonary metabolic testing; 2) skeletal muscle biopsy for mitochondrial function and
      gene expression profiling analysis, 3) brachial artery reactivity testing and 4) serological
      and blood cell sampling to determine biochemical, cellular and genomic perturbations in
      response to insulin-sensitization therapy in this cohort.
