    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of an investigational
      drug in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (a specific type of diabetes) and Chronic
      Renal Insufficiency (inadequate kidney function).

    <description>Safety and tolerability were measured in terms of the number of patients with clinical adverse experiences (CAEs), serious CAEs, drug-related CAEs, laboratory adverse experiences (LAEs), serious LAEs, and drug-related LAEs. Drug-relationship was assessed by the study investigator according to his/her best clinical judgment.</description>

        <description>Safety and tolerability were measured in terms of the number of patients with clinical adverse experiences (CAEs), serious CAEs, drug-related CAEs, laboratory adverse experiences (LAEs), serious LAEs, and drug-related LAEs.

          <description>The Sitagliptin group includes data from patients randomized to receive treatment with either one (1) 25 mg oral tablet of sitagliptin once daily (blinded) [patients with Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min or dialysis] or two (2) 25 mg oral tablets of sitagliptin once daily (blinded) [patients with CrCl 30 to &lt;50mL/min] alone or in combination with baseline insulin therapy. During Phase B, patients in the Sitagliptin group (with the exception of patients on baseline insulin therapy and patients who received glycemic rescue medication in Phase A) were given glipizide placebo (blinded). During Phase B, patients on baseline insulin could have their insulin uptitrated, and patients who received glycemic rescue medication in Phase A continued on open-label rescue medication.</description>
