  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum safe dose of orally administered
      Karenitecin (BNP1350) in patients with solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initially, the safety, side effects and recommended phase 2 dose of oral Karenitecin in
      patients with advanced solid tumors will be determined.

      When the recommended phase 2 dose has been determined, the specified dose will be used to
      determine if Karenitecin is effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed or
      refractory non-small cell lung cancer.
