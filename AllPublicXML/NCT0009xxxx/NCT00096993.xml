    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial
      of pertuzumab in combination with gemcitabine relative to placebo in combination with
      gemcitabine in subjects with advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer
      that is resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the first day of treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the time of documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete Response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was defined as &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>An objective response was defined as a complete or partial response determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart. Responses were determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions or the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. A partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of the Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of the objective response was defined as the time from the initial response to disease progression or death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Free From Disease Progression at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Survival</measure>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response</title>
        <description>An objective response was defined as a complete or partial response determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart. Responses were determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions or the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. A partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
