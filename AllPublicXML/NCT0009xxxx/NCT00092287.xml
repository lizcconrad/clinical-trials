    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of lanreotide Autogel and
      Sandostatin LAR Depot, to see whether these two 28-day prolonged release formulations produce
      a similar clinical response in patients with carcinoid syndrome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor of the carcinoid type.

          -  Documented evidence of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhea) attributable to a
             primary tumor of the lung, stomach or mid-gut.

          -  Previous positive Octreoscan.

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance score lower than 2.

        At the baseline visit patients MUST satisfy the following criteria before they are
        randomized to receive study treatment:

          -  Stool and/or flushing frequency of greater than or equal to 3 episodes/day (average
             over a minimum five consecutive days).

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with somatostatin analogues must have
             discontinued treatment for a sufficient period of time (a washout period of at least 7
             days for immediate release formulations and up to 2 months for prolonged release
             formulations is usually required). Compared with their &quot;controlled&quot; state on
             treatment, these patients must show a clinically significant deterioration (at least
             two episodes) of either symptom. For example, a patient considered to be controlled on
             their previous treatment with an estimated stool frequency of two episodes per day,
             must achieve a stool frequency of at least four episodes per day (average over a
             minimum five consecutive days).

          -  WHO performance score lower than 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  VIPoma or other non-carcinoid tumor.

          -  Treatment with interferon, chemotherapy or radiotherapy given within 30 days prior to
             inclusion, or planned during the study.

          -  Radionuclide treatment within three months prior to inclusion, or planned during the
             study.

          -  Presence of other active malignant pathology (except basal cellular carcinoma of the
             skin and/or in situ carcinoma of the cervix/uterus).

          -  Surgical procedure or embolization procedure (with or without cytotoxic agents) of the
             tumor within three months prior to inclusion, or planned during the study.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 6 months.

          -  Any investigational drug given within 30 days prior to inclusion or expected to be
             given during the study.

          -  No access to a telephone for completion of the daily telephone diary.
