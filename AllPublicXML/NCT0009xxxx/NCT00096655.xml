  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of infliximab
      (Remicade) in patients with Ulcerative Colitis. Infliximab (Remicade) targets specific
      proteins in the body's immune system to help control the development of inflammation to help
      reduce painful disease.

      This study is designed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of infliximab in adult
      patients with active ulcerative colitis. The purpose of this study is to see if the symptoms
      of ulcerative colitis are lessened with this medication infliximab, and what dose is needed
      to do that safely.Patients will receive infusions of either 5 or 10 mg/kg or placebo at weeks
      0, 2, 6, 14, and 22 up to week 164. Safety evaluations will be performed at specified
      intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as
      blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse events as
      well as other study specific procedures.

      Patients will receive infusions (into the vein) of either 5 or 10 mg/kg or placebo at weeks
      0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks up to week 164.
