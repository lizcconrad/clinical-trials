    <textblock>
      BCX-1777 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their
      growth. The Phase II trial is designed to study the effectiveness of BCX-1777 in treating
      patients who have recurrent or refractory advanced T-cell leukemia.

      Patients will receive an infusion of BCX-1777 on days 1-5. Treatment may be repeated every
      week for up to six courses. Patients are not required to be hospitalized for the
      administration of BCX-1777. Some patients may continue to receive an infusion of BCX-1777
      twice a week for 6 weeks.
