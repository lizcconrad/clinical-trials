    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is

        -  to find out the effects of treating patients with two new chemotherapy drugs (bortezomib
           and Revlimid™),

        -  to study how many patients' myeloma responds to treatment on this study, and how many
           patients survive after this treatment,

        -  to learn if a patient's genetic makeup before and after treatment can predict which
           patients will respond to bortezomib and Revlimid™, and to learn more about how the body
           responds (gene array studies).

    <textblock>
      Two new drugs BORTEZOMIB (Velcade®, PS-341) and REVLIMID (CC-5013) have been shown in recent
      studies to be effective in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. This study is being done
      to learn more about the best way to administer these drugs, either alone or in combination.
      Since it is not known at this time which treatment is the best, participants will be placed
      by chance in one of the three treatment groups:

        -  BORTEZOMIB alone

        -  BORTEZOMIB + REVLIMID

        -  BORTEZOMIB in a lower dose + REVLIMID.

      This chance selection process is called randomization and is often used in research studies.

          -  Performance status of &lt; or = 2 as per Zubrod scale, unless PS of 3 based solely on
             bone pain.

          -  Patients must have a platelet count &gt; or = 50,000/mm3, and an ANC of at least
             1,000/μl.
