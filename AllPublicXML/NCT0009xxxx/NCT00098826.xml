    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SB-715992 in treating patients who have acute
      leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SB-715992 given as a daily x 3 infusion
      in patients with acute leukemia.

      II. To obtain pharmacokinetic studies of SB-715992 given on a 3 consecutive day schedule
      every 3 weeks.

      III. To describe treatment-related and dose-limiting toxicities of SB-715992 in patients with
      acute leukemia.

      IV. To describe the anti-leukemia activity of SB-715992. V. To correlate treatment-related
      toxicities with pharmacokinetic studies of SB-715992.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To validate KSP as the major target of SB-715992 by determining the impact of drug
      treatment on cytoskeletal morphology in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and circulating
      leukemic blasts.

      II. To determine the expression of tubulin isoforms and KSP in leukemic blasts and explore
      possible relationships between gene expression and response to SB-715992.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Consolidation chemotherapy: Patients achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR),
      or stable disease (SD) after induction chemotherapy receive up to 4 additional courses of
      SB-715992 beyond CR, PR, or SD.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive SB-715992 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 9 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed for 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-15
      months.

             radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study

          -  Prohibited medications: SB-715992 is a moderate to significant in vitro inhibitor of
             CYP3A4; the following lists of medications/substances are moderate to significant

             6 months for amiodarone) prior to the administration of the first dose of SB-715992
             through discontinuation from the study is prohibited

               -  Inhibitors of CYP3A4:

                    -  Antibiotics: clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin

                    -  Antifungals: itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole (doses &gt; 200 mg/day),

                  within 6 months prior to the administration of the first dose of SB-715992 is
                  prohibited

               -  Inducers of CYP3A4:

                    -  Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine

                    -  Antibiotics: rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine

                    -  Miscellaneous: St. John's wort, modafinil

          -  Patients with suspected or proven CNS leukemia (diagnostic lumbar puncture not
             required before enrollment)

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to SB-715992

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active or
             poorly controlled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, poorly controlled pulmonary disease or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients with pre-existing neuropathy of grade 2 or higher are not eligible to
             participate

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SB-715992 is a mitotic inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with SB-715992, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with SB-715992

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients are excluded
             from this study
