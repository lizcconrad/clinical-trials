      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for patients with
      glioma. Drugs such as arsenic trioxide may also make the tumor cells more sensitive to
      radiation therapy. Combining arsenic trioxide with radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining arsenic trioxide with
      radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered with
           radiotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma,
           glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma, or intrinsic pontine glioma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide (ATO).

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 6 weeks. Patients
      concurrently receive ATO IV over 1 hour, 1-5 times weekly, for approximately 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ATO until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-36
      months.
