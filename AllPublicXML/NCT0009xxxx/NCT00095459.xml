  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  BAY 43-9006 is an inhibitor of wild-type and mutant B-Raf and c-Raf kinase isoforms in
           vitro, but it also inhibits p38, c-kit, VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-Beta affecting tumor growth as
           well as possibly promoting apoptosis by events downstream of c-Raf.

        -  Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds all biologically
           active isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, or VEGF-A) with high
           affinity (k(d)= 1.1nM)

        -  The most common adverse events associated with bevacizumab of any severity include
           asthenia, pain, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, stomatitis, constipation, epistaxis,
           dyspnea, dermatitis and proteinuria.

        -  This Phase I trial is open to patients with all solid tumors.

      Objectives:

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) and
           bevacizumab.

        -  Determine estimates of biochemical changes in the Ras-Raf-MAPK and VEGF signal
           transduction pathways in tumor and stromal cells in response to treatment at the MTD, at
           least in a pilot fashion, if those changes are statistically significant.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults with histologically documented solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or
           unresectable and for which standard curative therapies do not exist or are no longer
           effective.

        -  Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or
           biological therapy for at least 4 weeks.

        -  All patients enrolling in cohort 2 must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy.

        -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 and adequate organ and marrow function.

      Design:

        -  Cohort I will receive BAY 43-9006 and bevacizumab together at the start of study in a
           dose escalation fashion.

        -  Cohort II will be randomized as to which agent they receive for cycle one. Cycles 2 and
           beyond are treated using both agents.

        -  Tumor biopsies will be obtained from patients in Cohort II before treatment, two weeks
           into mono-therapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.

        -  DCE-MRI studies will be obtained on patients in Cohort II before treatment, two weeks
           into monotherapy, four weeks into monotherapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.

        -  FDG-PET studies will be obtained on patients in Cohort II before treatment, two weeks
           into mono-therapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.

        -  Patients will be evaluated for toxicity in clinic every 2 weeks for Cycles 1 and 2, and
           then every 4 weeks.

        -  Patients will be evaluated for response every 8 weeks using the RECIST criteria.

        -  Approximately 62 patients will be needed to achieve the objectives of the trial.

             normal

          -  Amylase and Lipase less than or equal to the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Spot Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio less than 0.5; If result is 0.5 or more, a 24-hour

        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Brain metastases

          -  Patients who have a history of remote CNS metastases that have undergone &quot;curative
             therapy&quot; by radiation therapy, gamma knife therapy, or surgery and have remained
             without recurrence for a period of greater than or equal to 2 years will be considered
             on a case-by-case basis.

          -  CNS imaging will not be mandated for all patients. However, if there is clinical
             suspicion of CNS involvement, a contrast CT or MRI of the brain will be required.
             Screening CNS scans should be required for certain tumor types with relatively high
             risk of CNS metastases, including but not limited to melanoma, RCC, breast, lung.

        Thrombotic or embolic events within the past 6 months such as a cerebrovascular accident
        (including transient ischemic attacks), pulmonary embolism, unstable angina, or myocardial
        infarction.

        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (AHA Class II or worse), unstable angina
        pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
        compliance with study requirements.

        -Patients with evidence of active infection will become eligible for reconsideration 7 days
        after completing antibiotic therapy.

        HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the
        study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006, bevacizumab,
        and/or the combination.

        Patients who have been treated with BAY 43-9006 or bevacizumab will be excluded

        Hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic pressure
        greater than 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management.

        Proteinuria defined as a 24-hour urine protein excretion greater than 1000 mg. Spot urine
        analysis for protein creatinine ratio (UPC) of 0.5 or greater will require a 24-hour urine
        to determine eligibility for enrollment.

        Therapeutic anticoagulation with coumadin, heparins, or heparinoids.

        Serious non-healing wounds (including wounds healing by secondary intention), acute or
        non-healing ulcers, or bone fractures within 3 months of fracture. History of abdominal
        fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal abcesses within 28 days will be
        excluded.

        Evidence of bleeding diathesis

        Impairment of swallowing that would preclude administration of BAY 43-9006.

        History of hemoptysis or surgery within the past 28 days.

        Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs will be excluded due to risk of fatal
        pulmonary hemorrhage. If a patient has a history of any type primary lung cancer and
        hemoptysis, they will be excluded.

        History of high grade varices.

        Use of herbal supplements are not permitted within 14 days of trial commencement and on
        study. Vitamin supplement (above a typical single multi-vitamin) usage is discouraged
        unless clearly indicated by an existing medical condition. An Associate or Principal
        Investigator will have the discretion regarding which vitamin supplements are permitted.

        Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other
        recombinant human antibodies.
