  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective and safe a new investigational drug
      is in treating persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer in patients who have received a
      platinum/taxane based chemotherapy and whose disease continues to progress. The treatment
      involves a 1-hour treatment given intravenously (IV), and repeated once every 21 days. A
      patient may continue to receive the treatment as long as they are benefiting from the
      treatment. Blood samples will be taken at specific times over a 24 hour period to measure the
      amount of drug in your body at specific times after the drug is given. Blood samples will
      also be taken for routine lab tests such as complete blood counts and clinical chemistries.
      Physical exams will be performed before each treatment.
