      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of ARQ 501 in combination with docetaxel
      in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. In addition, the study is designed to observe
      the potential the combination of ARQ 501 and docetaxel have in treating cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARQ 501 has demonstrated activity in vitro against a wide range of solid tumors including
      lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and myeloma. To date, no
      histological cancer type studied appears inherently resistant to treatment with ARQ 501. In
      animal xenograft models of human tumors, ARQ 501 monotherapy has been effective in treating
      ovarian, colon, prostate, and breast cancer. When used in combination with taxane therapy,
      ARQ 501 has demonstrated efficacy in treating a variety of human cancers, including ovarian,
      breast, and colon.

      This study is designed to explore whether the addition of ARQ 501 to a once every three week
      schedule of docetaxel is a safe and tolerable regimen. The study is designed to collect
      safety and pharmacokinetic data on the combination regimen and to measure the antitumor
      activity observed in patients.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a locally advanced or
             metastatic carcinoma. (Patients may have either measurable or nonmeasurable disease.)

          -  Be ≥18 years old.

          -  Must not be eligible for therapy of higher curative potential.

          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥70%.

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

          -  Be male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients. Patients who are fertile agree
             to use an effective barrier method of birth control (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or
             cervical cap) to avoid pregnancy.

          -  Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug (if patient is a female of childbearing potential).

          -  Sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Have adequate organ function as determined per protocol defined laboratory value

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received previous treatment with ARQ 501.

          -  Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, life
             threatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have a psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation,
             or follow-up.

          -  Have received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, major
             surgery, or irradiation, whether conventional or investigational, within 2 weeks of
             treatment in this study.

          -  Have not recovered from acute toxicity of all previous therapy prior to enrollment.

          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Have symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          -  Have a known severe hypersensitivity to docetaxel or drugs formulated with polysorbate
             80.
