  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maraviroc (UK-427,857), a selective and reversible CCR5 coreceptor antagonist, has been shown
      to be active in vitro against a wide range of clinical isolates (including those resistant to
      existing classes). In HIV-1 infected patients, maraviroc (UK-427,857) given as monotherapy
      for 10 days reduced HIV-1 viral load by up to 1.6 log, consistent with currently available
      agents. Safety and toleration have been studied in over 400 subjects for up to 28 days at 300
      mg twice daily. No significant effects were seen on the QTc interval. The goal of this study
      is to compare the safety and efficacy of maraviroc (UK-427,857) versus efavirenz, when each
      are combined with two other antiretroviral agents, in patients who are previously naive to
      antiretroviral therapy. This study will involve approximately 200 centers from around the
      world to achieve a total randomized subject population of 1071 subjects. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of three groups: maraviroc (UK-427,857) 300 mg once daily added to
      zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily), Maraviroc (UK-427,857) 300 mg twice daily
      added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily) or efavirenz (600 mg once daily)
      added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily). The study will enroll over
      approximately an 18 month period (5 months Phase 2b run-in, 13 months Phase 3) with 96 weeks
      of treatment. This may be extended for an additional 3 years depending on the results at 96
      weeks. Physical examinations will be performed at study entry, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24,
      32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. Blood samples will also be taken at study entry, weeks 2, 4,
      8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn
      twice, at least 30 minutes apart, at weeks 2 and 48 for maraviroc (UK-427,857)
      pharmacokinetic analysis. As part of this clinical study a blood sample will be taken for
      non-anonymized pharmacogenetic analysis. Patients will undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram at
      study entry, weeks 24, 48 and 96. A computerized tomography (CT) scan will also be performed,
      at selected centers, at study entry and week 96. Patients will be asked to complete a symptom
      distress questionnaire at study entry, weeks 12, 24, 48 and 96.

          <title>Number of Participants With NRTI Associated Mutations at Time of Treatment Failure Through Week 48 and 96</title>
          <description>Genotypic resistance to NRTIs was assessed by identification of relevant mutations at screening using MBPSGT assay and repeated for all participants with HIV-1 viral load more than 500 copies/mL at treatment failure through week 48 and week 96. Following mutations associated with NRTIs were summarized at time of failure: Any zidovudine/lamivudine (Zid/Lam), Any thymidine analogue-associated mutation (TAM), methionine (M) to valine/isoleucine (V/I) substitution at residue (r) 184 (M184V/I), lysine (K) to arginine (R) substitution at residue 65 (K65R) and any other NRTI mutations.</description>
          <population>FAS population included all the randomized participants who had taken at least 1 dose of the study medication. ‘n’ is signifying those participants who experienced treatment failure, defined as discontinuation due to insufficient response at specified time points for each arm group respectively.</population>
