  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium has recently been shown as a predictor of death, increased cost, and longer length
      of stay in ventilated patients. Sedative and analgesic medications relieve anxiety and pain,
      but may contribute to patients' transitioning into delirium. It is possible that modifying
      the paradigm for sedation using novel therapies targeted at different receptors, such as
      dexmedetomidine targeting alpha2 receptors and sparing the GABA receptors, could provide
      efficacious sedation yet reduce the development, duration, and severity of acute brain
      dysfunction (delirium).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium occurs in 60-80% of ventilated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and is
      independently associated with prolonged hospital stay, higher cost, a 3-fold increased risk
      of dying by six months and ongoing neuropsychological dysfunction. Hypothesis: Based on our
      preliminary work, we hypothesize that standard use of GABA agonist sedatives such as
      lorazepam and propofol may contribute to ICU delirium and its attendant untoward clinical
      outcomes. An alternative sedation strategy targeting alpha2 receptors and sparing GABA
      receptors (dexmedetomidine) might reduce delirium, provide adequate sedation, reduce
      analgesic requirement, and concurrently improve cognitive performance.

      Long-term objective: To standardize and compare different strategies of sedation and
      analgesia for ventilated ICU patients in order to optimize their clinical outcomes focusing
      on delirium and the long-term neuropsychological dysfunction of ICU survivors.

      Specific Aims:

        -  to study prevalence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients using
           differential exposure to alpha2 vs. GABA receptor agonists while evaluating efficacy of
           sedation and analgesia;

        -  to compare clinical outcomes including duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of
           stay and severity of neuropsychological dysfunction at hospital discharge; and

        -  to develop pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models for dexmedetomidine and lorazepam
           when used for up to 5 days in ICU patients.

      Relationship to anesthesiology: We will study whether the adverse clinical outcomes
      associated with ICU delirium including long-term neuropsychological dysfunction can be
      modified by the choice of psychoactive agents frequently used by anesthesiologists and
      intensivists.

      Design: A blinded, randomized controlled trial of adult mechanically ventilated patients
      using a sedation strategy of dexmedetomidine ± fentanyl versus lorazepam ± fentanyl, with
      relevant outcomes and safety monitoring.

    <description>The patients' managing team will set the &quot;goal&quot; or &quot;target&quot; as medically indicated using the RASS 37. A trained research nurse or physician blinded to patients' group assignment and medical management will perform measurement of the &quot;actual&quot; RASS level every 12 hours. Comparisons will be made between the actual and target RASS levels to determine the primary outcome measure, which is the accuracy of achieving the target sedation level.</description>

    <description>Delirium will be measured using the CAM-ICU, every 12 hours, by the same research personnel performing the assessment of the patients' sedation level. Together, these instruments take on average only 1 to 2 minutes to perform. Delirium is said to be present if the patients are responsive to verbal stimulation with eye opening (i.e., RASS -3 or better) and are found to have an acute change or fluctuation in the course of their mental status, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or an altered level of consciousness.</description>
