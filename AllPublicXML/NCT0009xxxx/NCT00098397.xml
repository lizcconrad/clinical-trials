  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with metastatic
      breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as FR901228, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      FR901228 may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy and safety of FR901228 (depsipeptide) in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical activity of this drug, in terms of progression-free survival, in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.4-12.3
      months.
