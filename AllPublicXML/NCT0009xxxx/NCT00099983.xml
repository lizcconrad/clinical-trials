    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research of 400 participants is to determine whether a drug called
      risperidone can decrease symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It is a
      placebo-controlled study, meaning that half of the participants will be assigned to receive a
      pill that contains no drug. The treatment phase of the study will last for 6 months, during
      which time participants will continue to receive all their usual treatments in addition to
      the study treatment and will be asked to complete procedures and assessments (questionnaires,
      interviews, laboratory tests, physical exams, etc.) related to their PTSD symptoms at various
      points within the 6-month treatment phase. At the end of the 6-month study, participants will
      discontinue the study treatment.

      Primary Hypothesis: Risperidone will reduce symptoms of PTSD, relative to placebo, in
      veterans with military service related chronic PTSD who have been partial or non-responders
      to antidepressant medications.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Risperidone is safe and well-tolerated in veterans with military
      service related chronic PTSD, and patients will comply with its prescription. As a result,
      patients will show improvement in the secondary consequences of PTSD for the veteran and for
      the VA.

      Intervention: Usual (PTSD) care plus Risperidone vs usual (PTSD) care plus placebo Study
      Abstract: Four hundred veterans with the diagnosis of military-related PTSD will be enrolled
      at 20 VAMC hospitals over a two-year period. An equipoise stratification design will be used
      to randomize patients in a double-blind manner to risperidone or placebo (~200 patients in
      each group) for six months of treatment. Usual care will be provided for all patients for
      treatment of PTSD and other psychiatric and medical disorders. Comparisons between the
      risperidone and placebo groups will be made at the end of six months to answer the primary
      question. The sample size is calculated to give 90% power at the two-sided alpha level of
      0.05 for the overall test for the CAPS score change.

      STUDY UPDATE/NOTES: The study kicked-off in late July 2006 with recruitment expected to begin
      October 1, 2006.

      Oct2006 - Participating sites are seeking approval for the protocol amendment which resulted
      from the Kick-Off meeting. Patient recruitment at each site will begin as soon as they
      receive approval of the amendment.

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study was the total score on the 34-item Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). This study was the intent-to-treat analysis of the improvement in PTSD symptoms from baseline to week-24 follow-up as measured by the CAPS. Total score range for the CAPS is 0-136 with higher values representing a worse outcome. This study was powered initially to detect a 9-point difference between the treatment groups in the CAPS change score.</description>

        <title>Change in CAPS Score From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure for this study was the total score on the 34-item Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). This study was the intent-to-treat analysis of the improvement in PTSD symptoms from baseline to week-24 follow-up as measured by the CAPS. Total score range for the CAPS is 0-136 with higher values representing a worse outcome. This study was powered initially to detect a 9-point difference between the treatment groups in the CAPS change score.</description>

Risperidone: Initiate treatment with a low dose (1 mg/day HS) for week one, increasing by 1 mg/day weekly to a target dose of 3 mg/day. Escalation to a maximum of 4 mg/day will be allowed after a minimum of 4 weeks at the target dose (3 mg/day). Reduction to a lower dose will be allowed at any time, based on adverse effects. Treatment will continue for 6 months. Patients who discontinue treatment will be allowed to resume treatment at any time.</description>
