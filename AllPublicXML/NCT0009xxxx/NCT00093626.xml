  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. This phase II trial is studying how well
      sorafenib works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial or
      peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian
      epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. Determine 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug, in terms of frequency and severity of adverse
      events encountered, in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical response rate (partial and complete response) in patients treated
      with this drug.

      II. Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with
      this drug.

      III. Correlate prognostic variables (platinum sensitivity, performance status, and histology
      [clear cell and mucinous type]) with response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-13
      months.
