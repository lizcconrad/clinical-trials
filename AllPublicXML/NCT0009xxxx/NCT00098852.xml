      RATIONALE: Drugs such as rosiglitazone may make tumor cells more sensitive to radioactive
      iodine.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well rosiglitazone works in treating patients
      with locoregionally extensive or metastatic thyroid cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine complete response in patients with locoregionally extensive or metastatic
           differentiated thyroid cancer treated with rosiglitazone.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the long-term response of patients treated with this drug with historical
           controls.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the presence/persistence of tumor in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive oral rosiglitazone once daily on weeks 1-8. Patients also receive oral
      liothyronine sodium twice daily on weeks 1-6 in preparation for radioactive iodine scan.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At week
      8, all patients undergo whole body radioactive iodine scan followed by a treatment dose of
      radioiodine to assess radioiodine uptake by tumor.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at the end of study treatment.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks, 1, 4, and 10 months, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
