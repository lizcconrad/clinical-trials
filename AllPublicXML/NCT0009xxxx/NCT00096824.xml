  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how often dementia and other neurological problems
      occur in people with HIV. Participants of ACTG A5175 will enroll in this study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS) are affected by HIV; however,
      the causes of neurotoxicity in HIV infected patients are unknown. Initial data indicate that
      as many as 40% of patients with HIV develop some form of dementia. Other common neurological
      problems observed in HIV patients are peripheral neuropathy and opportunistic infections of
      the CNS. Most antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV have poor penetration into
      the CNS, which may explain how HIV persists in the CNS and contributes to the prevalence of
      dementia and other neurological disorders in HIV infected patients. This study will examine
      the prevalence of dementia and other neurological disorders in participants in ACTG A5175,
      &quot;Once-Daily PI/NNRTI Therapy Combinations for Treatment Naive, HIV Infected Patients in
      Resource-limited Conditions.&quot;

      The study will last approximately 2.5 to 3 years. Participants will undergo neurological
      examinations and neuropsychological assessments at entry to both steps of ACTG A5175 and
      before the administration of the new antiretroviral regimen, then every 24 weeks until they
      discontinue ACTG A5175. Physicians will make targeted diagnoses at each study visit.
