      PURPOSE: This trial is designed to compare the combination of the investigational oral
      cytotoxic drug, satraplatin, and radiation therapy for patients with locally advanced
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatment.
      Please refer to the Eligibility Criteria below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN: Satraplatin is an oral, investigational anticancer drug that is a member
      of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based drugs have been clinically
      proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer therapies. Unlike the currently
      marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given orally.

      RATIONALE: Intravenously administered platinum-based drugs are currently used in combination
      with radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with locally advanced NSCLC. The purpose
      of this Phase I trial is to determine a tolerable dose and schedule for the oral platinum
      drug (satraplatin) when given to NSCLC patients throughout the course of their radiotherapy
      treatment.
