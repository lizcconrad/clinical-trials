  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, two-stage, multicenter Phase II study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in women with platinum resistant, advanced (Stage III or
      IV) EOC (epithelial ovarian cancer) or PPC (primary peritoneal cancer) that subsequently
      progressed either during treatment with Doxil or Hycamtin therapy or within 3 months of
      discontinuing treatment with Doxil or Hycamtin therapy.

          -  History of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Day 0 (the day of the first
             bevacizumab infusion)

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the subject at high risk from treatment
             complications
