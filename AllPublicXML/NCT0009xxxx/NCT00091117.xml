      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their
      growth. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib in
      treating patients with advanced cancer and liver dysfunction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in patients with advanced malignancies
      and varying degrees of liver dysfunction.

      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients with mild, moderate, or
      severe liver insufficiency.

      IV. Examine the dietary influences on bortezomib disposition and efficacy. V. Examine the
      influences of proteasome inhibition on CYP 450 activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to
      hepatic function (normal vs mild dysfunction vs moderate dysfunction vs severe dysfunction).

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      [Note: Patients with normal hepatic function do not receive escalating doses of bortezomib.]
