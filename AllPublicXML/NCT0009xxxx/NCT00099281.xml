  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study DPPE combined with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide in
      patients with metastatic and/or recurrent breast cancer who may have received previous
      hormone treatment but have not had exposure to anthracycline treatment. Stratification
      allocation will be within the following subgroups:

        1. Prior cytotoxic treatment;

        2. Estrogen receptor status;

        3. ECOG performance status;

        4. Number of cycles of chemotherapy.

      Endpoints of the trial are as follows:

      primary: overall survival; secondary: response rate, progression free survival, toxicity,
      neurocognitive function.
