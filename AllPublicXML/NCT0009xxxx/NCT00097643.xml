      The purpose of this study is to examine the relative and combined efficacy of a physical
      activity and health promotion program to help sedentary adults over age 70 maintain an
      independent life style.

      The study recruited 273 participants from a community-based HMO for whom computerized health
      service utilization and cost data were already available, as well as cognitive, functional,
      and health status measures. The participants were randomly placed into one of four treatment
      groups: exercise, health promotion, combination exercise and health promotion, and routine
      medical care. Assessments for physical performance, emotional well-being, and physical and
      emotional health status were conducted at screening, baseline, after 3 months
      (post-treatment), and at 6, 12, and 18-month follow-up by interviewers blind to treatment
      assignment.
