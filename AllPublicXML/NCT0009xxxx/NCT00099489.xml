  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AVONEX (Interferon Beta-1a), when compared
      to placebo, reduces the total dose of IVIg that is administered after Visit 5 and through
      Visit 9 (Week 32, End of Study).

    <textblock>
      Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired peripheral
      neuropathy of unknown origin. The etiology is not well understood but is presumed to be
      immunological. Evidence for this comes from observed similarities to Guillain-Barre syndrome
      and from the favorable response with immunomodulatory treatments.

      CIDP is a peripheral nervous system demyelinating neuropathy that is sometimes a corollary
      disorder to the central nervous system demyelination of multiple sclerosis (MS. The precise
      mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis are uncertain, but a number of those mechanisms
      support a potential role for immunomodulatory treatments such as interferon beta (e.g.,
      Biogen Idec Inc.'s AVONEX).

      The rationale for the use of AVONEX in CIDP derives from observations on the pathogenesis of
      the condition and its similarities to MS, the mechanism of action of AVONEX, clinical trials
      that have been performed in CIDP that support a role for IFN-beta, and the unmet need that
      currently exists because of availability and safety issues with existing therapies.

      This Phase 2b study is a dose-ranging study designed to provide scientific evidence regarding
      the safety and efficacy of AVONEX in CIDP. In addition, the study aims to demonstrate the
      responsiveness and clinical relevance of changes in the MRC sum score and ODSS in CIDP
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent prior to any testing under this protocol

          -  Must be between 18 and 75 years of age

          -  Have a diagnosis of CIDP as determined by a board-certified or board-eligible
             neurologist, or equivalent, for at least 6 months, including fulfilling modified INCAT
             neurophysiological criteria for CIDP,CIDP motor deficit responsive to IVIg and
             alternative EP data that justifies subject inclusion, and/or supportive pathologic or
             laboratory data that supports the diagnosis of CIDP

          -  Documentation in the medical record prior to screening that the CIDP had been
             associated with loss of muscle strength, such that the MRC sum score was less than or
             equal to 58.

          -  Documentation in the medical record that the patient benefited fom IVIg treatment
             (patient had a 2-point change or equivalent in 60-point MRC sum score)

          -  Tested for IgM monoclonal gammopathy and found to have tested negative for IgM
             monoclonal gammopathy or if positive for IgM monoclonal gammopathy, then are MAG
             antibody-negative and proven to be IVI g responsive per protocol.

          -  Must have been clinically stable while on a constant regimen of IVIg (every 2-weeks,
