  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are biological reasons to suspect that hormones may affect the risk of a woman becoming
      infected with a sexually transmitted disease. The evidence on this issue to date is mixed and
      previous studies have methodologic flaws making it difficult to draw conclusions about the
      results.

      This study compares the risk of developing either Chlamydial or Gonorrheal infection among
      three groups of women: those using combined oral contraceptives (birth control pills); those
      using the injectable hormone (brand name Depo Provera); and those women using non-hormonal
      contraceptive methods.

      The study was designed to examine the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and
      possible increased risk of Chlamydial and Gonococcal sexually transmitted infections, and to
      determine if any increased risk appeared to be mediated by the extent of cervical ectopy.

      Eight hundred and nineteen women, ages 15 to 45 years, were recruited from an inner city
      clinic and from a nearby suburban clinic. The women were classified into three groups based
      on type of contraceptive used. One group used oral contraceptives; the second used injectable
      depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA); and the third group used non-hormonal contraceptive
      methods. Women from each group were followed at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment to
      determine if a new infection with Chlamydia or Gonorrhea had occurred and to evaluate the
      extent of cervical ectopy present.
