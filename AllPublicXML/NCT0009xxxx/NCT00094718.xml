  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      West Nile (WN) virus infection is an emerging disease; WN infection may lead to paralysis,
      coma, and death. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of and immune response to a
      WN vaccine in healthy adults. The vaccine is based on a live attenuated vaccine developed
      against dengue virus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WN is widely distributed in Africa and Europe, where it is usually associated with mild
      illness. In the United States, WN is considered a public health threat because severe illness
      caused by WN infection has caused paralysis, coma, and death, especially in the elderly. This
      study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated chimeric virus,
      WN/DEN4-3'delta30, which is derived from the DEN4 dengue virus and wild-type WN serotypes.

      This study will last 180 days. Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to receive
      the lowest dose of WN/DEN4-3'delta30 or placebo at study entry. Cohort 2 will begin only
      after safety review of all participants in Cohort 1. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive a
      higher dose of WN/DEN4-3'delta30 or placebo. Cohort 3 will begin only after safety review of
      all participants in Cohort 2. Participants in Cohort 3 will receive the highest dose of
      WN/DEN4-3'delta30 or placebo. Immediately after receiving their injections, participants will
      be observed for 30 minutes for immediate adverse reactions.

      After vaccination, participants will be asked to monitor their temperatures every day for 16
      days and on Day 19. Study visits will occur every other day after vaccination until Day 16,
      followed by 5 additional visits at selected days through Day 180. Blood collection and a
      targeted physical exam will occur at each study visit. Some participants will be asked to
      undergo a skin biopsy or additional blood collection at selected visits.
