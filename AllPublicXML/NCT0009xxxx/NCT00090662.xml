  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased numbers of white blood cells called eosinophils can cause disease. To investigate
      this disease, researchers need normal blood and bone marrow samples to compare to samples
      from patients with this problem. This study will collect blood and bone marrow samples from
      normal volunteers who meet standard blood donor criteria. Some of the samples will be used
      for genetic testing or future research.

      This study will last for about 3 years and will include a maximum of 50 paid volunteers ages
      18 to 65.

      After a medical screening, volunteers will donate a blood sample and a bone marrow sample,
      taken from the hip bone, followed by a biopsy that will obtain a small sample of bone and
      bone marrow. The procedure lasts less than 1 hour. Volunteers may donate repeatedly within
      the limits set by the study.

      This protocol is designed to provide blood, urine, sputum, stool and bone marrow aspirate
      samples from paid, volunteer donors for use in in vitro studies of eosinophilia and parasitic
      diseases. Donors meeting standard normal donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to
      donate blood, urine, sputum, stool and/or bone marrow using conventional techniques. The
      investigational nature of the studies in which their samples will be used, as well as the
      risks and benefits of the donation process will be explained to all donors, and a signed
      informed consent document will be obtained. Donors will be compensated according to an
      established schedule based on the duration and discomfort of the donation. Samples provided
      through this protocol will be used solely for in vitro research. Blood, urine, sputum, stool
      and bone marrow samples will be assigned a unique product number, and the study investigators
      listed on this protocol will serve as the custodians of the code that links the product with
      a donor's identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the specimens collected in
      this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol and will be described in general
      terms only, since it involves several IRB approved LPD protocols. Because some of these
      protocols require normal controls without a history of asthma or allergic disease, all
      subjets will undergo a standardized allergy/asthma history at enrollment. Serum
      immunoglobulin levels and a basic RAST panel may be performed on sera from some normal
      donors, and some normal donors may be asked t undergo pulmonary function testing.This
      protocol is designed to assure adequate and complete informed consent, counseling and
      protection of the study subjects according to IRB, OHSR, OPRR and other applicable Federal
      regulatory standards.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Eligibility criteria for volunteer whole blood donation are based on the Standards of
             the AABB(2) and the Code of Federal Regualtions 21 CFR 640(3). Specific criteria
             follow:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (BLOOD, URINE, STOOL AND/OR SPUTUM DONATION):

          -  Ability to sign informed consent.

          -  Healthy, male or female, and 18-85 years of age.

        Eligibility criteria for volunteer bone marrow donation are more stringent than those for
        other specimen donations to minimize risk of procedure complications and maximize utility
        of specimens for study:

        Bone Marrow Donation

          -  Ability to sign informed consent.

          -  Healthy, male or female, and 18 65 years of age

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (BLOOD, URINE, STOOL AND/OR SPUTUM DONATION):

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Weight less than 110 pounds

          -  History of heart, lung kidney disease, chronic anemia or bleeding disorders

        Bone Marrow Donation

          -  A known bleeding disorder, low platelets (less than 100k) or taking medications that
             interfere with blood clotting, such as aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
             or warfarin

          -  Anemia (hemoglobin less than 12.3 mg/dL).

          -  Evidence of an immune deficiency, such as HIV infection or cancer.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Taking a medication that affects eosinophils, including steroids, beta-blockers and
             agents that affect the immune response.

          -  Allergic to xylocaine.

          -  Have taken an investigational drug in the last 6 months.

          -  Any other medical condition that the investigator feels puts the participant at too
             high a risk for participation.

        Warfarin and/or heparin treatment will not be stopped so that a subject can participate in
        this protocol. If warfarin or heparin was recently discontinued, a subject can be enrolled,
        but no bone marrow procedures will be performed until the PT is less than 15.5 seconds and
        the PTT is within normal range. For other agents that interfere with blood clotting without
        prolonging the PT, a 7 day washout period will be required before bone marrow sampling.
