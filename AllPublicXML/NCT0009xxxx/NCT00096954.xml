  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study
      that enrolled 333 subjects. These subjects were 12-75 years old with atopic asthma, had
      elevated serum total Immunoglobulin E (IgE), had a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1
      second (FEV1) ≥ 80% predicted, and were on inhaled corticosteroids with or without other
      controller asthma medications (e.g., long-acting β2-agonists [LABAs], leukotriene receptor
      antagonist [LTRA], or immunotherapy).

    <measure>Rate of Asthma Exacerbations Over the 24 Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of treatment to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A protocol-defined asthma exacerbation was a worsening of asthma requiring treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroid burst and/or a doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) dose for at least 3 days.
The rate of protocol-defined asthma exacerbations, normalized by subject-time at risk and computed over the 24 week treatment period in each treatment group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing One or More Protocol-defined Asthma Exacerbations During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of treatment to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients reporting one or more protocol-defined asthma exacerbations during the 24 week treatment period. A protocol-defined asthma exacerbation was a worsening of asthma requiring treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroid burst and/or a doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) dose for at least 3 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nocturnal and Daytime Asthma Symptom Scores at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The daytime asthma symptom score assessed the symptoms: shortness of breath, chest discomfort, wheezing, and cough over the previous 24 hour period on a scale of 0(no symptoms) to 4(marked discomfort).
The nocturnal asthma score was the patient's response to:How did you sleep last night? rated on a scale of 0(no problems) to 4(difficulty sleeping;rescue medicine used).
Scores were collected daily. Change from Baseline (mean of last 28 days prior to first dosing date) at Week 24 (mean of last 28 days prior to week 24 visit).
A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Percent Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was used to assess FEV1. All spirometry measurements were performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines.
The relative percent change from baseline in forced expiratory volume (liters) in one second (FEV1) was calculated at week 24 using the formula: (FEV1 at week 24 - FEV1 at baseline) / FEV1 at baseline * 100 for each treatment group.</description>

    <description>Omalizumab (Xolair) was administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks. The dose (mg) and dosing frequency were determined by serum total IgE level (IU/mL), measured before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg).

Doses of &gt; 150 mg were divided among more than one injection site to limit injections to no more than 150 mg per site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a documented history of asthma as well as evidence of ≥ 12% reversibility of
             FEV1. Evidence of ≥ 12% reversibility of FEV1 may be obtained by any one of the

             administration at any time during the preceding 24 months; 2) Documentation of ≥ 12%
             improvement in FEV1 with two separate measurements obtained within a 4-week period
             surrounding an asthma exacerbation during the preceding 24 months; 3) Demonstration of
             ≥ 12%reversibility of FEV1 after albuterol administration at the time of screening

        <description>The daytime asthma symptom score assessed the symptoms: shortness of breath, chest discomfort, wheezing, and cough over the previous 24 hour period on a scale of 0(no symptoms) to 4(marked discomfort).
The nocturnal asthma score was the patient's response to:How did you sleep last night? rated on a scale of 0(no problems) to 4(difficulty sleeping;rescue medicine used).
Scores were collected daily. Change from Baseline (mean of last 28 days prior to first dosing date) at Week 24 (mean of last 28 days prior to week 24 visit).
A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.</description>
