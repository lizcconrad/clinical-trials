  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the serious form of West Nile Virus (WNV) disease, referred to as neuroinvasive
      disease, is rare, it can result in permanent disabilities and occasionally death. For
      patients who get this serious form of WNV disease, there are no approved specific treatment
      options.

      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug, AVI-4020 Injection, in patients who are
      hospitalized with recent symptoms of this form of WNV disease. In this study, we will
      determine if the AVI-4020 treatment is safe. This will be accomplished by reviewing the
      results of laboratory tests and clinical signs and symptoms. Additionally, we will review the
      patient data for signs that AVI-4020 is providing any beneficial effects against WNV
      neuroinvasive disease.

      1. To evaluate the safety of intravenously administered (IV) AVI-4020 Injection every 12
           hours for a total of ten doses over the course of study surveillance.

        2. To evaluate the tolerability of intravenously administered AVI-4020 Injection every 12
           hours for a total of ten doses over the course of study surveillance.

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenously administered AVI-4020 Injection at 45 mg
           every 12 hours for ten doses, based on the neurological status of each study Subject as
           measured by a combination of the NIH stroke scale score and the Glasgow coma scale
           score.

        4. To evaluate the robustness of the potential effectiveness of intravenously administered
           AVI-4020 Injection every 12 hours for ten doses over the course of 35 days of active
           surveillance, based on a variety of criteria, e.g., clinical, laboratory and/or
           neurophysiological results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a positive serum or CSF ELISA MAC-IgM test indicating active/recent WNV
             infection, or the Subject resides in or has traveled to geographic areas with at least
             one of the following characteristics within the last seven days:

               1. Documented evidence of WNV infected mosquitoes or sentinel animals within the
                  last 30 days

               2. Documented evidence of WNV infected dead animals within the last 30 days

               3. Documented human cases of WNV infection/disease within the last two weeks

          -  Subject is between &gt;18 and &lt;75 years of age.

          -  Subject has developed a febrile disease with new neurological findings &lt;4 days prior
             to the current hospitalization.

          -  Subject has had an oral temperature of &gt;38 degrees Celsius within 48 hours of study
             entry.

          -  Subject must have one or more of the following acute signs at the time of study entry:

               1. Signs of meningitis (nuchal rigidity)

               2. Signs of encephalitis (changes in mental status)

               3. Evidence of brainstem, cranial nerve, or cerebellar dysfunction

               4. Limb weakness.

          -  Subject must have a CSF examination within 48 hours of study entry showing:

               1. Absence of any organisms on Gram or fungal stains

               2. White blood cell count of &gt; 4 per mm3 (corrected for significant red blood cell
