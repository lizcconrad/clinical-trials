    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are:

      A. To determine whether olanzapine can help patients with bipolar disorder who currently have
      mild to moderate mania.

      B. To assess the safety of olanzapine and any side effects that might be associated with it,
      as well as the quality of life and functioning of patients treated with olanzapine.

      C. To assess how olanzapine compares to divalproex.
