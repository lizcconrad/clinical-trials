    <textblock>
      Although some doctors favor starting anti-HIV treatment as soon as possible after patients
      learn they are infected, it is not known if treatment for recently infected patients results
      in long-term benefits or harm. The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not people
      should take anti-HIV drugs when they are first infected.

    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy has resulted in significantly decreased morbidity and
      mortality, incidence of opportunistic infections, and hospitalizations in HIV infected
      people. However, because of long-term toxicities associated with long-term use of
      antiretrovirals and the persistence of virus in latent reservoirs, it is unclear when it is
      best to initiate therapy in recently infected individuals. This study compared the virologic
      outcomes of adults recently infected with HIV who received emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (FTC/TDF), coformulated as Truvada, and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), coformulated
      as Kaletra [immediate treatment (IT arm)], with those who received no treatment [deferred
      treatment (DT arm)].

      The original study lasted 96 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups
      (IT arm vs. DT arm). For the first 36 weeks of the study, IT arm participants received
      FTC/TDF once daily and LPV/RTV twice daily. Some IT arm participants received a different ART
      regimen as determined by the participant and study staff, if appropriate. DT arm participants
      received no treatment for the duration of the study. At Week 37, participants from both arms
      were offered treatment continuation or initiation until Week 96 if they had a high viral
      load, low CD4 count, or experienced HIV-related symptoms (Step 2). Study visits occurred at
      screening, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 37, 38, 40, and every 4 weeks
      thereafter. Clinical assessment and blood collection occurred at all visits. Urine tests
      occurred at selected visits. Participants were asked to complete an adherence questionnaire
      at Weeks 12, 24, and 36.

      Per the recommendations the DSMB review in June 2009, this protocol was terminated as
      originally written with the exception of those participants in the IT arm in the middle of
      the first 36 weeks of treatment. Those participants were to continue on treatment until the
      end of the 36 weeks. At that point treatment decisions were made on best practice guidelines.
      In addition, the study duration was extended to include a 5 year follow up of participants
      who did not initiate long-term antiretroviral therapy (Step 3).

      The study was reviewed by an SMC on December 8, 2010. The SMC recommended the study close to
      long term follow-up because only very few participants enrolled in this portion of the study.

      All the results except for the CD4 analysis and time to treatment initiation and deaths were
      based on the database frozen on July 2, 2009. The results for the CD4 analysis and time to
      treatment initiation and deaths were based on the database frozen on January 30, 2012.

    The DSMB concluded that the findings regarding the primary analysis would persist and that no
    additional study goals would be achieved by continuing the study.

    <measure>Ranked Log10 HIV-1 RNA Viral Load (log10 Copies/mL) Averaged at 72 and 76 Weeks for the IT Arm and DT Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>At Weeks 72 and 76</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is (i) the average of log10 viral loads (VL) at wks 72 and 76 for participants who continued to wk 72 off ARV for the DT arm, (ii) average wk 72 and 76 VL for those who continued to wk 36 off ARV for the IT arm and (iii) an assigned VL rank for the &quot;failures&quot; who needed ARVs or met criteria for entry into Step 2 prior to these study visits. The assigned rank for the failures was either the last observed rank carried forward or the worst rank relative to the other possible outcomes. This approach was designed to, if anything, bias against finding a treatment effect. To illustrate, consider five participants who enter the study (A, B, C, D, and E), 4 of whom (A, B, C, D) make it to 72 wks off therapy with RNA levels that increase from A to D. Participant E enters Step 2 at wk 12, at which time his RNA is in the 50th percentile. This rank would be carried forward, so the rank order of the log10 HIV-1 RNA endpoints would be A B E C D.</description>

          <title>IT Arm</title>
          <description>On step 1, IT arm participants received 36 weeks of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate once daily and lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily. Participants in IT arm who met clinical, virologic or immunologic criteria for treatment re-initiation entered step 2 and re-initiated ART. At the time of the end of original randomized study, study participants in IT arm who did not enter Step 2 and did not initiate ART without meeting eligibility criteria for Step 2 had the opportunity to take part in a long-term follow-up study (step 3) for up to a total duration of five years in order to ascertain information about HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ T-cell count, occurrence of CDC Category B or C diagnoses, and initiation of ART.</description>

          <description>On step 1, DT arm participants received no Treatment,unless subsequent disease progression criteria were met. Participants in DT arm who met clinical, virologic or immunologic criteria for treatment initiation entered step 2 and initiated ART. At the time of the end of original randomized study, study participants in DT arm who did not enter Step 2 and did not initiate ART without meeting eligibility criteria for Step 2 had the opportunity to take part in a long-term follow-up study (step 3) for up to a total duration of five years in order to ascertain information about HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ T-cell count, occurrence of CDC Category B or C diagnoses, and initiation of ART.</description>

        <title>Ranked Log10 HIV-1 RNA Viral Load (log10 Copies/mL) Averaged at 72 and 76 Weeks for the IT Arm and DT Arm</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is (i) the average of log10 viral loads (VL) at wks 72 and 76 for participants who continued to wk 72 off ARV for the DT arm, (ii) average wk 72 and 76 VL for those who continued to wk 36 off ARV for the IT arm and (iii) an assigned VL rank for the “failures” who needed ARVs or met criteria for entry into Step 2 prior to these study visits. The assigned rank for the failures was either the last observed rank carried forward or the worst rank relative to the other possible outcomes. This approach was designed to, if anything, bias against finding a treatment effect. To illustrate, consider five participants who enter the study (A, B, C, D, and E), 4 of whom (A, B, C, D) make it to 72 wks off therapy with RNA levels that increase from A to D. Participant E enters Step 2 at wk 12, at which time his RNA is in the 50th percentile. This rank would be carried forward, so the rank order of the log10 HIV-1 RNA endpoints would be A B E C D.</description>
