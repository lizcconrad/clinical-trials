    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the anti-fungal drug caspofungin can prevent Candida
      infections in adult patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Caspofungin is approved to treat
      certain fungal infections, including fungal blood stream infections due to Candida. Because
      ICU patients are at high risk for Candida, it would be beneficial to have a preventive drug,
      thereby reducing complications due to infection.

      Patients 18 years of age or older who are not pregnant may be enrolled in this study on day 3
      or 4 of their ICU admission if they have an expected stay of at least 2 additional days in
      the ICU.

      Participants are randomly assigned to treatment with either caspofungin or placebo (an
      inactive substance). Before treatment, patients have a medical history and physical
      examination. Blood and urine tests are done for routine tests and to look for fungal
      infection. Additional samples that may be collected to test for fungal infection include a
      rectal swab or stool sample; a wound culture if the patient has a wound, or a sputum culture
      in patients who have a tube in their throat to help with breathing or are producing sputum.

      Patients take caspofungin or placebo once a day for no more than 28 days. In addition, they
      undergo the following procedures:

        -  Review of treatment side effects and medicines taken, daily during treatment, 1 week
           after treatment, and 2 weeks after treatment

        -  Physical examination once a week, on the last day of treatment, and 1 week after
           treatment

        -  Urine test once a week, on the last day of treatment, and 1 week after treatment to look
           for possible fungal infection

        -  Blood tests twice a week, on the last day of treatment, 1 week after treatment, and 2
           weeks after treatment for laboratory safety tests and to look for fungal infection

        -  Collection of additional samples (rectal swab or stool sample, wound culture, or sputum
           sample) once a week, on the last day of treatment, and 1 week after treatment to look
           for possible fungal infection

      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center randomized double-masked
      placebo-controlled trial of caspofungin versus placebo for prevention of invasive candidiasis
      in high-risk adults in the critical care setting. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of caspofungin as prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis in high-risk ICU subjects
      by comparing the risk of invasive candidiasis in subjects receiving caspofungin with the risk
      in those receiving placebo. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the rate of invasive
      candidiasis in subjects meeting the clinical prediction rule; to prospectively assess the
      effect of colonization as a risk factor for the development of invasive candidiasis; to
      evaluate the safety of caspofungin as prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis by summarizing the
      proportion of subjects who discontinue study therapy because of a drug-related adverse event
      and the proportion of subjects with one or more drug-related adverse event(s); and to
      evaluate all-cause mortality. The planned sample size will be 1200 subjects, 1/3 in the
      control arm and 2/3 in the active treatment arm based on a power of at least 0.8 needed to
      detect a 50% reduction in incidence from base rate of 11% to 5.5%. High-risk icu subjects
      greater than or equal to 18 years of age meeting all eligibility criteria with at least 5
      days of anticipated ICU stay will be randomized to receive either caspofungin 50 mg/day (70
      mg/day for subjects on rifampin) or placebo (normal saline) daily. Caspofungin or placebo
      will be given intravenously as a single daily dose infused over approximately one hour.
      Subjects will receive study drug or placebo for the duration on their icu stay, up to a
      maximum of 28 days.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment into the study:

        Participant, or their legal representative, has signed the informed consent. Sites will
        follow their institutional review board (IRB) specific guidelines for obtaining informed
        consent.

        Admission to an ICU within the previous 3 days. The subject may be enrolled into this study
        on Days 3, 4 or 5 of the ICU admission, and MUST HAVE an expected stay of at least 2
        additional days in the ICU.
