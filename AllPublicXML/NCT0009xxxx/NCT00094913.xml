  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the earliest predictors of memory and brain
      deterioration in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease using positron emission tomography (PET) to
      monitor brain glucose metabolism.

      Previous studies indicate that the brain's glucose metabolism rate potentially may be an
      early indicator of damage to particular regions of the brain caused by AD, including loss of
      neurons, synapses, and other changes. Many of these changes are reported among patients with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a group known to be at increased risk for AD.

      The overall goal of this study is to use FDG-PET
      (2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose/positron-emission tomography) to determine whether
      metabolic abnormalities in the hippocampus predict memory and brain deterioration in middle
      age, and to identify the brain glucose metabolism predictors of future MCI.

      Participants in the study will be grouped into 3 main groups of 35 each, including young
      individuals (20-40 years of age), 41-90 year-old normal, and MCI individuals with or without
      risk for memory decline. Participants will undergo baseline and 36-month follow-up exams to
      include comprehensive medical, neurologic, and psychiatric evalutions; lumbar puncture; a
      resting FDG-PET; an MRI scan; and a neuropsychological battery. A brief medical exam, full
      neuropsychological battery, and MRI scan will be administered at 18 months. Two subgroups
      (groups 4 and 5) of 15 each will be created from groups 1 and 2 at 18 months to participate
      in the evaluation of memory performance under acute hyperglycemia and saline challenges and
      effects on hippocampal formation and glucose metabolism.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females with a minimum high school education and between the ages of 50 and
             90 will be selected for Groups 1 and 2. For Group 3, normal subjects between the ages
             of 20 and 49 years of age will be selected. The Groups 1 and 2 will be balanced for
             age, and all three groups balanced for gender and ApoE genotype.

          -  Discontinuance of all psychotropic and/or cognitively active medication at least four
             weeks prior to evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past history or MRI evidence of brain damage including significant trauma, stroke,
             hydrocephalus, lacunar infarcts, seizures, mental retardation or serious neurological
             disorder.

          -  Significant history of alcoholism or drug abuse.

          -  Any history of psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, mania or depression).

          -  Any focal signs or significant neuropathology.

          -  A score of 4 or greater on the Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale, indicative of
             cerebrovascular disease.

          -  A total score of 16 or more on the Hamilton Depression Scale to exclude possible cases
             of primary depression.

          -  Evidence of clinically relevant hypertensive, cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, metabolic
             or hematologic conditions. Specific exclusion will be made for individuals with
             fasting glucose levels &gt;110 mg/dl.

          -  Physical impairment of such severity as to adversely affect the validity of
             psychological testing.

          -  Hostility or refusal to cooperate.

          -  Any prosthetic devices (e.g., pacemaker or surgical clips) that could be affected by
             the magnetic field employed during MRI imaging.

          -  Evidence of cognitive or memory impairment reaching early AD levels at the initial
             evaluation. At baseline, delayed paragraph recall z-scores &gt; 2 below the reference
             group.
