      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone and ketoconazole, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving
      ixabepilone with ketoconazole may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving
      ixabepilone together with ketoconazole and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone in patients
           with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of ixabepilone when administered alone and in combination with
           ketoconazole in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of ixabepilone.

      During course 1, patients receive oral ketoconazole on days 0-5 and ixabepilone IV over 3
      hours on day 1. During course 2 and subsequent courses, patients receive only ixabepilone IV
      over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of ixabepilone during course 1 until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 12 patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
