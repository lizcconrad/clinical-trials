  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the sedating (causing sleepiness) effects
      of risperidone or quetiapine alter cognitive (person's ability to think, perceive, recognize,
      remember, judge, and reason) functioning in subjects with stable Bipolar I Disorder.

      To compare the treatment effects of risperidone and quetiapine on cognitive function, using
      measures commonly believed to be affected by sedation and at doses typically used in clinical
      settings in stable bipolar I outpatients.One-half of patients are randomized to treatment
      sequence risperidone-quetiapine (R-Q), and the other one-half to quetiapine-risperidone
      (Q-R). Patients randomized to R-Q receive 2 mg of risperidone with dinner the night before
      testing and placebo with breakfast on the day of testing. After a 6 - 14 day washout period
      they receive 100 mg quetiapine with dinner the night before their second day of testing and
      100 mg with breakfast the day of testing.

      Those randomized to Q-R receive the same treatments, but in reverse order. Patients
      randomized to R-Q receive 2 mg of risperidone with dinner the night before testing and
      placebo with breakfast on the day of testing. After a 6-14 day washout period they receive
      100 mg quetiapine with dinner the night before their second day of testing and 100 mg with
      breakfast the day of testing. Those randomized to Q-R receive the same treatments, but in
      reverse order.
