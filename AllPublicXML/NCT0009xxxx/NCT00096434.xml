  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with metastatic
      breast cancer. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the tumor response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously
      treated with an anthracycline- and/or taxane-containing regimen receiving sorafenib.

      II. Assess the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine time to
      disease progression and survival time of patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate pre-treatment levels of activated ERK1/2 with tumor response in patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression and then every 3 months for up
      to 5 years.

    <description>A confirmed tumor response is defined to be either a CR or PR noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart. The tumor response rate is defined as the total number of eligible patients who achieved a complete or partial response according to the RECIST criteria divided by the total number of eligible patients enrolled on study. A 90% confidence interval for the true response rate will be constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach.</description>
