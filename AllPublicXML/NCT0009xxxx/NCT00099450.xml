  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to look at the safety and tolerability of the experimental
      drug, how people process the drug, how the drug affects people, and to identify a dose or
      doses to study in subsequent future studies.

      The purposes of this trial are to determine if administration of INS50589 Intravenous
      Infusion is well tolerated, to determine the pharmacological effects of INS50589 at different
      doses, and to identify an appropriate dose for later efficacy studies. More specifically, the
      objectives are to:

        -  Evaluate safety and tolerability

        -  Evaluate pharmacokinetics of INS50589 and its major metabolite(s)

        -  Evaluate effects of INS50589 on platelet function at various dose levels

        -  Evaluate potential relationship between plasma concentrations of INS50589 and various
           pharmacodynamic endpoints

        -  Identify one or more dose levels of INS50589 for future studies
