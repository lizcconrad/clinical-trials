    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alvocidib when given with
      doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent sarcoma that
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride
      and alvocidib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Alvocidib may also help doxorubicin
      hydrochloride work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving more than
      one drug may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol (alvocidib) when administered with a
      fixed dose of doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) in patients with unresectable
      metastatic or locally recurrent sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine,
      preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Correlate pRb, p53, and p21 protein levels with treatment response and apoptosis in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Correlate NMR biochemical patterns with response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of alvocidib.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 5-10 minutes and alvocidib
      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients reaching a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 600 mg/m^2 or
      experiencing cardiotoxicity may receive alvocidib alone at the discretion of the
      investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of alvocidib until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Ten additional patients receive
      treatment at the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
