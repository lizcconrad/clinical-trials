      This trial comprises three studies. In the first two studies, women will be randomly assigned
      to receive either real or sham acupuncture therapy. Study 1 will include women with various
      forms of cancer. White blood cell counts will be used to assess the effects of acupuncture on
      participants' immune responses. Study 2 will include women with unspecified pelvic pain and
      endometriosis; a self-report pain scale will be used to assess the effects of acupuncture on
      participants' symptoms. Study 3 will evaluate the validity and reliability of diagnoses made
      by Chinese medicine practitioners. In this study, a group of Chinese medicine practitioners
      will diagnose the same group of patients; consistency of the diagnoses will be evaluated.
