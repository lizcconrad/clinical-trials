      RATIONALE: Hepatic arterial infusion uses a catheter to deliver anticancer substances
      directly into the liver. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different
      ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving an hepatic arterial infusion of
      melphalan together with hepatic perfusion works in treating patients with unresectable liver
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with unresectable
           primary or metastatic liver cancer treated with intrahepatic arterial infusion of
           melphalan with venous filtration via peripheral hepatic perfusion.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the patterns of recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the filter characteristics including melphalan pharmacokinetics and filtration of
           cytokines and clotting factors during and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to primary tumor histology (neuroendocrine tumor
      vs primary hepatic malignancy vs adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal or other origin).

      Patients undergo peripheral isolated hepatic perfusion in which a catheter is placed via the
      groin into the hepatic artery and another into the hepatic vein. Patients then receive
      melphalan as an intrahepatic arterial infusion over 15-30 minutes. Treatment repeats
      approximately every 3-8 weeks for up to 6 total infusions in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then
      periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 105 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.
