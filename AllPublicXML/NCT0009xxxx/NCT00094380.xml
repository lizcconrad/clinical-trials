  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of a single dose of RG2077 in patients
      with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are currently receiving cyclophosphamide. This
      study will also determine if RG2077 is effective in decreasing disease activity in these
      patients.

      Study hypothesis: CTLA4-Ig mediates a T cell costimulatory blockade that effectively induces
      an antigen-specific nonresponsiveness in T cells.

    <textblock>
      SLE is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disorder that may affect many organ systems,
      including the skin, joints, and internal organs. RG2077 has been studied for use in multiple
      sclerosis, another autoimmune disorder. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      RG2077 in SLE patients who are currently receiving cyclophosphamide.

      This trial is composed of two parts. The first part is a dose-escalation study in which
      participants will receive one of two doses of RG2077 (0.2 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg); this part of the
      study will last 60 days. At screening, patients will have an IV catheter inserted into their
      arms for administration of cyclophosphamide and RG2077. Patients will also have medical and
      medication history assessments, a comprehensive physical exam, and blood and urine tests.
      There are 5 study visits for the first part of the trial; these will occur at screening, at
      study entry, and Days 1, 14, and 28. Selected visits will include physical exam, vital signs
      measurement, blood and urine tests, and disease activity assessment. At Days 7 and 60,
      patients will be contacted by phone to report their medication history and any adverse
      effects they have experienced.

      The second part of the study will evaluate a single 10 mg/kg dose of RG2077; this part of the
      study will last 90 days. In the study, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. At the start of the study, Group 1 participants will receive RG2077 and
      cyclophosphamide and Group 2 participants will receive cyclophosphamide only. There will be 9
      study visits; these will occur at study screening, study entry, and Days 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, and
      60. At selected visits, patients will undergo physical exam, vital signs measurement, blood
      tests and urine tests, and disease activity assessment.

    <description>Three patients will receive a single intravenous infusion of 0.2 mg/kg CTLA4-IgG4m following the scheduled cyclophosphamide infusion on the same day. If one or more dose-limiting toxicities (CTC grade 3 or higher adverse event in the first 28 days after CTLA4-IgG4m administration that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to CTLA4-IgG4m (RG2077)). are observed, enrollment in the trial will be suspended pending DSMB review. If no dose-limiting toxicity is observed in the 0.2mg/kg dose, three patients will receive a single intravenous infusion of 2 mg/kg of CTLA4-IgG4m following the scheduled cyclophosphamide infusion on the same day. If one or more dose-limiting toxicities are observed, enrollment will be suspended pending review by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).If no dose-limiting toxicity is observed in the 2 mg/kg dose, treatment of patients with 10 mg/kg of CTLA4-IgG4m in combination with cyclophosphamide will proceed.</description>
