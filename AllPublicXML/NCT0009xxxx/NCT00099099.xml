  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is one of three CALERIE trials that test the hypothesis that a reduced calorie,
      nutritionally sound diet increases the length of life and prevents some age-related chronic
      diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The three sites that are
      participating in the CALERIE trial represent a diversity of subject populations and
      interventional strategies.

      Researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts
      University are enrolling overweight men and women aged 20-42 in a 1-year study to develop an
      effective calorie restricted regimen that minimizes hunger and prevents weight regain. The
      study also examines the effects of weight loss on body composition, metabolism and aging. Two
      different diets containing usual foods and a healthy balance of nutrients will be tested at 2
      levels of caloric restriction, 10% and 30% (in other words, 90% or 70% of what one would
      normally eat). Weight loss is expected for most volunteers participating in this study, but
      cannot be guaranteed.
