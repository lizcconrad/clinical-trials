    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an investigational drug versus
      placebo in the treatment of metastatic bone cancer pain in patients diagnosed with breast or
      prostate cancer and a bone neoplasm. Patients in the study will be taking opioids to treat
      moderate to severe pain for their bone metastases and will remain on their opioids during the
      entire course of the study.
