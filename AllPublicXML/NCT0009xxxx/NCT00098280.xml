  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of the experimental drug eculizumab in
      treating patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare disorder of red
      blood cells that leads to premature destruction of the cells and resulting anemia. Patients
      may be at high risk of blood clots and may develop bone marrow failure or aplastic anemia,
      with low white blood cell and platelet counts. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may
      help improve the survival of red blood cells.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with PNH who require blood transfusions for anemia and
      have received at least four transfusions in the 12 months preceding evaluation for this study
      may be eligible to enroll. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical
      examination, and check of vital signs.

      Participants have an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood and urine tests, and are vaccinated
      against Neisseria meningitides, a common bacteria that can cause a disabling or fatal type of
      meningitis. They then enter an observation phase of the study, with monthly visits during
      which they complete a questionnaire; update their health status, transfusion record, and
      medication use; have their vital signs checked and PNH symptoms evaluated; have blood and
      urine tests; and receive a transfusion, if necessary. These visits continue for up to 3
      months until patients receive a &quot;qualifying&quot; transfusion; that is, a transfusion given as a
      consequence of a certain hemoglobin level with symptoms or a different level without
      symptoms.

      Patients are then randomly assigned to receive either eculizumab or a placebo (salt solution
      with no active ingredient). Both study medications are given intravenously (through a vein)
      over 30 minutes once a week for five doses and then once every 2 weeks for another 11 doses.
      At each treatment visit (study weeks 0-24), patients update their health status, transfusion
      records, and medication use; have their vital signs checked; and provide a blood sample. At
      various visits, they also complete a questionnaire, provide a urine sample and have an EKG.
      At the last treatment visit (week 26 or the final visit for patients who end their
      participation before visit 18) patients have a complete physical examination in addition to
      the procedures listed above.

    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder of the hematopoietic
      stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis.
      The clinical features of PNH result from the lack of one or more of the GPI-linked proteins
      that serve to protect cells from autologous complement mediated attack. Two such proteins,
      CD55 (decay accelerating factor) and CD59 (reactive lysis inhibitor) have been shown to be
      absent from PNH erythrocytes and platelets as well as other cell types.

      Evidence strongly suggests that lack of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 is responsible
      for the sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes and platelets to the effects of autologous
      complement. Since the pathogenesis of PNH is due to the inability of PNH red cells and
      platelets to inhibit the activation of terminal complement, it is logical to hypothesize that
      a terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop the intravascular hemolysis, obviate
      or lessen the need for transfusions, and possibly decrease the propensity of life threatening
      thrombosis. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that like CD59 inhibits terminal
      complement.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study of
      eculizumab or placebo administered intravenously to approximately 75 PNH patients. The study
      is designed to evaluate the safety of eculizumab in transfusion dependent patients with
      paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and to determine if the administration of this
      terminal complement inhibitor could provide a safe and effective substitute for CD59
      function.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Screening Period:

        Individuals at least 18 years of age;

        Patients must have required at least 4 episodes of transfusions in the 12 months prior to
        Visit 1 for anemia or anemia-related symptoms;

        Presence of a GPI deficient red blood cell clone (type II cells) by flow cytometry of
        greater than or equal to 10%;

        Patients taking erythropoietin must be on a stable dose for 26 weeks prior to visit 1 and
        the dose must be expected to remain stable during the Observation Period and the Treatment
