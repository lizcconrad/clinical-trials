    <textblock>
      This project seeks to understand how changes in the health of an individual affects the
      economic and social prosperity of the individual, family and community. The study involves
      providing iron supplements to a sample of participants in Central Java Indonesia and
      following those respondents for three years. They are compared with a control group who do
      not receive the supplement.

      The goal of the study is to pin down the causal effect of improvements in health on the
      economic and social prosperity of individuals and their families. Particular attention will
      be paid to the dynamics underlying the effect of health on labor outcomes; older adults are
      more likely to experience transitions in health and economic status and so will be
      emphasized.

      Beginning in 2002, about 4,000 households will be interviewed every four months for about 3
      years. The first two waves of the survey will serve as baselines. After the second wave,
      households will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Iron supplements will be provided
      to all members of households assigned to one of those groups. Household members in the 2nd
      group will receive an identical-looking placebo. Participants will take the supplements (or
      placebo) on a weekly basis for a year. The study will measure the effect of supplementation
      on the well-being of individuals and their families.

      Data will be collected at the individual, household and community level. Individual level
      data will cover time allocation including work and participation in community activities,
      earnings, self-reported and physical health and cognition. All adult household members will
      be interviewed; questions about children will be answered by a caretaker. Data on wealth and
      consumption will be collected at the household level. Community resources, services and
      infrastructure information will be gathered along with detailed price data.
