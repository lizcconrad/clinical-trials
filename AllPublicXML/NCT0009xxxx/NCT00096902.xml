      This study will examine whether certain procedures that do not involve the use of medications
      can reduce symptoms of neurocardiogenic syncope (SIN-ku-pe), or a condition involving
      recurrent fainting. This condition is also known as vasovagal syncope or neurally mediated
      hypotension. Neurocardiogenic syncope is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system, which
      controls automatic body functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating. That
      system can be affected by medications, conditions of the mind or body, and by a person's
      surroundings. Researchers in this study wish to learn whether hypnosis, hand exercises,
      education, or diary keeping can affect the autonomic nervous system and improve symptoms of
      neurocardiogenic syncope.

      Patients age 18 or older who have neurocardiogenic syncope may be eligible for this study.
      Those who have a medical illness making it unsafe to participate, who cannot discontinue
      certain medications, or who are pregnant are not eligible. Patients will undergo a medical
      history and physical examination, complete a questionnaire, and experience Valsalva and tilt
      table tests. These tests will take about 5 hours during 1 to 2 days.

      The Valsalva test evaluates some of the reflexes of autonomic nervous system. Patients will
      lie flat on a padded table and have sensors placed on the body, to measure blood pressure,
      breathing rate, and other functions. They will blow into a sterile tube for 12 seconds while
      the body's responses are measured. The procedure may need to be repeated several times.
      During the test, an intravenous tube, guided by a needle, will be placed in the patient's
      arm. The tube will be used to collect samples of blood (less than 7 tablespoons) to measure
      chemicals such as adrenaline. For the tilt table test, a patient will lie on a padded,
      motorized table and have sensors placed on the body. Velcro straps will be placed around the
      patient's body to help hold him/her on the table. Then the table will tilt the patient from a
      flat position to an upright one in about 10 seconds. The patient will stay upright for 45
      minutes while symptoms are monitored, measurements are taken, and blood samples are collected
      through the intravenous tube. Then the table will be returned to the flat position. If the
      patient faints or is about to faint, or if he or she has an unsafe heart rhythm before the 45
      minutes is over, the test will be stopped and the table will be returned to the flat
      position. Symptoms will be treated as needed.

      Patients who qualify for further study will then become familiar with hypnosis and be
      evaluated for their natural ability for experiencing it. A professionally trained doctor will
      guide patients into a hypnotic state, and patients will be asked to respond to various
      suggestions. They will be videotaped, an activity that will require a separate consent form.
      Following these procedures, patients will be assigned to one of the four groups in this
      study. Those in the hypnosis group will have weekly sessions for 6 weeks, with each session
      lasting about 1-1/2 hours. The education group will meet a study investigator for learning
      about syncope and the autonomic nervous system, with each session lasting about 1-1/2 hours
      once a week for 6 weeks. The hand exercise group will be taught certain hand exercises to
      perform, at home and as instructed, for 6 weeks. The diary group will receive instructions on
      keeping a diary pertaining to their condition, at home, for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, patients
      will return for an evaluation to include completion of questionnaires and another tilt table
      test and blood collection by intravenous tube. This entire study will take about 8 weeks.
      There may be direct benefits from participating in this study. The experimental procedures
      may help patients' neurocardiogenic syncope.

      After completing this study, patients will be offered any or all of the experimental
      procedures tested in this study upon their request and at the discretion of the principal
      investigator. For example, a patient who is assigned to the diary group may be offered
      hypnosis, education, and hand exercise instruction after completion of the study.

      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to test the efficacy of non-pharmacologic
      interventions for recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope. Specifically, the interventions tested
      in this study are hypnosis, patient education, hand exercises, and diary-keeping.

      Study Population: Subjects are patients ages 18 years or older with recurrent
      neurocardiogenic syncope or presyncope.

      Design: Patients who have a positive screening tilt table test are assigned to one of four
      groups: hypnosis, patient education, hand exercises, or diary-keeping. Following 6 weeks of
      outpatient intervention, all patients undergo repeat tilt table testing to complete the
      study.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is occurrence of syncope or presyncope during
      upright tilt table testing. Secondary measures are hemodynamic and neurochemical parameters
      during upright tilt table testing, and quality of life measures including recurrence of
      outpatient syncopal episodes.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are patients referred for neurocardiogenic syncope or presyncope, with or without
        postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Patients enter the trial after positive tilt table
        testing during the screening evaluation. Participation is offered to individuals 18 years
        old or older, independently of gender, race, advanced age, ethnicity, religion, or any
        other demographic or sociopolitical classifications.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Minors younger than 18 years old are excluded. Advanced age is not an exclusion criterion.

        Patients who have certain illnesses that would interfere or be contraindicated with the
        interventions or procedures in this study are excluded. These include significant coronary
        artery disease, psychosis, or psychotic depression.

        A candidate is excluded if the subject is unwilling to experience hypnosis or to have
        hypnosis sessions recorded; holds religious or other beliefs that would prevent engagement
        in hypnosis; is not fluent in spoken English; or has physical or other disabilities that
        prevent adequate participation in hypnotic susceptibility testing.

        Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements are known or suspected to interfere with
        the experimental results, and such herbal medicines or dietary supplements must be
        discontinued before enrollment in the study. For many herbal medicines or dietary
        supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the possible effects on the
        experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish to continue their herbal
        medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the available medical
        literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to interfere with the
        experimental results, then the subjects may participate.

        A candidate is excluded if clinical considerations require that the patient continue
        treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results. Patients who cannot
        discontinue medications in the following categories are excluded: certain
        anti-hypertensives including beta-blockers, anticoagulants, tricyclic antidepressants,
        barbiturates, and acetaminophen. Patients unable to discontinue nicotine, caffeine, or
        alcohol for 24 hours prior to tilt table testing are excluded. Patients with chronic
        alcohol intake are excluded. Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the
        patient or the patient's doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator, Accountable
        Investigator, an Associate Investigator, or Research Nurse. If it is decided that
        discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded.

        Patients who pose technical difficulties regarding the testing procedures are excluded.

        A candidate is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, Accountable
        Investigator, or Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at
        substantially increased acute medical risk, or if the medical risk outweighs the potential
        scientific benefit.
