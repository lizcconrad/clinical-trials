      The primary objective of this clinical research study is to assess the safety and efficacy of
      rFIX for a minimum of 6 months in previously treated patients (PTPs) with hemophilia B (FIX:C
      ≤2%) during standard-of-care treatment (on-demand, prophylaxis, and through major and minor
      surgical procedures).
