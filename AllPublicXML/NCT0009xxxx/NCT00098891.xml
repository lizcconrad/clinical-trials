  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining MS-275 with isotretinoin in treating
      patients who have metastatic or advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. MS-275 may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Isotretinoin may
      help cancer cells develop into normal cells. MS-275 may increase the effectiveness of
      isotretinoin by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. MS-275 and isotretinoin may
      also stop the growth of solid tumors or lymphomas by stopping blood flow to the cancer.
      Combining MS-275 with isotretinoin may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of MS-275 when
      administered with isotretinoin in patients with metastatic, progressive, refractory, or
      unresectable solid tumors or lymphomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of MS-275.

      Patients receive oral MS-275 once on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral isotretinoin twice daily on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      Patients are followed monthly.
