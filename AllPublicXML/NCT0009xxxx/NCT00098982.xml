      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also help the chemotherapy drugs work better by
      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Giving bortezomib with fluorouracil,
      leucovorin, and oxaliplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when
      given with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in treating patients with advanced or
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when
           administered with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin in patients with
           advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15; oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on days 1 and 15; and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 22
      hours on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients receive treatment at the
      MTD to a maximum of 12 patients at that dose level.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or start of a new anticancer
      treatment.
