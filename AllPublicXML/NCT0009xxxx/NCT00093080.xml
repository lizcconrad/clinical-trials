        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥15 years of age with metastatic and/or unresectable sarcomas of the
             following histological subgroups: Bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcoma and Ewings

             months

          -  Presence of at least one measurable lesion that: Can be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension with longest diameter ≥20 mm using conventional techniques or ≥10
             mm with spiral computerized tomography (CT) scan (or otherwise at least twice the
             reconstruction interval for CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scans)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Prior therapy with rapamycin, rapamycin analogues or tacrolimus

          -  Prior anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal, immunotherapy,
             biological response modifiers, signal transduction inhibitors, etc) within 4 weeks
             prior to the first dose of ridaforolimus

          -  Ongoing toxicity associated with prior anticancer therapy (except peripheral
             neuropathy of ≤ grade 1 by National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity criteria)

          -  Another primary malignancy within the past three years (except for non-melanoma skin
             cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ)

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 (Tween) or
             any other excipient contained in the study drug

          -  Known Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin,
             erythromycin, azithromycin)

          -  Significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             ridaforolimus

          -  Concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than prescribed
             corticosteroids at stable doses for 2 weeks prior to first planned dose of study drug

          -  Inadequate recovery from any prior surgical procedure or having undergone any major
             surgical procedure within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of ridaforolimus

          -  Presence of any other life-threatening illness or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would either compromise the patient's safety or
             interfere with evaluating the safety of the study drug
