  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain initial safety and efficacy data on the experimental
      agent REN-1654 in patients with painful post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study.
      After screening and baseline clinical assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive 30 or 100 mg REN-1654 by mouth (p.o.), or matching placebo, once daily for 3 weeks.
      After 3 weeks of treatment, the clinical assessments will be repeated. Subjects who complete
      the 3 week placebo-controlled segment may enter the 3-week active-treatment extension
      segment, during which subjects in the REN-1654 30 mg group will remain on that dose, subjects
      who were given placebo in the previous segment will receive REN-1654 100 mg daily, and
      subjects who received REN 1654 100 mg in the first 3 week study segment will discontinue
      dosing. Double-blind conditions will be maintained through the placebo-controlled active
      treatment period (primary efficacy endpoint) and for those continuing dosing into the 3-week
      second active treatment period. The clinical assessments will be repeated at the end of 6
      weeks, after which all subjects will discontinue treatment and return 2 weeks later for the
      final clinical assessment.

             pain intensity rating scales.

          3. History of herpes zoster cutaneous rash, followed by persistent pain for 2 to 18
             months after the onset of the rash until the time of dosing with study medication.

          4. A screening Daily Spontaneous Pain Rating (for the prior 24-hour period) of at least
             4, using an 11-point categorical pain intensity scale with 0 as &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 as
             &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;.

          5. A positive (non-zero) Evoked Allodynia score reported at the time of screening using
             the categorical pain intensity scale in response to at least one of two stimuli: light
             stroking with a foam brush, or #14 von Frey hair stimulation.

          6. Subjects who are compliant in maintaining a Pain Diary between the screening and
             baseline visits, and who record a Daily Spontaneous Pain Rating score of 4 or greater
             on at least 3 days during the week prior to the baseline visit.

          7. Subjects who at screening are taking analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
             anxiolytics, or muscle relaxants, must have been on each such medication for 4 weeks,
             and at stable doses for 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit, and must be maintained on
             the same doses throughout the study.

          8. Subjects who at screening are receiving adjunctive analgesic therapy such as
             acupuncture or biofeedback should either discontinue it or establish a schedule of
             treatments that will remain consistent for 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit, and
             throughout the study.

          9. Subjects who agree to discontinue topical pain treatments at least 2 weeks before the
             baseline visit, and agree not to use them during the study.

         10. Subjects who agree that they will not receive local, regional or spinal (articular,
             epidural, or intrathecal) injections of medication for pain treatments within 2 weeks
             prior to the baseline visit and through the end of the study.

         11. If female, must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, not currently pregnant
             (verified by a screening pregnancy test) or nursing, and using a reliable
             contraception method such as intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal birth control pills,
             or double-barrier method (male condom, female condom or diaphragm with spermicidal
             jelly).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of peripheral neuropathy or any chronic pain condition other than PHN.

          2. History of hepatic, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematological,
             neurological, endocrine (including diabetes), metabolic, pulmonary, immunologic
             (including HIV) or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             pose a significant safety risk for a subject exposed to an investigational compound
             such as REN-1654, or could significantly diminish the quality of the efficacy data to
             be collected in the study.

          3. History of the following ophthalmic disorders based upon medical review at the
             screening visit. Subjects will further undergo a screening ophthalmologic assessment.
             Should any of the following be identified at the screening ophthalmologic examination,
             the subject will be excluded from the study.

               -  Symptomatic cataract, resulting in any visual impairment (if a subject has been
                  diagnosed with cataract to a degree that the cataract interferes with daily
                  living and/or regarding which an ophthalmologist has recommended cataract
                  surgery);

               -  Other vision-impairing disorders (if a subject is aware of any eye disorder that
                  has impaired vision, such as age-related macular degeneration, lazy eye
                  (amblyopia), double vision or any optic nerve inflammation); presbyopia and other
                  non-pathological visual acuity deficits are not exclusionary;

                  herpes zoster ophthalmicus causing inflammation of any part of the eye
                  [conjunctiva, cornea, iris, retina, optic nerve]; subjects who only had cutaneous
                  herpes zoster involvement of the eyelid without involvement of the eye may be
                  eligible for the study).

               -  Glaucoma or history of ocular hypertension (intraocular pressures greater than 21
                  mm Hg).

          4. Cognitive or psychiatric disorders that may diminish compliance with study procedures,
             including maintenance of a daily pain diary and accurate dosing of study medication.

          5. Screening liver enzyme results greater than the upper limit of the normal range (a
             value less than one multiple above the upper limit of normal may be acceptable, if
             approved by the Sponsor before enrollment of the subject).
