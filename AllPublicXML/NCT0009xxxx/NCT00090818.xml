      This study will screen patients for eligibility in studies sponsored by the Craniofacial
      Genetics Section (HCGS), the Clinical Research Core (CRC), and other branches located within
      the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). It will also evaluate
      patients with diseases or abnormalities of the oral cavity or craniofacial complex, or both,
      for future protocol development. HCGS and CRC study the natural history of oral diseases and
      systemic diseases that are manifested in the maxillofacial region-the upper jaw and face.
      Among the diseases are lichen planus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and premalignant oral
      leukoplakia. Researchers also study certain acquired diseases and genetic diseases. Because
      many of the diseases of the maxillofacial region are poorly defined, the evaluation and
      characterization of patients with such diseases are goals of investigation.

      Patients of any age, gender, and racial and ethnic group who have oral diseases or systemic
      diseases of the upper jaw and face may be eligible for the study. Women of childbearing
      potential, or who are pregnant or lactating, may be eligible; they would undergo procedures
      and tests or receive medications posing a minimal risk to the fetus or child.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures:

        -  Complete medical history and physical examination, including a thorough examination of
           the head and neck; detailed examination of the teeth and gums may or may not be
           necessary.

        -  Tests of blood, urine, stool; tests for pregnancy and HIV when needed; and tests for
           cultures, fungi, bacteria, and parasites.

        -  Sampling of blood and oral tissues for diagnosis, treatment response, and disease
           progression.

        -  Electrocardiogram, x-ray, and imaging procedures, including imaging of the face.

      Biopsies may be performed as needed for diagnosis and to guide therapy. The type, number,
      location, and frequency of biopsies depend on several factors, including the nature of the
      disease being evaluated. Local anesthesia is typically used unless there are
      contraindications. Some biopsies are done with disposable, 2 to 3 mm, round, sharp metal
      punches. Larger excisions with the use of an appropriate blade may be necessary for proper
      evaluation of a patient's condition or complete removal of something that is abnormal. The
      risks and discomfort associated with any of the interventions include mild pain, bleeding,
      and infection; there may be temporary facial paralysis, bruising, and allergic reactions.

      Supportive care will be given as needed, according to the patient's diagnosis, treatment, and
      clinical information. Disease-related or drug-related complications, or both, will be managed
      through collaboration with the patient's referring physician.

      The purpose of this clinical research protocol is twofold: 1) to screen patients for protocol
      eligibility for those sponsored primarily by the Craniofacial Genetics Section, the Clinical
      Research Core and other Branches located within the National Institute of Dental and
      Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) as appropriate and 2) to evaluate patients with diseases or
      abnormalities of the oral cavity and/or craniofacial complex for future protocol development.
      Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to standard
      procedures and therapeutic modalities. No procedures will be done for research only. Standard
      or experimental biochemical, genetic and proteomic tests may be conducted on tissue or blood
      samples collected for diagnosis. Eligible patients will be referred to appropriate NIDCR
      clinical research protocols for further protocol-driven diagnostic workup and therapy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients of any age, gender, and racial/ethnic group with oral diseases or systemic
        diseases with maxillofacial manifestations that are mission relevant for the Craniofacial
        Genetics Section, the Clinical Research Core and other branches located within the NIDCR.

        Women of childbearing potential, or who are pregnant or lactating will only undergo tests
        and procedures, and/or receive medications for which data exists proving minimal risk to
        the fetus and/or child. Only diagnosis without radiographs will be performed.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with significant cognitive impairment.

        Pregnant patients or lactating patients, if this status precludes proposed diagnostic
        procedures or therapies because of known untoward effects on mother and/or child.
