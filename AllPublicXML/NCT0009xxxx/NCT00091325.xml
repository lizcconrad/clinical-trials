      RATIONALE: Green tea extract (Polyphenon E) contains ingredients that may prevent the
      development of cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well green tea extract works in preventing cancer
      in healthy participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) on cytochrome P450 enzyme
           activities and glutathione S-transferase activities and levels in healthy participants.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Participants receive oral green tea extract (Polyphenon E) once daily for 4 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Participants are followed for 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 participants will be accrued for this study.
