    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin, an
      unapproved drug, compared to rosiglitazone in lowering overall blood glucose levels in people
      with type 2 diabetes who have not previously been treated with drug therapy to lower their
      blood sugar.
