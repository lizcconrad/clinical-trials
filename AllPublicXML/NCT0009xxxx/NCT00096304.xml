      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin and docetaxel, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one
      drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of epirubicin when
      given with docetaxel in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

               -  Objective evidence of increase &gt; 20% in the sum of the longest diameters of
                  target lesions from the time of maximal regression OR the appearance of 1 or more
                  new lesions
