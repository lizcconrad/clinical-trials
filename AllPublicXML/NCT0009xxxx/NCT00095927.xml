  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called Amifostine as a treatment for squamous cell
      carcinoma in the head and/or neck area.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amifostine is a drug that is used to treat moderate to severe xerostomia (dry mouth) for
      those who receive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. It was approved by the FDA for
      use intravenously. This study plans to examine the effects of xerostomia when Amifostine is
      used subcutaneously (by injection). Amifostine has been seen to be effective when used to
      combat the effects of dry mouth, but also has some side effects which are listed later in
      this consent form.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of twice a day radiation therapy
      given with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel (Taxo 1). This study will
      examine the effectiveness of adding Amifostine in the hopes of reducing the side effects of
      radiation.
