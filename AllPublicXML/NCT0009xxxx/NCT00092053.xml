      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug
      in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The primary hypothesis of this study is that in
      postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, oral monthly ibandronate, at doses of 100 mg and 150
      mg, does not achieve persistence in reduction of bone resorption throughout the monthly
      dosing interval, as demonstrated by a larger change in the serum carboxyterminal crosslinked
      telopeptide of Type I collagen (CTX-I) log-transformed fraction from baseline four weeks post
      dose compared to one week post dose, during the third month of treatment, in the participants
      taking ibandronate than in the participants taking placebo.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: -postmenopausal for at least 3 years, with osteoporosis at any of the
        following sites: [BMD &gt; 2.0 standard deviations below young normal mean bone mass for the
        hip trochanter, PA lumbar spine (L1 to L4), total hip, or femoral neck based on the
        normative database provided by each individual manufacturer].

          -  willing to take study-supplied calcium and vitamin D supplement (or equivalent) and to
             discontinue any non-study calcium supplements for run-in period and the duration of
             the study. Exclusion Criteria: -pregnant or lactating, or of childbearing potential.

             problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose
             malabsorption.

          -  an abnormality of the esophagus which delays esophageal emptying such as stricture or

             transplantation; or other significant end organ diseases (genitourinary,
             cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, psychiatric, renal, hematologic, or pulmonary).

          -  history of or evidence of metabolic bone disease (other than postmenopausal bone
             loss).

          -  clinical fracture in the past year.

          -  is receiving or has received treatment prior to randomization which might influence
             bone turnover.

          -  is receiving or expected to receive during the course of the study any medication
             (other than study medication) which might alter bone or calcium metabolism, including
             Vitamin A in excess of 10,000 IU per day or Vitamin D in excess of 5000 IU per day,
             calcitonin, phenytoin, heparin, or lithium.
