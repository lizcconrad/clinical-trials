  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a multi-national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group study to evaluate the effectiveness of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in
      approximately 500 patients with chronic angina who remain symptomatic despite daily treatment
      with the maximum labeled dose of amlodipine (10 mg daily), a calcium channel blocker approved
      for the treatment of chronic angina. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive
      ranolazine 1000 mg or placebo twice daily, in addition to a daily dose of 10 mg of
      amlodipine. Participation in the study will last approximately 3 months.

        Eligible patients must have a diagnosis of chronic angina, with documented evidence of
        coronary artery disease or prior myocardial infarction, in addition to other study entry
        criteria. Prior to entering the study, patients will be required to have had at least two
