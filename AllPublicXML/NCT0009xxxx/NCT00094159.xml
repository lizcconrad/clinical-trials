  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether SNS-595 given intravenously weekly for 3
      weeks is safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Other objectives of this study include measuring pharmacokinetics (how long the drug can be
      measured in the blood) and determining the dose and dose schedule for the next phase of
      studies with SNS-595.
