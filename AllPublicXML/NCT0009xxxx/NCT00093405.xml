      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      the enzymes necessary for their growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
      works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in patients
           with metastatic papillary or clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor c-met expression with response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to histology
      (papillary vs clear cell).

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 60-90 minutes on
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-74 patients (12-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 6-20 months (clear cell stratum) and 2-5 years (papillary stratum).
