  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy together with oxaliplatin
      and fluorouracil followed by gemcitabine works in treating patients with locally advanced,
      unresectable pancreatic cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine, work
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oxaliplatin
      may also make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving radiation therapy
      with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the 1-year survival rate in patients with locally advanced, unresectable
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with concurrent external beam radiotherapy,
      oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil followed by gemcitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine overall survival, time to disease progression, and confirmed response rate in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5.5 weeks. Beginning
      concurrently with radiotherapy, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15,
      and 29 and fluorouracil IV continuously for 5.5 weeks. Beginning 4-6 weeks after the
      completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Treatment with gemcitabine repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

    <description>1-year survival will be considered &quot;success&quot;. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. If more than 1 patients is lost to follow-up, we will use Kaplan-Meier estimates for the 6-month and 12-month overall survival rates. 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
