  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label extension study. Subjects who have completed treatment in
      the parent study of pertuzumab, either alone or with a combination agent, and who received at
      least one dose of pertuzumab in the parent study are eligible for inclusion in this trial if
      they are continuing to receive clinical benefit.

    <description>A best overall response could occur at any time during the study and was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs and normalization of tumor marker level. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs.</description>

          -  Ongoing corticosteroid use (except for subjects who are on stable doses of &lt; 20 mg of
             prednisone daily [or equivalent] or who are taking corticosteroids for reasons other

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progressive Disease (PD)</title>
          <description>A best overall response could occur at any time during the study and was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs and normalization of tumor marker level. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs.</description>
