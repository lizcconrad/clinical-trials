      This project will evaluate the benefit of an enhanced social development program in grades
      3-6 to decrease the onset of risky behaviors in pre-adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Educational programs to promote the adoption of healthy behaviors and to decrease the onset
      of risky behaviors in pre-adolescents are far more likely to be successful than attempts to
      alter established patterns of high-risk behaviors. The project involves an evaluation of a
      comprehensive 4-year elementary school prevention initiative starting in 3rd grade. The
      prevention initiative, grounded in social cognitive, influence, and development theories is
      embedded within a pre-existing comprehensive elementary school social development program and
      will employ an evidence-based social skills curriculum (PATHS) in selected schools. The aim
      of the program is to teach children to use problem-solving and communication skills to
      negotiate and prevent high-risk behaviors.

      Students attending schools that will receive the enhanced social development program will be
      compared to students attending schools that will receive the current, standard social
      development curriculum. The study hypothesizes that students who participate in the 4-year
      enhanced social development program will self-report fewer risk behaviors when surveyed by
      the school system in grades 6-8.
