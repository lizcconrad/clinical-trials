      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and temozolomide, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Temozolomide may help
      irinotecan kill more tumor cells by making them more sensitive to the drug. Cefixime may be
      effective in preventing diarrhea that is caused by treatment with irinotecan.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan when
      given together with temozolomide and cefixime in treating young patients with recurrent or
      resistant neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral irinotecan when administered with
           fixed-dose temozolomide and cefixime in pediatric patients with recurrent or resistant
           high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate UGT1A1 genotype with the occurrence of dose-limiting diarrhea in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate BCRP genotype with pharmacokinetic phenotype in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate p53 status in tumor cells with response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of irinotecan.

      Patients receive oral cefixime once daily beginning 5 days before the start of fixed-dose
      temozolomide and irinotecan and continuing for the duration of the study. Patients also
      receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 and oral irinotecan once daily on days 1-5
      and 8-12. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A maximum of 12 patients are treated at the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed for toxicity, response, and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.25
      years.
