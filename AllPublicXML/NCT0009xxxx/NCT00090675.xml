      In this Phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, maintenance study, 300 subjects with advanced
      or metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Stage IIIB {T4-pleural effusion} and IV)
      who have SD or objective tumor response immediately following the completion of 4-6 cycles of
      front line, platinum-based, doublet chemotherapy will be randomized in a double-blind manner
      to receive either ZD1839 or placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must sign Informed Consent

          -  Females and males aged 18 years and over.

          -  Confirmed stage IIIB (T4-pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC.

          -  Either complete response, partial response, or stable disease following at least 4
             cycles (3 in the setting of intolerable toxicity) but no more than 6 cycles of
             definitive front line, platinum-based, doublet chemotherapy.

          -  No prior EGFR therapy

          -  No newly diagnosed intracerebral metastases while receiving or after completing
             chemotherapy

          -  At least 3 weeks (21 days) but no more than 4 weeks (28 days) since last dose of
             chemotherapy

          -  Must be completely healed from previous major oncologic surgery

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to ZD1839 or any of the excipients of these products.

          -  Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease (subjects with chronic,
             stable, radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded).

          -  Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ.

          -  Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 2
             from previous anticancer therapy excluding peripheral neuropathy or alopecia.

          -  Evidence of any significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it
             undesirable for the subject to participate in the study.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding (women of child bearing potential). Women of childbearing
             potential must practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy.

          -  Treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days before Day 1 of
             study treatment.

          -  Signs of neurological symptoms consistent with new onset spinal cord compression or
             CNS metastases.

          -  Treatment with any systemic anticancer therapies other than the prescribed protocol
             chemotherapy regimen (refer to Inclusion criterion -). Exception: Palliative
             radiotherapy for symptom relief of lesions present at diagnosis will be allowed;
             however, this radiotherapy must occur prior to completion of pre-study doublet
             chemotherapy.

          -  Males must also be willing to practice acceptable methods of birth control while
             taking the drug to prevent pregnancy of a partner.
