    <textblock>
      This study is one of three CALERIE trials that test the hypothesis that a reduced calorie,
      nutritionally sound diet increases the length of life and prevents some age-related chronic
      diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The three sites that are
      participating in the CALERIE trial represent a diversity of subject populations and
      interventional strategies.

      Animal studies suggest that caloric restriction (CR), or consuming fewer calories, increases
      life span, and also protects against some aging-related disease processes such as
      artherosclerosis and type II diabetes. However, it appears that simply burning more calories
      through physical activity does not increase life span by itself. It is not known how CR
      affects humans, but based on this evidence it appears that the reduced total intake and
      metabolism of food is the main factor, rather than increased exercise alone.

      To test this, volunteers will be placed on a program of either 20% caloric restriction or 20%
      increase of energy expenditure by exercise, or in a control group to be instructed in healthy
      living. All will be evaluated on a number of potential markers of aging, on body composition,
      and on risk factors for artherosclerosis and diabetes.

      Participation in the study will last for 12 months. The Diet group will receive individual
      instruction from a registered dietician. The Exercise group will be given an individualized
      exercise program created by a personal trainer. The Healthy Lifestyle group will be given
      information on how to make healthier choices; both diet and activity will be discussed. All
      participants will be measured every two weeks, and will keep daily food and activity logs.
      All will be seen by a physician and will have lab tests done before beginning the study, at 1
      month, and then 3 month intervals.
