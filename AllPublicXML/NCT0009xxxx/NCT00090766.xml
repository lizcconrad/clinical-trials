    <description>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time. The AUC 0-24 hours is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero through 24 hours after dosing. A compartmental model was used to measure the plasma concentrations of valganciclovir. One participant was not analyzed for this outcome measure as the participant underwent both a kidney and liver transplant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Cytomegalovirus Disease Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is defined as syndrome or tissue invasive disease in which CMV virus was identified in blood, urine, biopsy or other suitable specimen, which could be in conjunction with one or more of the following events: a) CMV syndrome was defined as virus present in blood or other suitable specimen, plus fever, and any of the following: leukopenia, atypical lymphocytosis, thrombopenia or elevated hepatic transaminases (for non-liver recipients). b) The diagnosis of organ specific tissue invasive CMV disease was evidence of CMV in the tissue (CMV inclusion bodies or in situ detection of CMV antigen or DNA), plus signs/symptoms of organ dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Failures</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined as either the development of CMV (viremia, antigenemia or test positive) requiring treatment up to day 100 post-transplant (i.e, while undergoing prophylaxis with valganciclovir up to day 100) or discontinuation of study medication due to lack of efficacy or to toxicity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced Graft Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Graft loss was defined as impairment of organ function to such a degree that the participant died or underwent re-transplantation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Maximum Plasma Concentration of Valganciclovir Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose; 1-3, 3-7, 7-12 hours post dose on any day between Day (D) 7 to D 14; and at Week (W) 6, W 10, and W 14</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) is defined as the maximum observed plasma concentration of Valganciclovir. Participants with kidney, liver and heart transplant were analyzed. One participant was not analyzed for this outcome measure as the participant underwent both a kidney and liver transplant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Elimination Half-Life of Valganciclovir Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose; 1-3, 3-7, 7-12 hours post dose on any day between Day 7 to Day 14; Week 6, Week 10, and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Elimination Half-Life Period is defined as the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by half to its original concentration. One participant was not analyzed for this outcome measure as the participant underwent both a kidney and liver transplant. Here n represents number of participant with specific transplant i.e., kidney, liver, and heart.</description>

        <description>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time. The AUC 0-24 hours is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero through 24 hours after dosing. A compartmental model was used to measure the plasma concentrations of valganciclovir. One participant was not analyzed for this outcome measure as the participant underwent both a kidney and liver transplant.</description>
