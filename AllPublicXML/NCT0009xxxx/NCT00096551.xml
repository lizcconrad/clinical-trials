      Background:

        -  Pox viral vectors can induce a PSA-specific T-cell responses and clinical responses in
           patients with advanced prostate cancer.

        -  Intratumoral vaccines of recombinant fowlpox vectors appear to be more potent in
           inducing antitumor effects than the s.c. route of administration, especially when the
           recombinant rF-vector given intratumorally is preceded by a rV-recombinant given s.c.
           This may be due to:

        -  Making the tumor cell an antigen presenting cell via upregulation of both antigen
           (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules (signal 2).

        -  Making the tumor cell more susceptible to killing via upregulation of ICAM.

        -  The increased expression of perforin in peptide-specific T cells that came into contact
           with the TRICOM-infected targets.

        -  Potentially allowing the immune system to select for other tumor encoded antigens to
           generate a polyvalent immune response.

      Objectives:

        -  1: Safety and feasibility of an intraprostatic vaccine strategy.

        -  2: To assess the change in PSA-specific T-cell response as measured by ELISPOT assay.

        -  2: To evaluate T-cell infiltration histologically in patients who have pre- and
           post-vaccine prostate biopsies.

      Eligibility:

        -  Must have either a) biopsy proven, locally recurrent prostate cancer following local
           radiation as defined by the ASTRO consensus criteria as 3 consecutively rising PSA
           levels or b) have refused or not be candidates for local definitive therapy (surgery or
           radiation therapy) and have clinically progressive disease on androgen deprivation
           therapy (eg. three increases in PSA over nadir, separated by at least one week). For
           patients with previous RT, the biopsy confirming local recurrence must be done at least
           18 months after the completion of RT.

        -  Since this may also generate a systemic immune response, patients with minimal
           extraprostatic disease may be enrolled.

        -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl, AST and ALT&lt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal

      Design:

        -  Dose escalation Phase I design. Each cohort will consist of 3-6 patients, with cohorts 4
           &amp; 5 restricted to include only HLA-A2 + patients; maximum accrual is 30

        -  Patients in all cohorts receive initial priming with rV- PSA(L155)/TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF
           s.c.

        -  The first two cohorts utilize a booster intraprostatic with dose escalation of
           rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM.

        -  Third and fourth cohorts add dose escalations of rF-GM-CSF along with the highest dose
           of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A. Histopathological documentation of prostate cancer confirmed in the Laboratory of
        Pathology at: NIH Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Naval
        Medical Center, or Walter Reed Army Medical Center prior to starting this study. If no
        pathologic specimen is available, patients may enroll with a pathologist's report showing a
        histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer and a clinical course consistent with the disease.

        B. Must have either a) biopsy proven, locally recurrent prostate cancer following local
        radiation or cyrotherapy as defined by the ASTRO consensus criteria as 3 consecutively
        rising PSA levels or b) have refused or not be candidates for local definitive therapy
        (surgery or radiation therapy) and have clinically progressive disease on androgen
        deprivation therapy (e.g., three increases in PSA over nadir, separated by at least one
        week). For patients with previous RT, the biopsy confirming local recurrence must be done
        at least 18 months after the completion of RT.

        Since this may also generate a systemic immune response, patients with minimal
        extraprostatic disease may be enrolled.

        C. Agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for at least 4 months
        following the last vaccine injection.

        D. Life expectancy greater than or equal to 6 months.

        E. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 (see Appendix A).

        F. Recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery, and
        radiation (treatment must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to being eligible for
        the study).

        G. Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy, see Appendix
        D).

        Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3

        Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3

        Lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 500/mm3

        Hgb greater than or equal to 10 Gm/dL

        H. Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):

        -A 24-hour urine collection for baseline to measure creatinine clearance, protein and
        electrolytes. CrCl greater than 60mL/min, proteinuria less than 1000 milligrams per 24
        hours, and no abnormal sediment. Serum creatinine not above normal limits OR creatinine
        clearance on a 24 hour urine collection of greater than 60 mL/min. For patients who are not
        able to obtain an accurate collection, a calculated creatinine clearance and urine analysis
        for protein may be used. Any abnormalities in the sediment or the presence of hematuria
        without a likely underlying cause should prompt the investigator to consider an evaluation
        by a nephrologist or urologist for evidence of underlying renal pathology.

        Patients may be eligible if the underlying cause of the abnormality is determined to be
        non-renal.

        -Hepatic function: Bilirubin equal to 1.5 mg/dL or patients with Gilbert's syndrome, a
        total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL, AST and ALT less than 2.5 times upper
        limit of normal.

        I. No other active malignancies within the past 12 months (with the exception of
        non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the bladder) or life threatening
        illnesses.

        J. Willing to travel to the NIH for follow-up visits.

        K. 18 years of age or greater.

        L. Vaccinia-naive or vaccinia immune.

        M. Able to understand and sign informed consent.

        N. Tested for HLA-A2; however, the results of this test will not affect entry into this
        study. This test may be drawn by the patient's referring physician at the time of referral
        (see Screening Consent for HLA typing). This consent will be mailed to the patient and
        discussed with patient. The signed consent will be signed with a non-family member witness
        and then mailed to the assigned research nurse at the NIH Clinical Center.

        O. Concurrent hormonal therapy will be allowed.

        P. PT / PTT will be drawn prior to any invasive protocol related procedure (i.e., prostate
        biopsy or intraprostatic injection) and standard clinical guidelines followed.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
