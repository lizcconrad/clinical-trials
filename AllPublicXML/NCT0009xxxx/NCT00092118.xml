      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of an approved medication on the
      symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis (an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose
      similar to that found in hay fever except that symptoms persist throughout the year), in
      patients who have a history of perennial allergic rhinitis.

    <time_frame>6 week treatment period (from baseline though the end of week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms score averaged over the 6-week treatment period. The Daytime Nasal Symptoms score was calculated as the average of the 3 individual scores for Congestion, Rhinorrhea, and Sneezing, each rated by patients daily on a 4-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worst)].</description>

    <description>Patients completed the validated, self-administered RQLQ which included 28 items on a 7-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 6 (worst)] across 7 domains: activities, sleep, nonnose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. The scores for each domain were averaged, then scores for the 7 domains were averaged to obtain the overall score.</description>

          <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms score averaged over the 6-week treatment period. The Daytime Nasal Symptoms score was calculated as the average of the 3 individual scores for Congestion, Rhinorrhea, and Sneezing, each rated by patients daily on a 4-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worst)].</description>
          <population>The primary efficacy analyses were performed using a modified intention-to-treat (MITT) approach. All patients with efficacy measurements, both at baseline and during the treatment period were included.</population>
