      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug propranolol in preventing fainting in
      patients with sympathoadrenal imbalance (SAI). SAI is a particular pattern of nervous system
      and chemical responses in which the blood vessels in skeletal muscles do not remain
      constricted appropriately during standing for a long time. This can lower blood pressure and
      cause fainting. Propranolol (InderalÂ® (Registered Trademark)) is a Food and Drug
      Administration-approved drug that belongs to a class of drugs called beta-blockers. These
      drugs slow the heart rate and maintain blood pressure in certain situations.

      Children between 10 and 17 years of age with frequent fainting or near-fainting due to SAI
      may be eligible for this study. Children must experience severe dizzy episodes at least once
      every 2 months or fainting episodes at least once every 4 months. The condition must be
      severe enough to affect the child's quality of life or to have forced the child to alter his
      or her life routines to accommodate to the illness. Screening includes a tilt table test,
      described below, to determine if the child has a particular chemical pattern in the blood.

      Children enrolled in the study take propranolol pills in increasing doses during the first
      week of the study to determine the proper dose for the individual. Then, the drug is stopped
      until the experimental phase of the study begins. In this phase, children are randomly
      assigned to take either propranolol or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient)
      for a maximum of 3 days. On the fourth day, the child undergoes a tilt table test to
      determine whether the treatment affects his or her ability to tolerate tilt. For this test,
      the child lies on a padded table with a motorized tilt mechanism that can move the child from
      a flat position to an upright position in about 10 seconds. The child remains upright for up
      to 40 minutes while the following measurements are taken:

        -  Blood sampling: Blood is drawn through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed in an arm
           vein. This allows repeated sampling without repeated needle sticks. Samples are
           collected before starting the tilt test, about every 4 minutes during the test,
           immediately when a drop in blood pressure is detected or symptoms develop, and after 10
           minutes of recovery lying flat. A maximum of 12 samples are collected for each tilt
           test.

        -  Physiologic measurements: Blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram (EKG) are
           measured continuously during the tilt test session, and blood flows and skin electrical
           conduction are measured intermittently. Blood flow is measured using sensors applied to
           the skin and a blood pressure cuff around the limb. For skin blood flow measurements, a
           laser beam scans the skin surface. The skin electrical conduction test measures how well
           the skin conducts electricity. This is measured through sensors placed on the tips of
           two fingers. Respiration and breathing rate are monitored by an elastic cloth band
           around the chest.

        -  Self-report questionnaires: Patients or their parents complete a questionnaire about the
           child's symptoms before and during treatment.

      The effects of the test drug are allowed to wear off for up to 1 week, after which the entire
      tilt test procedure is repeated. Patients who were given propranolol for the first test
      session take placebo for the repeat session, and those who were given placebo take
      propranolol.

      Objectives: This protocol is to evaluate treatment with oral propranolol for a particular
      form of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), characterized by a neuroendocrine pattern called
      &quot;sympathoadrenal imbalance&quot; (SAI), in children. In SAI, plasma adrenaline levels increase
      progressively and to a greater extent than do norepinephrine levels, before syncope. The SAI
      pattern is associated with skeletal muscle vasodilation. We hypothesize that increased
      occupation of beta-2 adrenoceptors in skeletal muscle by high circulating adrenaline levels
      precipitates the neurocirculatory positive feedback loop that leads to NCS.

      Study Population: Patients 10-17 years old with a history of NCS.

      Design: In a randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we test
      the above hypothesis by using the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol. We
      predict that in patients with previously documented SAI and tilt-evoked NCS, propranolol
      treatment will improve orthostatic tolerance during follow-up tilt table testing.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be whether propranolol therapy can prevent
      tilt induced syncope; or significant hypotension and/or bradycardia preceding development of
      clinical symptoms (greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure or heart rate
      less than 40 beats/min). Secondary dependent measures that will be assessed are occurrence of
      duration of tilt tolerance (if tilt induced symptoms are provoked), hemodynamic and
      neurochemical indices of SAI, and patient questionnaire reports.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are patients referred for evaluation of chronic orthostatic intolerance. Patients
        enter into the therapeutic trial after they are determined to have NCS with SAI in a
        screening evaluation. Participation in this protocol is offered to individuals 10-17 years
        of age, independently of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other demographic or
        sociopolitical classifications. To be eligible to enter this study, the patient must have a
        minimum frequency of pre-syncope of at least 1 event/2 months, or syncope of at least
        once/4 months. The severity of the symptoms should be of such severity as to alter the
        individual's quality of life or routines of life.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: Minors younger than 10 years old and pregnant female subjects between 10 and 17 years
        of age will be excluded.

        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator,
        protocol participation would place the subject at substantially increased acute medical
        risk. This includes the risk associated with air travel to the NIH. A candidate subject is
        excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the medical risk outweighs the
        potential scientific benefit.

        Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are history of asthma or chronic
        obstructive pulmonary disease requiring bronchodilators, hepatic or renal failure,
        atrioventricular block of any degree, bradycardia, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
        severe anemia, psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, insulin-dependent diabetes
        mellitus, or psychiatric disorders requiring continuous drug treatment. Patients with known
        allergy or hypersensitivity to propranolol are excluded from this study. A positive HIV
        test result does not necessarily exclude a patient from participating. If a female subject
        becomes pregnant during the study, she will be excluded from further participation in the
        study.

        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the
        patient continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.
        Patients who must take medications daily in the following categories are excluded:
        anticoagulants, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, aspirin, acetaminophen, insulin,
        and bronchodilators. Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the patient or
        the patient's doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator, an Associated
        Investigator, or Research Nurse. If it is decided that discontinuing medications would be
        unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the study.

        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. For
        many herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while in study, and search the
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.

        Practical Limitations: Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to technically carry
        out the testing procedures are excluded.

        Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating females of child-bearing potential are excluded. A blood
        test pregnancy will be conducted in all females of childbearing potential, before intake
        evaluation and also before each drug treatment phase. During the course of the protocol,
        patients who are of childbearing potential will be advised to practice adequate
        contraception (birth control pills, Depo-Provera, or implanted intrauterine device), if
        sexually active. If during the course of this study, a minor patient is found to have a
        positive pregnancy test, she will be asked confidentially whether she has had any recent
        sexual activity that could have resulted in the test being positive. In agreement with
        current legal statutes, the minor patient will be told confidentially that she is pregnant.
        She will be encouraged to share this information with her parents. By current legal
        statutes, we will not directly divulge this information to her parents. The pregnant minor
        subject will also be told that further participation in the study is a protocol violation
        (because of possible adverse risks to the unborn fetus), and she will be terminated from
        continued participation in the protocol.
