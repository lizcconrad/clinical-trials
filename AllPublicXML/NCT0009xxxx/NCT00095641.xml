      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving capecitabine after surgery may
      kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well capecitabine works in treating patients who
      have undergone surgery for locally recurrent or persistenthead and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine 2-year disease-free survival of patients treated with surgical salvage
           followed by adjuvant low-dose capecitabine for locally recurrent or persistent squamous
           cell carcinoma of the head and neck .

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine 2-year overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine patterns of disease relapse in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine once daily for 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
