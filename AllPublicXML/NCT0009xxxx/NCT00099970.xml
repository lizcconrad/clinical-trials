  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to determine tumor response and preliminary safety of
      a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a cell surface receptor (α5β1 integrin) that
      is required for the establishment of new blood vessels during tumor growth, a process known
      as angiogenesis.

          -  Pretreatment laboratory levels that meet specific criteria.

          -  Signed informed consent, including permission to use protected health information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with M200 or a5b1 inhibitors and murine or chimeric monoclonal
             antibodies.

          -  Prior treatment with DTIC, temozolomide, or other chemotherapeutic regimens.

          -  Known sensitivity to murine proteins or chimeric antibodies or other components of the
             product.

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to screening or 5 half-lives of
             the prior investigational drug (whichever is longer).

          -  Systemic biologic, immunotherapy, and/or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of the first
             dose of M200.

          -  Documented central nervous system (CNS) tumor or CNS metastasis.

          -  History of thromboembolic events and bleeding disorders within the past year.

          -  Medical conditions that may be exacerbated by bleeding.
