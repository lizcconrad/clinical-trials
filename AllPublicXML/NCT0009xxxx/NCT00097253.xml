      The purpose of this study is to examine the body's response to relaxing and stimulating
      fragrances commonly used in aromatherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite aromatherapy's popularity, efficacy data are scant, and potential mechanisms are
      controversial. This randomized controlled trial examined the psychological, autonomic,
      endocrine, and immune consequences of one purported relaxant odor (lavender), one stimulant
      odor (lemon), and a no-odor control (water), before and after a stressor (cold pressor); 56
      healthy men and women were exposed to each of the odors during three separate visits. To
      assess the effects of expectancies, participants randomized to the &quot;blind&quot; condition were
      given no information about the odors they would smell; &quot;primed&quot; individuals were told what
      odors they would smell during the session, and what changes to expect. Experimenters were
      blind.

      In each case we measured several different aspects of the cellular immune response, as well
      as skin barrier repair following tape stripping. This design allowed us to examine the
      ability of the odors to modulate endocrine and immune function, and health-relevant cutaneous
      responses.

    <description>A yellow-tinted cotton ball containing 100 ml of the essential oil or distilled water was taped between the nose and upper lip on top of a piece of surgical tape; use of the barrier tape avoided percutaneous absorption . This method provided continuous and uniform exposure across subjects that would not have been possible with ambient room inhalation, and helped maintain experimenter blindness.</description>
