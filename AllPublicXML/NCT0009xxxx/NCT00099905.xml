    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of three doses of
      vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to placebo in lowering overall blood glucose
      levels in people with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously treated with drug therapy
      to lower their blood sugar.
