    <textblock>
      This is an open label study of mepolizumab 750 mg intravenous in those subjects who
      participated in study 100185 to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of mepolizumab in
      subjects with hypereosinophilic syndrome. The study will also evaluate the optimal dosing
      frequency for clinical use, the effects on corticosteroid reduction, and decrease of signs
      and symptoms of Hypereosinophilic Syndrome.

    <time_frame>up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The criteria for eosinophil count was achieved if the participant's eosinophil count remained below &lt;600 cell/uL for the last observation on study i.e. within length of dosing cycle + 7 days of last dose of study drug. For participants who entered in Stage 1, HES medications taking prior to the first infusion date in Stage 2 were considered as the lowest background therapy. For participants who entered in Stage 2, HES medications taken on the date that immediately preceded the first infusion date of study drug and had not been discontinued was regarded as the lowest background therapy. If the dose of the lowest background therapy had increased or the medication had changed or the participant had not reached their lowest background therapy, the participant was regarded as not achieving this endpoint.</description>

          <description>Participants received mepolizumab 750 mg by intravenous (IV) infusion monthly in Stage 1 along with concomitant hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)-active medications that included prednisone (or equivalent) or other HES therapies. In Stage 2, the dosing intervals were optimized for each participant based on the individual’s blood eosinophil count and the clinical presentation. In Stage 3, the dosing frequency established in Stage 2 was continued with individual participant monitoring.</description>

Duration of doses &lt;= 10 mg were determined by examining changes in the prednisone dosing or allowable alternative corticosteroid medication (prednisone equivalents). Start and stop dates of other HES medications were checked to ensure that they did not overlap with the steroid dosing dates. If overlap occurred, then the number of days &lt;=10 mg during this overlap was considered as zero and the cumulative days reset to zero, as the endpoint was assessing prednisone dose as sole background therapy. The dosing criteria for this endpoint was considered as achieved if the duration of dosing was minimum of 84 days (3months).</description>

        <description>The pruritus visual analogue scale asks participants to rate the status of their Pruritus based on the severity of their itch. Scores range from 0-100 with 0 = No itch and 100 = Worst imaginable itch. Change from Baseline in pVAS score is the difference between the pVAS score at the time point being considered to the MHE100901 Baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life (QoL) and Current Health Status: Physical Summary Score of the Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) 3 Months After the Start of Study MHE100901 and Every 6 Months Thereafter</title>
        <description>The SF-12v2 is the 12 item abbreviated form of SF-36v2 survey . It provides information about how participants feel, and how well they have been able to perform their usual activities, over the past 4 weeks. SF-12v2 questions make up 8 scales: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, Mental Health . Transformed physical component summary score (PCS-12) is derived using all the 12 items and scored onto a 0-100 scale such that a higher score indicates a better health state and better functioning. Change from Baseline in scale or summary measure score is the difference between the score at the time point being analyzed to Baseline.</description>

In Stage 2, the dosing intervals were optimized for each participant based on the individual’s blood eosinophil count and the clinical presentation. In Stage 3, the dosing frequency established in Stage 2 was continued with individual participant monitoring.</description>
