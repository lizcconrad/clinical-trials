      RATIONALE: Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above
      body temperature. Using MRI to measure heat may help to determine the effectiveness of
      hyperthermia therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining hyperthermia with radiation
      therapy and chemotherapy before surgery may kill more tumor cells and shrink the tumor so
      that it can be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of hyperthermia when given
      together with radiation therapy and optional chemotherapy and to see how well they work in
      treating patients who are undergoing surgery for soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and accuracy of real time magnetic resonance-based
           non-invasive thermometry in patients with grade 2 or 3 soft tissue sarcoma of the
           extremity receiving combination hyperthermia, radiotherapy, surgery, and optional
           high-dose ifosfamide and doxorubicin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine acute and late toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate measurements of tumor physiology, defined by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
           resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and tumor oxygenation, with clinical
           and/or pathological response and/or metastatic potential in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients may receive high-dose ifosfamide IV continuously over 6 days (144 hours).
      Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of ifosfamide, patients undergo radiotherapy once
      daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. Beginning 1 hour after radiotherapy, patients also undergo
      hyperthermia (with heat measured by conventional and magnetic resonance-based thermometry)
      over 1-2 hours once weekly for 5 weeks. Approximately 4 weeks after the completion of
      radiotherapy and hyperthermia, patients undergo surgery. Approximately 1 month after surgery,
      patients may then receive high-dose doxorubicin IV once every 4 weeks for 4 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-6 years.

    <description>Patients will receive hyperthermia throughout the course of radiotherapy delivered once weekly for a total of 5 treatments. Each treatment will last 1-2 hours with a goal of delivering a cumulative thermal dose of 10-100 CEM 43˚T90. Interstitial temperature measurements will be taken by placing a single (less than or equal to) 15 gauge thermometry catheter into the tumor.
In addition to hyperthermia treatment and radiation therapy all patients will receive conventional surgery for the removal of their tumors. Some patients will also receive chemotherapy if their treating physician thinks it is the their best interested (including the possibility of doxorubicin hydrochloride or ifosfamide and mesna).</description>
