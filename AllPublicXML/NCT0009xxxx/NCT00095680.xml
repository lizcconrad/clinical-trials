    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the long-term effectiveness of SCIO-469 as
      monotherapy, or in combination with bortezomib in relapsed, refractory patients with multiple
      myeloma (MM) who have previously demonstrated clinical benefit in the Scios B003 study.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy of SCIO-469 as
      monotherapy, or in combination with bortezomib in relapsed, refractory patients with multiple
      myeloma (MM) who have previously demonstrated clinical benefit in the Scios B003 study.
      Patients took by mouth two capsules (60 mg) three times a day alone or in combination with
      bortezomib, for 168 days.
