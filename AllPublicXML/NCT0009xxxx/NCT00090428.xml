      This study will determine whether a gluten- and casein-free diet has specific benefits for
      children with autism.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a serious brain disorder that affects brain development and often causes social and
      educational problems. Prior studies suggested that a gluten- and casein-free diet may have a
      therapeutic effect on the behavior of children with autism. This study will examine the
      effects of such a diet on the behavior of children with autism who meet research diagnostic
      criteria, are monitored in adherence to the diet, and receive similar intense behavioral
      therapy.

      Children in this study will be following a gluten free and casein free diet for 18 weeks. All
      subjects will have 6 weeks of baseline followed by 12 weeks of randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, challenge snacks with careful behavioral observation and evaluation. They
      also will be receiving uniform educational and behavioral services through their provider.
      Standard autism evaluation methods, weekly diet and sleep diaries and scheduled laboratory
      tests will be used to assess subjects. An end of study, follow-up assessment will be
      completed at 30 weeks after the start of the study.

    <description>After established on a gluten free and casein free diet for at least 6 weeks, participants received double blind, placebo controlled challenges containing gluten, casein, gluten+casein, or placebo in a random order. Data was collected on behavioral and physiologic responses relative to the challenges. Children remained on the gluten free and casein free diet throughout this period.</description>
