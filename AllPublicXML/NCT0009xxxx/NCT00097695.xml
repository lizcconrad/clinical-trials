      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Icatibant, a bradykinin
      antagonist in the treatment of acute cutaneous and/or abdominal attacks in patients with
      hereditary angioedema (HAE).

      This Phase II/III study consisted of two parts: A controlled phase and An Open label
      extension(OLE) phase. The controlled phase describes the double blind part of the study and
      was intended to evaluate the efficacy of icatibant in decreasing the time to onset of symptom
      relief compared with placebo for the first treated cutaneous and/or abdominal attack in
      randomised patients. Patients experienced a laryngeal attack were not randomised, but treated
      with open label icatibant according to the controlled phase procedures and assessments. The
      outcome of this group was to be reported descriptively. After treatment of the first attack
      in the controlled phase, the patients were eligible to enter the OLE phase. In the OLE phase,
      patients who experienced angioedema attacks severe enough to warrant treatment were to be
      treated with s.c. icatibant as appropriate until the end of the study.The OLE phase became a
      modified open label extension where all 56 patients who had been randomised and the last
      randomised patient had concluded the double-blind phase. The modified open label extension
      period permitted treatment for patients who were screened and found eligible but did not
      experience an angioedema attack, or had an attack that was not severe enough to merit
      treatment while the double blind phase was still ongoing.

    <measure>Time to Onset of Symptom Relief (TOSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was TOSR assessed by the patient using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is a scale used to measure intensity of each symptom of the attack at baseline and at the pre-determined time points throughout treatment period. It consists of a horizontal 10cm line, with the 0 point corresponding to a state where patient experiences no symptoms at all and the 10cm point represents the worst symptoms ever experienced by patient. The patient indicates his/her current state of symptoms by drawing a mark across the horizontal line.
TOSR was defined as the time between time of injection to time of first documented onset of symptom relief for the 3 primary symptoms: cutaneous swelling, cutaneous skin, and abdominal pain.
The primary symptom was based on the type of attack. For abdominal attacks, the single primary symptom was abdominal pain. For cutaneous attacks, the single primary symptom was either skin swelling or skin pain, whichever was most severe.</description>

    <measure>Time to Regression (Start of Improvement) According to Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter assessed the time to regression (start of improvement) of observable(visible) symptoms according to the patients. Patients were asked &quot;Report date and time when you feel that your symptoms start to improve&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Almost Complete Symptom Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The time to almost complete symptom relief was defined as a score between 0 and 10 mm on the VAS for at least 3 consecutive measurements for all symptom.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Symptom Relief (TOSR)</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was TOSR assessed by the patient using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is a scale used to measure intensity of each symptom of the attack at baseline and at the pre-determined time points throughout treatment period. It consists of a horizontal 10cm line, with the 0 point corresponding to a state where patient experiences no symptoms at all and the 10cm point represents the worst symptoms ever experienced by patient. The patient indicates his/her current state of symptoms by drawing a mark across the horizontal line.
TOSR was defined as the time between time of injection to time of first documented onset of symptom relief for the 3 primary symptoms: cutaneous swelling, cutaneous skin, and abdominal pain.
The primary symptom was based on the type of attack. For abdominal attacks, the single primary symptom was abdominal pain. For cutaneous attacks, the single primary symptom was either skin swelling or skin pain, whichever was most severe.</description>
