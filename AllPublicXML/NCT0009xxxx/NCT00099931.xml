  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain their target blood glucose levels on a
      single therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of
      vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, in lowering overall blood glucose levels when added to
      insulin in people with type 2 diabetes who are not at target blood glucose levels on insulin
      alone.
