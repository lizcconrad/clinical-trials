      The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the effects of two body therapy
      approaches in women who have experienced child sexual abuse.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who have experienced child sexual abuse often display symptoms of dissociation and lack
      of bodily self-awareness which hinder the recovery process. Mind-body researchers have
      examined alternative therapeutic approaches to eliminating these factors. This study will
      compare a standardized therapeutic message to body-oriented therapy which involves a
      combination of hands-on bodywork and verbal therapy focused on somatic and emotional
      awareness.
