  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is in patients with at least moderate obesity (Body Mass Index [BMI] &gt; 30 kg/m2 or
      approximately 30 or more pounds overweight) and who also produce too much insulin (insulin
      stores sugar as fat). Sandostatin LAR速 Depot suppresses insulin, and is being developed to
      help with weight loss in people who find it hard to lose weight on their own because they
      produce too much insulin.

      The main purpose of the study is to find the lowest dose of Sandostatin LAR速 Depot that
      safely helps overweight people lose weight. The study will also compare weight loss in obese
      patients who receive one of three different dosages of Sandostatin LAR Depot or placebo.
