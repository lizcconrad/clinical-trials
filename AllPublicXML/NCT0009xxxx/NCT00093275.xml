        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects with incomplete (traumatic), chronic (defined as 18 months or
             more post spinal cord injury) SCI aged 18 to 65 years

          -  CSCI must be categorized in classes C or D in the ASIA impairment scale. (C =
             Incomplete impairment with motor function preserved below the neurological level, and
             more than half of key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade less
             than 3. D = Incomplete impairment with motor function preserved below the neurological
             level, and at least half of key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle
             grade more than or equal to 3).

          -  The level of the SCI must be between C4 and T10 (neurological)

          -  Subject has a measurable range of motion at the hips, knees and ankles and possesses
             potential propulsive activity (i.e. no functional contractures)

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterile or who
             are less than 2 years postmenopausal) must be using two forms of birth control,
             including a primary and a secondary form and have a negative pregnancy test
             immediately prior to treatment. Primary forms of contraception include: tubal
             ligation, partner's vasectomy, intrauterine devices, birth control pills, and
             topical/injectable/implantable/insertable hormonal birth control products. Secondary
             forms of contraception include diaphragms, latex condoms and cervical caps; each must
             be used with a spermicide.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinical evidence of recent fracture(s) within the last six months prior to study
             start.

          -  Any history of Multiple Sclerosis or peripheral demyelinating disease or neuromuscular
             disorder.

          -  Heart rate of less than 38 or greater than 100

          -  Ashworth spasticity score of 0/4 or 4/4 at the hip or knee.

          -  Subject whose medical condition requires mechanical ventilation.

          -  Lower motor neuron injury, such as those with conus medullaris or cauda equina
             injuries.

          -  Subject with lower extremity amputation or proximal femorectomy.

          -  Subject with pressure ulcers stages 3 and 4.

          -  Subject medically or mentally unstable in judgment of Investigator.

          -  Subject on tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline and
             imipramine.

          -  Subject with ASIA motor score of greater than or equal to 92.

          -  Subject with ASIA sensory score of greater than or equal to 200.

          -  Subject with history of seizure within 2 years prior to study start.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical trial involving investigational
             medication within 30 days prior to administration of HP184 or placebo.

          -  Female subjects with positive urine pregnancy test.

          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding.
