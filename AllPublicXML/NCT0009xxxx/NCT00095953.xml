      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well SB-715992 works in treating patients with
      metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of SB-715992, in terms of response rate, in patients with
           previously untreated metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the early progression rate and response duration in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetics with safety and efficacy endpoints of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate β-tubulin and kinesin spindle protein expression in tumor tissue with clinical
           outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients are followed at 4 weeks after completion of protocol therapy. Patients with
      ongoing complete response, partial response, or stable disease are followed every 3 months
      thereafter until relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14
      months.
