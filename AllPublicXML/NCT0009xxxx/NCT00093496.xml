      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine hydrochloride and tanespimycin in
      treating patients who have recurrent advanced ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity
      cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and tanespimycin, work
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients with recurrent
      advanced ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with gemcitabine
      hydrochloride and 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (tanespimycin).

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the effect of
      17-AAG alone on chaperone and client proteins in tumor samples and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells with response, time to progression, and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to gemcitabine
      hydrochloride therapy (gemcitabine hydrochloride-naive/no prior exposure to gemcitabine
      hydrochloride vs gemcitabine hydrochloride-resistant/prior exposure to gemcitabine
      hydrochloride as a single agent with disease progression while on treatment). Patients
      receive tanespimycin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 8 during course 1 and days
      2 and 9 during subsequent courses and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 7
      during course 1 and days 1 and 8 during subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.

    <measure>Proportion of Patients Who Experience a Confirmed Response According to Modified RECIST Criteria.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were evaluated every 6 weeks on treatment, with median treatment length of 12 weeks (3 week minimum and 42 week maximum).</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response will be measured using the modified RECIST criteria. A confirmed response requires an objective status of complete or partial response on 2 consecutive evaluations occurring 4 or more weeks apart.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions and normalization of tumor biomarkers.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the target lesions from the baseline.</description>
