  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well SGN-00101 vaccine works compared to a
      placebo in treating human papillomavirus and preventing cervical cancer in patients with
      abnormal cervical cells. Vaccines, such as SGN-00101, may make the body build an immune
      response to kill human papillomavirus and abnormal cervical cells and may be effective in
      preventing cervical cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the effectiveness of SGN-00101 vaccine vs placebo in reducing the human
      papillomavirus (HPV)-16 viral load in patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined
      significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) of the cervix with
      persistent HPV-16 infection who are at increased risk for developing a high-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesion or invasive cervical cancer.

      II. Compare the natural history of HPV-16 viral load in patients treated with these regimens.

      III. Compare the effect of HPV-16 variants on viral load response in patients treated with
      these regimens.

      IV. Compare the relative effectiveness of these regimens on the regression of cervical
      cellular atypias (based on Pap test results), in terms of the regression of cytologic
      findings of LSIL and ASCUS to normal findings and resolution or regression of colposcopically
      defined cervicovaginal lesions, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive SGN-00101 vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 8
      for a maximum of 3 injections in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or the development of
      an invasive malignancy or serious illness.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo vaccine SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 8 for a maximum of 3
      injections in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or the development of an invasive
      malignancy or serious illness.

      Patients are followed at 12, 24, and 52 weeks after the last vaccination.
