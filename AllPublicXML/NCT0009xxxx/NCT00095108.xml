  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if an experimental drug called recombinant interleukin-21
      (rIL-21) when given to patients with stage 4 malignant melanoma or stage 4 kidney cancer is
      safe and has any effect on these types of cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 safety study. Everyone enrolled and eligible will be given rIL-21. The
      study has 2 parts, Part A will determine how high a dose of rIl-21 can be safely given to
      patients with these types of cancers. Part B will determine if the drug is of any benefit to
      patients with these types of cancers. Part A may have up to 7 different dose groups.
      Beginning with the lowest dose, 3 patients will be treated and will be watched for side
      effects. If the side effects are not severe, the next group of 3 patients will recieve a
      higher dose. This cycle is repeated until the highest tolerated dose group is found.
