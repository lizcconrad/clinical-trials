      This study will examine whether lithium carbonate, given alone or with divalproex, increases
      the amount of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal fluid of patients with
      Huntington's disease (HD), a hereditary disorder of the central nervous system. Patients with
      this fatal degenerative disease have lower amounts of substances in the brain and spinal
      fluid called trophic or growth factors. One of these factors is BDNF. A possible treatment
      for HD may be to increase the levels of BDNF. Lithium carbonate, a drug used to treat bipolar
      disorder, and divalproex, a drug used to treat mood disorders and seizure disorders, have
      both been shown to increase the amount of BDNF protein in laboratory studies.

      Patients 18 to 70 years old with a DNA-confirmed diagnosis of Huntington's disease may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical
      examination, neurological evaluation, blood and urine tests, and electrocardiogram (EKG).

      Participants take lithium carbonate with and without divalproex. They also receive placebo
      (an inactive substance) for portions of the study. On the first day of the study, patients
      are given a supply of pills with instructions on how to take them. Blood pressure and pulse
      are measured, and blood and urine tests may be done. Patients are evaluated with standardized
      tests and scales for assessment of various aspects of HD.

      Patients return to the clinic once a week for follow-up evaluations, including blood and
      urine tests, physical examinations, disease assessments, and a review of medication side
      effects. Each week, they receive a new supply of medications and instructions on how to take
      them. At the end of the sixth week, they finish taking the medications.

      During the study, patients undergo three lumbar punctures (spinal taps) - at weeks 2, 4, and
      6 - to measure BDNF and various other brain chemicals. For this test, a local anesthetic is
      given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF
      circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle.
      The procedure generally takes from 5 to 20 minutes.

      Patients return to the clinic 2 weeks after completing the study medication for a final
      evaluation, including a physical examination and blood and urine tests.

      Objective: The overall objective of this study is to examine the acute effects of lithium
      alone and/ or in combination with divalproex on markers of neuroprotective activity in
      patients with Huntington's disease (HD). It is hypothesized that at safe and tolerable doses
      these drugs will enhance depleted levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a
      neurotrophin which is necessary for the survival of striatal neurons.

      Study population: Patients suffering from Huntington's disease will be study participants.

      Design: The acute effects of lithium and divalproex on surrogate measures of neuroprotective
      activity will be evaluated in up to 24 HD patients. The study, lasting approximately 6 weeks,
      will be conducted on an outpatient basis.

      Outcome measures: In this proof-of-principle study, efficacy in restoring BDNF concentrations
      will be assessed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements. Safety will be monitored by
      means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory test.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Subject is between the ages of 18 and 70 (inclusive);

          2. Subject will have a diagnosis of HD confirmed by DNA testing [prior to enrollment into
             the study].

          3. Only those subjects will be eligible, who with or without a caregiver, can be assumed
             to be able to comply with study requirements and to report on their condition by
             telephone.

          4. Subjects with minimental status examination score of greater than and equal to 24.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria during screening or during the
        study will not be immediately excluded from the study, as appropriate:

          1. Patient has a history of any medical condition such as diabetes, cardiac disease,
             renal impairment, liver disease, pancreatitis and other chronic medical problems that
             can reasonably be expected to subject the patient to unwarranted risk;

          2. Patient has clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that would preclude
             administration of lithium and divalproex;

          3. Patient is taking a prohibited concomitant medication;
