  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults admitted to intensive care units are at risk for a variety of complications. One of
      the most frequent complications is the development of new infections. Infections due to a
      fungus called Candida are of particular concern. This study will test the possibility that
      caspofungin, a new therapy for fungal infections, may reduce the rate of Candida infections
      in subjects at risk.

      A Randomized, Double-Masked Trial of Caspofungin (50 mg/day) Versus Placebo as Prophylaxis of
      Invasive Candidiasis in HighRisk Adults in the Critical Care Setting for up to 28 days with
      observation of primary outcome through 7 days after study therapy. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of caspofungin as prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis
      in high-risk ICU patients as opposed to those receiving placebo whereas the secondary
      objectives are as follows: To evaluate the utility of surrogate markers for the diagnosis of
      invasive candidiasis, to assess the effect of colonization as a risk factor in developing the
      disease, evaluate the safety of prophylactic caspofungin in subjects who discontinue the
      study due to drug-related adverse events versus subjects with 1 or more drug-related adverse
      events and to evaluate the all-cause mortality.

        subjects must have at least 1 of the following: received at least one other dose of any
        systemic antibiotic on any one of the ICU days before study entry and continue to receive
        antibiotics at the time of enrollment, and/or presence of a central venous catheter at the
        time of enrollment and for one additional day during the current ICU stay, and at least 2
        of the following: use of total parenteral nutrition on any of Days 1-4 of ICU stay; any
        type of dialysis on any of Days 1-4 of ICU stay; any in-patient surgery done under general

        or on ICU admission; more than 1 dose of systemic steroids (prednisone equivalent dose
        &gt;/=20 mg per dose) in the 7 days prior to or on ICU admission; and/or use of more than 1
        dose of other systemic immunosuppressive agents (such as azathioprine, tacrolimus,
        sirolimus, mycophenolate, monoclonal antibodies, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]
        immunomodulators) in the 7 days prior to or on ICU admission.

          -  Excludes placement of vascular catheters.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with an allergy or intolerance to caspofungin or other echinocandin analog;
        absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/mm3 at entry or likely to develop such a count during
        therapy; diagnosis of HIV, aplastic anemia, or chronic granulomatous disease; moderate or
        severe hepatic insufficiency as defined by a Child Pugh score of 7 or greater or cirrhosis
        due to any cause; pregnancy or breastfeeding; subjects unlikely to survive more than 2
        days; subjects who have received systemic antifungal therapy within 7 days prior to study
        entry; subjects with documented active, proven, or probable invasive fungal infection
        within 7 days prior to study entry; subjects previously enrolled into this trial; subjects
        currently receiving another investigational agent or who have received an investigational
        agent within the 7 days prior to study entry; subjects in the ICU 5 or more days prior to
