      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may make the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin,
      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy
      with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III
      non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed with surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of standard paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
           radiotherapy in combination with vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM vaccine, fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM
           vaccine, and recombinant fowlpox GM-CSF vaccine in patients with unresectable stage III
           non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to disease progression and overall median survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine immunologic response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Vaccine: Patients receive vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 0 and
           fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM (rF-CEA-TRICOM) vaccine SC on days 14, 29, 43, 57, 70, 91, and 112.
           Patients also receive recombinant fowlpox GM-CSF (rF-GM-CSF) vaccine SC with each
           vaccination. Patients with stable or responding disease after day 112 continue to
           receive rF-CEA-TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF SC every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy on days 21-25, 28-32, 35-39, 42-46, 49-53,
           56-60, and 63-67.

        -  Chemotherapy: Concurrently with radiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour
           and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63. Patients also
           receive paclitaxel and carboplatin on days 91 and 112 (after completion of
           radiotherapy).

      Patients are followed annually for up to 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-6 months.
