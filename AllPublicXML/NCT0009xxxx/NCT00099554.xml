      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the proportion of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) subjects
      achieving a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; DAS28 response (EULAR28 criteria) at Week 16 with etanercept
      50 mg subcutaneously (SC) once weekly in patients who have failed infliximab.
