  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will gain information about a rare disorder called KSHV-associated multicentric
      Castleman s disease (MCD). KSHV, a virus, causes several kinds of cancer, including some
      forms of MCD. KSHV stands for the Kaposi s sarcoma herpes virus, also called human herpes
      virus-8, or HHV-8. Researchers want to understand the biology of KSHV-MCD to identify how
      this disease causes illness and to find ways to treat it. There is no standard therapy
      effective for all cases of KSHV-MCD. The disease is often fatal, and about half the people
      who have it die within 2 years of diagnosis.

      Patients ages 12 and older may be eligible for this study. Participation entails more drawing
      of blood and having repeated tumor biopsies than if patients received treatment in a
      non-research setting. Researchers would like to learn more about the relationship of KSHV and
      Castleman s disease symptoms, and they want to obtain at least three biopsies in this study.

      There are some side effects of experimental therapy that patients may take for KSHV-MCD.
      Zidovudine, or Retrovir , is used at a high dose. It is given orally or through a vein, four
      times daily, for 7 days or longer. Zidovudine can cause nausea, vomiting, decreased bone
      marrow function, and decreased blood counts. Combined with valganciclovir, or Valcyte , it is
      likely to be more toxic to bone marrow. Valganciclovir can cause problems with bone marrow
      function, leading to low blood counts, sterility, and defects in a fetus. Combined with
      zidovudine, valganciclovir may cause more toxicity to the bone marrow. It is given twice
      daily for 7 days or longer. Bortezomib, or Velcade , is given for a few seconds by a rapid
      push through a needle into the vein. It is given twice weekly for four doses and then stopped
      for 1 week. Bortezomib can sometimes cause low blood pressure; it also can cause
      gastrointestinal problems and a low blood platelet count. Rituximab and liposomal doxorubicin
      are drugs given by a catheter into a vein. Interferon-alpha is given by injection into the
      skin. Those drugs are not experimental, but their use in Castleman s disease is experimental.

      Some patients may be treated with a combination of chemotherapy followed by interferon-alpha.
      Interferon-alpha is infected into the skin by a needle. The natural form of interferon is
      produced by the body and helps to control viral infections. KSHV decreases the effect of the
      body s interferon, and the researchers want to see if giving higher doses of interferon will
      help to control KSHV infection.

      A positron emission tomography (PET) scan, for research purposes only, may be done up to
      three times a year. A radioactive sugar molecule called fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG, is used.
      It is believed that activated lymphocytes that may be found in patients disease might use
      more FDG because these cells burn more glucose fuel. Children younger than 18 years will not
      have PET scan done.

      This study may or may not have a direct benefit for participants. However, detailed
      assessments made throughout the study may provide information to help the doctors treat
      KSHV-MCD better.

      Background:

        -  Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is a rare but lethal Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
           herpesvirus (KSHV) associated lymphoproliferative disorder with a median survival of 2
           years. It occurs more often in HIV-infected individuals than those without HIV
           infection. The poor prognosis is not fully explained by the underlying HIV, as the
           HIV-negative cases appear to have no survival advantage over the HIV-positive cohort.
           The disease has no defined standard treatment and has not been prospectively studied in
           a comprehensive manner.

        -  KSHV-MCD may provide a model for the development of targeted oncolytic virotherapy or
           other pathogenesis-based approaches to viral-associated malignancies. In KSHV-MCD, viral
           encoded tyrosine kinase genes appear to be possible targets to exploit in a virotherapy
           approach. Specific viral encoded genes appear to convert zidovudine and ganciclovir (or
           valganciclovir) into toxic phosphorylated moieties within the KSHV-infected tumor cells,
           to specifically target the KSHV-infected cells thus leading to specific cell death. If
           successful, this could have direct therapeutic benefit to patients and also provide a
           model for further development of this approach in other tumors.

      Objectives

        -  To study and describe the natural history of KSHV-MCD.

        -  To assess disease activity as reflected by fever, thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia,
           and lymphocytopenia, human and viral interleukin-6 levels, C-reactive protein, and KSHV
           viral loads.

        -  To describe how the laboratory pathogenesis-related parameters (especially serum levels
           of human and viral interleukin-6) are related to the clinical and hematologic parameters
           listed.

      Eligibility

        -  Age greater than or equal to 12 years

        -  Biopsy proven KSHV-associated MCD

        -  Natural History study

        -  Inclusion of treatment as needed, with guidelines for preliminary investigation of a
           variety of specific treatments of interest

             -  High-dose zidovudine and ganciclovir

             -  High-dose zidovudine and ganciclovir and bortezomib

             -  Sirolimus
