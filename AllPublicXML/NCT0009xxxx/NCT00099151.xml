  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is one of three CALERIE trials that test the hypothesis that a reduced calorie,
      nutritionally sound diet improves biomarkers of aging and prevents some age-related chronic
      diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The three sites that are
      participating in the CALERIE trial represent a diversity of subject populations and
      interventional strategies.

      This study tests whether chronic caloric restriction improves risk factors of longevity in
      humans as it is known to do in animals, by measuring a variety of factors dealing with
      metabolism and oxidative stress, through physical evaluations and laboratory tests.

      Participants will receive dietary counseling and free medical evaluations. In addition, each
      volunteer will be asked to do one of the following:

        1. Follow a reduced calorie diet

        2. Follow a reduced calorie diet using a liquid diet

        3. Increase physical activity while on a reduced calorie diet

        4. Follow a standard diet.

      Three separate five-day inpatient stays are required.
