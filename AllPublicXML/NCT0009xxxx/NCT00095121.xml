  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of adefovir dipivoxil for
      the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in children and adolescents (age 2 to less than 18
      years) following 48 weeks of placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment and following an
      additional 192 weeks of open-label adefovir dipivoxil treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weeks 1 through 48 (Study Year 1): The first 48 weeks of the study were a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group treatment period. Participants were randomly
      assigned to treatment in a 2:1 fashion to ADV or PLB. Prior to randomization, eligible
      participants were classified into 1 of 6 strata based upon age at screening (2 to &lt; 7 years;
      &gt;= 7 to &lt; 12 years; &gt;= 12 to &lt; 18 years) and prior exposure to treatment for chronic
      hepatitis B (CHB) (prior treatment; no prior treatment).

      Weeks 49 through 240 (Study Years 2 through 5): At Week 48, all placebo-treated participants
      who did not exhibit HBeAg or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion at Week 44,
      plus all ADV-treated participants, were offered the opportunity to receive open-label ADV for
      up to an additional 192 weeks. Any participant with HBV DNA &gt;= 1000 copies/mL at 2
      consecutive visits 12 weeks apart was to be discontinued from open-label study treatment. The
      only exception was for participants in the adolescent age range with prior lamivudine
      experience who were allowed the opportunity to add lamivudine to ADV; similarly, if
      combination failed to impart suppression of HBV DNA below 1000 copies/mL (confirmed)
      discontinuation was necessary. All participants who discontinued study drug due to confirmed
      seroconversion were requested to continue to return for study visits for the remainder of the
      study in order to evaluate the durability of seroconversion. Participants who wished to
      discontinue study treatment and withdraw from the study prior to study completion were
      requested to return every 4 weeks for 16 weeks for posttreatment evaluations following an
      early termination visit. Any participants who experienced posttreatment hepatic flares during
      the 16-week follow-up period were to be followed every 4 weeks until their ALT levels
      returned to &lt;= 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for a maximum off-treatment follow-up
      of 6 months. Participants who experienced a severe hepatic flare (per protocol definition)
      after discontinuation of ADV during the open-label treatment period may have been eligible to
      receive ADV for treatment of the hepatic flare (after consultation with the Gilead medical
      monitor).

          <title>ADV - ADV</title>
          <description>Once daily treatment: children aged 2 to &lt;7 years received 0.3 mg/kg oral suspension; children aged &gt;=7 to &lt;12 years received 0.25 mg/kg oral suspension; children aged &gt;=12 to &lt;18 years received 10 mg tablet. The adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) baseline was defined as the day of first dose of ADV (ie, Week 0 for participants originally randomized to double-blind [DB] ADV [ADV-ADV group]). Additionally, ADV week was defined as the windowed visit week relative to ADV baseline. Thus, participants in the ADV-ADV group could have received up to 240 weeks of ADV treatment (ADV Week 240). Lamivudine was to be added to the open-label ADV regimen of subjects between 12 and &lt;18 years old who had prior lamivudine exposure and who had a serum HBV DNA concentration &gt;= 1000 copies/mL at 2 consecutive study visits at or after Study Week 96.</description>

Additionally, ADV week was defined as the windowed visit week relative to ADV baseline. Thus, participants in the PLB-ADV group could receive only up to 192 weeks of open-label (OL) ADV treatment (ADV Week 192). Lamivudine was to be added to the open-label ADV regimen of subjects between 12 and &lt;18 years old who had prior lamivudine exposure and who had a serum HBV DNA concentration &gt;= 1000 copies/mL at 2 consecutive study visits at or after Study Week 96.</description>

            <description>Placebo was matched to ADV treatment (oral suspension or tablet) by age group for the DB treatment period. At Week 48, all placebo-treated participants who did not exhibit HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion at Week 44 were offered the opportunity to receive OL ADV for up to an additional 192 weeks (ie, enter the OL study period; Weeks 49 to 240).The ADV baseline was defined as the day of first dose of ADV (ie, Week 48 for those originally randomized to placebo [PLB-ADV group]). ADV week was defined as the windowed visit week relative to ADV baseline. Thus, participants in the PLB-ADV group could receive only up to 192 weeks of ADV treatment (ADV Week 192).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HBeAg Loss or Seroconversion by ADV Week 240 (Open Label Analysis Set, Participants Who Were HBeAg Positive at ADV Baseline; Missing = Excluded)</title>
        <description>Per protocol, participants could discontinue study medication due to HBeAg seroconversion and remain in the study in order to evaluate the durability of seroconversion. HBeAg loss is defined for an individual participant as HBeAg+ at ADV baseline and HBeAg− post baseline. HBeAg seroconversion is defined for an individual participant as HBeAg+ at ADV baseline and HBeAg− and anti-HBe+ post baseline.</description>

        <population>The OL analysis set included any participant who took at least one dose of open-label ADV. This analysis set was subdivided based on DB drug, as ADV-ADV or PLB-ADV. Participants with missing values were excluded. Analysis set included only data from participants while on study treatment.</population>

          <description>A participant was defined to have durable HBeAg seroconversion only if she/he remained in a seroconverted state (HBeAg−, hepatitis B e antibody + [anti-HBe+]) from the date that she/he first seroconverted through and including her/his last study visit. This endpoint could only be assessed for participants who (HBeAg−) seroconverted on-treatment and subsequently discontinued open-label dosing.</description>
          <population>Participants who discontinued treatment because of confirmed HBeAg seroconversion in Weeks 49 to 240 were to remain in the study through Week 240 to monitor the durability of seroconversion. Any participant who formally stopped drug early and restarted, by definition, did not have durable HBeAg seroconversion.</population>

      <desc>Treatment-emergent AEs included AEs collected from the date of the first dose of study drug up to the last day on study (including the follow-up, off study medication period of the study). For those participants who did not enter open-label treatment, AEs were collected until 30 days after last double-blind dose. Only on-treatment AEs are shown.</desc>

At Week 48, ADV−treated participants were offered the opportunity to receive open-label ADV for up to an additional 192 weeks (ie, OL Weeks 49 - 240). ADV baseline was defined as the day of first dose of ADV (ie, Week 0 for participants originally randomized to DB ADV [ADV-ADV group]). ADV week was defined as the windowed visit week relative to ADV baseline. Thus, participants in the ADV-ADV group could have received up to 240 weeks of ADV treatment (ADV Week 240). Treatment-emergent AEs for the OL period are events that began on or after the date of the first dose of OL ADV, and include only new events (ie, events that were never observed during the DB period, or, events observed during the DB period but with greater severity during the OL period).</description>
