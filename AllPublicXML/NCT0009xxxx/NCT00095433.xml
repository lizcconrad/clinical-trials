      This is a Phase III, open-label, multicenter extension study of intravitreally administered
      ranibizumab in subjects with primary or recurrent subfoveal choroidal neovascularization
      (CNV) secondary to AMD who have completed the treatment phase of a Genentech sponsored Phase
      I or Phase I/II ranibizumab protocol (FVF1770g, FVF2128g, or FVF2425g).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health
             information

          -  Age &gt;=50 years

          -  Completion of the treatment phase of a Genentech sponsored Phase I or I/II ranibizumab
             protocol (FVF1770g, FVF2128g, or FVF2425g)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CNV in either eye due to other causes such as ocular histoplasmosis, trauma, or
             pathologic myopia

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye

          -  Current vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye

          -  Subretinal hemorrhage in the study eye that involves the fovea, if the size of the
             hemorrhage is either &gt;=50% of the total lesion area or &gt;=1 DA in size

          -  Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 1 month
             preceding Week 0

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure &gt;=30 mmHg
             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication)

          -  Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception

          -  Laser photocoagulation (subfoveal, juxtafoveal, or extrafoveal) in the study eye
             within 30 days preceding Week 0

          -  Prior treatment with external-beam radiation therapy or transpupillary thermotherapy
             (TTT) in the study eye

          -  Previous treatment with verteporfin in the study eye within 30 days preceding Week 0

          -  Treatment with verteporfin in the non-study eye within 7 days preceding Week 0

          -  History of vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or other surgical intervention for AMD in
             the study eye

          -  Previous participation in a clinical trial (for either eye) involving antiangiogenic
             drugs other than ranibizumab (e.g., pegaptanib, anecortave acetate, protein kinase C
             inhibitors, etc.)

          -  Previous participation in any studies of investigational drugs within 1 month
             preceding Week 0 (excluding vitamins and minerals studies)

          -  Discontinuation from a ranibizumab study due to an adverse event judged by the
             investigator to be possibly or probably related to ranibizumab

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation
             of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from treatment
             complications

          -  Inability to comply with study or follow up procedures
