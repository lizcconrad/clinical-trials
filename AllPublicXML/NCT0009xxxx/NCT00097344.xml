      The purpose of this study is to determine whether maximal estrogen suppression achieved via
      the combination of an experimental drug, atamestane, plus an FDA-approved drug, toremifene
      (Fareston®), is more effective than another approved drug, letrozole (Femara®), in delaying
      the growth of breast cancer, and whether the side effects of the combined hormonal therapy
      are different from the side effects of letrozole.

      Aromatase is an enzyme expressed in tissues such as muscle and fat in postmenopausal women.
      These non-ovarian tissues become the dominant sources of estrogen in postmenopausal women.
      Breast cancer cells are often very dependent on estrogens to continue to grow. Atamestane
      blocks the formation of estrogens from androgenic precursors in the body via the aromatase
      enzyme. Toremifene blocks circulating and intracellular estrogens from stimulating estrogen
      receptors in breast cancer cells. The goal of therapy with atamestane, an aromatase
      inhibitor, in combination with the estrogen receptor antagonist, toremifene, is to achieve
      complete suppression of estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cells. This study is designed
      to determine whether combined hormonal therapy will lengthen the time to disease progression
      and the rate of objective response, as compared to single agent therapy with the approved
      aromatase inhibitor letrozole.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women age 18 years or older

          -  Postmenopausal women who are to receive their first hormonal treatment for locally
             recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic disease, and who would be appropriate
             candidates for treatment with antiestrogens or aromatase inhibitors.

          -  Locally recurrent, locally advanced, locally metastatic disease not amenable to
             radiation therapy or surgery and/or distant metastatic disease.

          -  Pathological or histological confirmation at primary diagnosis of breast cancer or at
             the time of diagnosis of advanced disease.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 or Karnofsky performance status of 60 or higher.

          -  Predicted life expectancy of 12 weeks or more.

          -  Postmenopausal endocrine status. LH/FSH levels in the postmenopausal range in women
             whose menopause occurred less than 5 years ago.

          -  At least one tumor localization measurable in 2 dimensions.

               -  One diameter either at least 2 cm or at least two times the CT/MRI
                  slice/reconstruction thickness for bone/soft tissue/visceral disease assessed by
                  CT/MRI scan (to include spiral CT technique).

               -  One diameter at least 2 cm for lesions other than bone lesions assessed by
                  conventional X-ray techniques.

               -  One diameter at least 1 cm for bone lesions assessed by conventional X-ray
