  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to identify the highest oral dose of BMS-599626, a drug that is
      directed against EGFR and HER2 proteins, that can be given safely on a daily schedule of 21
      days with a 7 day rest period in patients with cancer who no longer benefit from other
      commonly used treatments. The study will also test for other proteins that may be affected by
      BMS-599626; and the level of study drug in the blood will be studied.
