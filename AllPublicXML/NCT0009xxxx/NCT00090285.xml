  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to demonstrate that Gardasil™ (quadrivalent human papillomavirus
      [qHPV] vaccine) 1) is well tolerated in young men, 2) reduces incidence of external genital
      lesions in young men, 3) reduces the incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) or
      anal cancer in men having sex with men (MSM), and 4) reduces incidence of Human
      Papillomavirus (HPV) infection in young men. In the 7-month Base Study participants received
      randomly assigned qHPV vaccine or placebo at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6. Base Study
      follow-up continued through Month 36. In Extension 1 (EXT1), participants who received
      placebo or an incomplete qHPV vaccine regimen in the Base Study were offered qHPV vaccine.
      Participants were followed in EXT1 for 7 months. In Extension 2 [LTFU (EXT2)], long-term
      effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of qHPV vaccine were followed up to 10 years
      following study enrollment. Participants who received ≥1 dose of qHPV vaccine in the Base
      Study or EXT1 were eligible to enroll in LTFU (EXT2).

    <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR'S product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR'S product, is also an adverse experience. A severe AE is incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activities.</description>

          <title>LTFU (EXT2): Number of Participants With Vaccine-Related SAEs</title>
          <description>An SAE is an AE that 1) results in death, 2) is life threatening, 3) results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 4) results in or prolongs an existing hospitalization, 5) is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, 6) is a cancer, 7) is an overdose, or 8) based on appropriate medical judgment may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention. A vaccine-related AE is one deemed to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study vaccine by the investigator.</description>

          <description>Antibodies to HPV types were measured using IgG LIA. Thresholds for seropositive were ≥9, 6, 5, and 5 IgG LIA mMU/mL for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18, respectively.</description>
          <population>All participants who 1) were seronegative at Day 1 and PCR negative Day 1 through Month 7 for the relevant HPV type, 2) received all 3 vaccinations, and 3) did not have protocol deviations that could interfere with the effects of the vaccine. Immunogenicity was assessed only for participants who received qHPV vaccine in the Base Study..</population>
