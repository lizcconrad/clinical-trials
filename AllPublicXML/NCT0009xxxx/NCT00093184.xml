    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the benefit of bivalirudin in combination with
      clopidogrel with provisional GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use, in reducing the bleeding complications
      associated with early invasive management of patients presenting with an ST Elevation
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and undergoing primary PCI, while providing similar rates of
      ischemic events when compared to published results of relevant trials.

               -  ST-segment elevation in at least 2 contiguous leads or new Left Branch Bundle
                  Block (LBBB), OR existing LBBB with positive troponin

               -  Residual high grade stenosis and associated abnormalities in regional wall
                  motion.

          3. Planned primary PCI in native coronary vessel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed pregnancy

          3. Culprit lesion within SVG or bypass conduit

          4. Dependency on renal dialysis

          5. Administration of LMWH within 8 hours prior to PCI

          6. Administration of abciximab within 7 days prior to PCI
