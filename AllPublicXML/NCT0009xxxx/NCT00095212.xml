  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgen deficiency in HIV-infected women is associated with sarcopenia and may cause
      critical reductions in physical functioning and reduced bone density. The effects of
      long-term androgen therapy on lean body mass, bone density and other clinical endpoints
      including quality of life, functional status and neurocognitive function in HIV-infected
      women are not known.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform an 18-month randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study among
      relatively androgen deficient women with HIV, to determine the effects of testosterone
      administration on lean body mass. The administered dose will be 300 micrograms twice a week
      vs. identical placebo in the form of a transdermal preparation. Secondary endpoints include
      effects on bone density, quality of life, neurocognitive function and menstrual function.
      Open label administration at 300 micrograms twice a week will be initiated for 12 months in
      all subjects following the randomized portion of the study. Assuming a 15% dropout rate and
      25 randomized patients, the probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment
      difference at a two sided 5.000 percent significance level, if the true difference between
      the treatments is 2.7 kg. This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the
      response variable, lean body mass by DEXA, is 2.3 kg, as was shown by Choi et al1 over 12
      weeks in HIV-infected women at the same dose of 300 ug 2x/week.

    <measure>Quality of Life/Depression: Becks Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (time 0) to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Represents change in the mean score from baseline to 18 months. Depression was evaluated with the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI is a 21-item self-report instrument used to assess the presence and severity of symptoms of depression. A Total score in the range of 0-13 is considered minimal, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>

    <description>Represents change in measure from baseline to 18 months. The BISF is 22 items with seven domains: Thoughts and Desires, Arousal, Frequency of Sexual Activity, Receptivity/Initiation, Pleasure, Relationship Satisfaction, and Problems Affecting Sexual Function. Data from Domain 7: Problems Affecting Sexual Function is reported. The score range for this domain is -16 to 75,a higher score indicates greater sexual function.</description>

    <description>Represents number of subjects who reported this symptom from baseline to 18 months. Every 6 weeks,subjects were counseled on appropriate barrier contraception methods and a urine pregnancy was performed. Subjects who experienced increased hair growth (facial hair) could remain in the study on a lower dose of testosterone (1 patch per week), but dose reductions were not necessary and full dosing was continued throughout the study for all subjects. Changes in menstrual status, missed periods and/or irregular bleeding, were noted and reported back to the primary care physician if significant.</description>

    <measure>Neurocognitive Function: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-revised,&quot;Total Recall&quot; Z Score Represents Change in Z Score From Baseline to 18 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (time 0) to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test assesses verbal learning and memory. Subjects are given a list of 12 words and asked to repeat as many words as they can recall during 3 separate trials. The Total Recall Z score is calculated based on the sum of total correct responses for Trials 1,2,&amp; 3. A Z score of 0 equals the 50 percentile, a Z score of 1 is 1 standard deviation above the mean and a Z score of -1 is 1 standard deviation below the mean. The lowest and highest T scores for the HVLT-R are ≤20 and ≥80. This correlates to lowest and highest Z scores of ≤ -3.0 and ≥3.0. A lower Z score is indicative of poor recall.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment began in August, 2004 and continued through October, 2006. Subjects were recruited via poster advertisement at community health centers, hospitals, and AIDS Service Organizations, as well as newspaper advertisement and provider referral.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to randomization at the baseline visit, each subject's doctor was contacted to confirm safety of study enrollment. Subjects age 40 and older were required to have a mammogram performed within one year of study enrollment and provide results. Eligible subjects completed a pregnancy test at each visit and were excluded for a positive test.</pre_assignment_details>

Every 6 weeks,subjects were counseled on appropriate barrier contraception methods and a urine pregnancy was performed. Subjects who experienced increased hair growth (facial hair) could remain in the study on a lower dose of testosterone (1 patch per week), but dose reductions were not necessary and full dosing was continued throughout the study for all subjects. Changes in menstrual status, missed periods and/or irregular bleeding, were noted and reported back to the primary care physician if significant.</description>

        <title>Safety: Number of Subjects Reporting a Change in Hair Pattern (Increased Hair on Chin, Upper Lip, Chest, Abdomen, Fore Arms, and Legs)</title>
        <description>Represents number of subjects who reported this symptom from baseline to 18 months. Every 6 weeks,subjects were counseled on appropriate barrier contraception methods and a urine pregnancy was performed. Subjects who experienced increased hair growth (facial hair) could remain in the study on a lower dose of testosterone (1 patch per week), but dose reductions were not necessary and full dosing was continued throughout the study for all subjects. Changes in menstrual status, missed periods and/or irregular bleeding, were noted and reported back to the primary care physician if significant.</description>

        <title>Neurocognitive Function: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-revised,&quot;Total Recall&quot; Z Score Represents Change in Z Score From Baseline to 18 Months.</title>
        <description>This test assesses verbal learning and memory. Subjects are given a list of 12 words and asked to repeat as many words as they can recall during 3 separate trials. The Total Recall Z score is calculated based on the sum of total correct responses for Trials 1,2,&amp; 3. A Z score of 0 equals the 50 percentile, a Z score of 1 is 1 standard deviation above the mean and a Z score of -1 is 1 standard deviation below the mean. The lowest and highest T scores for the HVLT-R are ≤20 and ≥80. This correlates to lowest and highest Z scores of ≤ -3.0 and ≥3.0. A lower Z score is indicative of poor recall.</description>
