  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their
      growth. It may also stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. This
      phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with recurrent or
      metastatic head and neck cance

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response probability (confirmed, complete and partial responses) in
      patients with metastatic head and neck cancer who are treated with BAY 43-9006.

      II. To evaluate median progression-free survival and median overall survival. III. To
      evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen. IV. To investigate in a
      preliminary manner the effects of the agent on the Ras signal transduction pathway in tissue
      samples obtained prior to and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.3-8
      months.
