      RATIONALE: CP-547,632 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well CP-547,632 works in treating patients with
      recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of CP-547,632, in terms of clinical response benefit (CA 125
           response [complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)] or stable disease ≥ 16
           weeks), in patients with recurrent or persistent small-volume ovarian epithelial,
           primary peritoneal serous, or fallopian tube cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine CA 125 response (CR or PR) rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine duration of CA 125 response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate the steady state plasma concentration of this drug with efficacy and toxicity
           in these patients.

        -  Correlate clinical outcome with an angiogenic profile derived from measurement of serum
           vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-8 in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine changes in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral CP-547,632 once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
