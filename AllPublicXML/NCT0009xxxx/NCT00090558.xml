      Regular exercise reduces the risk of heart problems, in part because it improves the work of
      the endothelium (the cells that line blood vessels). Exercise appears to release precursor
      cells from the bone marrow that will later become endothelial cells. A molecule called nitric
      oxide (NO) appears to be involved in this release. However, some heart patients do not
      improve their endothelial function despite regular exercise. The researchers believe that the
      heart disease in these patients may interfere with the normal relationship between exercise
      and endothelial function. This study is designed to test whether giving a patient
      nitroglycerin (which is converted to NO in the bloodstream) will increase the release of
      endothelial precursor cells from the bone marrow. If the study succeeds, it may lead to
      improved healing of arteries in heart disease patients.

      Adults may be eligible for this study if they have coronary artery disease and do not take
      nitroglycerin or nitroglycerin-like medication on a daily basis.

      Volunteers will be admitted to the Clinical Center on 2 separate nights at least 1 week
      apart. On the morning after each admission, volunteers will have blood drawn from an arm vein
      for laboratory tests, and then walk on a treadmill until fatigue or discomfort prevents
      further exercise, or until asked to stop. On one of their admissions, volunteers will receive
      1 tablet of nitroglycerin under the tongue shortly before the treadmill test. Volunteers will
      be monitored by EKGs and blood pressure tests during the treadmill tests, and will have more
      blood drawn at about 15 minutes and 24 hours after each treadmill test. Researchers will
      examine the levels of endothelial precursor cells and nitric oxide in the blood samples taken
      before and after exercise.

      Exercise training has long been recommended as a means of improving cardiac function and
      reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). One
      mechanism of benefit may be through improved endothelial function and enhanced nitric oxide
      (NO) bioactivity, which may improve blood flow to exercising skeletal muscle and to the
      myocardium. We have recently determined in a collaborative study with the Suburban Hospital,
      however, that many CAD patients do not show improved endothelial function despite compliant
      participation in a three month cardiac rehabilitation program with exercise three times
      weekly. The initial data from this study suggest that improvement in endothelial function may
      be dependent on the release of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow into
      the circulation in response to the stimulus of repetitive exercise, with the potential of
      repairing damaged endothelium and improving endothelial function and NO release. Thus,
      patients who have poor EPC mobilization responses to exercise may have limited capacity to
      improve endothelial function over time and, conversely, patients with higher EPC mobilization
      responses to exercise may show improved endothelial function as a result of vascular repair.
      Animal models indicate that NO is necessary for EPC mobilization during exercise, likely
      through nitrosation reactions with key signaling proteins within bone marrow. In many CAD
      patients, NO release from endothelium and transport in blood to bone marrow may be
      compromised because of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and thus limit EPC mobilization and
      vascular repair. We hypothesize that the exogenous administration of NO to CAD patients may
      enhance EPC mobilization from bone marrow in response to exercise. If successful,
      administration of an NO donor (such as nitroglycerin) prior to exercise may extend the
      benefit of exercise to endothelial function-and thus cardiovascular risk-in a larger segment
      of CAD patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs.

        cholesterol greater than 250 mg/dL. Healthy subjects taking chronic prescription
        medications will be excluded.
