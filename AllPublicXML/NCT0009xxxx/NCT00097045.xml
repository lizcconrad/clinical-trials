      This study is designed to compare the safety, tolerability and antiviral effects of omega
      interferon administered alone to omega interferon administered with ribavirin in the
      treatment of subjects with chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

          -  At least one alanine aminotransferase level greater than the upper limit of normal
             between three months and twelve months prior to randomization

          -  For the duration of treatment with study drug for all subjects and for the duration of
             treatment with study drug plus an additional six months for subjects who take

               2. definitive exclusion by surgery, radiation, menopause or vasectomy

          -  For women of childbearing potential, negative serum Beta HCG pregnancy test within 14
