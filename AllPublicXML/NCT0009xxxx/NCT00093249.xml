    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of clevidipine injection versus
      placebo in treating preoperative hypertension.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initiation of study drug infusion will commence with the occurrence of protocol-defined
      preoperative hypertension (SBP &gt; 160 mmHg) as measured via an indwelling arterial line.

      The study drug (clevidipine or placebo) may be administered to treat hypertension until one
      hour has elapsed, or until induction of anesthesia, whichever occurs first.

      The primary endpoint of bailout described (as defined per protocol) as bailout for lack of
      efficacy, bailout for safety reason or bailout due to treatment failure will be determined
      during the 30-minute period from study drug initiation.

    <description>Clevidipine was administered in a blinded fashion by intravenous (IV) infusion, starting at a rate of 0.4 μg/kg/min (non weight-based equivalent is 2 mg/hr) and titrating upward, as tolerated, in doubling increments approximately every 90 seconds to achieve the desired blood pressure-lowering effect. Up-titration to 3.2 μg/kg/min (16 mg/hr) was allowed. Infusion rates above 3.2 μg/kg/min could be used, guided by the patient's response, by increasing in serial increments of 1.5 μg/kg/min up to the maximum recommended clevidipine infusion rate of 8.0 μg/kg/min. Clevidipine was to be administered for a minimum of 30 minutes, unless bailout occurred, and up to a maximum of one hour.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Placebo consisted of 20% lipid emulsion (the same lipid vehicle used for clevidipine) administered in a blinded fashion intravenously following the same study drug administration guidelines as with clevidipine study drug administration guidelines. As with clevidipine, placebo was to be administered for a minimum of 30 minutes, unless bailout occurred, and up to a maximum of one hour.</description>

    <description>Clevidipine (0.5 mg/mL in 20% lipid emulsion)will be administered intravenously at an initial infusion rate of 0.4 µg/kg/min and will be titrated, as tolerated, at the discretion of the investigator, in doubling increments approximately every 90 seconds up to a maximum of 3.2 µg/kg/min, in order to achieve the desired blood pressure lowering effect. Clevidipine may be titrated upwards or downwards and may be temporarily interrupted and restarted to attain the desired blood pressure effect. The maximum study drug infusion rate of 8.0 µg/kg/min may not be exceeded.</description>

             of starting study

        Post-randomization Inclusion Criteria:

          -  After the insertion of an arterial line, the patient is determined to meet the per
             protocol preoperative definition of hypertension, i.e. systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;
             160 mmHg

          -  It is the investigator's intent to lower the patient's SBP by a minimum of 15% from
             its baseline value
