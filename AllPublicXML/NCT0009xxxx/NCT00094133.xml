      flashes in breast cancer survivors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of hypnosis in controlling hot flashes in women who are breast
           cancer survivors.

        -  Determine the extent to which hypnotizability is related to the success of the
           hypnotherapy intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are stratified according to age,
      gender, race, and educational background. All patients complete a Hot Flash Daily Diary to
      record frequency and severity of hot flashes for 1 week. Patients are then randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (hypnotherapy): Patients undergo hypnotherapy once a week for 5 weeks. Patients
           complete the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale, the Hospital Depression and
           Anxiety Sub-scale, the CES Depression Scale, and the MOS-Sleep and Sexual Function
           Scales in week 5 after the last hypnotherapy intervention. Patients also complete
           another Hot Flash Daily Diary for 1 week in week 6 and are administered the Stanford
           Hypnotic Clinical Scale in week 7.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive no contact for 4 weeks. Patients complete the
           questionnaires as in arm I in week 5. Patients also complete another Hot Flash Daily
           Diary for 1 week in week 6 and are administered the Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale in
           week 7.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
