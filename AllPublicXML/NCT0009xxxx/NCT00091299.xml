      RATIONALE: Vatalanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Warfarin may be effective in preventing the formation of blood clots in patients who are
      undergoing treatment for advanced solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well giving warfarin together with vatalanib
      works in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the acute and chronic changes in INR in patients with advanced solid tumors
           treated with low-dose warfarin and vatalanib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) phase: Patients receive oral low-dose warfarin once daily on days
           1-14 and oral vatalanib once daily, 1 hour before warfarin administration, on days 2-14
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Continuation phase: Patients not experiencing a drug interaction in the PK phase
           continue to receive oral vatalanib and oral low-dose warfarin once daily. Patients
           experiencing a drug interaction (INR &gt; 2.0) in the PK phase receive oral vatalanib alone
           once daily. Continuation therapy continues indefinitely in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
