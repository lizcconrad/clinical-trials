      This dose comparison study, taking place at over 200 sites worldwide, will compare the
      dosing, safety and efficacy of an investigational medicine OPC-6535 to the dosing, safety and
      efficacy of Asacol ® in the maintenance of remission in subjects with ulcerative colitis.

      Objective(s):

      This study will compare the safety and efficacy of 25 mg per day (QD) and 50 mg QD of
      OPC-6535 to 800 mg twice a day (BID) of Asacol® in the maintenance of remission in subjects
      with ulcerative colitis.

      Subject Population:

        -  Subjects with ulcerative colitis currently in remission defined as rectal bleeding (RB)
           and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) scores of 0, on or off a stable dose of sulfasalazine or
           5-ASA products for at least 6 weeks.

        -  Subjects must have had the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis established by prior
           colonoscopy or undergo colonoscopy in lieu of flexible sigmoidoscopy during the
           Screening Period.

        -  Subjects must have had treatment for a flare of ulcerative colitis, with symptomatic
           onset of remission occurring no more than 52 weeks from the Screening Period.

        -  Subjects may not have used corticosteroids, topical agents (corticosteroid or 5-ASA
           enemas, suppositories, foams), azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate within 6
           weeks of the Screening Period. Upon entry, sulfasalazine and 5-ASA containing products
           will be discontinued.

      Safety: Vital signs, ECGs, laboratory studies (including hematology, clinical chemistry, and
      urinalysis), and adverse events.
