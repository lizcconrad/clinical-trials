    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter outpatient study is designed to
      test the safety and tolerability of AC2592 as well as examine the effect of AC2592 on oxygen
      consumption during maximal tolerated exercise in adult subjects with chronic congestive heart
      failure.
