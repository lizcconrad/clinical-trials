      The primary objective of this study is to compare the QVAR-Easi-Breathe 100 mcg/day and
      QVAR-Easi-Breathe 200 mcg/day with placebo relative to changes in forced expiratory volume in
      1 second (FEV1) results following 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives such as daily
      asthma symptoms scores (per week), morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) values, nocturnal
      awakening and utilization of rescue medication per day also will be evaluated. In addition,
      an exploratory evaluation will assess the comparability of the two devices (i.e.,
      QVAR-Easi-Breathe versus QVAR-MDI) at the same dose levels.
