  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was not conducted in the United States. Many people with type 2 diabetes also have
      high cholesterol levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of
      vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, on blood lipid measures such as triglycerides and
      cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes.
