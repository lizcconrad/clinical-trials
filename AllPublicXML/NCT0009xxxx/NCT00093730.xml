      RATIONALE: BMS-599626 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BMS-599626 in
      treating patients with metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, biologically active dose, and recommended phase II
           dose(s) of BMS-599626 in patients with metastatic HER2/neu-overexpressing primary solid
           tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on biomarkers and predictive markers of HER1 and HER2
           in skin and tumor in these patients.

        -  Evaluate tumor metabolic activity in response to this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, evidence of anti-tumor activity of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral BMS-599626 once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-599626 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 20 patients are
      treated at that dose level.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
