  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their
      growth. This phase II trial is studying how well lapatinib works in treating patients with
      recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with lapatinib.

      II. Determine the progression-free survival, time to progression, and overall survival of
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to
      prior epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-88 patients (21-50 epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]
      inhibitor-naive patients [cohort A] and 19-38 EGFR inhibitor-pre-treated patients [cohort B])
      will be accrued for this study within 4-12.6 months.

    <description>Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be performed to examine the magnitude and significance of pre-post treatment changes. To determine whether these markers are correlated with tumor response, both the baseline levels and the pre-post changes will be compared between responders and non-responders using the nonparametric, Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The correlative data will also be entered as covariates into a Cox regression model to determine whether they are predictive of progression-free and overall survival.</description>
