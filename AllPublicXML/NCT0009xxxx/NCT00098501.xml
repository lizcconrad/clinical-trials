  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of CCI-779
      and EKB-569 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as CCI-779, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. EKB-569 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth. Giving CCI-779 together with EKB-569
      may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of CCI-779 and EKB-569 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the response
      rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      Group I: Patients receive oral EKB-569 on days 1-28 and oral CCI-779 on days 1-7 and 15-21.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of EKB-569 and CCI-779 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Group II: Patients receive oral EKB-569 at the MTD on days 4-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of
      all subsequent courses and CCI-779 at the MTD on days 1-3 and 15-17.

      Group III: Patients receive EKB-569 at the MTD as in group I and oral CCI-779 at the MTD on
      days 7-9 and 19-21 of course 1 and days 1-3 and 15-17 of all subsequent courses.

      In all groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-42 patients (18-30 for group I, 6 for group II, and 6 for
      group III) will be accrued for this study within 1.35-1.75 years.
