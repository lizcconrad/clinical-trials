      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of of clevidipine versus placebo in
      treating postoperative hypertension. Approximately 100 patients with postoperative
      hypertension undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery
      bypass (OPCAB) or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or
      valve replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups: clevidipine or placebo.

      The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of clevidipine versus placebo in treating
      postoperative hypertension by comparing the incidence of bailout in the clevidipine and
      placebo treatment groups during the 30-minute time period from initiation of study drug.
      Secondary objectives included assessments of efficacy through measuring time to target blood
      pressure (BP) lowering effect defined as 15% reduction in SBP, change in mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) and the incidence of bailout by causality. Assessments for safety included
      change in heart rate (HR) from baseline.

    <description>Clevidipine was administered in a blinded fashion intravenously, starting with an infusion rate of 0.4 μg/kg/min (non weight-based equivalent is 2 mg/hr), titrating upward, as tolerated by the patient, in doubling increments approximately every 90 seconds up to an infusion rate of 3.2 μg/kg/min (16 mg/hr) to achieve the desired blood pressure-lowering effect. Up-titration to infusion rates above 3.2 μg/kg/min could be used, guided by the patient's response, by increasing the infusion rate in serial increments of 1.5 μg/kg/min, up to the maximum recommended clevidipine infusion rate of 8.0 μg/kg/min. Clevidipine was to be administered for a minimum of 30 minutes, unless bailout occurred, and up to a maximum of one hour.</description>

    <description>Placebo consisted of 20% lipid emulsion (the same lipid vehicle used for clevidipine) administered in a blinded fashion intravenously following the same study drug administration guidelines as with clevidipine study drug administration guidelines. As with clevidipine, placebo was to be administered for a minimum of 30 minutes, unless bailout occurred, and up to a maximum of one hour.</description>
