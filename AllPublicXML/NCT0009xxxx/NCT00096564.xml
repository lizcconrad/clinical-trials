      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to identify areas of brain activation during the
      urge to yawn. Little is known about how yawning is suppressed, or why yawning often occurs in
      response to seeing another person yawn (contagious yawning). Contagious yawning is similar to
      other contagious motor programs, such as the greater urge Tourette subjects feel to tic when
      seeing repetitive movements or other subjects' tics, the urge to scratch when discussing
      itching and scratching, or the urge to urinate when hearing running water. Hypothetically,
      the urge or the suppression of this urge is modulated by a common cortical circuit implicated
      in Tourette syndrome. We plan to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify
      the pattern of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation in the brain when normal
      volunteers feel the urge to yawn.

      Study Population: We intend to study 25 normal, right-handed, healthy volunteers.

      Study Design: Using an event-related design, we will scan subjects, using the same 3T fMRI
      scanner, while showing a video of a person yawning, gaping, coughing, or doing nothing. Each
      of these four action stimuli will last for four seconds, with varying interstimulus
      intervals. Each video set will contain all actions displayed ten times pseudorandomly. Two
      data sets will be collected from each subject and will be separated by a brief rest period.
      Subjects will be instructed before the scan to watch a videotaped person perform various
      behaviors, without detailing the specific actions. So as not to influence their natural
      response to the yawning stimulus, we will instruct them only to keep their head still. The
      variable of interest will be the activation during urge-generation, contrasted with other
      control stimuli. A survey will be administered for informational purposes following the scan
      to assess the subjects' general impression of their susceptibility to yawning, whether they
      yawned in the scanner, whether they suppressed the urge to yawn, and if the urge to yawn
      increased or decreased with the repetition of the yawning segment.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome of this study is the activation of brain structures in
      response to viewing another person yawning. In particular, we are interested in the
      activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, parietal operculum, insula, supplementary motor
      area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as these are areas implicated in the urge to move in
      response to either internal (as in Tourette syndrome) or external (as in itching from
      histamine injection) states. Since the urge to yawn is the process of interest, suppression
      of yawning is not relevant to the fMRI analysis.

      Purpose of this study

      This study will look at how perception and observation of various facial expressions may
      affect the way different areas of the brain function. We hope to gain a greater understanding
      of abnormal movements, such as tics, by investigating how facial expressions affect the
      brain.

      Background Information

      This study is based on prior research that focuses on the activity and changes in different
      areas of the brain depending on what people see others around them doing. An example is the
      feeling of empathy one might have when looking at a sad face, or anxiety and fear when
      looking at an angry face.

      Who is the Study Population?

      20 healthy, right-handed men and women
