  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well decitabine works in treating
      patients with myelofibrosis, a cancer of the blood system associated with fibrosis (scar
      tissue) in the bone marrow that is advanced and for which there is no standard therapy.
      Decitabine may block the actions of some proteins that are responsible for turning certain
      genes off in various cancers including myelofibrosis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response rate (complete and partial responses and hematological improvement)
      to decitabine in patients with myelofibrosis.

      II. To determine the safety of decitabine in patients with myelofibrosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of decitabine on specific epigenetic changes including
      methylation status of specific target genes and gene re-expression.

      II. To determine the effect of decitabine on hemoglobin F levels and on the absolute numbers
      of circulating cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ progenitor cells and to investigate the
      potential utility of these markers as a surrogate for biologic activity of decitabine in
      myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every
      42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Samples are then analyzed by flow cytometry, and CD34+ cells quantitated after 75,000 CD45 events are studied. (At least 75,000 CD45 events must be studied to ensure accuracy of the assay). Absolute numbers are determined by multiplying the % CD34+ cells by the total white blood cell count obtained on a CBC that is processed simultaneously.</description>

        <description>CD34 positive(+) cells are determined by flow immunostaining and light scatter in peripheral blood. Samples are then analyzed by flow cytometry, and CD34+ cells quantitated after 75,000 CD45 events are studied. (At least 75,000 CD45 events must be studied to ensure accuracy of the assay). Absolute numbers are determined by multiplying the % CD34+ cells by the total white blood cell count obtained on a CBC that is processed simultaneously.</description>
