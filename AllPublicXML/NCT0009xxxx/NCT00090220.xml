  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to assess the safety, immunogenicity, efficacy and long-term
      effectiveness of a vaccine being evaluated for the prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV)
      infection and disease in mid-adult women.

      The Base study vaccination period (V501-019) encompassed Day 1 through Month 7, during which
      time participants received randomly assigned, blinded Gardasilâ„¢ (V501, qHPV vaccine) or
      placebo at Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6. The Base study follow-up period continued through
      approximately Month 48.

      The base study was extended in protocol V501-019-10 (EXT1). Participants who received placebo
      and participants who received only 1 dose of qHPV vaccine in the Base Study were offered a
      complete, open-label, 3-dose qHPV vaccine regimen (administered at EXT1 Day 1, Month 2 and
      Month 6). Participants who received only 2 doses of qHPV vaccine in the base study were
      offered a single additional dose of qHPV vaccine (administered at EXT1 Day 1). Participants
      were followed to EXT1 Month 7.

      A Long Term Follow-Up (LTFU) extension study V501-019-21 (EXT2) was added to observe the long
      term safety, effectiveness, and immunogenicity of qHPV vaccine in approximately 1,600 women
      who participated in the Base Study at sites in Colombia. Data were collected over a period of
      6-10 years following participant's enrollment in the original Base Study.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in or prolongs a hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is a cancer, or is an overdose. Vaccine-related SAEs are those deemed by the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to study vaccine.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Vaccine- or Placebo-Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in the Base Study</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an adverse event. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in or prolongs a hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is a cancer, or is an overdose. Vaccine-related SAEs are those deemed by the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to study vaccine.</description>

        <description>Serum antibodies to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were determined by Competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA).
