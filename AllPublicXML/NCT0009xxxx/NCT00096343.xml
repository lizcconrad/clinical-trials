      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy
      before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. Combining paclitaxel with
      carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with carboplatin
      works in treating women who are undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed, locally advanced
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical and pathological response in women with newly diagnosed, locally
           advanced operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising
           paclitaxel and carboplatin.

        -  Evaluate specific biomarkers for prognostic value and as markers for response/resistance
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients with non-palpable lymph nodes undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy within 4 weeks
      before beginning neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      All patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo lumpectomy or modified radical mastectomy. Patients with a positive sentinel
      lymph node biopsy or palpable axillary adenopathy undergo axillary lymph node dissection. All
      patients undergoing lumpectomy or mastectomy with high-risk disease also undergo
      radiotherapy.

      Patients refusing lumpectomy or mastectomy due to persistence of disease may undergo core
      needle biopsy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
