      Women pregnant with twins or triplets are at high risk of preterm birth, yet no intervention
      or approach has served to reduce this risk. A recently completed trial by the NICHD sponsored
      Maternal Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network has, for the first time, demonstrated a
      treatment that substantially reduces the rate of preterm birth in women at high risk for
      preterm delivery (i.e. progesterone therapy). Preterm birth was reduced by 35% among
      progesterone-treated women with a singleton pregnancy when compared with women receiving
      placebo. The current trial compares weekly treatment by injection of progesterone with
      placebo in women pregnant with twins or triplets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with multifetal gestation face numerous risks in excess of those faced by women with
      singleton gestation. Preterm birth is by far the most common and the most significant of
      these problems, yet no intervention or approach has served to reduce this risk. The
      prevalence of preterm birth has risen dramatically in recent years, in large part due to
      Assisted Reproductive Technologies. Consequently, the problem of preterm birth has assumed an
      even greater role in contributing to perinatal morbidity and mortality. The recently
      completed trial by the NICHD sponsored Maternal Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network has, for
      the first time, demonstrated a treatment (i.e. progesterone therapy) that substantially
      reduces the rate of preterm birth in women at high risk for preterm delivery because of a
      prior spontaneous preterm birth . Preterm birth was reduced by 35% among progesterone-treated
      women when compared with women receiving placebo. Given this dramatic benefit and the
      extremely high risk of preterm birth in women with multifetal gestation, a trial to evaluate
      the benefit of progesterone in women with multifetal pregnancy is appropriate and timely.
      This protocol outlines a randomized, double-masked clinical trial comparing weekly treatment
      by injection of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) with placebo in women with twin
      or triplet gestation. In an ancillary study, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 17P
      in multifetal gestation will be studied.

      This trial aims to enroll six hundred women with twin gestation and one hundred twenty women
      with triplet gestation between 16 weeks 0 days to 20 weeks 6 days. At the initial screening
      evaluation, and after signing the informed consent form, the patient will receive an
      injection of the placebo (1 ml inert castor oil). She will be asked to return after three
      days for randomization. During this compliance test period, an ultrasound exam will be
      scheduled, if not previously done. When the patient returns and if she still meets the
      inclusion criteria, she will be randomized to one of two treatments:

        -  17 a-hydroxyprogesterone caproate: weekly 1 ml injections containing 250 mg of 17P

        -  Placebo: weekly injections of 1 ml placebo inert castor oil

      Treatment will be given through 34 weeks 6 days gestation or delivery. At the time of consent
      to the main study, the patient will also be asked to participate in an ancillary study. If
      she agrees, she will have 30 cc of blood drawn at 24-28 weeks and at 32-35 weeks gestation. A
      pelvic exam will be done at the same two times to collect vaginal specimens and to determine
      Bishop score.

             other prior reductions.

          -  Gestational age between 16 weeks 0 days to 20 weeks 6 days based on clinical
             information and evaluation of the first ultrasound.

          -  Signed patient authorization and consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior elective fetal reduction in the current pregnancy, except in the case of a
             quadruplet gestation reduced to triplets.

             abnormalities). An ultrasound examination from 12 weeks 0 days to 20 weeks 6 days by
             project estimated date of confinement (EDC) must be performed to rule out fetal
             anomalies

          -  Discordance in fetal size, defined as a discrepancy of 3 or more weeks in gestational
             age by ultrasound between the largest and the smallest fetus. Diagnosis is based on
             measurements made at the ultrasound done between 12 weeks 0 days and 20 weeks 6 days
             gestation

          -  Progesterone treatment used or planned after 14 weeks gestation

             molecular weight heparin during the current pregnancy, or thromboembolic disease for
             which such heparin treatment is planned (because of contraindication to intra-muscular
             injections)

             diabetes managed with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents

          -  Inability to arrange a pre-randomization ultrasound between 12 weeks 0 days and 20
             weeks 6 days gestation

             delivery or neonatal morbidity or mortality

          -  Prenatal follow-up or delivery planned elsewhere (unless the study visits can be made
             as scheduled and complete outcome information can be obtained)
