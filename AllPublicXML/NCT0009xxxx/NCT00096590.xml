      RATIONALE: A test that detects abnormal blood clotting in patients with cancer may help
      doctors plan cancer surgery.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at a new blood test to detect abnormal clotting in
      patients with metastatic cancer undergoing surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether whole blood thrombin generation assay (WBTGA) detects
           hypercoagulability in patients with metastatic carcinoma compared with a healthy control
           group.

        -  Determine whether results of the WBTGA will change as a result of major surgery
           performed on patients with metastatic carcinoma.

        -  Establish a reference interval for the WBTGA using healthy controls.

      Secondary

        -  Compare a battery of plasma components known to affect or reflect coagulant or
           fibrinolytic reactions in patients with metastatic carcinoma vs healthy controls.

        -  Establish reference intervals for this battery of tests using healthy controls.

        -  Determine how major surgery in cancer patients affects this battery of factors.

        -  Identify changes in these factors that correlate with changes in the WBTGA.

        -  Compare the results of WBTGA tests in patients who develop venous thromboembolism (VTE)
           with those who do not.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Blood samples of patients are collected on day -7 and day 1 after surgery.

      Blood samples of healthy controls are collected once.

      After collection, blood samples are analyzed for hypercoagulability by whole blood thrombin
      generation assay. Routine blood tests are performed, as are immunoenzyme techniques for
      antigenic tissue plasminogen activator and its inhibitor, thrombin-antithrombin complexes,
      tissue factor, factor VIIa, D-dimer, and glycocalicin.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients and 30 healthy controls will be accrued for this
      study.
