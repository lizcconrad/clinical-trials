      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well SB-715992 works in treating patients with
      locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of SB-715992, in terms of response rate and stable disease rate,
           in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the early progression rate and response duration in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetics with safety and efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor expression of β-tubulin and kinesin spindle protein with clinical
           outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with ongoing stable or responding disease are
      followed every 3 months until relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14
      months.
