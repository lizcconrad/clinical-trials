      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  The effectiveness of olanzapine as compared to quetiapine in treating and preventing the
           recurrence of a variety of symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in
           patients who are obese or overweight.

        -  The safety of olanzapine as compared to quetiapine.
