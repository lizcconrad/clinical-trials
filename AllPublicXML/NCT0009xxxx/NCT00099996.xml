    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of 40 mg of ezetimibe (Zetia ) daily in
      lowering blood levels of cholesterol and of the plant sterols sitosterol and campesterol in
      patients with homozygous sitosterolemia, an inherited disorder of sterol metabolism. (Sterols
      are alcohol substances found in animal and plant fats.) In this disorder, an excess of many
      plant sterols is absorbed and not enough excreted. Patients can develop atherosclerosis and
      coronary heart disease as early as childhood, as well as other problems including arthritis,
      arthralgia, and tendon xanthomas (lipid deposits). Current treatment consists of ezetimibe 10
      mg, dietary restriction of plant and shellfish sterols, and bile salt binding resins.
      Ezetimibe is a cholesterol-lowering drug that inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol
      and structurally related plant sterols across the intestinal wall.

      Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia who are between 18 and 85 years of age have completed
      NHLBI's 1-year study of ezetimibe at 10 mg a day may be eligible for this study.

      All participants maintain their current stable diet and take a 10-mg pill of ezetimibe daily
      for 26 weeks. They are also randomly selected to take either an additional 30-mg pill of
      ezetimibe or a placebo (look-alike pill with no active ingredients). Patients fast for at
      least 12 hours before each of 6 visits scheduled during the course of the study. At these
      visits, patients undergo some or all of the following procedures for monitoring their health
      and evaluating their response to treatment:

        -  Medical history and review of medications

        -  Physical examination

        -  Measurement of vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and temperature)

        -  Review of dietary maintenance

        -  Measurements of height, weight, and waist circumference

        -  Measurement (with ruler) and photographs of non-Achilles xanthoma

        -  X-ray of Achilles tendon

        -  Blood draw and urine collection

        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

      Homozygous Sitosterolemia is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of sterol metabolism.
      Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia experience accelerated atherosclerosis with initial
      coronary heart disease (CHD) events occurring in childhood. Plasma concentrations of
      sitosterol and other dietary plant sterols are markedly elevated in homozygous sitosterolemic
      patients, and are characteristic of this disorder. Sitosterolemic individuals demonstrate a
      range of abnormalities in sterol absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Recent reports have
      shown that sitosterolemia can result from mutations in 1 of 2 ATP-binding cassette
      half-transporters (ABCG5 or ABCG8), which are responsible for regulation of non-cholesterol
      sterols in the body.

      Current treatment of homozygous sitosterolemia consists of ezetimibe 10 mg, dietary
      restriction of plant and shellfish sterols, as well as the use of bile salt binding resins.
      Ezetimibe is the first member of a new class of cholesterol-lowering agents that inhibits the
      intestinal absorption of cholesterol and structurally-related noncholesterol sterols (plant
      sterols) across the intestinal wall. Importantly, ezetimibe is not an inhibitor or inducer of
      CYP450, reducing the potential for drug-drug interactions which renders ezetimibe a
      particularly appealing candidate with other drugs. Ezetimibe has proved to be generally safe
      and well-tolerated as monotherapy or when coadministered with statins, with an overall
      clinical adverse experience profile similar to placebo. In clinical studies with
      hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetemibe doses ranging from 0.25 to 40 mg daily for periods
      of 8 to 12 weeks were more effective than placebo in lowering plasma TC and LDL-C
      concentrations. There were no dose-related increase in adverse experiences or laboratory
      abnormalities in these studies. We will investigate whether a higher dose of ezetimibe is
      safe and efficacious in lowering plant sterols in patients with sitosterolemia.
