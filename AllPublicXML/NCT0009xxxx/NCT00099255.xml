      This multi-center, phase II study will be conducted to define the toxicity profile and
      antitumor activity of SGN-30 in patients with pcALCL and other closely related
      lymphoproliferative disorders.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients must have a definite diagnosis.

          -  Patients must be histologically confirmed CD30 positive within 3 months of enrollment

          -  Patients with pcALCL must have target lesions present for at least 1 month without
             spontaneous regression

          -  pcALCL patients must have failed treatment with local radiation therapy, or failed
             systemic therapy of a single agent

          -  Patients must be considered an eligible candidate for systemic therapy as determined
             by the investigator

          -  All patients must have a three week wash-out from previous treatments, unless in the
             opinion of the investigator it is not in the best interest of the patient, at which
             point the individual case must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of &lt; 2 (Appendix B) and a life
             expectancy &gt; six months.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must be available for periodic blood sampling, study-related assessments, and
             management of toxicity at the treating institution.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative HCG pregnancy test result
             within three days of enrollment. All patients must agree to use an effective
             contraceptive method during the course of the study.

          -  Patients must give written informed consent.

          -  Required baseline laboratory data: Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to
             to 1,000/mm3, Platelet count greater than or equal to 75,000/mm3, Serum bilirubin less
             than or equal to 1.5 times ULN, Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN,
             BUN less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN, SGOT less than or equal to 2.5 ULN, SGPT less
             than or equal to 2.5 ULN

        Criteria for Exclusion

          -  Patients with Sezary syndrome, or any type of lymphoproliferative disease other than
             pcALCL, T-MF or LyP

          -  Patients with systemic ALCL or extracutaneous involvement of cutaneous ALCL

          -  Patients with known active systemic viral, bacterial, or fungal infection

          -  Patients who are known to be HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C positive

          -  Patients who have been treated previously with any anti-CD30 antibody

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or any excipient
             contained in the drug formulation

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies during the past five years with the
             exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical
             carcinoma in situ

          -  Patients with symptomatic cardiac disease including ventricular dysfunction, coronary
             artery disease, or arrhythmias

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Patients with any serious underlying medical condition that would impair their ability
             to receive or tolerate the planned treatment

          -  Patients with dementia or altered mental status that would preclude understanding and
             rendering of informed consent
