      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a two-dose schedule
      of the recombinant plague vaccine rF1V in healthy volunteers when given as an intramuscular
      (IM) injection at four ascending dose-levels. The purpose of the Cohort 4 Extension is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of a third intramuscular (IM) dose of 160 ug rF1V in
      healthy volunteers who have previously been vaccinated with the same concentration of rF1V
      vaccine.

      The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed as an open-label, single-center, dose-escalation study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of rF1V in
      healthy volunteers at four dose-levels (20 ug, 40 ug, 80 ug and 160 ug rF1V) in four
      sequential cohorts. The protocol was amended 26 January 2006 to recruit volunteers from
      Cohort 4 to participate in an Extension. Cohort 4 Extension volunteers will receive a third
      vaccination at day E-0. Day E-0 (-1) should not exceed Day 240 of the Phase 1 study.
