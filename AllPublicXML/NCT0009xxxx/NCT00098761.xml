      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as VNP40101M, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of VNP40101M in
      treating young patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of VNP40101M in
           pediatric patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug and its active metabolite VNP4090CE in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      receiving ≥ 1 of the following prior therapies: craniospinal irradiation (yes vs no),
      autologous bone marrow transplant (yes vs no), and &gt; 2 myelosuppressive chemotherapy or
      myelosuppressive biologic therapy regimens (yes vs no).

      Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 42 days
      for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 2-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 25% of patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-60 patients (2-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 18 months.
