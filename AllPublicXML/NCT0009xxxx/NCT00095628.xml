  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well SB-715992 works in treating patients with recurrent
      or metastatic head and neck cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the antitumor activity of SB-715992 in recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck using objective response rates (partial and complete
      responses).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of objective response, rate and duration of stable disease,
      progression-free, median and overall survival rates of SB-715992 in recurrent and/or
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      II. To document the safety and tolerability of SB-715992 in recurrent and/or metastatic
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      III. To characterize the population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SB-715992 including an
      assessment of significant covariates on SB-715992 PK and an assessment of the potential
      relationships between the pharmacokinetics of SB-715992 and relevant safety and efficacy
      endpoints.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

             criterion; for patients who received local therapy prior to study entry, there must be
             either progression of measurable disease documented within the treatment field, or
             must have measurable disease outside the treatment field prior to study entry

             the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of SB-715992 will be
             determined following review of their use by the TREATING RESPONSIBLE investigator;
             patients receiving nonprohibited medications or substances known to interact with
             CYP450 isoenzymes may be eligible but should be monitored carefully; questions about

             there is increased vigilance with respect to monitoring INR. If medically appropriate
             and treatment available, the investigator may also consider switching these patients
             to LMW heparin, where an interaction with SB-715992 is not expected

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception

             the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with non-squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck or nasopharyngeal
             cancer

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from AEs due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within 28 days of
             study entry

             hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study

          -  The following lists of medications/substances are moderate to significant
             inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 that, if administered concomitantly with SB-715992, may
             alter study drug exposure; the use of these medications/substances within 14 days (&gt;=
             6 months for amiodarone) prior to the administration of the first dose of SB-715992
             through discontinuation from the study is prohibited

               -  Inhibitors of CYP3A4:

                    -  Antibiotics: clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin

                    -  Antifungals: itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole (doses &gt; 200 mg/day),
                       voriconazole

                    -  Antidepressants: nefazodone, fluovoxamine

                    -  Calcium channel blockers: verapamil, diltiazem

                    -  Miscellaneous: amiodarone*, grapefruit juice, bitter orange

                         -  Use of amiodarone within 6 months prior to the administration of the
                            first dose of SB-715992 is prohibited

               -  Inducers of CYP3A4:

                    -  Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine

                    -  Antibiotics: rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine

                    -  Miscellaneous: St. John's wort, modafinil

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to SB-715992

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SB-715992 is a mitotic inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with SB-715992, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with SB-715992
