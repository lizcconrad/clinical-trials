      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and VNP40101M, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Temozolomide may also help VNP40101M kill more cancer cells by making cancer cells
      more sensitive to the drug. Giving temozolomide together with VNP40101M may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temozolomide and
      VNP40101M in treating patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide and VNP40101M in patients with
           relapsed or refractory leukemias.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide twice daily on days 1-3 (for 5 doses) followed by
      VNP401010M IV over 15-60 minutes on day 3 (course 1). Patients achieving a complete or
      partial response or having ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow blasts may receive a second course
      of therapy no earlier than day 43. Courses may be repeated approximately every 6 weeks at the
      discretion of the sponsor and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until a dose that depletes
      leukemic blast AGT in at least 4 of 6 patients is determined. Once this dose is determined,
      cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP401010M until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
