  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of Albuferon in subjects with hepatitis C (HEP C) who failed to
      respond to previous interferon alfa therapy.

        Major Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of chronic HEP C established on the basis of detectable
             viral load, as measured by a serum HCV RNA test during the screening period.

          -  Have previously failed to respond to treatment with any interferon alfa (IFNa) product

          -  Have compensated liver disease with the following minimum criteria: white blood cell
             count &gt; 3,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 2,000/mm3, platelets &gt;
             125,000/mm3, and hemoglobin (Hb) &gt; 13 g/dL for males or &gt; 12 g/dL for females.

        Major Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of decompensated cirrhosis or portal hypertension.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  History of any other medical disease or condition that would make the subject (in the
