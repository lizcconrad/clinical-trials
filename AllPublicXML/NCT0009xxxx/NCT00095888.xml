    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining 3-AP with gemcitabine in treating
      patients who have refractory metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Combining 3-AP with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine antitumor activity of 3-AP (Triapine®) and gemcitabine by
      measuring tumor size in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary I. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. II.
      Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the effect of multidrug resistance polymorphisms on pharmacokinetics and
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 3 years after registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-75 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
