  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study where each patient will receive TOCOSOL(R) Paclitaxel 120mg/m2
      every week for first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be followed to
      determine the efficacy of treatment (as measured by objective response rate), and the safety
      associated with weekly administration of TOCOSOL Paclitaxel.

      This is an open label, non-randomized Phase 2 study of weekly administration of TOCOSOL
      Paclitaxel at a dose level, 120mg/m2, known to be tolerated based on Phase 2a studies of this
      investigational agent in patients with other histological diagnoses. This study is a fixed
      sample size design with no planned early stopping decision. The goals of the study include
      the determination of the safety of TOCOSOL Paclitaxel, and the objective response rate,
      defined by RECIST criteria as complete responses plus partial responses.
