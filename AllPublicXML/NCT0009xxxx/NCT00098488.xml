  <official_title>A Phase 1 Study of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (NSC 330507; IND 57,966) and Rituximab in Patients With Relapsed B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</official_title>

      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin when given with or without rituximab in treating
      patients with relapsed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or prolymphocytic leukemia. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some find cancer cells and kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Others
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Monoclonal antibodies may kill
      cancer cells that are left after chemotherapy. Giving
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin with or without rituximab may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of twice weekly
      17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in combination with weekly rituximab in
      patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      II. To examine the pharmacology of twice weekly 17-AAG in combination with weekly rituximab
      in patients with relapsed CLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity (using NCI CTCAE v3.0 criteria) and preliminary efficacy of twice
      weekly 17-AAG when used in combination with weekly rituximab in this patient population.

      II. To examine the kinetics of depletion of PDK1/AKT-related proteins, mutant p53 and
      up-regulation of alternative targets that mediate resistance to therapy following treatment
      with twice weekly 17-AAG; and the relationship of this to spontaneous and drug-induced
      apoptosis in patients with relapsed CLL.

      III. To examine the immunologic effects of twice weekly 17-AAG, in conjunction with weekly
      rituximab, in patients with relapsed CLL.

      IV. To evaluate toxicity and preliminary efficacy of twice weekly 17-AAG as a single agent in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).

      Patients receive 17-AAG intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 18
      (course 1). Patients achieving ≥ 25% reduction in measurable disease after course 1 receive
      an additional course of single-agent 17-AAG approximately 10 days later in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and provided absolute lymphocyte count continues
      to decrease. Patients failing to achieve a 25% reduction in measurable disease after course 1
      OR with disease progression after courses 1 or 2 of single-agent 17-AAG proceed to
      combination therapy comprising 17-AAG IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, and 22;
      and rituximab IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 and over 1 hour on days 4, 8, 15, and 22 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG as a single agent or in
      combination with rituximab until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed up at 2 months and then every 3 months for 2 years.
