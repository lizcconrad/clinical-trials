      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of an approved medication being studied
      in support of a new approach in the prevention of exercise-induced asthma (a worsening of
      asthma caused by exercise, also known as exercise-induced bronchospasm), in patients who have
      a history of worsening asthma after exercise.
