    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) for Adolescent
      Drug Abusers to treatment as usual (TAU).

      An additional follow up assessment, funded by an American Recovery &amp; Reinvestment Act (ARRA)
      grant, was completed 5 years post randomization in order to examine the long term effects of
      outpatient treatments for illicit drug using adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent drug abuse continues to be one of the most pressing public health issues in the
      United Statesâ€”our nation's teenagers continue to use illicit drugs at a worrisome rate. Broad
      reviews of the treatment outcome literature indicate that family interventions in general,
      and Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) in particular, are effective with drug using youth.
      This study is designed to compare BSFT to treatment as usual (TAU). The researchers believe
      that BSFT will be much more effective than TAU in reducing adolescent drug use. They will
      also examine which of these treatment approaches does a better job of engaging adolescents
      and family members in treatment, decreasing problem behaviors, decreasing sexually risky
      behaviors, increasing pro-social activities (e.g., school, work), and improving the
      functioning of the family.

      With the addition of the extended follow up, we have the opportunity to examine the
      sustainability of study outcomes into early adulthood, filling a gap in the treatment
      research literature about the long-term effects of adolescent substance abuse treatment. The
      follow up study examined the long term effectiveness of BSFT compared to TAU in the rates of
      substance use, number of arrests and externalizing behaviors, in youth who received study
      treatments at the time when they were adolescents.

    <time_frame>Number of self reported drug use days from 28 days prior to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measured drug use. At baseline, TLFB identified drug use in the 28-day period that preceded the baseline assessment. At all other time points the TLFB was used to collect data on daily use from the prior assessment to the current assessment. Thus, the TLFB was used to collect 365 continuous days of data on daily drug use after randomization. TLFB interview uses a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall to obtain retrospective reports of daily substance use. Urine drug screens were conducted using Sure Step 10 urine drug screens and urine cups, which included temperature controlled monitoring and detection of adulterants. Urine drug screens were administered immediately prior to the administration of the TLFB to improve the chances of accurate reporting of days of use. The higher the median number, the more drug use; minimum median of drug use 0 days and maximum median of 28 days.</description>

The ASR is a 123 item self report scale designed for 18 to 59 year-old to describe their own functioning. Items are on a 3 point likert type scale (0= not true, 1=somewhat true, 2=very true or often true). The externalizing scale is comprised by the aggressive, rule braking and intrusive syndromes. The problem syndromes have been normed by sex and age (18 to 35, or 36 to 59), using a nationally representative sample. Scores were square-root transformed to more closely approximate a normal distribution. Scores ranged from 0 to 7.2. The higher the score, the more externalizing behavior. Participants were also asked to self report arrests in the past year . Externalizing was analyzed using regression</description>

        <title>Main Study, Adolescent Drug Use</title>
        <description>Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measured drug use. At baseline, TLFB identified drug use in the 28-day period that preceded the baseline assessment. At all other time points the TLFB was used to collect data on daily use from the prior assessment to the current assessment. Thus, the TLFB was used to collect 365 continuous days of data on daily drug use after randomization. TLFB interview uses a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall to obtain retrospective reports of daily substance use. Urine drug screens were conducted using Sure Step 10 urine drug screens and urine cups, which included temperature controlled monitoring and detection of adulterants. Urine drug screens were administered immediately prior to the administration of the TLFB to improve the chances of accurate reporting of days of use. The higher the median number, the more drug use; minimum median of drug use 0 days and maximum median of 28 days.</description>

        <description>For the Main study, an equally weighted composite of the following standardized scales was used to assess externalizing behaviors: â€˜Total Delinquencyâ€™ from the National Youth Survey; â€˜Oppositional Defiant Disorderâ€™ and â€˜Conduct Problemsâ€™ from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Predictive Scales, â€˜Externalizing Scaleâ€™ from the Youth Self-Report. This composite was then transformed to a z-score using the mean and standard deviation of the baseline in the entire sample. Adolescent externalizing behaviors were assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months post randomization.This hypothesis analyzed using hierarchical linear models. Scores ranged from -1.6 to 3.0. The higher the score, the more externalizing behavior.</description>

        <description>Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measured drug use. At baseline, TLFB identified drug use in the 28-day period that preceded the baseline assessment. At all other time points the TLFB was used to collect data on daily use from the prior assessment to the current assessment. Thus, the TLFB was used to collect 365 continuous days of data on daily drug use after randomization. TLFB interview uses a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall to obtain retrospective reports of daily substance use. Urine drug screens were conducted using Sure Step 10 urine drug screens and urine cups, which included temperature controlled monitoring and detection of adulterants. Urine drug screens were administered immediately prior to the administration of the TLFB to improve the chances of accurate reporting of days of use. The higher the median number, the more drug use; minimum median of drug use 0 days and maximum median of 28 days.</description>

          <description>Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measured drug use. At baseline, TLFB identified drug use in the 28-day period that preceded the baseline assessment. At all other time points the TLFB was used to collect data on daily use from the prior assessment to the current assessment. Thus, the TLFB was used to collect 365 continuous days of data on daily drug use after randomization. TLFB interview uses a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall to obtain retrospective reports of daily substance use. Urine drug screens were conducted using Sure Step 10 urine drug screens and urine cups, which included temperature controlled monitoring and detection of adulterants. Urine drug screens were administered immediately prior to the administration of the TLFB to improve the chances of accurate reporting of days of use. The higher the median number, the more drug use; minimum median of drug use 0 days and maximum median of 28 days.</description>

        <description>Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measured drug use. At baseline, TLFB identified drug use in the 28-day period that preceded the baseline assessment. At all other time points the TLFB was used to collect data on daily use from the prior assessment to the current assessment. Thus, the TLFB was used to collect 365 continuous days of data on daily drug use after randomization. TLFB interview uses a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall to obtain retrospective reports of daily substance use. Urine drug screens were conducted using Sure Step 10 urine drug screens and urine cups, which included temperature controlled monitoring and detection of adulterants. Urine drug screens were administered immediately prior to the administration of the TLFB to improve the chances of accurate reporting of days of use. The higher the median number, the more drug use; minimum median of drug use 0 days and maximum median of 28 days.</description>

        <title>Follow Up Study, Drug Use</title>
        <description>Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) measured drug use. For the Follow Up Study, the TLFB was used to identify drug use in the 90 day period that preceded the assessment. TLFB interview uses a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall to obtain retrospective reports of daily substance use over the past 90 days. Urine drug screens were conducted using Sure Step 10 urine drug screens and urine cups, which included temperature controlled monitoring and detection of adulterants. Urine drug screens were administered immediately prior to the administration of the TLFB to improve the chances of accurate reporting of days of use.The higher the median number, the more drug use; minimum median of drug use 0 days and maximum median of 90 days.</description>

        <description>For the follow up study, externalizing behavior for the 90 days prior to the follow up was assessed using the externalizing composite of the Adult Self Report (ASR). The ASR is a 123 item self report scale designed for 18 to 59 year-old to describe their own functioning. Items are on a 3 point likert type scale (0= not true, 1=somewhat true, 2=very true or often true). The externalizing scale is comprised by the aggressive, rule braking and intrusive syndromes. The problem syndromes have been normed by sex and age (18 to 35, or 36 to 59), using a nationally representative sample. Scores were square-root transformed to more closely approximate a normal distribution. Scores ranged from 0 to 7.2. The higher the score, the more externalizing behavior. Participants were also asked to self report arrests in the past year . Externalizing was analyzed using regression</description>

        <description>For the Follow Up Study, sexual risk behavior was measured by examining the number of unprotected sexual acts and the number of partners and number of sex acts that included substance use the in the 90 day period that preceded the assessment; a latent factor using structural equation modeling will be used created from the Behavioral Risk Assessment. Scores ranged from -0.5 to 11.7. The higher the score, the more risky sexual behavior.</description>
