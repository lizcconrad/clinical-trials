      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nesiritide administered
      as serial infusions to heart failure (HF) patients in the outpatient setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) is the inability of the heart to pump efficiently and the heart cannot
      perform the necessary circulation of blood through the body. This can result in symptoms like
      shortness of breath at rest or with minimal activity. Advanced heart failure is one of the
      leading causes of hospitalization and deaths in the United States. This is a prospective
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group, multicenter study of the
      effectiveness of Nesiritide administered as serial infusions in the outpatient setting.
      Patients enrolled in this study will receive nesiritide or placebo for up to 12 weeks.
      Patients will then be followed for an additional 12 weeks. During the the first 17 weeks of
      the study patients will have multiple laboratory tests, have their vital signs (blood
      pressure and heart rate) assessed, and complete quality of life questionnaires. During the
      last few weeks of the study patients will be contacted to inquire how they are doing. The
      study hypothesis is that compared to placebo plus standard care, Nesiritide plus standard
      will reduce time to death or first occurrence of hospitalization due to heart or kidney
      problems. Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests and vital signs at various time points throughout the study. The patients
      assigned to the nesiritide group will receive a single 2.0mcg/kg bolus (one time injection)
      followed by serial IV infusions (4 to 6 hours) at a standard flow rate of 0.010 mcg/kg/min
      once or twice per week for 12 weeks. The patients assigned to the placebo group will receive
      matching placebo.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Had at least two qualifying hospitalizations or hospitalization equivalents in the
             past year, with the most recent hospitalization or hospitalization equivalent within
             the past 60 days, but who has been out of the hospital at least 5 days (the day of
             discharge is day 0)

          -  Have documentation indicating that the patient was consistently New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV during the 60 days before randomization

          -  Have a Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction less than 40% (measured within 24 weeks
             before randomization)

          -  Are (1)NYHA Class IV or (2)NYHA Class III with highest calculated CrCl, 60mL/min
             within the previous 30 days

          -  Are receiving optimal treatment with long-term oral medications (e.g., diuretics,
             angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers
             (ARBs), and beta blockers, unless these are documented to be contraindicated or not
             tolerated)

          -  Agree to come to the clinic up to 2 times per week (according to randomization) for 16
             weeks of study drug infusions and to participate in all required follow-up assessments
             through week 24. In addition, agree to be contacted monthly after week 24 for
             follow-up, until the entire study has been completed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have systolic blood pressure consistently &lt;90mm Hg

          -  Are unable or unwilling to discontinue intermittent or continuous infusions of
             dopamine, dobutamine, milrinone, nitroglycerin, or open-label Natrecor beginning at
             the time of the screening visit

          -  Have required recent outpatient IV vasoactive (milrinone, dobutamine, dopamine,
             nitroglycerin, or open-label Natrecor) therapy as defined as &gt;2 outpatient (excluding
             emergency room or inpatient) infusions in the last 30 days without a subsequent
             hospitalization

          -  Had, or during the course of the study are anticipated to have, any organ
             transplantation (heart, liver, lung, kidney, or bone marrow)

          -  Had a biventricular pacemaker placed within the 45 days before randomization or a
             single or dual chamber pacemaker or an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator
             placed within the 15 days before randomization

          -  Have cardiogenic shock, volume depletion, or any other clinical condition at the time
             of randomization that would contraindicate the administration of Natrecor

          -  Are currently receiving chronic dialysis or have the expectation that dialysis will be
             required during the next 12 months.
