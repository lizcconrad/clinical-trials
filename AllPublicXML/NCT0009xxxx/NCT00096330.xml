      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain agents to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. The use of folic acid may be effective in preventing colorectal
      cancer. Eating a diet rich in folic acid may prevent the development of colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well a folate-depleted diet works
      compared to a folate-supplemented diet in preventing colorectal cancer in patients who are at
      high risk for developing colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Analyze the effects of a folate-depleted vs a folate-supplemented diet on folate-related
           DNA endpoints (e.g., genomic and gene-specific DNA methylation and DNA strand breaks) in
           rectal epithelial cells in patients at high risk for colorectal neoplasia.

        -  Analyze the effects of these dietary interventions on folate-related DNA endpoints
           (e.g., genomic and gene-specific DNA methylation, DNA strand breaks, and uracil
           incorporation into DNA) in blood mononuclear cells in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Analyze the effects of these dietary interventions on the patterns of differential gene
           expression in rectal epithelial cells and blood mononuclear cells in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, single-blind study.

        -  Run-in period: Patients are placed on an average folate-containing diet for 56 days.

        -  Randomization: After completion of the run-in period, patients are randomized to 1 of 2
           arms.

             -  Arm I (folate depleted diet): Patients are placed on a low-folate diet for 84 days.
                Patients receive oral folic acid supplementation once daily on days 57-84.

             -  Arm II (folate supplemented diet): Patients continue on an average
                folate-containing diet for an additional 56 days. Patients receive oral folic acid
                supplementation once daily on days 1-56.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      2.5 years.
