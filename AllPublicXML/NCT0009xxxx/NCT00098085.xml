    <textblock>
      Antigenics is enrolling patients in a Phase II study testing the feasibility to derive an
      autologous investigational vaccine (HSPPC-96) from the tumor tissue of patients with
      resectable non-small cell lung cancer.

      Vaccine production will be attempted on all patients who undergo surgery and meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Antigenics is enrolling patients in a Phase II study testing the feasibility to derive an
      autologous investigational vaccine (HSPPC-96) from the tumor tissue of patients with
      resectable non-small cell lung cancer.

      All patients will undergo surgery to remove the tumor and will be followed for recurrence and
      overall survival.

      The primary goal of this trial is to determine if HSPPC-96 can be made from the tumor tissue
      of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer.

      The secondary goals are to further characterize the safety and efficacy profile, to evaluate
      disease recurrence in patients receiving, and to evaluate overall survival in patients
      receiving HSPPC-96.

      HSPPC-96 is an investigational, immunotherapeutic agent made from an individual patient's own
      tumor, which is collected at the time of surgery. A portion of the tumor tissue is sent to
      Antigenics' manufacturing facility where it will undergo processing to create a vaccine. This
      vaccine may help the patient's immune system attack cancerous cells while leaving healthy
      cells alone.

          -  Tumor size &gt; 3x3 cm or equivalent to a 9 cmÂ² lesion

          -  Scheduled surgery with curative intent

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Must not be pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Agree to not receive any other investigative agent at any time while enrolled in this
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment for non-small cell lung cancer

          -  Clinical signs or symptoms of brain metastases
