  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, randomized, multicenter study designed to compare the efficacy
      of 12 weeks of subcutaneously administered efalizumab (monotherapy) with that of combination
      therapy (Efalizumab and a topical corticosteroid ointment) in subjects with moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The study will also evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of 30 months of continuous efalizumab treatment in those subjects
      who derive benefit from the initial 12 weeks of treatment.
