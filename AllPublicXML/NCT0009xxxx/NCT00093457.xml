      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of sorafenib in treating patients
      who have metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of sorafenib, as measured by prostate-specific antigen response,
           in patients with metastatic or recurrent hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the
           prostate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rate and duration of response in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine time to treatment failure and overall survival in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Explore the relationship between measures of ras/raf pathway activation (pERK) and
           response to treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks after going off study treatment and then periodically for
      survival. Patients with stable or responding disease, when they go off study treatment, are
      followed every 3 months until relapse or progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
