      RATIONALE: Interleukin-7 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells.
      Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Combining interleukin-7 with vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-7 when
      given with vaccine therapy in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-7 (IL-7) when administered with
           melanoma peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with metastatic
           melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the biological effects of this regimen on T-cell function and phenotype at
           various doses and at the optimal biological dose in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of IL-7 in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of IL-7, in terms of a dose-escalation strategy, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of interleukin-7 (IL-7).

      Patients receive IL-7 subcutaneously (SC) on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21. Patients
      also receive melanoma peptide vaccine comprising gp100 antigen and MART-1 antigen emulsified
      in Montanide ISA-51 SC on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-7 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined, an additional 13
      patients are treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 5 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and then at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-12.3
      months.
