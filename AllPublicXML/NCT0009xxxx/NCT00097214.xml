    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study in previously untreated subjects with histologically or
      cytologically proven stage IIIB/IV NSCLC designed to determine the efficacy of first line
      treatment with carboplatin and cetuximab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed for both genders in the United States.
      Approximately 173,770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer
      deaths in both men and women, with approximately 160,440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis
      for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage, and therapy for advanced disease is
      limited. The study will test carboplatin in combination with a newly approved drug called
      cetuximab, which is continuing to be tested in colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab
      is a monoclonal antibody, which is believed to work by attaching to an epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It
      is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung cancers overexpress EGFR.

      Rationale:

      The present study is built upon the data from the described studies, incorporating cetuximab
      into a regimen of single-agent carboplatin. Previous data suggest that single agent
      carboplatin is active in NSCLC. The addition of biologic therapy with the anti-EGFR agent
      cetuximab to carboplatin will presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping
      toxicity to a minimum in patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.

      Research Hypothesis:

      The population being studied in this trial is subjects with previously untreated Stage IIIB
      or IV NSCLC. The research hypothesis is that these subjects will achieve a response (based on
      RECIST criteria) to therapy with the combination of carboplatin and cetuximab.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible for the study, subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria.

          -  Subjects must have signed an approved informed consent.

          -  Subjects with histologically or cytologically documented stage IIIB (supraclavicular
             lymph node, high neck node, or pleural effusion involvement) or IV NSCLC. Disease must
             be newly diagnosed or recurrent at least 1 year post adjuvant therapy.

          -  Subjects with measurable disease.

          -  Subjects with ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  If diagnostic tissue or slides are available for a subject, these must be submitted
             for testing of EGFR status.

          -  Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastasis are eligible; however, they must have
             completed radiotherapy/radiosurgery at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Radiotherapy
             must have been completed &gt;2 weeks prior to enrollment and the subject must have
             recovered from all adverse effects of prior radiotherapy. No previous irradiation to
             the only area of measurable disease. New lesions that developed in a previously
             irradiated area will be allowed.

          -  Subjects ≥18 years of age.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 4 weeks after the
             study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. WOCBP include any
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is
             not postmenopausal [defined as amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months; or women on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             level &gt;35mIU/mL]. Even women who are using oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive
             hormones or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods
             (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or
             where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be of child
             bearing potential. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of
             study medication.

        Physical and Laboratory Test Findings

          -  Subjects with adequate hematologic function defined as: ANC ≥1,500/mm 3 ; WBC

             ≥3,000/mm 3 ; platelets ≥100,000/mm 3 ; and hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL.

          -  Subjects with adequate hepatic function defined as: total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN) or AST ≤2.5 x ULN.

          -  Subjects with adequate renal function defined as a serum creatinine level ≤1.5 mg/dL
             or a creatinine clearance ≥60 cc/minute.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any of the following criteria will make the subject ineligible to participate in this
        study:

          -  WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for
             the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study. Subjects who are men
             must also agree to use effective contraception.

          -  WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  Subjects who have had prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the
             subject has been disease-free for 5 years.

          -  Subjects with significant history of cardiac disease, i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy with decreased
