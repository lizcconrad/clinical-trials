      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of
      perioperative hypertension. Approximately 500-900 patients with perioperative hypertension
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) or
      minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or valve
      replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups: clevidipine or nitroglycerin.

      The primary objective was to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of
      perioperative hypertension, as assessed by comparing the incidences of death, stroke, MI and
      renal dysfunction in the clevidipine and nitroglycerin treatment groups from the initiation
      of study drug infusion through postoperative Day 30. Secondary objectives were to evaluate
      the efficacy of study drug, assessed by the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect, and
      additional safety variables.

    <description>Clevidipine (0.5 mg/mL in 20% lipid emulsion) was initiated after insertion of an arterial line upon the occurrence of perioperative hypertension, as determined by the investigator, and was administered intravenously (IV) at an initial infusion rate of 0.4 μg/kg/min (non weight-based equivalent is 2 mg/h). Clevidipine was titrated to blood pressure lowering effect by doubling increments approximately every 90 seconds up to a maximum infusion rate of 3.2 μg/kg/min (16 mg/h). Infusion rates above 3.2 μg/kg/min were permitted up to the maximum infusion rate of 8.0 μg/kg/min. Treatment was maintained as long as was deemed clinically necessary or until discharge from the ICU. Infusion rates between 4.4 and 8.0 μg/kg/min were to be administered for no more than 2 hours.</description>

    <description>Nitroglycerin (NTG) was initiated after insertion of an arterial line upon the occurrence of perioperative hypertension, as determined by the investigator, and was administered intravenously as per institutional practice.
