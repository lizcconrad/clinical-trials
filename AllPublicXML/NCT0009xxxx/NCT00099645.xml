  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the anti-HIV activity and safety of 3 different
      doses of mifepristone (also known as VGX-410 and RU486) in HIV infected people.

      Hypothesis: Mifepristone will be generally safe (no serious adverse effects) and well
      tolerated.

    <textblock>
      Mifepristone is a potent anti-glucocorticoid compound that effectively inhibits replication
      of both laboratory and clinical HIV isolates in vitro. This study will evaluate the anti-HIV
      activity and safety of 3 different doses of mifepristone in HIV infected people.

      This study will last approximately 2 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      4 study arms, and will receive either mifepristone or placebo daily for 28 days. Arm A
      participants will receive one of three doses of placebo; Arm B participants will receive 75
      mg mifepristone; Arm C participants will receive 150 mg mifepristone; and Arm D participants
      will receive 225 mg mifepristone. A thorough neck and thyroid examination will be performed
      within 30 days prior to study entry. Blood collection and vital signs measurement will occur
      at study entry and Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56. Urine collection and pill counts will also
      be done at some study visits.
