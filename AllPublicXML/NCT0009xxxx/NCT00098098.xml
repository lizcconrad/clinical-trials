      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a two-dose regimen
      (Day 0 and Day 28) of recombinant Botulinum Vaccine (rBV) A/B in healthy volunteers when
      given intramuscularly at three ascending dosage levels by cohort and a two-dose regimen (Day
      0 and Day 28) of a formulation containing only antigens at the 40 ug total immunizing protein
      dosage level.

      The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed as a single-center, open-label, non-randomized study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a two-dose schedule of rBV A/B in
      healthy volunteers at three ascending dosage levels, 5 ug, 10 ug and 20 ug serotype-specific
      antigen (10 ug, 20 ug and 40 ug total immunizing protein) in three dosing cohorts and a
      two-dose regimen (Day 0 and Day 28) of a formulation containing only antigens at the 40 ug
      total immunizing protein dosage level. Approximately 44 volunteers (11 per cohort) are
      expected to be enrolled. Cohorts will enroll consecutively beginning with the lowest dosage
      level. Volunteers in each cohort will receive a two injection series at the assigned dosage
      level given as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (i.m.) injection on Day 0 and Day 28. Potential
      volunteers for study participation will undergo qualification screening for this study during
      the 21 days prior to the date scheduled for vaccination. After successful completion of the
      informed consent process and all screening assessments, volunteers will be scheduled for
      vaccination. Volunteers will report acute adverse events daily for 28 days after each
      vaccination and return to the clinic at regular intervals according to the Schedule of Study
      Assessments with the last scheduled follow-up 168 days (± 7 days) after the initial
      vaccination (Day 0).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  The volunteer is between 18 to 40 (inclusive) years of age at the time of the first
             dose of rBV A/B.

          -  The volunteer is in good health as determined by the Investigator (Study Doctor) from
             a medical history and physical examination.

          -  The volunteer has clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis laboratory values
             within 10 % above the upper or within 10 % below the lower limit of the normal range
             as established by the University of Kentucky clinical laboratory which are not
             considered clinically significant by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor Medical
             Monitor.

          -  The volunteer has a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). However, if a potential volunteer
             is reported to have a benign ECG abnormality (e.g., sinus bradycardia) the results may
             be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. With the agreement of the Sponsor
             Medical Monitor and documentation of the consultation in the volunteer's study record,
             the Investigator may include the volunteer in the study.

          -  The volunteer is willing to have his or her blood samples stored for future botulinum
             research studies.

          -  The volunteer has signed the Informed Consent Form, successfully completed (at least
             90 % correct) the Test of Understanding, and has signed the Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form.

          -  The volunteer agrees not to donate blood for at least 30 days following vaccination.

          -  The volunteer is willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol through the
             post-vaccination Day 168 (± 7 days) visit.

          -  Female volunteers must be of non-childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterilized
             or postmenopausal), or must not be pregnant (as indicated by a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to rBV A/B administration) or nursing, and must
             use two types of acceptable form of FDA-approved birth control methods including: 1)
             hormonal types of birth control (such as implants or birth control pills) or an
             intrauterine device (IUD) and 2) an additional barrier type of birth control measure
             (i.e. condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, spermicide, etc.) during the period
             beginning from 30 days before vaccination through completion of the study. Completion
             of the study is defined as completing the post-vaccination Day 168 (± 7 days) visit.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The volunteer has frequent or severe headaches of any etiology.

          -  The volunteer has chronic, severe or recurrent joint pain or arthritis of any
             etiology.

             performed where applicable).

          -  The volunteer has a previous diagnosis of any serious psychiatric disorder. For this
             purpose, serious psychiatric disorder is defined as illness requiring hospitalization
             within the previous 12 months; routine administration of more than one medication to
             control anxiety, mood or sleep disorder; or history of suicide attempt.

             before the post-vaccination Day 168 (± 7 days) visit.

          -  Licensed vaccines are not exclusionary but should be given at least 30 days before or
             after immunization (if live vaccine: 60 days before or after immunization) to avoid

          -  The volunteer has a known hypersensitivity to aluminum compounds or yeast.

          -  The volunteer has any laboratory values greater than 10 % above the upper or greater
             than 10 % below the lower limit of normal or clinically significant as assessed by the
             Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor.

          -  The volunteer tests positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); Hepatitis C Virus
             (HCV) or Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg).
