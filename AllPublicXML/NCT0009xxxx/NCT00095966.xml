  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Giving sorafenib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial is
      studying how well giving sorafenib together with gemcitabine works in treating patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine.

      II. Determine the toxicity experienced by patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are
      treated with sorafenib plus gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 7 months.
