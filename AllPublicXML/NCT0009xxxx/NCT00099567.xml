  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for
      cognitive decline and if this association is modified by inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of several commonly occurring disorders that include
      abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and insulin
      resistance. This study was conducted to determine if, as hypothesized, the presence of the
      metabolic syndrome is associated with more cognitive decline and greater risk of developing
      cognitive impairment, and whether this risk is affected by the level of inflammatory markers
      in the blood.

      This 5-year prospective observational study was conducted from 1997 to 2002 at community
      clinics in two locations. A total of 2632 black and white participants, aged 70 to 79 years,
      were recruited from the 3075 participants in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (ABC)
      study conducted during the same period. Participants were screened for presence of metabolic
      syndrome, cognitive status, inflammatory markers, and a clinic examination was administered,
      when the study began and at the year 3 and 5 follow-up visits.
