  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to examine the effects of Capecitabine administered as an oral chemotherapy
      drug in participants with nasopharyngeal cancer.

      Capecitabine is an oral prodrug. A &quot;prodrug&quot; is a drug that is converted within the body into
      its active form that has medical effects. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
      which is a chemotherapy agent frequently used to treat head and neck cancers. Capecitabine is
      absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and is converted to 5-FU. Capecitabine (Xeloda9)
      has been tested in subjects with colorectal and breast cancers, and shown to be effective in
      those cancers. Likewise, 5-FU has shown benefit when administered as a continuous infusion
      for those with nasopharyngeal cancers. Since Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-FU, it is
      possible that similar results will be achieved.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who
      have locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.

                  elapsed since this previous therapy.

               -  Prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy, or known extreme
                  sensitivity to 5-FU.

               -  Completion of previous chemotherapy regimen &lt; 4 weeks prior to the start of study

                  start of study treatment.

               -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart failure,
                  symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled

                  been stable for &gt; 3 months) or history of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous
                  system disorders or psychiatric disability judged by the investigator to be
                  clinically significant, precluding informed consent, or interfering with
                  compliance of oral drug intake. Other serious uncontrolled medical conditions
                  that the investigator feels might compromise study participation.

               -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete

                    -  ALT, AST &gt; 2.5 x upper normal limit (or &gt; 5 x upper normal limit in the case

                       in the case of liver metastases or &gt; 10 x upper normal limit in the case of
                       bone disease).

               -  Unwillingness to give written informed consent.

               -  Unwillingness to participate or inability to comply with the protocol for the
