  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise intolerance and reduced health status have been found in patients with sarcoidosis
      and has been related to skeletal muscle weakness. The present researchers reason that
      skeletal muscle weakness is, at least in part, related to physical inactivity and therefore
      partially reversible following a structured exercise training program. Nevertheless, the
      effects of exercise training have never been studied in patients with sarcoidosis. Therefore,
      the present study is undertaken to explore the effects of exercise training in patients with
      sarcoidosis. A priori, the following hypotheses are formulated:

        -  A 12-week exercise training program improves health status, quality of life and exercise
           capacity in patients with sarcoidosis as compared to sarcoidosis patients without
           exercise intervention.

        -  A 12-week exercise training program improves skeletal muscle function and reduces
           complaints of anxiety and depression in patients with sarcoidosis as compared to
           sarcoidosis patients without exercise intervention.

        -  A 12-week exercise training program reduces circulating levels of inflammatory markers
           in patients with sarcoidosis as compared to sarcoidosis patients without exercise
           intervention.

      The EXTRAS study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 24-week crossover clinical trial
      in which the participants are randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of dynamic resistance and
      whole-body endurance exercises followed by 12 weeks without intervention or vice versa.
      Consenting participants will be assessed at baseline (before randomization, week 0) and at
      weeks 12 and 24.
