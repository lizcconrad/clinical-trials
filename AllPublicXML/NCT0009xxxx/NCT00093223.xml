      This trial will treat patients with a new chemotherapeutic medicine who have undergone a
      successful and uncomplicated de novo stent placement in up to two native coronary arteries.
      The purpose of the trial is to determine the appropriate dose of the new medicine for future
      trials and to evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse
      events.
