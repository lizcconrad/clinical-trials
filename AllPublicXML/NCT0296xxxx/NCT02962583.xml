  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited interventional human studies suggest that probiotic supplementation may be a
      beneficial strategy for promoting weight loss when added to a nutritional intervention via
      their effects on lipid absorption and metabolic signaling molecules. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effects of addition of a probiotic supplementation to a weight loss
      intervention on body weight, body composition and overall health in overweight adults.
