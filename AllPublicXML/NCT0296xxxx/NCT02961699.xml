  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-site, safety and efficacy study of subjects with
      chronic venous stasis ulcers. Patients will fall into two categories: treatment arm (24
      subjects) and non-treatment or control arm (12 subjects). The treatment group will undergo a
      small liposuction procedure and receive placement of autologous cell therapy (stromal
      vascular fraction or SVF) injected around the rim of venous stasis wound
      (subcutaneously)following standard wound debridement, with saturation of collagen dressing
      material with standard over-dressing. Control (non-treatment) subjects will receive
      debridement and dressing changes as per standard of care without SVF.
