  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if isatuximab can help to control
      smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Isatuximab is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 61 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 42 will take part at
      MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days (about 1 month).

      Participant will receive isatuximab by vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1. On Day 1,
      participant will receive it over about 5 hours and on Days 8, 15, and 22 participant will
      receive it over about 3 hours. During Months 2-6, participant will receive isatuximab over
      about 3 hours on Days 1 and 15. After Month 6, participant will receive isatuximab over about
      3 hours on Day 1 only.

      Participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.
      Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their
      risks.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for anti-drug
           antibody, and to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons ) will be drawn for genetic testing.

        -  Starting at Cycle 2, urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  If participant is able to have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 2 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for genetic testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests and to check the status of the disease.

      On Days 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           participant's disease.

        -  On Day 15 only, urine will be collected for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  On Day 15 only, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected to check for anti-drug
           antibody.

        -  If participant is able to have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 15 of Cycles 2-6, if participant is able to have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or
      urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 28 of Cycles 6, 18, and 30:

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for genetic testing.

        -  Participant will have a skeletal survey to check the status of the disease.

        -  Participant will have bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease,
           genetic testing, and for biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers).

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an MRI and/or an FDG-PET/CT
           scan.

      If the disease appears to get worse, at any time the doctor thinks it is needed, participant
      may have all or some of the above tests and procedures repeated to check the status of the
      disease.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking isatuximab for up to 30 months. Participant will no longer be
      able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or
      if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on this study will be over after long-term follow-up has been completed.

      End of Treatment:

      Two weeks after the last dose of isatuximab:

        -  If participant is able to have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected to check for anti-drug antibody.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 28 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for anti-drug
           antibody, and to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for genetic testing.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected
           for a pregnancy test. If participant has an irregular menstrual cycle, participant will
           also have this test within 14 days after your last dose.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After participant's last dose of study drug, participant will be called by a member of the
      study staff and asked how participant is doing, if participant has had any side effects, and
      if participant has started any new anti-cancer treatment. This call should last about 15-20
      minutes. Participant will receive these calls at least every 6-12 months after the end of the
      study. If participant has any serious side effects, participant may be called more often to
      check up on participant. This follow-up will stop if the disease gets worse. If participant
      has routine clinic visits with participant's doctor, these questions will be asked on
      participant's clinic visit and participant may not receive a phone call.

             progression to multiple myeloma by PETHEMA criteria) 2. Immunoparesis (This term
             refers to the patient having low uninvolved immunoglobulins in peripheral blood, for
             example if a patient has IgA smoldering multiple myeloma, then either having a low IgM
             and/or low IgG will qualify as a risk factor for progression to multiple myeloma) *2

             device for 2 weeks prior to screening, during and 12 weeks after the last dose of
             trial medication. Adequate methods of contraception are provided as examples. Other
             acceptable and effective methods of birth control are also permitted (eg, abstinence).

          9. Men must agree to not donate sperm while on the study and for at least 3 months after
             the last dose of study drug(s). Women of child bearing potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to the first administration of
