      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of remote ischemic preconditioning on
      dynamic cerebral autoregulation and related hematology indexes in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) is the phenomenon whereby brief cycles of ischemia and
      reperfusion, applied to a distant organ, provide protection to the target organ. Dynamic
      cerebral autoregulation(dCA), a mechanism to maintain the cerebral blood flow, has been
      proved to be critical for the occurrence,development and prognosis of ischemic neurovascular
      disease. In this study, we hypothesis that RIPC provides neuro-protection by means of
      improving dCA.

    <description>A dynamic cerebral auto-regulation parameter derived from transfer function analysis.Continuous cerebral blood flow velocities of bilateral middle cerebral artery will be assessed noninvasively using transcranial Doppler. Spontaneous arterial blood pressure will be simultaneously recorded using a servo-controlled plethysmograph on the left or right middle finger with an appropriate finger cuff size. Transfer function analysis will be used to derive the autoregulatory parameters.</description>

    <description>The RIPC consisted of 4 cycles of extremities ischemia (5-minute blood-pressure cuff inflation to 200 mm Hg, followed by 5-minute cuff deflation). The tourniquets were applied to one side upper arm and other side thigh. This intervention was undertaken one time in total.</description>

    <description>Serial measurements of dCA were performed at 7 time points, baseline, 1h, 3h, 6h, 9h, 12h, 24h after RIPC.The continuous ABP was measured non-invasively using a servo-controlled plethysmograph (Finometer Pro, the Netherlands) at the middle finger. Two 2 MHz transcranial Doppler probe was used to measure continuous cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) simultaneously in the bilateral middle cerebral arteries at a depth of 45-60 mm Endtidal CO2 was monitored using a capnograph (MultiDop X2, DWL, Sipplingen, Germany). The probes were placed over temporal windows and fixed with a customized head frame. CBFV and continuous arterial blood pressure were recorded simultaneously from each subject in the supine position for 10 minutes. All data were recorded for further assessment and analysis.</description>
