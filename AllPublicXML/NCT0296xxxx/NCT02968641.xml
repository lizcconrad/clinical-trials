      A Phase 2b, Open-Label, Randomized Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamic
      Activity of Lonafarnib With or Without Ritonavir in Patients Chronically Infected with
      Hepatitis Delta Virus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2b, randomized, open-label study will assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacodynamics (PD)/efficacy of 48 weeks of lonafarnib (LNF) and ritonavir (RTV)
      combination therapy vs. LNF monotherapy in patients with chronically infected with Hepatitis
      Delta Virus (CHD). Sixty patients will be enrolled at a single study site. Eligible patients
      will have CHD infection (≥ 6 months) confirmed by positive HDV antibody (Ab) test and HDV RNA
      ≥ 3 lg IU/mL by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at study entry.

             therapy and follow-up could be completed. Patients for whom participation in the study
