      This prospective, post-market, open label clinical study is designed to examine the lumbar
      fusion rate at 24 months post operative in subjects who have undergone a lumbar fusion
      surgery using Trinity Elite with or without local bone.

      The study is a prospective, post-market, open label clinical study. Up to 10 sites across the
      United States, with a minimum enrollment of 120 subjects study-wide, will be enrolling
      subjects. The primary objective of this study is to measure the lumbar fusion rate in
      subjects at 24 months when lumbar arthrodesis is performed using Trinity Elite with or
      without local bone. Surgical approach (PLF, TLIF,ALIF, XLIF, etc.) is according to the
      physician's discretion, but must comply with FDA approved/cleared indication for use and
      labeling. The primary endpoints are radiographic evidence of fusion and the absence of
      serious adverse events attributable to Trinity ELITE. The secondary objectives of this study
      are to measure the clinical and economic outcomes when posterolateral arthrodesis is
      performed using Trinity Elite and/or local bone with supplemental pedicle screw fixation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be 18 years of age (â‰¥ 18 years) or older at the time of consent.

          2. Subject must have a documented diagnosis of DDD. DDD is defined by back and/or
             radicular pain with degeneration of the disc as confirmed by medical history, physical
             examination, and radiographic studies that may include CT, MRI, plain X-ray film,
             discography, myelography, etc. with one or more of the following findings:

               -  Instability as defined by &gt;3mm translation or &gt;5 degrees angulation

               -  Osteophyte formation of facet joints or vertebral endplates

               -  Decreased disc height, on average by &gt;2mm, but dependent upon the spinal level

               -  Scarring/thickening of ligamentum flavum, annulus fibrosis, or facet joint
                  capsule

               -  Herniated nucleus pulposus

               -  Facet joint degeneration/changes; and/or

               -  Vacuum phenomenon

          3. Subject may have up to a Grade 2 Spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine with clinical
             manifestations of one or more of the following phenomena:

               -  Radiculopathy

               -  Sensory deficit

               -  Motor weakness

               -  Reflex changes

          4. Subject must require lumbar arthrodesis at 1-4 contiguous levels (L1-S1) for a PLF
             approach and 1-2 contiguous levels for an interbody approach.

          5. Subject must have been unresponsive to conservative care for at least 6 months prior
             to fusion surgery.

        7. Subject must agree not to use electromagnetic adjuncts to enhance bone fusion during the
        course of the study 8. Subject must be willing and able to sign an informed consent
        document. 9. Subject must be willing and able to return for all follow-up visits, agree to
        participate in postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluations and comply with the
        required study regimen.

          1. Subject is under 18 years of age (&lt;18) at the time of consent

          2. Subject has had prior lumbar spine fusion surgery at any level

          3. Subject has greater than grade 2 spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine

          4. Subject is currently undergoing treatment for malignancy or has undergone treatment
             for malignancy in the past 5 years (benign skin cancer is permitted)

          5. Subject is pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the two years (24
             months) following arthrodesis

          6. Subject has an active local or systemic infection or is undergoing adjunctive
             treatment for local or systemic infection

          7. Subject requires supplemental interbody arthrodesis.

          8. Subject has an allergy to DMSO.

          9. Subject is a prisoner.
