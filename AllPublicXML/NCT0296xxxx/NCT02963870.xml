      The recommendation for the treatment of suicidal adolescents, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) targeted new generation offer effective approaches to suicidal crisis and relapse
      prevention.

      Since 2009, our team is engaged in a partnership between France and Quebec Interuniversity
      agreement concluded by a University Picardie Jules Verne-University of Montreal. In this
      context, two teams G4 (Amiens and Rouen) have received training in suicidal crisis, including
      the security plan by a university instructor and TCC Québec, Dr. Labelle. Furthermore, we
      complete a descriptive and prospective study of risk and protective factors for adolescent
      suicide in which the Quebec team of Professor Labelle contributes as an expert (sponsor:
      Rouen). 200 subjects were recruited on 2 years by 3 (CHU Amiens, CH Compiègne, CHU Rouen)
      with an assessment of recurrence at 1 year (lost rates of view = 15%). The first results
      highlight the central role of personal coping strategies (coping) in suicidal recurrence. We
      want extend this study to validate the implementation of the security plan (safety level)
      with suicidal adolescents. The security plan is the initial step of the TCC approach short of
      suicidal crisis. It is established after working with adolescents and their families (chain
      analysis of the suicidal crisis, coping self-evaluation and identification of support
      resources). Developed by Stanley B from Columbia University and adapted for francophone
      adolescents R Labelle and JJ Breton wrote this list those resources and coping strategies to
      apply in case ideation and suicidal crisis. Signed by the young person and his family, he
      then uses to frame the monitoring and management plan of the youth and his family
      environment, friendly and professional in case of suicidal crisis.
