  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of echocardiography in intensive care is a developing field. In expert hands
      echocardiography has proven its utility in diagnosing cardiac pathology, differentiating
      shock states and in haemodynamic monitoring. However, whether the results obtained by experts
      can be generalized to trainees or specialists with limited training remains unclear. Further,
      concerns around training time and cost for intensive care staff have been a factor in
      limiting the uptake of echocardiography in intensive care.

      The investigators aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Australian ICU doctors in training
      after completion of the current minimum training. After completing a structured teaching
      program and 30 mentored training scans trainees will be assessed on their accuracy with
      echocardiography. In the research phase trainees will complete a further 40 scans with each
      one matched with an expect scan. The results from the expert and trainee scans will be
      compared to determine the trainee's accuracy.

    <description>Patient participants are adult patients in the Epworth Richmond Intensive care Unit. They are not the focus of the research but rather represent a general population of ICU patients that require echocardiography in the management of their critical illness. They will be a mix of medical and surgical patients some of whom are receiving mechanical ventilation, have movement restrictions, high BMI or other impediments to performing echocardiography.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Registrar Participants</arm_group_label>
    <description>Registrar participants are doctors in training in ICU. They have completed a formal echo teaching program and completed a logbook of 30 supervised scans. They are the focus of the research and are being assessed on their diagnostic accuracy with echocardiography.</description>
