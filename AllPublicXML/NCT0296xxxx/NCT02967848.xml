    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 pilot study to assess feasibility and utility of 99mTc-mebrofenin
      hepatobiliary scintigraphy for measurement of functional liver change due to radiotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancers of the liver who are not suitable for surgery or chemo/radio
      embolisation are often treated with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR). SABR
      results in high local control rates but, similar to other treatment modalities, carries risk
      of damage to healthy surrounding liver. This study aims to use a novel nuclear medicine
      imaging tracer, 99mTcMebrofenin, to evaluate liver function before and after radiotherapy.

      Patients will have a 99mTcMebrofenin scan performed &lt; 2 weeks before radiotherapy and 1 and 6
      months after radiotherapy. At the same time points, indocyanine green (ICG) and liver
      elasticity tests will be performed. These are global measures of liver function, whereas
      99mTcMebrofenin is both global and local. From the imaging data, the Investigators will be
      able to correlate change in local liver function in each sub volume of the liver with the
      radiotherapy dose it received. The Investigators will be able to thus measure the effect of
      radiotherapy on global and local liver function.

    <description>99mTc-mebrofenin HBS is a SPECT imaging procedure that allows evaluation of global and local liver function. Mebrofenin, bound to albumin, is taken up by hepatocytes in a similar manner to organic anions such as bilirubin. After hepatic uptake, the mebrofenin is excreted into the bile canaliculi. Dynamic imaging tools allow measurement of clearance rates for global function, and 3D SPECT imaging with corresponding CT allows visualisation of the local liver function with respect to anatomy. HBS allows direct visualisation of hepatocyte function.</description>
