    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study of care for women with gestational diabetes (GDM) using
      electronic equipment to participate in virtual office visits.

      Participants will be trained in the use of glucose meters, scales, and sphygmomanometers
      which are Bluetooth connected to an app on their cellphones. Fetal well-being will be
      assessed with Dopplers and kick counts. Care will be delivered by alternate in-office and
      telephone visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The core elements of a prenatal visit for any pregnant woman include assessment of BP,
      weight, and presence of fetal heart activity. The treatment of GDM additionally requires the
      measurement of and review of maternal glycemia. Technology exists for patients to measure
      these parameters and to relay this information securely directly from these devices via the
      internet to the healthcare provider's office. A key element of antepartum care for GDM,
      self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), has for some years been conducted with memory-based
      portable glucose meters. To assure accuracy in reports of patient measurements, it is
      important that all devices be of a design wherein results of measures of patient parameters
      are transmitted in unedited fashion directly devices to the health care provider. While no
      data exists about the accuracy of self-reporting of patient weight and blood pressure,
      intentional or unintentional alteration in reports of self-monitored glucose results is a
      known risk of reliance on patient self-reported data. This pilot study will explore the
      feasibility of the use of this technology from patients' homes in lieu of an office visit.
