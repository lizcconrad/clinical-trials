      This aim of study to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR7390 and to define the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of SHR7390 in the patients with advanced solid tumors.

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of SHR7390 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      To study the effects of food on the pharmacokinetic parameters of SHR7390. To assess the
      antitumor activity of SHR7390 in patients with advanced solid tumors preliminarily and
      recommend reasonable dosage regimen for the follow-up clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study of repeated doses of SHR7390 in the patients
      with advanced solid tumors that have no targeted agent as standard of therapy.

      A study cycle is defined as SHR7390 administered once daily orally for 28 days. Dose limiting
      toxicities (DLT) will be assessed in the first cycle of treatment. the trial is dose
      escalation and is designed by Accelerated Titration Designs during initial accelerated phase.
      when the significant toxicity or DLT is observed in any course of treatment,the accelerated
      titration trial terminates and subsequent cohort sizes and dose escalation are a conventional
      design of 3+3 patients. If one adverse event （AE） meets dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria
      at a given dose, 3 additional patients will be enrolled in this dose cohort. If 2 DLTs are
      determined at a given dose level, this dose will be designated as the MTD.

      Additional patients will be enrolled for PK evaluations at different dose levels based on
      preliminary safety and tolerability. Multiple blood samples at designated time points will be
      collected for PK evaluations.

      The safety, tolerability and AEs will be closely monitored throughout the study duration. The
      preliminary effectiveness and clinical benefits of SHR7390 will be evaluated as a single
      agent.

      The evaluation of the effects of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the single-dose
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of SHR7390.The design to assess food-effect is a randomized, balanced,
      2-treatment(fed vs. fasted), separated by an adequate wash-out period.
