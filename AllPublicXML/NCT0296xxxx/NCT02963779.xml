    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to determine the side effects related to LY2775240 given orally to
      healthy participants. Blood tests will be done to check how much LY2775240 is absorbed into
      the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. Each participant will enroll in
      either Part A or Part B of the study, which will last about 14 weeks and 8 weeks
      respectively, including screening.
