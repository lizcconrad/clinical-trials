  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      50-90% of patients with RA reports foot problems and the metatarsophalangeal joints of the
      forefoot are most frequently afflicted. Studies shows that foot problems can influence
      negatively on the walking function, physical activity and quality of life. Different foot
      orthoses and insoles are used as an intervention. Studies find that different insoles do have
      effect on pain, but there are no or minor effect on walking ability. The literature reports a
      further need for research and indicates the importance of studies on the effects of
      cost-effective insoles for patients with RA.

      Custom-built insoles takes time and are often expensive, and many patients, especially women,
      do not wear them since they often do not fit the shoes they prefer to wear. In this study, a
      4-mm thin, flat insole of a malleable plastic material (CI-Core®) with synthetic textile
      material on the upper side is customized to provide support for the transverse and
      longitudinal arches of the foot to reduce pressure on painful joints. The insole is easily
      customized and ready for use the same day. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
      this insole can reduce foot pain and increase walking distance in patients with RA and
      forefoot pain.

      An experimental study was performed on patients with RA and forefoot pain in either one or
      both feet. The patients walked as fast as they could in 6 minutes (6MWT) with either insoles
      (situation A) and without insoles (situation B). The order of situation A and B was
      randomized, and the assessor was blinded for the order of the two situations. Both tests were
      conducted the same day. After each test round, the patient was asked to register pain in the
      foot and perceived exertion. A telephone interview was conducted one year after the effect
      study to examine whether the insoles were still being used.
