  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Racial and ethnic minorities with type II diabetes in the US are more likely to develop
      complications and die from the disease than the general population. The foreign-born subset
      of this population is less likely to adhere to diabetes care recommendations than US-born
      patients, thereby placing them at higher risk for complications. In our previous pilot
      project, eight stories were assessed through preliminary multi-site intervention for
      acceptability and efficacy in diabetes management among Latino and Somali patients with
      poorly controlled type II diabetes. The goal of this project is to evaluate a new format for
      delivery of a culturally tailored digital storytelling intervention by incorporating a
      facilitated group discussion following the videos, for management of type II diabetes in
      Latino communities.

    <description>The evaluation will assess the degree to which the intervention motivates the patient to improve self-management of diabetes. The evaluation will also assess overall acceptability. Items for this survey were adapted from a well validated health communication assessment tool produced by the National Cancer Institute.</description>
