  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal prioritization of second-line chemotherapy and immune therapy based on
      demographic or biomarker data is an area of ongoing investigation. The hypothesis of this
      study is that there may be an additive or synergistic antitumor effect of combined
      chemotherapy and nivolumab in the second-line treatment of NSCLC as an important concept to
      test in a clinical trial. Previously treated NSCLC remains a setting of unmet clinical need
      despite recent clinical research progress. Early progression for a subset of NSCLC patients
      receiving nivolumab is a specific area of clinical need.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nab-paclitaxel will be added to standard nivolumab therapy in previously treated advanced
      stage non-small cell lung cancer to help prevent early progression and to improve progression
      free survival. The primary endpoint will be to determine if the addition of nab-paclitaxel to
      nivolumab improves progression free survival compared to nivolumab alone. Retrospective
      studies will be conducted to analyze blood based immune biomarkers, and tumor biomarkers to
      better understand the effect that nivolumab combined with chemotherapy has on the immune
      system in NSCLC. Patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer who have progression
      of cancer after receiving platinum doublet chemotherapy will be randomized to receive
      nivolumab with or without nab-paclitaxel. Patients on both arms will receive a maximum of one
      year of therapy with the option to retreat at progression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (per
             the Union Internationale contre le Cancer/American Join Committee on Cancer staging
             system, 7th edition) or recurrent incurable non-small cell lung cancer that has
             progressed after first-line chemotherapy.

          2. Prior Therapy: Platinum doublet chemotherapy for current diagnosis of advanced lung
             cancer. Only one prior line of chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer allowed. Adjuvant
             chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy given for early stage
             lung cancer at least 6 months prior to diagnosis of recurrent/metastatic disease is
             not counted as a line of therapy for advanced lung cancer. Patients who received
             platinum doublet therapy with or without radiotherapy as part of treatment for early
             stage non-small cell lung cancer less than 6 months after developing stage 4 or
             recurrent incurable disease will be considered study eligible by the criterion of
             having received one line of chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.

          3. EGFR, ALK and ROS biomarker positive tumors are eligible as long as the patient has
             received at least one standard oral, molecular inhibitor therapy in addition to
             standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. More than one molecular inhibitor is allowed
             such as a first generation EGFR inhibitor followed by a next generation EGFR inhibitor
             when T790 mutation develops. Prior molecular therapy for biomarker positive tumors
             such as (but not limited to) MET, RET and BRAF allowed but not required.

          4. Prior chemotherapy must have been completed 21 days prior to initiation of protocol

             therapy.

          7. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at least
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter
             to be recorded) as ≥ 20mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10mm with spiral CT
             scan.

          8. ECOG Performance Status: 0-1

             enrollment, be asymptomatic from brain metastases, stable on brain imaging, and not be
             receiving a supra-physiologic dose of steroids (&gt; 10 mg prednisone daily or
             equivalent).

         11. Non-pregnant and non-nursing. The effect of nab-paclitaxel and nivolumab on the fetus
             is unknown.

         12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Patients of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free of menses &gt; 1 year.

         13. Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the
             first dose of study therapy through 7 months after the last dose of study therapy.
