    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel treadmill training intervention can
      improve the gait stabilization strategy used by individuals who have experienced a stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year, approximately 15,000 American Veterans experience a stroke, with an estimated
      cost of acute and follow-up care in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Following a stroke,
      the restoration or improvement of walking is a high-ranking goal among patients, but only
      about half of the population is able to return to typical levels of community ambulation. The
      resultant decrease in independent mobility is strongly associated with a decline in quality
      of life. Gait instability is a common contributor to limited mobility through either an
      increased fall-risk or fear of falling, but current interventions to address post-stroke gait
      instability have had limited success. This project will conduct initial testing of a novel
      elastic force-field designed to improve post-stroke gait stability through targeted motor
      learning. The results of these experiments will serve as the basis for the development of
      novel gait rehabilitation techniques, which have the potential to increase the quality of
      life of thousands of Veterans and save millions of dollars.

    <description>Participants will complete a 12-week training program, in which they practice walking on a treadmill for 30-minutes during twice-weekly training sessions. During these sessions, participants will interface with a custom-built force-field able to exert mediolateral forces on the legs, which will be in &quot;error reduction&quot; mode. This training period will be followed by a 12-week follow-up period. Five assessment sessions will be interspersed throughout this total 24-week period.</description>

    <description>During training sessions, a custom-built force-field will exert forces on the legs while participants walk.

    <description>During training sessions, a custom-built force-field will exert forces on the legs while participants walk.

    <description>During training sessions, participants will interface with a custom-built force-field while they walk. The force-field will essentially get out of the way, producing minimal forces on the legs, and having no direct effect on the errors in foot placement that are often present among individuals who have experienced a stroke.</description>
