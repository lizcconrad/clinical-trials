  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare personality and social cognition changes, including
      emotion detection and self-awareness, and neuroanatomical correlates in patients, and how
      that affects the caregiver-patient relationship.

      The purpose of this study is to understand social cognition changes in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration
      (FTLD), which includes Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS) and
      Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD - behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, progressive
      non-fluent aphasia and semantic dementia), and the effect of these changes on the patients'
      relationship with their caregivers. In addition, the study aims to provide a greater clarity
      in the neuroanatomical correlates of social cognition in patients with FTLD, PD and AD.

        Patients and Caregivers:

          -  history of another neurological disorder

          -  psychiatric disorder

          -  severe aphasia (semantic word loss)

          -  visual deficits requiring correction beyond the use of eyeglasses or contact lenses
             (intact visual acuity is required for completing both the questionnaires and the

          -  auditory deficits requiring correction beyond hearing aids (videos have auditory
             component)

        Patients:

          -  presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal
             fragments or foreign objects in the eyes, skin or body will be excluded as they will
             be unable to have a MRI scan.

          -  premenopausal women will be excluded due to the unknown risk of MRIs during pregnancy.
