  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test a text message intervention for people who are
      beginning an attempt to quit smoking. The intervention seeks to teach people to think about
      their cravings to smoke in more helpful ways. The investigators expect that participants
      receiving the text message craving program will be less likely to begin smoking again
      compared to participants in a control condition.

    <measure>7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (6-week) Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Point prevalence abstinence is defined as the prevalence of not experiencing a full relapse in the period immediately preceding measurement. A full relapse will be defined as 7 continuous days of smoking or smoking ≥ 1 day(s) per week for the two consecutive weeks preceding the time of measurement. Self-reported abstinence will be verified by a Carbon Monoxide assay of breath samples and will override self-report in the direction of smoking.</description>
