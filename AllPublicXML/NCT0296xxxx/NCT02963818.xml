    <textblock>
      Exploring technology based tools to reduce drinking is important. The purpose of this
      research study is to compare different BAC monitoring apps for their effects on alcohol
      drinking and ratings of usability among young adults.This study will be conducted in six
      phases: a web-based and in-person screening assessment; brief counseling session on the day
      before the alcohol drinking session; brief appointment on the day of the alcohol drinking
      session; alcohol drinking session; two-week field period; and a follow-up appointment.
      Participation in this study will last approximately two months.

    <description>This is a small device that connects to a smartphone with an accompanying app that produces accurate breath alcohol readings when a user blows into a small tube attached to the device. Participants randomized to this study condition will have the opportunity to use this device and app during an alcohol drinking session in an actual bar and during a two-week field period.</description>

    <description>This is an app that produces estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC) readings based on sex, weight, number of drinks and time taken to consume drinks. Participants randomized to this study condition will have the opportunity to use this app during an alcohol drinking session in an actual bar and during a two-week field period.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will be able to make an entry into the BAC estimator app after consuming each alcoholic drink, which produces an estimated blood alcohol concentration based on the individual's sex, weight, number of alcoholic drinks and time spent drinking alcohol. These estimated blood alcohol concentrations may inform participants' subsequent decisions regarding drinking.</description>
