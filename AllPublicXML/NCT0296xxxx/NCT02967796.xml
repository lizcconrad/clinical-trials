    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate in primiparous patients the benefit of supplementation
      with Proteochoc® to reduce perineal pain in the postpartum especially, in sitting posture.
      The patient is followed from the delivery to 6 to 8 weeks after.

    <textblock>
      For this study, 60 patients are going to be included. There will be 2 groups : a supplemented
      one (proteochoc®) and a non supplemented one (control). The patients of these two groups will
      have the same follow-up At the time of inclusion, an inclusion card is completed describing
      the patient's socio-demographic characteristics, major medical, surgical and obstetric
      history. After an uncomplicated delivery, women stay in maternity for a maximum of 3 days. In
      accordance with standard medical practice, women will be seen daily from D0 to D + 3 by the
      nursing staff. The investigating physician and his team will complete the follow-up sheets in
      the aftermath (day1), day3 and 6-8 weeks after the usual visits.

      The data collected are information on medication treatments, prescribed care, assessment of
      the patient's overall condition and recovery, and monitoring of perineal lesions and
      complications if applicable.

      In the same time (day1, day3, day6, day14 and 6-8 weeks after, the patient will also complete
      a patient follow-up sheet to collect her impressions.

      The data collected are the medications taken, the care taken, the general pain felt, the
      perineal pain felt if applicable, and the fatigue felt.
