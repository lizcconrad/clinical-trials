          -  Subjects must be adequately informed and understands the nature and risks of the study
             and must be able to provide a signature and date on the informed consent form (ICF).

          -  Subjects must have a health status of &quot;healthy&quot; assessed by the investigator, defined
             as no clinically significant deviation from normal in medical history, physical
             examination, and clinical laboratory determinations.

          -  Subjects must be males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females, between 18 and 55 years
             of age (inclusive) at time of the Screening Visit.

          -  Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 19.0 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m² with a minimum
             weight of 110 pounds for females and 130 pounds for males at the Screening Visit. The
             BMI will be calculated using the standard formula of weight (kg)/(height [m])2.

          -  Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and
             check-in to the study site. All female subjects who are biologically capable of having
             children must agree and commit to the use of 2 acceptable methods of birth control,
             defined as nonhormonal forms of contraception, condoms or diaphragms with spermicidal
             foam 14 days prior to check-in to the study site and for the duration of study
             participation. Unacceptable methods of birth control include abstinence,
             hormone-containing intrauterine devices, uterine ablation, hormonal forms of
             contraception, rhythm, and withdrawal methods. Female subjects who are not
             biologically capable of having children are defined as postmenopausal female subjects
             who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months prior to the Screening
             Visit or are surgically sterile.

          -  Male subjects with reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of
             contraception for the duration of the study (surgical sterilization [vasectomy] or
             condom with spermicide).

          -  Subjects must be able to communicate effectively with study personnel.

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow all protocol requirements and study
             restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subjects is ineligible for the study if he or she meets any of the following
             criteria at the Screening Visit or at check-in to the study site:

          -  Subject is from a vulnerable population, as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations
             Title 45, Part 46, Section 46.111(b), including but not limited to employees
             (temporary, part-time, full time, etc.) or a family member of the research staff

             of the institutional review board (IRB).

          -  Subject has a history of any drug allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any
             opioids, APAP, or naltrexone which, in the opinion of the investigator, would place
             the subject at particular risk and compromise the safety of the subject in the study.

          -  Subject has a positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             (surface antigen), or hepatitis C virus antibody.

          -  Subject has a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) value that is outside the reference
             range at the Screening Visit.

          -  Subject has donated or had significant loss of whole blood (480 mL or more) within 30
             days, or plasma within 14 days, prior to the Screening Visit or plans to donate blood
             or plasma while enrolled in this study.

          -  Subject has smoked or used nicotine-containing products 6 months prior to the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Subject has current or recent (within 2 years of the Screening Visit) drug or alcohol
