  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous study showed circulating tumor DNA levels reflect the total systemic tumor burden.
      Circulating tumor DNA levels should decrease after complete surgery and could be increase as
      tumor recurrence. Few study investigated the half time of circulating tumor DNA in lung
      cancer patients that no criterion has been established of how to use it for surveillance.

    <textblock>
      For lung cancer patients who received surgery, multiple time of plasma will be collected
      before or after surgery. A series of mutations will be detected in plasma before surgery
      based on next generation sequencing. The positive mutation will be traced after surgery and
      in follow up.
