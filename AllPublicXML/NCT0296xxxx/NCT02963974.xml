      This feasibility study evaluates whether children with unilateral, moderate to profound
      sensorineural hearing loss experience an improvement in speech perception, hearing in noise,
      localization, and quality of life with a cochlear implant as compared to an unaided listening
      condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral hearing loss (UHL) is a term used to describe a substantial hearing loss in one
      ear and normal hearing in the contralateral ear. Despite normal hearing in one ear, these
      individuals experience reduced speech perception in noise, variable abilities on localization
      tasks, increased reports of hearing handicap, reduced quality of life, and often, they obtain
      limited or no benefit from conventional amplification. In the United States, the prevalence
      of UHL in children ranges from 0.03% to 3%, depending on the age of the child.

      Cochlear implantation performed for children with bilateral, severe to profound deafness has
      significant impacts on several aspects of child development.

      The practice of providing cochlear implants to children who have significant hearing loss in
      one ear is of great interest and is occurring with greater frequency as reported in case
      studies and small set clinical reports. The primary purpose of this feasibility study is to
      demonstrate the effectiveness of cochlear implantation in children, age 3 years 6 months to 6
      years, 6 months, with moderate to profound UHL. Postoperative results will be evaluated with
      speech perception measures, localization tasks, hearing in noise tasks, and subjective
      reports.

    <description>The Speech Spatial Qualities Questionnaire requires participants to rate their perceived hearing ability for 49 scenarios using a 10-point scale, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 10 (Perfectly). A score higher than 0 for each listening scenario shows some benefit of the device, while a score of 10 indicates the device was extremely beneficial. The SSQ questionnaire assesses performance in three domains, hearing speech in quiet and noise environments (9 items), spatial or directional hearing (5 items) and sound qualities (8 items), which address sound segregation and listening effort. Domain scores represent an average of item ratings. A modified version of this test will be used.</description>

    <description>PedsQL Multidimensional fatigue scale (Varni, Limbers &amp; Burwinkle, 2007) is a validated scale for determining fatigue in young children, including general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue and cognitive fatigue.

        i) Inclusion Criteria

          1. Unilateral moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss.

               1. Unaided residual hearing thresholds that yield a PTA at frequencies 500Hz, 1K Hz
                  and 2K Hz of ≥70 dB HL in the ear to be implanted. It is possible that subjects
                  may have hearing at other frequencies not included in this average.

               2. Hearing thresholds in the contralateral ear of ≤25 dB HL

          2. Between 3 years, 6 mos and 6 years, 6 mos of age at implantation.

          3. Anatomically normal cochlear nerve

          4. Cochlear anatomy that is amenable to cochlear implantation as evaluated by imaging
             (modality at the physician's discretion) including:

               1. Normal cochlear anatomy or

               2. Incomplete Partition Type II (IP2) with or without Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct
                  (EVA) or

               3. EVA with normal partitioning

          5. No evidence of progressive hearing loss.

          6. Willing to undergo 4 week hearing aid trial as warranted based on achieving desired
             audibility when fitted via real ear DSL method.

          7. Aided word recognition in the ear to be implanted of 30% or less as measured with CNC
             words (50-word list)

               1. When listening with an appropriately fit hearing aid and masking applied to the
                  contralateral ear (Turner, 2004).

               2. Aided testing will be conducted in a sound-proof booth with the participant
                  seated 1 meter from the sound source, facing 0° azimuth. Recorded materials will
                  be presented at 60 dB SPL.

          8. Realistic parental expectations: a verbal acknowledgement of the potential benefits
             and risks, and postoperative variation in performance. For instance, cochlear
             implantation will not restore normal hearing.

        (9) Development and cognition within the normal range as measured by the Leiter-R test of
        nonverbal intelligence and cognitive abilities and the Bracken Basic Concept Scale

          6. History of condition that contraindicates middle or inner ear surgery or anesthesia
             (i.e. otitis media refractory to treatment)
