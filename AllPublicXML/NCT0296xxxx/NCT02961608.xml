  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LCP-Tacro is an extended-release formulation of tacrolimus designed for once-daily dosing.
      Phase 1 studies demonstrated greater bioavailability than twice-daily tacrolimus capsules and
      no new safety concerns.

        -  Stable kidney transplant patients can be safely converted from Adoport® twice-daily to
           LCP-Tacro®.

        -  The greater bioavailability of LCP-Tacro after once-daily dosing results in similar
           (AUC) exposure, at a dose approximately 30% less, than the total daily dose of Adoport®.

        -  LCP-Tacro provides a slow drug release and this results in flatter kinetics
           characterized by significantly lower peak-trough fluctuations.

        -  CN is the major cellular target of the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) cyclosporine A
           (CsA) and tacrolimus. The ability of these drugs to inhibit CN activity is dependent on
           their binding to the respective immunophilins, cyclophilins A and B for CsA and FKBP12
           for tacrolimus.

        -  CN inhibition is a rate limiting phenomenon. Over concentrations of tacrolimus does not
           correlate with an increase in the CN activity.
