      The purpose of this study is to collect patient outcomes data for patients who are undergoing
      an Exactech Optetrak速 primary total knee replacement using the Exactech Guided Personalized
      Surgery (eGPS速) manufactured or distributed by (Exactech, Gainesville, Florida, USA). Patient
      outcomes data are important for assessing the post-market safety and effectiveness of
      orthopedic medical devices.
