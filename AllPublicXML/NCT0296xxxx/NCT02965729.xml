  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to examine the influence of step goals with pedometers to
      improve children's weight loss, physical activity, and psychosocial health during behavioral
      treatment. Children with overweight or obesity were assigned to receive the behavioral
      treatment alone, plus pedometers, or plus pedometers with step goals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 105 overweight and obese children ages 8 to 17 years participated in a 10-week
      family-based weight management intervention focusing on physical activity, nutrition, and
      behavioral modification. A quasi-experimental design was used to group cohorts into three
      conditions: two cohorts had no pedometer (n=24); two cohorts had pedometer only (n=25); and
      four cohorts had pedometer with step goals (i.e. 500 steps/day weekly increase above
      baseline; n=56). Height and weight were measured at baseline and week 10 and used to
      calculate body mass index (BMI). Analysis of covariance was performed to examine difference
      by condition for change in weight, BMI, and BMI z-score, controlling for age and baseline
      value. Differences in steps/day and psychosocial health were compared between the two
      pedometer conditions.

    <description>The &quot;Our Lifestyles, Our Lives&quot; family-based weight management intervention consisted of 10 weekly 90-minute group sessions focused on physical activity, nutrition, and behavioral modification. Parents and siblings were encouraged to join the participant in these sessions. Sessions were interactive and included cooking demonstrations, light to moderate intensity physical activity that engaged all family members, and behavioral counseling sessions in both mixed (parent and child) and parent-only format.</description>
