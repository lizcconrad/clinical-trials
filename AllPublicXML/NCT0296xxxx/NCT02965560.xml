  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an ailment with high incidence of multiorgan failure
      (MOF) and consequent mortality. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are
      characteristic pathophysiological features. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) could subdue systemic
      inflammation and alleviate liver injury in mice model. However, there are no studies
      evaluating PGE2 as a predictor of early mortality.This study is designed to investigate
      whether plasma PGE2 and its receptors are associated with development of MOF and predict
      short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. By the way, we will
      also measure several other potential predictive factors (C-reactive protein,severe
      hyponatremia, Second infections,Diabetes mellitus,High density
      lipoprotein,interleukin-10,serum bile acids,ferritin,the neutrophil to lymphocyte
      ratio,urokinase plasminogen activator receptor,vWF-Ag levels and FVIII-to-PC ratios).
