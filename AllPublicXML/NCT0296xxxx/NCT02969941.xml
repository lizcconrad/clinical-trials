      To investigate the treatment effect of continuous transcranial magnetic stimulation on
      patients with Parkinson disease, and the underlying neural mechanism by functional MRI

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients underwent a medical evaluation that included physical examination and routine
      laboratory studies before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to rTMS group and the sham group. There are about
      30 patients in each group. For the first 30 patients, allocation was by coin toss. For the
      subsequent 30 patients, allocation was according to computer generated random numbers. The
      decision to enroll a patient was always made prior to randomization. Patients were studied
      using a double-blind design. Study participants, clinical raters, and all personnel
      responsible for the clinical care of the patient remained masked to allocated condition and
      allocation parameters. Only rTMS administrators had access to the randomization list; they
      had minimal contact with the patients, and no role in assessing clinical symptoms. Each
      patient would be treated for continuous 15 days by rTMS.

      Before the rTMS treatment, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and the Non-motor
      Symptom Scale were obtained by a trained investigator to assess baseline severity. The
      patients had receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests(mini-mental state
      examination, Montreal cognitive assessment, digital span test, verbal fluency test, Hamilton
      depression/anxiety scale, Stroop test, Iowa gambling test, game of dice test, stop signal
      test, and delay discount), magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and
      electroencephalography (EEG) record.

      In the second day after the last treatment, all the tests were reassessed. Patients were
      instructed to focus their answers on the past 15 days. The patients had also receiving a
      battery measure of neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging scan in
      multimodalities, and EEG record.

      The clinical symptom and cognition of participants were followed in two month after the last
      treatment. They were instructed to focus their answers on the past week. Additionally, they
      were also asked to assess the battery of neuropsychological tests, and have magnetic
      resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and EEG record. Afterwards, they were unblinded by
      the study coordinator.

    <description>The continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. In the cTBS session, this 40s protocol was repeated for three times (1800 pulses in total) separated by two 15 min breaks (controlled by a stopwatch). MRI dataset should be acquired before the first cTBS session and after the last cTBS session.</description>

    <description>The procedure of this protocol was performed by a placebo coil. Each session lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. No actual magnetic stimulation was applied on the head of the volunteers. MRI dataset should be acquired before the first sham TBS session and after the last sham TBS session.</description>
