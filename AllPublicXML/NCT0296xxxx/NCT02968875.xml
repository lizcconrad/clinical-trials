  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease leading to one of the most common
      forms of dementia in humans and memory disorder is one of the first symptoms that lead to
      diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Present in greater amounts in the regions of the hippocampus and cortex, the Brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to both learning and memory processes. This protein
      is found in lower amounts in people with AD. Acute physical activity of moderate to vigorous
      intensity would increase the levels of plasma BDNF whether for a healthy person or a person
      with AD. Nevertheless in rest, healthy people have higher level of BDNF than individuals with
      AD. There are no studies on the effect of chronic exercise based on BDNF level at rest in
      people with AD. In a hypothetical endurance training of 18 sessions, whether interval or
      continuous training the levels of BDNF would increase in people with AD at rest. Their
      physiological and neuropsychological performances would also show a rise.

    <description>The first group of 40 people will do endurance training; 20 of them will perform a continuous exercise on cycle ergometer at a power equivalent to 70% of the maximal heart rate, twice a week. The other group will do Interval Training, with a four minute long base and one minute long peak, twice a week. The base workload will be equivalent to an intensity of 60% of the maximal heart rate and the peak will be equivalent to 80% of the maximal heart rate.</description>

    <description>40 people will submitted to endurance training: 20 will perform a continuous training and 20 will perform an interval training. The variables that will be analyzed are maximum aerobic power, endurance, heart rate, prehension strength, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), REY's test, biological examination and level of BDNF plasma, before and after the intervention and one month after the end of the intervention and one month after the end of the intervention.</description>
