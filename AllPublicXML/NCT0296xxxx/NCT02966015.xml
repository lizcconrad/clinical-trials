    <description>The subjects had to evaluate if it was possible to insert and navigate the Coloplast Test catheter through urethra by the 5-point Likert question: &quot;How did you find the catheter navigates through the urethra during insertion&quot; ( Very easily, Easily, Neither/nor, Difficultly, Very difficultly, Not possible). The catheterization was considered successful if it was possible to insert the catheter, meaning that ifthey selected any other answer than 'not possible'.</description>
