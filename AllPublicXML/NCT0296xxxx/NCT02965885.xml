  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A First-in-Human (FIH) study of TAS-116 in patients with advanced solid tumors was first
      initiated in Japan in April 2014 and has been ongoing since then. The study consists of a
      dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. Three dosing regimens of TAS-116, once
      daily (QD), every other day (QOD) and 5 days on/2 days off regimens in 21-day cycles, are
      being evaluated. This phase I study is also planned to enroll patients with advanced solid
      tumors in UK to confirm the MTD, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TAS-116 in a
      Western patient population in the dose expansion phase. In addition, patients with HER2+ MBC,
      NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations or NSCLC harbouring ALK translocations will be further
      evaluated for safety, tolerability, and efficacy in 3 separate cohorts at recommended dose of
      TAS-116 on the 5 days on/2 days off regimen.
