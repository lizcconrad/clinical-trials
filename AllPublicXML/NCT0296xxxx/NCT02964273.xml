  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the long term safety of treatment with
      tolvaptan in children and adolescents with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
      (ADPKD). The secondary objective is to assess the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and
      efficacy of tolvaptan in the same subject population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tolvaptan has been demonstrated to delay the decline of kidney function in adults with
      rapidly progressing ADPKD (CKD stages 1 to 3) as measured by estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR) and Total Kidney Volume (TKV).

      This trial will be the first trial of tolvaptan in children and adolescents with ADPKD.

      Subjects in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in Phase A; tolvaptan
      or placebo. Participants will have an equal chance of being assigned to either treatment
      group and will be stratified by age and gender into the following cohorts:

        -  Female subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive

        -  Female subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive

        -  Male subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive

        -  Male subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive

      Phase (A) of this study will last 12 months. After that time, all subjects who qualify will
      be assigned tolvaptan and will be treated with tolvaptan for 24 months (Phase B).

      A qualified subject is defined as one who has completed Phase A on investigational medicinal
      product (IMP), is willing to continue in the trial, and who does not have any adverse events
      (AEs), which would require IMP discontinuation.

      Participants in this study will be required to make monthly visits to the study clinic and
      will be closely monitored over the course of the study.

Subjects will be randomized to receive either active tolvaptan or matching placebo for 12 months in Phase A, followed by open-label tolvaptan for 24 months in Phase B. Study medication will be administered orally as a split-dose, with the first dose taken upon awakening and the second dose taken approximately 8 hours later. Phase A and Phase B starting doses will be based on weight. After 1 week, subjects will be asked to up-titrate once from their starting dose.

             claustrophobia).

          -  Subjects with a history of taking a vasopressin agonist/antagonist.

          -  Subjects taking medications or having concomitant illnesses likely to confound
             endpoint assessments, including taking approved (ie, marketed) therapies for the
             purpose of affecting polycystic kidney disease (PKD) cysts such as tolvaptan,
             vasopressin antagonists, anti-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapies, rapamycin,
             sirolimus, everolimus, or somatostatin analogs (ie, octreotide, sandostatin).
