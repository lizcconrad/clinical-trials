  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent clinical condition in hospitalized, in particular, in
      critically ill children. Moreover, AKI is an independent predictor of mortality. An incidence
      of AKI in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) between 10 and 62% has been reported in
      recent clinical trials adopting pRIFLE or AKIN criteria, with the highest risk present in
      cardiac surgery patients. Despite significant developments in the management of AKI, the
      overall mortality rate of patients with AKI has not improved significantly. Currently, there
      is no consensus concerning the optimum dialysis modalities to adopt in pediatric AKI. No
      studies have prospectively compared the efficacy of different types of RRT for pediatric AKI.
      While PD remains the most commonly used modality in children worldwide, over the last decade
      CRRT has become the preferred treatment modality for critically ill children with AKI in
      North America.

      The investigators have recently conducted a survey among 34 European Pediatric Nephrology
      Centers in the ESCAPE Network to obtain current information on dialysis management practices
      in children. Approximately 900 children with AKI requiring dialysis are managed at these 34
      centers per year. This number supports the creation of a prospective European AKI registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main scope of the Registry is to report the epidemiology and outcome of children with AKI
      treated with dialysis in over 30 Pediatric Nephrology Centers in Europe. Secondary aims are
      to verify the association of a specific dialysis modality with the outcome and the
      association of primary disease, co-morbidities, nephrotoxic agents, fluid overload, anuria,
      basic hemodynamic parameters (BP, HR), basic nutritional intakes (protein and calorie supply)
      with the outcome.

      Data capture will be exclusively web-based via electronic case report forms. Every
      participating site will be provided with a unique code and password that identify the
      corresponding site.
