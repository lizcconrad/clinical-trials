  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase III randomized controlled trial on men and women with Metabolic syndrome (MetS) to test
      the hypothesis that comprehensive life-style changes and/or metformin treatment prevent
      age-related chronic non-communicable diseases (ArCD).

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a comprehensive life-style
      intervention (including moderate physical activity and Mediterranean/macrobiotic diet with
      moderate calorie and protein restriction), and of treatment with Metformin (a calorie
      restriction mimetic drug) for the prevention of ArCD.

      Phase III randomized controlled trial on men and women with MetS to test the hypothesis that
      comprehensive life-style changes and/or metformin treatment prevent ArCD.

      Design:

      2x2 factorial: 2,000 volunteers will be randomized in four equal groups of 500 each, and
      allocated to the following treatments: METFORMIN (1700MG/DAY) + ACTIVE LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION
      PLACEBO + ACTIVE LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION METFORMIN (1700 mg/day) alone PLACEBO alone The
      metformin /placebo component of the study will be double blind.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 55-74, waist circumference equal or greater than 85 cm for women and 100 cm for
             men, plus at least two other factors among those defining the MetS

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed diabetes (or baseline fasting glycemia above 7mmol/L at baseline
             examination)

          -  Cancer (except skin carcinoma) diagnosed in the last 5 years, or under treatment

          -  Excessive frailty: in absence of agreed-upon measurements parameters and cutoff
             points, the investigator will exclude subjects under the lower 5th percentile of the
             muscular mass distribution estimated by impedance in previous studies

          -  Conditions that contraindicate the use of MET because might favour lactic acidosis:

               -  Renal, cardiac, hepatic, or respiratory insufficiency

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;124Î¼mol/L, or proteinuria at baseline examination

               -  Current treatment with K-sparing diuretics, or with proton pump inhibitors

               -  Excessive alcohol consumption

          -  Distressing side effects of MET treatment. Nausea and diarrhoea typically occur in
             about one third of patients receiving MET for the first time at full dose. To avoid
             dropouts for gastrointestinal discomfort we will treat all volunteers with half the
             planned dose for one month in order to exclude intolerant subjects before
             randomization. Participants randomized in the intervention group will continue to take
             half a dose for one month and then shift to the full dose.
