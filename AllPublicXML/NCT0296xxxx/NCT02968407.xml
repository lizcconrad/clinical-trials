    <textblock>
      The study group want to investigate whether doctors, who are in the beginning of their
      training to become surgeons, can rate themself and their peers using Objective Structured
      Assessment of Technical Skills. Participants have participated in a 6 weeks course in basic
      open surgical skills. At the end of the course the participants will be examined at at
      videotaped test. The participants will be asked to rate their own video and two videos of
      other trainees' performances. Ratings will be compared to expert ratings.

      The study is a prospective, descriptive study investigating whether doctors are able to rate
      their own and their peers' performance in a basic open surgery skill course. At the end of
      the course in basic open surgery, participants will be examined at the post-test as described
      in the protocol &quot;The effect of group dynamics in surgical skill training&quot;. After the
      participants complete the post-test, participants will be asked to participate in this
      additional study. The participants will receive no instructions on this additional study,
      before they complete the study &quot;The effect of group dynamics in surgical skill training&quot;.

    <description>Participants will be given a print and a e-mail of the modified OSATS global rating scale and will be introduced to how the rating scale is used to rate technical performance. The participant will receive a USB stick each allowing the participant to see a video of his/her own performance and two videos from previous post-test performances from participants enrolled in the course. One video is a video of a participant who performed poorly,the other is from a participant who performed well. The participants will be asked to watch and rate the videos of their peers' performance first and afterwards watch and rate the participants own video performance. The investigators choose to let the participants rate their peers' performances before their own, so the participants will have the best opportunities to self-rate. Participants will be asked to email the results of their ratings to the principal investigator within 3 days. And expert in surgery will also rate the videos using OSATS.</description>
