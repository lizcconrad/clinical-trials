    <textblock>
      UX007G-CL301 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of UX007 in the treatment of movement disorders associated
      with Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome. The study will enroll approximately 40
      subjects who experience disabling paroxysmal movement disorders.

      UX007G-CL301 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of UX007 in Glut1 DS. The study will enroll approximately 40 pediatric,
      adolescent, and adult subjects who are not on KD and are having disabling paroxysmal movement
      disorders. A movement disorder event is defined in this study as a period of time when the
      subject experiences one or more movement disorder symptoms, including symptoms that are
      experienced during a movement disorder event alone or significant worsening of continuous
      movement disorders. In this study, movement disorder events are defined as disabling if they
      affect or limit a subject's activities of daily living.

      During the 6-week Run-in Period, subjects will record disabling paroxysmal movement disorder
      events in a daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary; if the minimum criterion for number of
      events is not met or subjects complete &lt;80% of the daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary,
      the subject will be considered a screen failure and will not be randomized. Individuals may
      be allowed to rescreen, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, subject to approval
      by the Medical Monitor.

      At the end of the Run-in Period, eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to one of
      two treatment sequences (UX007/placebo or placebo/UX007). At Randomization, subjects will
      begin a 10-week double-blind Treatment Period 1. Treatment Period 1 will consist of a 2-week
      titration period and an 8-week Maintenance Period. At the end of Treatment Period 1, subjects
      will discontinue treatment and begin a 2-week washout period to minimize any potential
      carryover effect. Subjects will crossover to the second randomized, double-blind treatment
      assignment (placebo to UX007, UX007 to placebo) for an additional 10 weeks during Treatment
      Period 2. Treatment Period 2 will consist of a 2-week titration period and an 8-week
      Maintenance Period. At the end of the blinded crossover period (Week 22), all active subjects
      will have the option of rolling into the open-label Extension Period, to continue UX007
      treatment for up to 3 years or until one of the following occurs: the subject withdraws
      consent, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator,
      the study is terminated, or until commercial availability of the study drug in a subject's
      region, whichever occurs first. Long-term safety and maintenance of effect of UX007 will be
      assessed during the open-label Extension Period. A Safety Follow-up Phone Call will be
      conducted 30-35 days after the last dose of UX007G-CL301 study drug.
