    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of erlotinib hydrochloride and how well it works
      in reducing duodenal polyp burden in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis at risk of
      developing colon cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the mean percent change in duodenal polyp burden (sum of diameters from all
      polyps) from baseline to 6 months post-intervention for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
      subjects receiving weekly erlotinib hydrochloride (erlotinib).

      II. To assess the grade 2/3 adverse event rate in this population and compare it to
      historical data.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate all adverse events at least possibly attributed to weekly erlotinib.

      II. To assess the absolute and percent change in duodenal polyp number from baseline to 6
      months.

      III. To assess the absolute and percent changes in lower gastrointestinal polyp burden and
      number for the subset of participants with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) or ileo-rectal
      anastomosis with rectal stump.

      IV. To assess the absolute and percent change in desmoid tumor size in participants who have
      baseline and follow up computed tomography (CT)s performed as part of their standard of care.

      V. Gene expression profiles in duodenal adenomas and uninvolved tissue will be compared
      between baseline and endpoint samples using negative binomial statistics (DESeq2).

      VI. Identify differentially expressed genes between duodenal polyps and uninvolved tissue at
      endpoint compared to baseline.

      VII. Evaluate the effect of weekly erlotinib on EGFR and Wnt target gene expression in
      duodenal adenomas.

      VIII. Evaluate the effect of weekly erlotinib on immune response signaling in duodenal
      adenomas and uninvolved tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once weekly. Treatment continues for up
      to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>All registered and treated participants will be evaluable for AEs from the time of their first dose of weekly erlotinib treatment. To evaluate the AE profile for this treatment, the maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each participant and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine the overall patterns. The number and severity of adverse events will be tabulated and summarized across all grades. Grade 2+ adverse events will be similarly described and summarized separately. Overall toxicity incidence, as well as toxicity profiles will be explored and summarized. Frequency distributions, graphical techniques, and other descriptive measures will form the basis of these analyses. In addition, all adverse event data that are graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either &quot;unrelated or unlikely to be related&quot; to the study intervention in the event of an actual relationship developing will be reviewed.</description>

    <description>Laboratory measures will be correlated with participant outcomes (i.e., polyp burden, adverse events) and with each other as well. Cut-points will be determined based on previously defined and accepted standards. Descriptive statistics and simple scatter plots will be generated to review the tissue-based biomarker data. For continuous variables, the actual and % change in the level of each of the biomarkers from pre- to post-intervention will be explored using Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and paired sample t-tests. All categorical variables will be analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test. For all translational endpoints, any notable statistical result will be viewed as an impetus for further study rather than as a definitive finding in and of itself.</description>
