  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized study designed as a 2x2 cross-over in two periods (Period 1 and
      Period 2) to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of
      EOS789 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyperphosphatemia receiving
      hemodialysis. Period 1 is double-blind and Period 2 is open-label. Period 1 and Period 2 are
      identical with regard to the design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and assessments. EOS789
      and its combination with sevelamer carbonate are tested in Period 1 and Period 2
      respectively.
