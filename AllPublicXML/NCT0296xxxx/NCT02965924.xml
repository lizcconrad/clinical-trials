  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist
      commonly used topically for dilation prior to ocular fundus examination. In the eye,
      phenylephrine acts locally as a potent vasoconstrictor and mydriatic by constricting
      ophthalmic blood vessels and the radial dilator muscle of the iris. Episcleral venous
      pressure (EVP) is a determinant of intraocular pressure (IOP) and can be measured
      non-invasively by venomanometry. Since phenylephrine is a vasoconstrictor, it may affect
      episcleral venous tone, but the effect on EVP is unknown. Understanding the physiology of
      episcleral veins helps us in better understanding of pathophysiology of glaucoma.
