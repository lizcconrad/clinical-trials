    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) and acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and documented mutation of extra cellular domain EGFR
      (ECD-EGFR).
