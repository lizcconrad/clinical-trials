  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is the determination of the in-vivo ultrafiltration
      coefficient (in-vivo KUF) for Diacap Pro dialyzers following routine dialysis prescription in
      the United States.

    <textblock>
      The in-vivo KUF for Diacap Pro High Flux dialysers with the surface sizes of 1.3/ 1.6/ 1.9
      sqm will be determined as required by the US guideline &quot;Guidance for the Content of Premarket
      Notifications for Conventional and High Permeability Hemodialyzers 1998&quot; for comparison with
      the in-vitro KUF data.

      Clinical data of at least 12 patients will be collected for determination of the in-vivo KUF
      complemented by safety-, performance-data for the removal of small and middle molecular
      substances and hemocompatibility data.
