  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of Bronchial Thermoplasty on moderate
      bronchial asthma in China, by observing the improvement of quality of life, the decrease of
      acute attack and emergence, as well as the incidence of related complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label and single arm study. At least 50 patients with moderate
      asthma receive Bronchial Thermoplasty for three times. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire
      (AQLQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), Frequency of mild asthma acute attack, PEF, FEV1,
      Emergency and Hospitalization are compared between before and after BT treatment.

      The unified peak flow test meter will be provided to all subjects enrolled in this study.
      They will get a follow-up diary book before leaving hospital. In order to ensure the
      efficiency, all enrolled asthma patients are trained and tested by doctors and nurses from
      in-patient or out-patient department when they follow up, including how to use the PEF meter,
      how to read and record the data. As for the dosage of medication, all the medication uses are
      followed the doctor's advice, once the rescue medications were used, the times and dosages
      are mandatory to be recorded in the diary book by the patients themselves.

    <description>A mild exacerbation is defined as 2 consecutive days when at least one of the following occurs:1. Morning peak expiratory flow falls at least 20% below the average morning peak flow recorded at the baseline (the first 2 weeks during the 4-week baseline period).
2. More than 3 more puffs of rescue short acting bronchodilator are required than the average usage at the baseline(the first 2 weeks during the 4-week baseline period).
3. Awakening at night with asthma symptoms.</description>
