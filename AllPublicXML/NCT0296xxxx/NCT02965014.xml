    <textblock>
      This three-arm cross-over cluster-randomized trial will develop, test, and compare the
      efficacy of two delivery formats of the Women's CoOp (WC), which is designed to provide risk
      reduction and empowerment skills, as well as linkages to healthcare services for
      substance-using women. The current study will develop a revised version of the WC and
      evaluate the relative efficacy of a face-to-face (face-to-face WC), mobile Health application
      (mHealth WC) delivery format, and HIV counseling and testing (HCT) as a control to reduce
      risky sexual behaviors, reduce substance use, and increase sexual negotiation among young
      (18-25 years) substance-using African American women who are sexually active and have not
      recently been tested for HIV in three NC counties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use the seek, test, treat, and retain framework to develop
      and test the efficacy of a clinic-based, age-appropriate, woman-focused HIV intervention to
      reduce sexual risk and increase sexual negotiation among up to 700 young sexually active and
      drug-using, African American women aged 18 to 25 in three North Carolina counties. We will
      test the delivery of the woman-focused intervention conducted in two formats, face- to-face
      WC and mHealth WC, using a three-arm cross-over cluster-randomized design in which counties
      are randomized to (1) HCT as the control, (2) face-to-face WC; and (3) mHealth WC that will
      be delivered on tablets using an interactive app. We will fulfill the purpose of this study
      through the following aims: (Aim 1) To develop a new WC intervention and recruitment
      strategies using formative methods to engage substance-using young African American women who
      have not recently been tested for HIV, clinic staff, and stakeholders to ensure age
      appropriateness, to identify barriers to reaching these young women and the challenges in
      conducting the intervention in the clinics, and to develop the mHealth WC; (Aim 2) To test
      the efficacy of two formats of the woman-focused intervention program (face-to-face WC and
      mHealth WC) relative to HCT with up to 700 young women aged 18 to 25 in three North Carolina
      county health departments for primary outcomes at 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments: and
      to assess access to, referral, and retention in health services, such as substance abuse
      treatment, reproductive health care, and other health care; (Aim 3) To estimate the total
      costs of implementing the face-to-face WC and mHealth WC interventions, and to assess the
      resource components that drive these costs; and (Aim 4) To examine the extent to which the
      face-to-face WC and mHealth WC are perceived by collaborating health clinic staff and
      participants as being acceptable and sustainable.

    <ipd_description>Analytic data sets will be prepared in accordance with the &quot;Privacy Rule&quot; of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/) as &quot;limited data sets&quot; in which names and other personal health identifiers are removed, birthdays have been converted to age at intake, and other dates have been changed to be days before or after the date of intake. Because there are fewer than 20,000 people in the data set, HIPAA says we cannot ensure that it is completely &quot;de-identified&quot;; consequently, HIPAA requires that we treat it as a &quot;limited data set&quot; and that we have a data sharing agreement (DSA) in place before giving anyone access to the client-level data. After the main findings are published, we will welcome other researchers who want to analyze the data in other ways. Requesting access to data will involve drafting an abstract, checking the feasibility relative to the available data, and seeking the permission of the PI and her team.</ipd_description>
