  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to further understand the memory response to HPV vaccination
      in subjects who have received 2 versus 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Although memory
      responses can be detected shortly after immunization, the best approach to measure the
      long-lasting anamnestic response is to challenge with a booster dose years (&gt; 5) after the
      original exposure.

      This is a single center, interventional study to evaluate long term memory response to Q-HPV
      vaccination and to natural infection. Memory response will be assessed by measuring
      seroprotection 8-10 years post Q-HPV vaccination and to challenge with a booster dose years
      after the original exposure to measure the long-lasting anamnestic response.
