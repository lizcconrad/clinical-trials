      A Phase 1, Randomized, Open-Label, 3-Way Crossover, Pilot, Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate
      the Steady State Pharmacokinetics of a Once-Weekly Application of Corplex Donepezil
      Transdermal Delivery System (TDS) Compared to Daily Oral Administration of Aricept in Healthy
      Adult Subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A:

      60 male and female subjects will be enrolled Subjects will receive 2 versions of once-weekly
      Corplex Donepezil TDS and QD oral Aricept; each administered for 35 days in 3 different
      treatment periods.

      For each treatment period; Subjects will receive a lead-in dose of approximately 5 mg
      donepezil/day for 7 days before commencing a dose of 10 mg donepezil/day for 28 days. Blood
      samples for donepezil PK and red blood cell (RBC) AChEI (as a potential pharmacodynamic [PD]
      marker) will be collected pre-dose through Week 8.

      Adhesion and skin irritation will be monitored throughout TDS Treatments. A washout period of
      at least 21 days between the last study drug administration (oral administration or removal
      of TDS, as appropriate) in each treatment period and the first application of TDS or oral
      drug administration, as appropriate, in the following treatment period.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by adverse event reporting, repeated clinical
      and laboratory evaluations

      Part B:

      Up to 47 subjects male and/or female will be enrolled This is an open-label, randomized,
      2-way crossover sub-study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences
      prior to the first TDS application.

      Subjects will receive 2 different once-weekly Corplex Donepezil TDS treatments (Treatments D
      and E), each administered for 1 week, in 2 different treatment periods (Treatment Period 1
      and Treatment Period 2).

      In each treatment period, subjects will receive a target dose of 5 mg donepezil/day for 7
      days. There will be a washout period of 35 days between removal of the first TDS in Treatment
      Period 1 and application of the second TDS in Treatment Period 2.

      Blood samples for donepezil PK will be collected pre-dose and through to Week 6 of each
      treatment period.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the sub-study by repeated clinical, skin irritation and
      laboratory evaluations.

Skin irritation assessed using 8 pt categorical scale based on former FDA.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/990236GD.pdf. The Skin Irritation scale is: no irritation; minimal erythema/barely perceptible; definite erythema readily visible, minimal edema or minimal papular response; erythema and papules; definite edema; erythema, edema and papules; vesicular eruption; strong reaction spreading beyond application site.</description>

Adhesion is based on the adhered area (%) of the patch according to FDA.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory Information/Guidances/UCM504157.pdf. Specifically: ≥ 90% adhered (essentially no lift off skin); ≥ 75% to &lt;90% adhered (some edges only lifting off skin); ≥ 50% to &lt;75% adhered (less than half the TDS lifting off skin); &lt; 50% adhered but did not detach (not detached, but more than half of the TDS lifting off skin without falling off); patch completely detached (TDS detached, completely off skin).</description>
