      Efficacy outcome will be evaluated the major cerebro-cardiovascular event including stroke,
      cardiovascular death, and myocardial infarction during 1 year-medication period. In addition,
      safety outcome will be evaluated the gastrointestinal responses including peptic ulcer and
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding events to both study drugs by repeated gastroenteroscopic
      examinations before and after medication by GI specialist.
