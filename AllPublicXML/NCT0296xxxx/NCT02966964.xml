      The patient who meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria is assigned to Test1 group or Test 2
      group or control group randomly.

      All subjects take one pill of Viread® Tab. (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300mg) once a day
      for 48 weeks. At the same time, all randomized subjects take two pills of DWPUR001 or Placebo
      of DWPUR001 twice a day for 48 weeks.
