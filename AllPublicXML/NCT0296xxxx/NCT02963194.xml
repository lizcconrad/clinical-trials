  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) influences self-processing by
      investigating whether it increases the endowment effect in relation to both self and others.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, between- subject placebo (PLC) controlled design, investigator aimed to
      measure the effect of intranasal OXT on the endowment effect. All subjects completed a range
      of questionnaires measuring personality and affective traits and levels of anxiety before
      self-administration: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) , State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI) , Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), self-esteem scale (SES). Subjects were
      asked to decide whether to buy or sell their own or others' (their mothers'/ fathers'/
      classmate'/ strangers') possessions at various prices. Indifference point and brain
      activation were inluded into analysis as dependent variables.
