  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess if grip strength can be used as a single, objective surrogate of
      frailty assessment in the surgical population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is associated with worse outcomes. Current screening surveys are cumbersome, most
      containing multiple components. For frail patients particularly, it can be difficult to
      ascertain all the information requested. There is a need for a simple, one step, objective
      screening measure of frailty. There is some evidence in the medicine patients that grip
      strength may be related to frailty, but no such information is available for surgical
      patients.
