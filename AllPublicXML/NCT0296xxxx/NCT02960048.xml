    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Michigan-type occlusal splint and anterior repositioning
      splint in patients with temporomandibular joint anterior disc displacement with reduction.

      PICO:

      Population (P): Patients with symptomatic anterior disc displacement with reduction.

      Intervention (I): Michigan splint. Comparator (C): Anterior repositioning splint (ARS) .

      Outcome(O):

      Primary outcome: Patients' subjective pain experience. Each patient will be asked to rate his
      or her current and worst pain intensity on numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10 with zero
      being no pain and ten corresponds to the worst pain that the patient ever had.

      Secondary outcome:

        1. Maximum mouth opening (MMO). Assessment of MMO will be performed by measuring the
           distance in mm between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central incisors using a
           ruler.

        2. lateral excursion . Assessment of lateral excursion will be performed by measuring the
           distance in mm between midline of upper and lower jaws

        3. protrusion. distance in mm from the incisal edge of the maxillary central incisor to the
           incisor edge of the mandibular incisor will measured in the maximum protruded position.

    <description>A 2-mm-thick, hard, clear sheet of resin will be adapted to the maxillary arch .
Small amount of self-curing acrylic will be added to the anterior portion of the appliance as a stop for the lower incisor. The area of this stop is approximately 4 to 6 mm. The patient is instructed to protrude the mandible slightly and to open and close the mouth In this position.
Self-curing acrylic will be added to the occluding surface of the appliance. All occluding areas, except the contact on the anterior stop .
Excess acrylic surrounding the centric contacts is removed with a hard rubber wheel on a lathe.</description>
