  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of catheter-based thrombectomy for reperfusion by
      removing a thrombus in a cerebral blood vessel in patients with acute cerebral infarction
      (within 8 hours after onset), in whom intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen
      activator (t-PA) is not indicated or reperfusion cannot be achieved by intravenous t-PA
      administration.
