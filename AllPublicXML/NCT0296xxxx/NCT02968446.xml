  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of an oral Vitamin D on the
      body's immune system.

      An interest has been growing because studies have shown that Vitamin D may reduce
      inflammation and harmful effects in the body, however, the best dose for Vitamin D is still
      unknown.

      Inflammation is the body's physical response to infection, injury, or long term disease.
      Pain, redness, heat, and sometimes loss of function are all signs of inflammation in the
      body. This study will look at product use, testing skin irritation in healthy volunteers and
      seeing how Vitamin D may help stop or reduce inflammation and skin irritation, which could
      one day help doctors prescribe Vitamin D to patients with long term disease to relieve their
      symptoms.

      Primary Endpoint To determine the effect of a topical application of Valchlor on human
      subjects at the clinically approved dose.

      Secondary Endpoint To establish the efficacy of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in reducing skin
      irritation 48 hours after topical application of Valchlor.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 week after mechloroethamine exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Skin erythema (redness) will be quantified using a CR300 chromameter. The difference in erythema between exposed and non-exposed skin will be calculated after valchlor exposure</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in skin thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week after mechloroethamine exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Skin thickness, an acute measure of edema, was quantified using a Mitutoyo 9mm dial caliper. Thickness measurements will be repeated in triplicate and the mean was used for all calculations. The difference in thickness between exposed and non-exposed skin will be calculated after valchlor exposure.</description>

    <measure>Change in TNF-alpha expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 hours after mechloroethamine exposure</time_frame>
    <description>A 6 mm punch biopsy specimen will be obtained from the valchlor exposure site 48hr after exposure. RNA will be extracted from fresh frozen punch biopsies using the RNeasy Lipid Mini Kit, and tissue mRNA expression of TNF-Î± will be quantified</description>
