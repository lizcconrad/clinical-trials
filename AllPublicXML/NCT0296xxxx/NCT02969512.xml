  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), leading to hip replacement, is a leading contributor to global mobility
      impairment. Given the boom in the older demographic it is not surprising that there is an 11%
      increased demand for replacement every 5 years in Canada. Health promotion interventions,
      such as prehabilitation, defined as pre-surgical education, are vital to optimizing surgical
      outcomes, reducing hospitalization costs, accelerating rehabilitation, and reducing patient
      discomfort and pre-operative anxiety. HIPPER is a 2-year randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      that will assess feasibility indicators and clinical outcomes of online prehab education
      modules compared to a traditional in-person education. The feasibility indicators (process,
      resource, management, and treatment issues) and clinical outcomes (physical function,
      anxiety, pain, satisfaction with education, and health related quality of life) will be
      assessed among Vancouver-dwelling older adults aged &gt; 50 years, with advanced hip
      osteoarthritis. The findings will lead to the refinement of the design protocol in order to
      evaluate a contemporary, standardized, and geographically accessible prehab education program
      in a large multi-site RCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will use a single-site, parallel group evaluator blind RCT. Subjects
      (N=40) will be randomly assigned to the experimental (HIPPER n=20) or control (n=20)
      groups.The experimental group will receive the interactive online HIPPER intervention
      consists of 10 modules (2 hrs/module) supported by phone access to Trainers. The control
      group is usual practice consisting of 2 x 2 hr small group educational sessions. Feasibility
      indicators (i.e. recruitment and retention; trainer and subject burden; safety; intervention
      administration/adherence; perceived benefit) will be evaluated as binary outcomes against
      pre-set parameters reflecting viability for a multi-site large-scale RCT. The primary
      clinical outcome of interest when assessing effect size for the eventual RCT is the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety. Secondary clinical outcomes include measures of pain,
      function, self-efficacy, environmental setup, physical activity and health related quality of
      life.

      Upon successful screening/enrollment and baseline data collection (T1) the Study Coordinator
      will contact the statistician by telephone or email and obtain group assignment within 48
      hours. Subjects will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio between groups. A central
      computerized randomization process will be designed by the statistician, with an undisclosed
      block size. Subject contact information will be forwarded to the appropriate group Trainer.
      To address bias, subjects will be instructed not to discuss their program and Testers will
      reinforce this point at each session. T1 data will be collected at our clinic while the
      follow up data collected 7-10 days prior to surgery (T2), 30 (T3) and 90 days (T4)
      post-surgery.

      The findings from the study will be summarized and mailed to each participant upon study
      completion. HIPPER and control group assessments will be held at GF Strong Rehabilitation
      Centre and at subject's homes.

      The outcome will lead to the refinement of the design protocol in order to robustly evaluate
      a contemporary, standardized, and geographically accessible prehabilitation education
      program. Ultimately, HIPPER may be found to have significant individual and social (health
      system level) benefits.

    <description>The HIPPER group will receive 10 interactive online modules (~20 minutes each). HIPPER participants will receive email or phone contact (participant preference) to provide them with website portal access consisting of the web address, simple instructions to access the website using personalized encrypted login information to the site, and a personalized exercise program.
Participants in the HIPPER group will also receive an exercise program. The exercise program is created by the Trainer (using the participant's baseline data) and will be provided to the participant by email or phone when providing the web portal access. Participants will be encouraged to accumulate a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity, at least 5 days per week.</description>

    <description>To provide a comparable level of education, participants in the In-Person Education group will receive 2 x 2-hour in-person educational small group sessions as per current practice.

    <description>Participants can complete the online educational modules at home or another location with internet access. The total time to complete all of the modules is about 2 hours and 30 minutes. A trainer (an occupational therapist or physiotherapist) will be able to remotely monitor the participant's progression on the HIPPER modules and will phone participants to check in if there is no online activity for 2 weeks. Participants will also be given the phone number and email of the trainer to contact if experiencing difficulty using the modules or with any other aspects of the study.
The total amount one could exercise using this program is 30 hours. However, it is up the participant how much they actually exercise.</description>
