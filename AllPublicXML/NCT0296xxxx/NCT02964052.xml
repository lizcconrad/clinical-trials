  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and intra-arterial (IA) recanalization treatment has
      been rapidly increasing, However, despite of the treatment, recanalization rates are 22.6 -
      70% and only 30-50% of patients show meaningful clinical improvements. Mechanisms of futile
      recanalization may include 1) large ischemic core, 2) poor collateral, and 3) presence of
      comorbidity. In this regards, developing selection criteria using acute stroke imaging and
      comorbidity is warranted.

      Investigators will recruit the consecutive acute stroke patients who received IV thrombolysis
      and/or IA recanalization treatment. This study will perform with prospective design to
      develop CT-based clot, core and collateral scores and a comorbidity index for selecting
      stroke patients who are at high risks by the treatment. Investigators will firstly establish
      the CT-based scores and comorbidity index using a pre-existing cohort database. Using these
      CT-based and comorbidity index, Investigators will validate them in a multi-center
      prospectively cohort. In addition, Investigators will assess the cost-effectiveness of
      selecting patients based on the comorbidity index.
