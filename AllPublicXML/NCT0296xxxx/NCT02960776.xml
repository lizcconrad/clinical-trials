  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to look at the effects of long-term, sustained sleep
      restriction (SR) in adults, and assess the effects on mood and cognitive and physical
      performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Sleep Restriction (SR) is highly prevalent in today's modern society. Artificial
      light, portable electronic devices, and 24-h services have allowed individuals to remain
      active throughout the night, leading to reductions in sleep duration. SSD has been linked to
      obesity and our laboratory has been interested in establishing whether sleep could be a
      causal factor in the etiology of obesity. Given the increasing prevalence of obesity over the
      past 5 decades, coinciding with the marked reduction in sleep duration, further exploration
      into the role of sleep as a risk factor for obesity could provide additional ammunition in
      the fight to prevent further increases in the incidence of obesity.

      This study will be a randomized, crossover, outpatient SR study with 2 phases of 6 weeks
      each, with a 6 week wash-out period between the phases. Sleep duration in each phase will be
      the participant's regular bed- and wake times during the habitual sleep (HS) phase and HS
      minus 1.5 hours in the SR phase. During the HS phase, participants will be asked to follow a
      fixed bedtime routine based on their screening sleep schedule. During the SR phase,
      participants will be asked to keep their habitual wake time constant but delay their bedtime
      to achieve a reduction of 1.5 hours in total sleep time.

    <description>Participants will be asked to keep their habitual wake time constant but delay their bedtime to achieve a reduction of 1.5 hours in total sleep time. A delay in bedtimes was chosen rather than advancing wake-up time because it most closely reflects differences in sleep timing behavior between short and normal sleepers.</description>
