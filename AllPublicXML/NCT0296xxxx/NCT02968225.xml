    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that this serious game (designed to provide a learning
      environment that maximizes opportunities for adolescents with autism to discover the
      functional utility of eye gaze) will improve sensitivity to eye gaze cues, specifically to
      identify gazed-at objects, and will also lead to increased social attention to faces in
      adolescents with autism. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a small-scale
      exploratory randomized control trial that will include both behavioral and eye tracking
      outcome measures.

    <description>The game involves viewing subtle nonverbal behaviors of game characters for the purpose of executing their own goal-directed behavior in the game related to solving various crimes. The learning involves interpreting nonverbal cues on the animated characters, such as pointing, head turns, eye gaze cues.</description>
