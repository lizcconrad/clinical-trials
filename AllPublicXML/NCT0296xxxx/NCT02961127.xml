    <textblock>
      The cases were hospitalized patients from two medical centers in Beijing and Harbin
      respectively. Venous blood was collected by standard vein puncture in fasting condition.

      In our study, the CAD was defined by one of the following criteria: (1) based on World Health
      Organization criteria in terms of elevations of cardiac enzymes, electrocardiography (ECG)
      and clinical symptoms (angina, chest pressure, or shortness of breath); (2) angiographic
      evidence of more than 50% stenosis in one or more major coronary arteries; (3) previous
      history of PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) or CABG (coronary artery bypass graft).
      The controls were selected from the two medical centers meeting the following criteria: (1)
      with no family history for CAD; (2) no clinical symptoms for CAD; (3) resting ECG showed
      normal results. The subjects with two or more risk factors of CAD (age&gt;45 for man and &gt;55 for
      woman, hypertension, diabetes, overweight, hyperlipidemia) were subjected to treadmill stress
      test and selected as controls if their ECG were normal without clinical symptoms. Those with
      history of cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, severe
      hepatic and kidney deficiency were excluded in our study.

      Venous blood was collected by standard vein puncture in fasting condition. Four
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7586970, rs6434222, rs10153820 and rs8176528) were
      detected with polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing method. And the genotypes of these
      SNPs were determined in both CAD patients and non-CAD controls.

        The participants with two or more risk factors of CAD (age&gt;45 for man and &gt;55 for woman,
        hypertension, diabetes, overweight, hyperlipidemia) were subjected to treadmill stress test
        and selected as controls if their ECG were normal without clinical symptoms.
