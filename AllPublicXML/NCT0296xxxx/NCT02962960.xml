  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to characterize pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and
      tolerability of anifrolumab given via the subcutaneous (SC) route of administration in adult
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) subjects with a type I Interferon (IFN) test high result
      and active skin manifestations while receiving Standard of Care (SOC) treatment. In addition,
      the efficacy of anifrolumab on SLE skin manifestations will be characterized.
