  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two cohort Phase I study within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium
      (PNOC).

      This study will assess the safety of repeated administration of the H3.3K27M specific vaccine
      in HLA-A2+ children and young adults with H3.3K27M DIPGs and other gliomas.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are eligible will receive a specific peptide vaccine, along with a helper drug
      called poly-ICLC, every 3 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment. Subjects will be
      monitored routinely by laboratory assessments, physical evaluation, vital signs, and MRI.
      Subjects who tolerate therapy well and have stable or improved disease after 6 months of
      treatment can continue to receive treatment, now every 6 weeks, for a total of 96 weeks of
      treatment.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the vaccine will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events (AEs), scheduled laboratory assessments, vital signs, &amp; physical examinations for subjects who receive the vaccination. The severity of toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. AEs &amp; clinically significant lab abnormalities (meeting Grade 3, 4, or 5 criteria according to CTCAE) will be summarized by maximum intensity &amp; relationship to study drug(s). Grade 1 &amp; 2 AEs will be summarized if related to study therapy. Descriptive statistics will be utilized to display the data on toxicity seen.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS) at 12 months (OS12)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS12 will be the clinical efficacy primary endpoint. Any eligible subject that receives at least one dose of the K27M/TT vaccine will be considered evaluable for clinical efficacy. For subjects who are still alive at 12 months, OS12 will be censored at the last contact date. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Induction of the H3.3K27M epitope-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in post vaccine peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) in HLA-A2+ children with DIPG and other gliomas</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>A subject will be considered to have responded, if at any of post-vaccine time point against H3.3K27M antigen, the number of spots is double that at baseline, and there are at least 10 spots/20,000 cells, and if the number of the post-vaccine spots is at least three times the standard-deviation of the pre-vaccine value. This definition provides some protection against false positive response. We will correlate response with OS data. We will plot the time course of the magnitude of response and model it using a mixed-effects model approach.</description>

    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>In subjects with evidence of progression that will undergo tissue collection as part of their standard of care, the tumor tissue will be analyzed for H3.3K27M expression status and infiltration of H3.3K27M specific T cells.</description>
