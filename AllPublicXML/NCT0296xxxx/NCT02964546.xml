  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation in the elderly is a complex condition due to the high number of
      frequently associated comorbidities such kidney disease. Direct oral anticoagulants
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) are indicated for preventing thromboembolic events but
      renal function should be closely monitored for this age group when these drugs are used.
      Dosing recommendations for prevention of stroke are based on renal clearance of creatinine
      (ClCr) estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. It is well known that ClCr estimates
      predict a steeper decline with advancing age than Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) estimates.
      This raises the possibility that substitution of commonly reported GFR for estimated CrCl
      could result in different plasmatic concentrations of oral direct anticoagulants. The aim of
      this study was to compare estimates of ClCr and GFR and determine the impact on the plasmatic
      concentration of these drugs in elderly patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
