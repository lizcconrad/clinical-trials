    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a condition characterized by a sustained elevation in
      pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) above 25 mmHg assessed by right heart catheterization. PH is
      fatal in absence of adequate treatment or therapy, as the condition progressively increases
      the workload of the right heart and ultimately leads to its failure. With a minimal
      indicative prevalence of 1 case/300, PH affects at least 25'000 people in Switzerland alone.
      After initiation of PH therapy, the follow-up of the patient's health status is often limited
      to punctual PAP measurements at the clinic at intervals of several months. The lack of more
      frequent measurements of the patient's PAP strongly hinders the identification of short-term
      trends in pulmonary hemodynamics, and therefore the anticipation of worsening conditions or
      treatment inefficiency. As possible solutions, wireless implantable hemodynamic monitors such
      as the CardioMEMSTM HF System (CardioMEMS Inc., Atlanta, USA) have recently been introduced
      for the continuous monitoring of PAP in patients with PH. The benefits of frequent
      measurements over intermittent clinic visits have been demonstrated in several previous
      studies, notably in terms of prediction of therapy outcomes, anticipation of worsening heart
      failure, feedback rapidity during therapy, or decline in hospitalization rates. Nevertheless,
      despite the undeniable advantages that implantable monitors offer to the patient, they remain
      highly invasive solutions. In contrast, noninvasive alternatives for the measurement of PAP
      exist, such as transthoracic echocardiography, but are impractical for frequent PAP
      assessments due to their dependency on qualified personnel to perform the measurement. An
      optimal PAP monitoring modality for patients with PH should be non-invasive (free of any
      risks or complications associated with cardiac catheterization) and unsupervised (able to
      operate without supervision of a medical doctor). Such a modality does not currently exist.
      In the present study, the investigators propose and investigate the potential of a novel
      non-invasive, continuous and unsupervised PAP monitoring approach based on the pulse wave
      velocity (PWV) principle and the use of electrical impedance tomography (EIT).

    <description>Assessment of significant subject-wise correlation coefficients between the reference PAP, obtained by the gold Standard transthoracic echocardiography technique, and an EIT-derived PAP-related parameter. The primary outcome is therefore the demonstration of the feasibility of monitoring changes in PAP (intra-subject trending ability) by EIT.</description>
