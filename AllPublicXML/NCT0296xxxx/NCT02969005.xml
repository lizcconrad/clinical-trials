  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Localization of small femur lesions for resection can be challenging and may be associated
      with the need for significant fluoroscopic imaging and tissue dissection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to evaluate the use of a radiopaque localizer grid along with
      methylene blue staining for resection of small femur lesions in children, and to determine
      this technique's effectiveness at reducing radiation exposure and tissue injury.
