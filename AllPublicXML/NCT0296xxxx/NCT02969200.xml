  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate renal function decline by measured glomerular
      filtration rate (mGFR) in patients with FD during enzyme replacement therapy, and to explore
      the influence of age on renal function in FD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nephropathy is common in Fabry disease (FD). Renal function decline is often the first sign
      of major organ involvement, sometimes progressing to end-stage renal failure. Available
      studies of renal function during enzyme replacement therapy have shown inconsistent results,
      and are based on different composition of patient materials and follow-up time.

      Most investigations have used estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for evaluating
      renal function. GFR is an important indicator of renal function. eGFR based on a serum
      creatinine measurement is most commonly used in FD. However, this method has been shown to be
      unreliable, as serum creatinine levels are influenced by other factors than renal function
      such as ethnic group, muscle mass, age, hydration and diet. Performance of eGFR in detecting
      minor changes in renal function is poor. A 10 year old review on renal function evaluation in
      patients with FD recommended the use of GFR based on an exogenous marker, e.g. Cr-EDTA.
      Nevertheless, only few studies have used mGFR for evaluation of renal function and to our
      knowledge, the present study is the first to describe the rate of renal function decline with
      consecutive mGFR values in a nationwide population of patients with FD.

      Renal function declines with age in renal healthy individuals. To our knowledge, the present
      study is the first to age-standardize renal function in patients with FD to adjust for
      age-dependent renal deterioration.

    <description>GFR was measured at least once a year by the one sample 51Cr-ethylenendiaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) clearance technique using two (for duplicate determination) plasma samples 200 min after the injection of 4 (3.8-4.2) MBq 51Cr-EDTA. In children (&lt; 15y) the injected 51Cr-activity was 3 MBq, and the blood-samples were collected 120 min after radiotracer injection. (&lt; 5y: 2 MBq).</description>

    <description>Repeated twenty-four hour urine samples were collected by patients at home, the last 24 hours before coming to the hospital. These samples were analysed for albumin, creatinine and protein. Furthermore spot urine samples were applied and analysed for albumin, creatinine and protein. Albumin-creatinine-ratio was calculated and abnormal values were defined as &gt; 30 mg/g. Urine protein- and albumin values below detection limit (&lt; 0.04 g/L and &lt; 3 mg/L, respectively) were converted to zero for statistical analyses.</description>
