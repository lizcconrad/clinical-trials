    <textblock>
      Cervical insufficiency, previously referred to as cervical incompetence, has classically been
      defined as painless dilation of the cervix in the absence of contractions or bleeding in the
      second trimester resulting in recurrent pregnancy losses. Painless mid-trimester cervical
      dilation is an uncommon finding in the general population occurring in less than 1% of
      pregnancies. Cerclage for the prevention pregnancy loss in cases with both prior preterm
      births and/or second trimester losses, as well as second trimester cervical dilatation in the
      index pregnancy, was first reported in the 1950's. Cerclage placement in this setting has
      been variably referred to as &quot;physical exam-indicated cerclage&quot;, &quot;rescue cerclage&quot;, and
      &quot;emergency cerclage&quot;. To date, the benefits of cerclage for this indication are not entirely
      clear.

      A recent meta-analysis showed that physical exam-indicated cerclage is associated with a
      reduction in perinatal mortality and prolongation of pregnancy when compared to no such
      cerclage.

      Recently, several RCTs have shown that cervical pessary could decrease the incidence of PTB
      in several populations.

      Thus, the aim of our trial as noninferiority trial is to evaluate the efficacy of pessary
      compared to cervical cerclage in prevention of PTB in women in the setting of mid-trimester
      cervical dilation
