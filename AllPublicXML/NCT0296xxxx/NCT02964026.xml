  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this retrospective Electronic Health Record (EHR) analysis is to
      evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with the utilization of a pulmonary artery catheter
      (PAC), for monitoring purposes, within patients undergoing cardiac surgeries (isolated
      coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], valve, aortic surgery, multi-procedures, other complex
      nonvalvular procedures and heart transplants). The study will be conducted using
      prospectively collected hospital inpatient data over a duration of over 5 years (Jan. 1, 2010
      - June 30, 2015) using a large US electronic health database (Cerner HealthFacts; Kansas
      City, MO).

      A retrospective study will be conducted using prospectively collected hospital inpatient data
      over a duration of over 5 years (Jan. 1, 2010 - June 30, 2015) using a large US electronic
      health database (Cerner HealthFacts; Kansas City, MO). Patients who underwent a qualifying
      cardiac surgery (verified through use of selected valid International Classification of
      Diseases-9 procedure codes and/or Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes) will be
      included. Each patient's cohort designation will be defined based upon whether he/she did or
      did not receive a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) for monitoring purposes. Propensity scores,
      which take into account patient and hospital demographics, patient comorbidities, surgical
      type (isolated coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], valve, aortic surgery, multi-procedures,
      other complex nonvalvular procedures and heart transplants), and pre-operative condition (via
      an adapted EuroSCORE II) will be utilized to &quot;match&quot; patients who received a PAC for
      monitoring purposes with those who did not, to form a matched study cohort. Clinical outcomes
      will be monitored through index visit discharge and up to 90 days post index visit discharge.

        Adult patients undergoing an isolated CABG, isolated valve, aortic procedure, complex
        nonvalvular procedures, multi-procedures or a heart transplant who receives or does not
        receive a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) for monitoring purposes

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient undergoes a qualifying cardiac surgery between Jan 1, 2010 and January 1,
             2015. If multiple qualifying surgeries are present, the first in database will be
             utilized

          -  Inpatient with a LOS of at least 48 hours

          -  Treated arm receives a PAC for monitoring purposes within admission date and
             qualifying cardiac surgical day plus one via specified ICD-9 or CPT-4 codes, or EHR
             recorded PAC readings

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac surgery patients with age &lt;18 years on index procedure date

          -  Non-treated arm derived from an institution which does not have database documented
             use of ICD-9 or CPT-4 PAC placement codes for monitoring purposes [Lessens the
             likelihood that the untreated arm is indeed treated by ensuring that the patient would
             likely be coded if he/she had a PAC in place for monitoring purposes]

          -  Patient record must have the demographics populated of age, gender, and race. ICD-9
             diagnosis and procedure codes must be present in record for index visit, as well as
             medications administered over index visit

          -  Patient must be treated at a hospital which performs a minimum of 100 qualifying
             cardiac procedures per year
