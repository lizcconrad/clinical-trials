  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examined feasibility and acceptability of a non-restrictive diet focused on
      increasing dietary fiber and lean protein for weight loss. Fifteen obese adults enrolled in a
      12-week assessment which included 6 bi-weekly individual dietary counseling sessions to
      attain a daily goal of higher fiber (&gt;35 g/day) and lean protein (0.8 g per kilogram/day of
      individual's ideal body weight).

      Participants were instructed to increase both their dietary fiber intake to 35 g/day and
      protein intake to 0.8 g per kilogram/day of their ideal body weight. Loss of 5% of their body
      weight are considered to achieve the weight-loss goal. The intervention included 6 bi-weekly,
      30-minute individual dietary counseling sessions over 12-weeks. Behavioral strategies
      including self-monitoring, problem solving, goal setting, stimulus control, food
      substitution, and relapse prevention were taught to assist participants in meeting their
      fiber and protein goals.
