      A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an experimental drug (SEP-363856) in acutely
      psychotic adults with schizophrenia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, flexibly-dosed, study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of SEP-363856 in acutely psychotic adult subjects with
      schizophrenia using SEP-363856 (50 or 75 mg/day [ie, once daily]) versus placebo over a
      4-week treatment period. Primary hypoathesis to be tested: H0: μSEP = μPBO versus H1: μSEP ≠
      μPBO, where μSEP and μPBO are the mean changes from Baseline at Week 4 in PANSS total score
      for the SEP-363856 and placebo arms, respectively. Subjects who complete study SEP361-201 may
      be eligible to enroll in the open-label extension study SEP361-202.

             Subjects who have been hospitalized for more than 2 weeks for reasons unrelated to an
             acute psychotic exacerbation may be included if such a hospitalization was for a
             condition other than an acute psychotic relapse. For example, subjects in a long-term

               1. Adequate contraception is defined as continuous use of either two barrier methods
                  (eg, condom and spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) or a hormonal
                  contraceptive.

                  Acceptable hormonal contraceptives include the following: a) contraceptive
                  implant (such as Norplant®) implanted at least 90 days prior to screening; b)
                  injectable contraception (such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injection) given at

                  remain abstinent or use adequate contraception.

         11. Female subject of reproductive potential agrees to remain abstinent or use highly
             effective and reliable contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days
             after the last dose of study drug has been taken (See Section 21 Appendix II Highly
             Effective Protocol SEP361-201, Version 3.01 SEP-363856 Confidential and Proprietary 36
             17 August 2017 Contraceptive procedures). In the Investigator's judgment, the subject

         16. Subject has had a stable living arrangement at the time of screening and agrees to
             return to a similar living arrangement after discharge. This criterion is not meant to
             exclude subjects who have temporarily left a stable living arrangement (eg, due to
             psychosis). Such subjects remain eligible to participate in this protocol. Chronically
             homeless subjects should not be enrolled.

             not been a focus of primary treatment.

             8. Subject tests positive for drugs of abuse at screening, however, a positive test
             for amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines may not result in exclusion
             of subjects if the investigator determines that the positive test is as a result of
             prescription medicine(s). In the event a subject tests positive for cannabinoids
             (tetrahydrocannabinol), the Investigator will evaluate the subject's ability to

             adequate dose for at least 4 weeks within a 1 year period prior to Screening.

             14. Subject has a history of treatment with clozapine for refractory psychosis and/or
             subject has been treated with clozapine (for any reason) within 4 months of Screening.

             serum chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel, coagulation panel, thyroid panel, and serum
             prolactin (Note: abnormal findings that may be clinically significant or of
             questionable significance will be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to
             including subject).

             20. Subject demonstrates evidence of acute hepatitis, clinically significant chronic
             hepatitis, or evidence of clinically significant impaired hepatic function through
