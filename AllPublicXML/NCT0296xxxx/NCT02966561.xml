    <textblock>
      The STAR-study (STay Active after Rehabilitation) investigates in a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) the additional effect of a pedometer-based behavior change intervention (BCI)
      during in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on objectively measured physical activity
      (PA) 6-weeks and 6-months post PR. The BCI uses the behaviour change techniques a)
      instruction on how, where and when to perform the behavior, b) prompt goal setting for
      physical activity, c) prompt self-monitoring of behavior and d) feedback on behavior. The
      primary outcome of PA will be measured using an accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X) for a time
      period of seven days, firstly two weeks before rehabilitation begins (T0 = study phase I) as
      well as six weeks and six months (T3 and T4) after PR. Additionally to predict PA progression
      after PR, a complex personal diagnostic, including questionnaires as well as functional
      assessments, is to be carried out at the start (T1 = start of study phase II) and end of PR
      (T2). This diagnostic is based on the main ideas of the PA-related health competence model
      (PARC-model) and especially incorporates physical and psychological personal determinants of
      PA.

    <description>Standard care is an in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in a specialized German Rehabilitation Clinic. PR is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary intervention based on a patient assessment followed by a combination of patient-tailored therapies. PR lasts on average 25 days. PR includes the following obligatory main components: Checking and, if required, adjusting the current COPD medication according to current COPD-guidelines; physical training (4-5 units/week endurance training [45 min] and 3 units/week of strength training [45 min] per week, 7 units/week whole body vibration muscle training/week); structured COPD-patient education (6 hours patient education COPD + 1 hour device training); respiratory physiotherapy in groups [2-4 units/week with 45 min]. PR is implemented by an interdisciplinary rehabilitation team.</description>
