  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis is the most common and feared complication of ERCP, occurring after 1% to
      30% of procedures. Since 2012, a multicenter RCT was published in NEJM, indomethacin use in
      high risk patients was considered a &quot;standard&quot; method to prevent PEP. The mechanism of
      indomethacin is dependent on COX-2 inhibitor.

      According to data, we design the project. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      COX-2 inhibitor is effective on control of Post-ERCP pancreatitis.

      This prospective, randomised controlled trial was done in 8 tertiary referral hospitals in
      China. Patients (aged 18-90 years) with native papilla planned for diagnostic or therapeutic
      ERCP were eligible for enrolment in the study. Exclusion criteria included contraindications
      to ERCP, known pancreatic head mass, previous biliary sphincterotomy without planned contrast
      injection into the pancreatic duct, acute pancreatitis within 3 days, ERCP for biliary stent
      removal or exchange without anticipated pancreatogram, known active cardiovascular or
      cerebrovascular disease, unwilling or inability to provide consent, and pregnant or
      breastfeeding women. Indications or contra- indications for ERCP were determined by
      endoscopists or anaesthesiologists before ERCP; these included risks to patient health or
      life judged to outweigh the potential benefit of ERCP, known or suspected perforated viscus,
      and haemodynamic instability. The risk stratification of the patients was defined based on
      criteria used in the study by Elmunzer and colleages. Patients were considered high risk for
      post-ERCP pancreatitis if they met at least one of the major criteria or two or more of the
      minor criteria. The risk status of the patients was determined immediately after the
      procedure by one investigator at each site who was masked to group allocation.

      Randomisation and masking The study coordinator did the block randomization (ten in each
      block). The randomization list was computer generated, and stratified according to individual
      centers. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio, before receiving ERCP, to either the
      universal pre- procedural group or the risk-stratified post-procedural group. Cox-2 inhibitor
      or Indometacin was administered in the procedure room before or after ERCP by one
      investigator in each site who did not participate in data collection and analysis.
      Endoscopists and assistances who participated in ERCP procedures were masked to group
      allocation. Investigators who collected demographic or procedure-related data or participated
      in the assessment of post-ERCP compli- cations were also masked to group allocation. Patients
      were not masked to treatment allocation.

      Before the start of this study, post-procedural selective indometacin in high-risk patients
      had been demonstrated as effective in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

      Outcomes The primary outcome of the study was the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The
      diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis was established if there was new onset of upper abdominal
      pain associated with an elevated serum amylase of at least three times the upper limit of
      normal range at 24 h after the procedure, and admission to hospital for at least 2 nights.
      The secondary outcome was the frequency of moderate to severe post-ERCP pancreatitis. We
      defined severity of pancreatitis according to the criteria reported by Cotton and colleagues.

      Other post-ERCP complications (including bleeding, biliary infection, perforation, and any
      adverse outcomes requiring hospital admission or prolonged hospital stay for further
      management) were monitored as described previously.24 Moderate to severe bleeding was defined
      as clinically significant bleeding with decrease in haemoglobin concentration of at least 3
      g/L with the need for transfusion, angiographic intervention, or surgery. 23 Patients were
      contacted at 30 days to assess late complications (including delayed bleeding or
      cardiovascular or renal adverse events); this was the final follow-up.

      An investigator who was familiar with ERCP at each site and masked to treatment allocation
      recorded the procedure-related parameters including cannulation methods, numbers of
      cannulation attempts, and inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation, pancrea- tography, and
      prophylactic placement of pancreatic duct stent. The same investigator also recorded the
      patient demographics, post-ERCP adverse events potentially caused by the procedure or study
      drug, and follow-up data. All data were subsequently entered into a web- based database and
      managed by independent investigators.

      We defined severity of post-ERCP complications according to the Cotton criteria:23 mild
      (pancreatitis after the procedure requiring admission or prolongation of planned admission to
      2-3 days); moderate (pancreatitis after the procedure requiring hospitalisation of 4-10
      days); and severe (pancreatitis after the procedure requiring hospitalisation for more than
      10 days, or haemorrhagic pancreatitis, phlegmon or pseudocyst, or intervention). Detailed
      definitions for other adverse events are provided in the appendix.
