  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of national economy and medical technology, patients can extend life
      rely on high-end medical facilities. At the same time, the continued treatment cannot bring
      benefits to children, even resulting in poor quality of life of children and bringing high
      medical costs. This makes the limited medical resources are unreasonable distributed.
      Research showed that PICU mortality rate halved over ten years ago, but the data did not
      include death cases who left hospital before death. However, the death number of out-hospital
      were more than death in-hospital. Therefore, the data cannot actually reflect China's
      mortality rate of PICU. The reason analysis was limited to the cause of the disease, and does
      not take the social, economic factors into account. This study include eight PICUs of
      children's Hospital PICU. Critically ill patients are prospectively studied from death risk
      factors, admission status, disease diagnosis, severity of illness, analyzing of the risk
      factors of death from disease diagnosis and death risk factors. In addition, we will
      illuminate the relationship of death and economic factor, especially for who died
      out-hospital after withdraw or stop treatment.
