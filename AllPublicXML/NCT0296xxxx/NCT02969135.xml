  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder disorders are extremely common, with a life-time prevalence in population of 30%.
      About 23% of the working population with shoulder problems are sick-listed. Specifically
      rotator cuff tears are considered some of the principal causes of chronic shoulder pain and
      disability, especially with advancing age. The National Patient Register in Denmark has
      registered 730 rotator cuff repairs in 2006 and 990 in 2012, which represents a 35% increase.

      A rotator cuff tear is defined as a rupture of the tendon (s) of the shoulder, and most
      frequently involves the supraspinatus and/or the infraspinatus tendon, resulting in loss of
      function due to pain and tissue weakness. Little is known about the effects of the
      postoperative training/rehabilitation, and this provides an unclear picture of the total
      treatment procedure of this condition.

      The Danish National Clinical Guidelines from 2013 recommend that these patients are offered
      rehabilitation and that the shoulder is immobilized post-surgery, but the evidence for
      postoperative training is moderate- low. The past few years, there have been conducted 5
      systematic reviews looking at different rehabilitation parameters after rotator cuff surgery.
      They conclude that early Range-Of-Motion exercise accelerate healing, reduce stiffness, do
      not increase risk of re-rupture and that immobilization do not increase tendon healing or
      clinical outcome. They also conclude that there is a further need to evaluate approaches that
      foster early initiation of rehabilitation and gradual introduction of functional load in
      high-quality, adequately powered trials, also considering key outcomes such as return to
      work.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of a progressive early passive and
      active movement protocol with a care as usual (limited early passive movement protocol) on
      tendon healing, physical function, pain, and quality of life, in patients operated due to
      traumatic full thickness rotator cuff tear in a Randomized Controlled Trial.

      Shortterm effects of physical function, pain, and quality of life will be studied as primary
      patient reported outcome, while secondary outcomes will be clinical and paraclinical outcomes
      in addition to the longterm effects of physical function, pain, and quality of life.
