  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) and wound complications are common occurrences following
      colorectal resection surgery. Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (iNPWT) has
      developing evidence for improving wound complication rates in certain populations. However,
      there have been no RCTs to date that have looked at iNPWT use after colorectal surgery. We
      propose a study in which patients are randomized into one of two treatment arms: 1)
      incisional NPWT, and 2) standard sterile gauze dressings. Patients will be followed for 30
      days for diagnosis of infection or wound complication. We will compare primary outcomes in
      each group using Chi-Squared statistical testing in order to report a Absolute Risk Reduction
      and Number Needed to Treat

      Purpose: To evaluate if incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (iNPWT) confers a lower
      rate of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) or wound complication compared to standard treatment of
      elective colorectal resection laparotomies.

      Justification: Colorectal resection with bowel anastomosis is a clean-contaminated procedure
      known to have increased rates wound complication. Techniques like the use of incisional wound
      barriers, antimicrobial eluding dressings or iodine washout have been assessed in an attempt
      to reduce occurrence. However, evidence for their efficacy is not compelling for surgeons to
      universally adapt. Meanwhile, negative pressure wound therapy has demonstrated impressive
      efficacy in the management of complex and non-healing wounds. And recently, NPWT has become
      an area of interest in managing, not only open wounds, but closed wounds as well. The benefit
      of this therapy is yet to be clearly defined in the elective colorectal resection patient
      population, however.

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in SSI or wound complication rate in standard and
      iNPWT groups.

      Design: Single-institution, prospective, randomized, open-label, superiority trial

      Statistical Analysis: Assuming a complication rate of 20-30% and a relative risk reduction of
      50%, we will recruit 400 patients (200 in each group) to achieve a power of 80% and type 1
      error of 0.05. Primary endpoints will be: Wound Complication - defined as presence of seroma,
      hematoma, dehiscence, SSI - and SSI reported independently. Secondary endpoints will include:
      Length of Stay, ER visits related to SSI, Complications (according to Clavien-Dindo
      classification), need for and duration of home care related to wound care, and wound VAC
      specific complications (local reaction to adhesive dressing, blisters, failure of vacuum,
      need for early removal). Primary endpoints will be assessed according to intention-to-treat
      principle using Pearson's chi-squared test. In the event that baseline characteristics are
      significantly different, a secondary analysis using multivariable logistic regression will
      adjust for the effect of the difference. A p value of &lt; 0.05 will be used to determine
      significance. Results will be presented as an absolute risk reduction as well as number
      needed to treat to prevent one wound complication. Secondary outcomes will be compared using
      a Mann-Whitney U-test for non-normally distributed continuous variables and chi-squared for
      categorical data.

    <description>Patients in the iNPWT group will have their incision covered by a single layer of Mepitel wound contact layer followed by application of a KCI V.A.C Simplace ™ Dressing composed of a strip of black foam covering the entire length of the incision followed by coverage of the incision, Mepitel, and foam with an occlusive Tegederm ™ dressing to establish an airtight seal. Negative pressure will then be applied using a SensaT.R.A.C. Pad ™ to a setting of 100 mmHg continuous suction. Dressings shall remain in place and will be removed by the surgical team on the morning of the third post-operative day and left open to air thereafter. Any loss of seal of the dressing shall be reinforced using occlusive dressings.</description>

    <description>Patients in the conventional dressings group will receive a standard Mepore ™ dressing applied to cover the entire incision. This will be left in place and and removed by the surgical team on the morning of the second postoperative day and will be left open to air thereafter. Dressings may be either reinforced or changed at the discretion of the surgical team due to drainage or saturation during the first two postoperative days.</description>

    <intervention_name>Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (iNPWT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy devices are lightweight, self contained, portable battery powered (or line powered), suction pumps for medical procedures where secretions and other body fluids and infectious materials must be removed through the application of continuous or intermittent negative pressure. The pumps are operated through computer software, having help and alarm features. The device is indicted for management of chronic, acute, traumatic, subacute and dehisced wounds, partial-thickness burns, ulcers (such as diabetic or pressure), flaps and grafts. The pumps may be used at patient's bedside. These are suitable for use in either hospitals or long term care facilities and nursing homes. These devices will be applied to closed laparotomy incisions with the aim to provide three days of continuous negative pressure of - 100mmHg.</description>

    <description>In most cases, self-adhesive, absorbent dressings will be used for standard wound therapy. However, surgical teams may decide on alternative forms of sterile gauze dressings, as long as the wound site is kept clean and dry. Dressings should be taken down on the second post-operative day.</description>
