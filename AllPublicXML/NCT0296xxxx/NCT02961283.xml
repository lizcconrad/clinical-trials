    <textblock>
      The study is divided into two parts. The first part of the study will test various doses of
      ASN003 to find out the highest safe dose to test in three specific groups.

      The second part of the study will test how well ASN003 can control cancer. Subjects will be
      enrolled into one of three groups.

      Group 1: metastatic or recurrent melanoma with documented BRAFV600 mutation (n=20 evaluable
      patients) Group 2: metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), or advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) with documented BRAFV600 mutation (n=14 evaluable patients) Group 3: advanced solid
      tumors with documented PI3K pathway alterations (PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss) (n=14
      evaluable patients)

      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A is a dose escalation study to determine a
      safe and tolerable dose of ASN003 for subjects with advanced solid tumors. Part A will also
      characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASN003 through blood sampling and
      optional biopsies.. Part B will only enroll subjects in three groups:

      Group 1: subjects who have metastatic or recurrent melanoma with the BRAFv600 mutation.

      Group 2: subjects who have advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, or colorectal
      cancer with the BRAFv600 mutation.

      Group 3: subjects who have advanced or metastatic cancers with phosphatidylinositide
      3-kinases (PI3K) mutations, or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss mutation. Subjects
      will be treated with the highest safe and tolerable dose determined in Part A of the study to
      determine preliminary efficacy. Subjects may continue to receive ASN003 for up to 1 year in
      the absence of severe side effects or disease progression.
