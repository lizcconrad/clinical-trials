    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving a modified stem cell
      transplant is less likely to cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to patients with certain
      types of blood disorders or blood cancers make patients less likely to develop GVHD. You will
      also receive melphalan and fludarabine as part of your regular chemotherapy and total body
      irradiation (TBI) regimen.

      Before you receive the stem cell transplant, it will be &quot;modified&quot; to remove certain types of
      T cells that cause GVHD.

      GVHD occurs when transplanted immune tissue, such as T cells and stem cells, attacks the
      tissues of the recipient's body.

      Central Venous Catheter:

      The chemotherapy and some of the other drugs in this study will be given by vein through your
      central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube and needle that will be
      placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Blood samples will also be
      drawn through your CVC. The CVC will remain in your body during treatment. Your doctor will
      explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate
      consent form.

      Chemotherapy and Stem Cell infusion:

      You will receive 1 of 2 chemotherapy treatments (high-dose regimen or reduced-intensity
      regimen) that will be chosen by your doctor. The treatment will be selected based on your age
      and health. The high-dose regimen includes a higher dose of melphalan than the
      reduced-intensity regimen. The doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are the same.

      Study Drug Administration:

      On Day -7 (7 days before receiving the modified stem cell transplant), you will be admitted
      to the hospital and given fluids by vein.

      On Day -6, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes and fludarabine by vein over 1
      hour. Fludarabine and melphalan are given to treat the cancer and lower the immune system in
      order to lower the risk of rejecting the donor cells.

      On Days -5 through -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour.

      On Day -2, you will receive total body irradiation (TBI). TBI involves the delivery of high
      doses of radiation designed to destroy cancer cells and/or lower the immune system in order
      to lower the risk of the body rejecting the new stem cells.

      On Day -1, you will &quot;rest&quot; (not receive chemotherapy).

      On Day 0, you will receive the modified stem cell transplant by vein. The infusion will last
      anywhere from about 30 minutes to several hours.

      On Days +3 and +4, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. Cyclophosphamide
      is given to lower the immune system in order to lower the risk of GVHD. You will also receive
      mesna by vein over 30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3 and +4.
      Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide.

      Starting on Day +5, if you are one of the first 6 patients enrolled in the study, you will
      receive tacrolimus to help lower the risk of GVHD. Tacrolimus will be given by vein as a
      continuous infusion for about 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks of taking tacrolimus by vein, you
      will take tacrolimus by mouth as a pill for at least 4 months.

      Starting on Day +7, you will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day,
      until your blood cell levels are high enough. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth
      of a type of healthy white blood cells that fight infection.

      Depending on the type of disease, your doctor may decide to give you rituximab by vein over
      several hours on Days -13, -6, 1, and 8. Rituximab is given to help the body get rid of
      abnormal white blood cells.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Testing:

      Before you are sent home from the hospital and/or clinic, you will receive additional written
      instructions. These instructions will include how often you will come to the hospital/clinic,
      which standard drugs you will take at home, and what side effects you may have and what to do
      for them.

      After finishing the chemotherapy and cell infusion, your follow-up care will be routine
      standard of care follow-up that all patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      receive. At each visit, you will have a physical exam and will be checked for symptoms of
      GVHD. You will be asked about any side effects you may have had. Blood (about 1 tablespoon)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      Mouse protein antibodies are used in the T cell removal process. If your body becomes immune
      to these proteins, you may develop antibodies against the mouse antibodies (called &quot;human
      anti-mouse antibodies&quot; or HAMA). Blood samples drawn before the modified stem cell transplant
      and about 3 months after the modified stem cell transplant will be used to compare against a
      sample of your blood collected after the transplant is complete, to make sure you have not
      developed an immune system reaction against these mouse protein antibodies. If you leave the
      study before 3 months after the stem cell transplant, blood will be drawn to check for HAMA,
      if possible.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status
      of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed
      with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.

      Blood (up to about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to test the genetic makeup and function of
      the modified stem cells and to check the status of the disease about 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months after the modified stem cell transplant.

      Length of Treatment:

      You will be on study for up to about 2 years. You may be taken off study early if the doctor
      thinks it is in your best interest, if the disease gets worse or comes back and needs more
      treatment, if intolerable side effects occur, if you are unable to follow study directions,
      or if you choose to leave the study early.

      If for any reason you want to leave the study early, you must talk to the study doctor. It
      may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have started to receive the study drugs
      but before you receive the stem cell transplant because your blood cell counts will be
      dangerously low.

      This is an investigational study. The study drugs are FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of blood cancers and/or stem cell transplant. The way the researchers
      remove the T cells and the infusion of the modified stem cell transplant is investigational
      and is not FDA approved.

      Up to 12 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
