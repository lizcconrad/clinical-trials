    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose of High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy
      chosen for this study as well as a commonly used alternate form of brachytherapy called low
      dose rate (or seed) brachytherapy. Investigators would like to understand how these
      treatments control the prostate cancer and look at their short and long term treatment
      related side effects.

      Radiation therapy is an accepted treatment to help manage low and intermediate risk prostate
      cancer. Radiation therapy can be given using machines that are outside the body (called
      &quot;image guided external beam radiation therapy&quot;) or by brachytherapy, which is a form of
      radiation therapy where the radiation source is placed directly into the prostate gland near
      the tumour. The standard or usual treatments for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer are
      low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy which involves placing radioactive seeds in the prostate
      which deliver radiation over several months, image guided external beam radiation therapy
      (IGRT), or IGRT plus high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost.

      High Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy is another type of brachytherapy which delivers a high
      dose of radiation to the tumour over a period of minutes. The radiation is delivered under
      computer control through flexible needles, which are temporarily inserted into the prostate.
      This form of radiotherapy targets cancer cells within the prostate gland. HDR brachytherapy
      is another type of radiotherapy for prostate cancer that has the potential to help target
      your cancer more accurately while causing fewer side effects compared with standard radiation
      therapy. HDR brachytherapy is an option for treatment in some hospitals now but the best dose
      of radiation is still unknown. This study is testing a new dose of radiation for HDR
      brachytherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate diagnosed within the last 9
             months. Patients on active surveillance with evidence of disease progression are
