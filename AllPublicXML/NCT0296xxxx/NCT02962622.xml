    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the association between soluble insulin receptor dysfunction,
      cardiorespiratory fitness, and HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Those who
      volunteer to participate in the study will have two evaluations at study entry that include a
      dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry, anthropometry, neurocognitive testing, blood
      and urine samples for metabolic testing, and a cardiorespiratory fitness testing. DEXA will
      be conducted in the Endocrinology Unit at the University Hospital, Medical Center (letter of
      support included). The cardiorespiratory fitness testing will be conducted in the AIDS
      Clinical Trials Unit (ACTU) project, University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, and
      the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium. Then, participants will be
      invited to participate in a 6-week, 3 days/week individualized exercise program. The exercise
      program will be conducted at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. After
      completion of the exercise program, study entry evaluations will be repeated. The duration of
      the study will take approximately 10 weeks.

      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of a low volume high intensity interval
      training (HIIT) exercise intervention on cardio-respiratory fitness (CR-fitness), insulin
      resistance, and cognitive function among normally active but physically untrained HIV+
      Hispanic women. The primary hypotheses are that HIIT will improve: 1) CR-fitness in all
      groups (HIV+ and HIV-), 2) insulin sensitivity in both groups of HIV+ women, and 3) cognitive
      function as determined by hippocampal function in HIV+ women with HAND. Participants will
      receive 2 weeks, 6 sessions of 8 x 60 seconds cycling bouts eliciting approximately 80% of
      maximal heart rate with 60 second rest between bouts after which they will receive 4 week, 12
      sessions of 10 x 60 seconds cycling bouts eliciting approximately 90% of maximal heart rate
      with 60 second rest between bouts. Then, participants will be evaluated with a CR-fitness,
      insulin resistance, anthropometry, and neurocognitive function tests.

      Participants will undergo an intervention (described above) designed for normally active but
      physically untrained HIV+ Hispanic women, one with (n=15) and other without (n=15)
      neurocognitive impairment &amp; HIV- controls (n=15). After the HIIT intervention, measurements
      of CR-fitness, insulin resistance, and cognitive function including hippocampal function
      using the memory island test will be obtained, as well as CR-fitness, anthropometry, DEXA
      densitometry, and blood and urine samples for metabolic testing. The ultimate goal is to
      improve the understanding of mechanisms by which exercise influence neurocognitive function;
      thus, providing a potential non-pharmacological alternative to prevent, control or reduce
      chronic incapacitating diseases in HIV+ Hispanic adults.

             below.

          3. Non-drug abusers; defined as those with &lt;5 exposures in a lifetime to drugs
             (opiates/heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine/crack, speed ball). For the purpose of this
             study neither tobacco nor nicotine use will be considered a drug.

             head trauma (&lt;6 months with loss of consciousness for &gt;1 hr); cerebral palsy; or any
             other neuropsychiatric condition that in the judgment of the investigators may affect
             the study.

          5. Active systemic infection or illness, which in the judgment of the investigators may

             levels (Seltzer 1975).

          8. Patients who are unwilling to give informed consent or incapable of understanding
             informed consent.

          9. Education less than 9th grade.
