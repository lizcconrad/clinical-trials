  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has a relatively high prevalence in adolescents.
      Exercise is the most common conservative therapy for mild AIS patients. There are increasing
      evidences suggesting that physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE) can halt the
      curve progression. Nevertheless, the evidence concerning PSSE is inadequate and low quality.
      The aim of this study is to identify the efficacy of PSSE on Cobb's angle, rotation angle,
      fall index, pulmonary function, bone quality, and health related quality-of-life (HRQoL) for
      mild AIS patients, and to promote PSSE's application in Shanghai.

      Prior to inclusion, all subjects will be examined by the physiatrists. A parent of each
      subject will be asked to sign an informed consent form before the subject participate in the
      study.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized by a 1:1 allocation ratio by computer either to the
      intervention group, in which they will perform PSSEs; or the control group, in which they
      will perform generalised physiotherapy exercises. All subjects will be assessed at the
      initial visit and 6 months. A multidimensional, comprehensive evaluation including aesthetic
      appearance, radiographic measurement, static balance test, pulmonary function test, bone
      quality, and HRQoL will be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spinal
      column, including scoliosis in the coronal plane, fixed rotation of the vertebral body and
      physiological curvature loss in the sagittal plane. AIS has a relatively high prevalence in
      adolescents. Exercise is the most common conservative therapy for mild AIS patients and has
      been widely used to reduce spinal deformity and halt curve progression. There are two kinds
      of exercises: generalised physiotherapy exercises and physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific
      exercise (PSSE). Little evidence is in favor of generalised physiotherapy exercises. There
      are increasing evidences suggesting that PSSE can halt the curve progression. Nevertheless,
      the evidence concerning PSSE is inadequate and low quality. Thus, the aim of this study is to
      identify the efficacy of PSSE on Cobb's angle, rotation angle, fall index, pulmonary
      function, bone quality, and health related quality-of-life (HRQoL) for mild AIS patients, and
      to promote PSSE's application in Shanghai.

      The AIS patients will be recruited from and investigated at the Xinhua Hospital, Xinhua
      Hospital Chongming Branch, Shanghai First Rehabilitation Hospital, Shanghai Yangzhi
      Rehabilitation Hospital, and Shanghai Yangpu Daqiao Community Health Service Centre. Prior to
      inclusion, all subjects will be examined by the physiatrists. The subjects' height, weight,
      shoulder, chest, back and pelvic asymmetries, and the Adams forward bend test will be
      evaluated and recorded. The following information will be obtained for all subjects,
      including demographic data (for example, age and sex), menarche status for the girls, and
      family history. A parent of each subject will be asked to sign an informed consent form
      before the subject participate in the study.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized by a 1:1 allocation ratio by computer either to the
      intervention group, in which they will perform PSSEs under the guidance of an experienced
      physiotherapist with expertise in scoliosis in an outpatient clinic; or the control group, in
      which they will perform generalised physiotherapy exercises. All subjects will receive the
      treatment as allocated and will be assessed at the initial visit and 6 months. A
      multidimensional, comprehensive evaluation including aesthetic appearance, radiographic
      measurement, static balance test, pulmonary function test, bone quality, and HRQoL will be
      used.

    <measure>Scores of Scoliosis Research Society-22 Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire (SRS-22) scores will be evaluated using the Chinese version of SRS-22 at the initial visit and 6 months later. All subjects will be required to complete SRS-22 independently. SRS-22 is a simple form of questionnaire to assess the HRQoL of AIS patients. It consists of 22 questions in 5 domains including functional activity, pain, self-image, psychological heath and satisfaction to treatment. Each question scores from 1 point (the lowest) to 5 (the highest). Each domain scores from 5 points to 25 points except for satisfaction to the treatment, which scores from 2 points to 10 points. Each domain is expressed as a mean value: the higher the score the better the outcome.</description>

    <description>Physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises (PSSE) is recommended as a first step in the treatment of AIS to halt curve progression by SOSORT guidelines. The PSSE program will be personalized according to the subject's curves characteristics. The program includes patient and family education, 3D self-correction, stabilizing exercises, balance training, breathing exercises, and training in activities of daily living. A physiatrist will give a detailed explanation of the aims, importance, methods, and procedure of an intervention to patients and their parents. Each subject will receive guidance from multiple physiotherapists to ensure that the treatment effects are the result of the protocol and not any particular physiotherapists.</description>
