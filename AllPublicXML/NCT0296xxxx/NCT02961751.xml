    <textblock>
      Data from this clinical study will be used to assess if the treatment approach meets CDC
      criteria for becoming a recommended treatment (cure rate greater than 95 percent with a lower
      CI:95percent greater than 95 percent) or alternative treatment (cure rate greater than 95
      percent with a lower CI95 percent greater than 90 percent) for uncomplicated gonococcal
      infection. An estimated cure rate of 0.98. A single-arm clinical study design, allowing for a
      10 percent subject drop-out rate and 10 percent non-evaluable rate. Screening Visit will
      include a NG NAAT; the Baseline Visit at Day 1 will include a NG NAAT and culture; Test of
      Cure Visit at Day 6 will include a NG NAAT and culture. The primary objective of this study
      is to determine the efficacy of ciprofloxacin for treatment of uncomplicated N. gonorrhoeae
      infections with gyrA serine 91 genotype.

      This study is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label clinical study to assess the efficacy of
      one dose of ciprofloxacin given orally in subjects infected with untreated gyrA serine 91
      genotype N. gonorrhoeae as determined by a real-time PCR assay. The study will enroll
      approximately 381 subjects to obtain a per protocol eligible target of 257 subjects age 18
      and older regardless of gender identification who are seeking care in STD clinics at
      participating sites in the United States. Subjects who have untreated gyrA serine 91 genotype
      N. gonorrhoeae of the rectum, or male or female urogenital tract identified by a positive
      culture or NAAT conducted at a prior visit will be offered enrollment in the study. Subjects
      not consenting to participate in the study will receive treatment per local standard of care.
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of ciprofloxacin for
      treatment of uncomplicated N. gonorrhoeae infections with gyrA serine 91 genotype. The
      secondary objectives of the study are to 1) investigate the efficacy of ciprofloxacin for
      treatment of uncomplicated serine 91 gyrA N. gonorrhoeae infection by anatomic site and 2) to
      determine the sensitivity of the gyrA assay for detection of ciprofloxacin-susceptible N.
      gonorrhoeae infections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to give voluntary written informed consent before any study related
             procedure is performed.

          -  18 years or older, on the day of enrollment.

          -  Untreated gyrA serine 91 genotype N. gonorrhoeae of the rectum, or male or female
             urogenital tract, as determined by the gyrA test assay on a specimen collected within
             30 days of enrollment.

             --Subjects must have gyrA serine 91 genotype detected for N. gonorrhoeae from at least
             one non-pharyngeal site.
