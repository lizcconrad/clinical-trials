    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if the implementation of an online platform with procedures and
      protocols, improve the knowledge of professionals and can have a health impact related to
      decreased contamination of blood cultures.

      This is a Quasi-experimental study, with parallel groups (experimental and control).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an Online Learning Platform used by
      nurses to improve the results of a blood culture technique. The online learning tool is
      studied in two of four internal medicine units of a tertiary hospital in Madrid. These two
      units have similar characteristics of personnel, materials and structure. Both units are at a
      great distance, preventing a professional talk to each other.
