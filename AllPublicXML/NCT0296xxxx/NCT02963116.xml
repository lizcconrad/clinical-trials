    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, 5-period, 5-treatment, single-dose, single-center,
      crossover study to estimate the effect of AZD5718 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      rosuvastatin, and to assess the relative bioavailability of AZD5718 oral suspension vs
      AZD5718 immediate release (IR) Tablet Formulation and the Food Effect of AZD5718 in Healthy
      Volunteers. The study will be performed at a single study center.

      The study will comprise:

        -  A Screening period of maximum 28 days;

        -  Five treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from the morning on the
           day before dosing with the IMP (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after dosing; discharge
           will be on the morning of Day 3, and

        -  A Follow-up Visit within 7 to 10 days after the last administration of the IMPs.

        -  There will be a minimum of a 7 days washout between each treatment period.

      Each subject will receive 5 treatments. The following treatments will be given:

        -  Treatment A: 10 mg rosuvastatin tablet alone (fasting state)

        -  Treatment B: 10 mg rosuvastatin tablet + 200 mg of AZD5718 IR tablet (2 x 100 mg tablet)
           (fasting state)

        -  Treatment C: 200 mg of AZD5718 IR tablet (2 x 100 mg tablet) (fasting state)

        -  Treatment D: 200 mg of AZD5718 oral suspension 50 mg/mL (fasting state)

        -  Treatment E: 200 mg of AZD5718 IR tablet (2 x 100 mg tablet) (fed state)

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 8 weeks.

             excluded from other aspects of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled:

          1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             PI, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or
             influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion

          3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of IMP.

             urinalysis results, at the Screening Visit and/or admission to the study unit as
             judged by the PI including: − Aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN); −
             Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; ULN; − Total bilirubin (TBL) &gt; ULN; and − Gamma
             glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) &gt; ULN.

          5. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs at the Screening Visit
             and/or admission to the study unit, as judged by the PI defined as any of the
             following: − Systolic BP (SBP) &lt; 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg; − Diastolic BP (DBP) &lt; 50 mmHg
             or ≥ 90 mmHg; and − Pulse &lt; 45 or &gt; 85 beats per minute (bpm).

          6. Any clinically significant abnormalities (at the Screening Visit and admission) in
             rhythm, conduction or morphology of the resting ECG and any clinically significant
             abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG, as considered by the investigator that may interfere
             with the interpretation of QTc interval changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave
             morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular
             hypertrophy.

          7. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          9. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of IMP in this
             study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or 1 month after
             the last visit whichever is the longest. Note: subjects consented and screened, but

             (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of
             20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to
             the first administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long half-life.
             Note: Hormonal replacement therapy is not allowed for females.

        study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.

        21. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
        trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order In addition,
        the following is considered a criterion for the exclusion from the optional genetic
        component of the study: 22. Previous bone marrow transplant. 23. Non-leukocyte depleted
        whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the date of the genetic sample collection or
