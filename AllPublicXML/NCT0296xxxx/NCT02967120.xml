      The purpose of this study is to verify the function of p16 hydroxymethylation diagnostic
      reagents in early diagnosis of oral cancer.

      Background:Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is one of the common precancerous lesions among
      Chinese adults. To investigate the clinical predictive value of p16 hydroxymethylation
      diagnostic reagents in the early diagnosis of oral cancer, the investigators carried out the
      prospective multi-center double-blind cohort study.

      Methods:265 patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate OED were included in the
      present study. After the bisulfite modification and tet assistant bisulfite modification,
      MethyLight and Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays were used to analyze p16 methylation and
      status in these patients. Building three follow-up queue by p16-methylated,
      p16-hydroxymethylation and p16-unmethylated. The Statistical analysis used SPSS16.0. All
      P-values were two-sided. P&lt;0.05 was considered to test for statistical significance
      difference.

        336 patients with mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia were selected. 145 of them are
        collected from Peking University of Stomatology and 165 were from Capital Medical
        University School of Stomatology and other 26 were from Fourth Military Medical University
        School of Stomatology.All of the patients with OED had been diagnosed pathologically by at
        least two senior pathologists using the criteria from '2005 WHO Classification System' and
        The oral tissue pathology diagnostic criteria (oral histopathology Edition Sixth).All cases
        involved primary lesions without any LASER, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
