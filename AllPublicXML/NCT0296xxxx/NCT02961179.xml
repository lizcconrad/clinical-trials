    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the in-depth the benefits of dairy consumption on glucose
      metabolism in patients at risk of type 2 diabetes using novel genomics methodology.To do so,
      33 individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes will be randomly subjected to an intervention study
      including a 6-week intensive dairy product consumption period and a 6-week dietary
      counselling period.

    <textblock>
      More than 9 million Canadians are living with diabetes or prediabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a
      disorder characterized by high blood glucose. Dietary modification is a key component in type
      2 diabetes management. For example, dairy product consumption has beneficial effects on
      metabolic health. Yet, researchers have shown that mixed results exists for insulin
      sensitivity.
