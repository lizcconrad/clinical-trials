  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted from November 2015 and May 2016 with 112
      participants of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Participants aged 18 years or older with
      Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-V) schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from
      outpatient mental health clinics in Jordan, were randomly assigned participants either to
      receive 6 weeks of a booklet form of intervention with face to face discussion, and treatment
      as usual (TAU) (intervention, n = 56), or TAU (control, n = 56). Participants were assessed
      at baseline, immediately post-intervention (post-treatment1) and at three months follow-up.
      The primary outcome measure was change in helplessness score . Secondary outcomes for PDwS
      were psychiatric symptoms, recovery rate and quality of life.
