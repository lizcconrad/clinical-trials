  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are at high risk for swallowing impairment
      (dysphagia) which leads to malnutrition, decreased pulmonary health, aspiration and
      aspiration pneumonia. These sequelae necessitate timely identification of at risk individuals
      to ensure optimal management of oral intake and pulmonary function. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the discriminant ability of several non-invasive screening tools at detecting
      swallowing impairment in individuals with ALS.

      This research study is being performed to determine screening tools or tests that are able to
      identify and track swallowing problems associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
      over time. Also, this study will provide insight into the natural progression of swallowing
      impairment in persons with ALS over time.

      Participants enrolled in this study will complete one evaluation at the University of Florida
      Swallowing Systems Core laboratory located at Shands Hospital, Gainesville every three
      months. Each evaluation will take approximately 90 minutes. During these evaluations, a
      videofluoroscopy (X-ray of swallowing) examination, cough tests, tongue function test and
      questionnaires will be completed.
