      Examination of the correlation between adenoid hypertrophy and body temperature in candidate
      children for adenoidectomy after exercise.

      Adenoid hypertrophy and adenoiditis are accompanied by chronic rhinitis with or without
      otitis media. It is very common phenomena at ages 2-6 years and those children are
      symptomatic with snoring, rhinitis, nasal obstruction.

      In healthy children with nasal obstruction, body temperature can be elevated following
      exercise.

      As adenoiditis and chronic rhinitis are accompanied by inflammatory process, we would like to
      examine body temperature of children with adenoid hypertrophy before after exercise.
