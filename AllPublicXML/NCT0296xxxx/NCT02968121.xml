    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      brexpiprazole in the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia. The trial will consist of two
      parts across 13-36 months. The trial population will include approximately 110 male &amp; female
      subjects between 18 and 64 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as
      defined by DSM-V criteria.

             not meet DSM-V criteria for substance use disorder]).

          -  Use of more than 1 psychotropic medication at the screening or baseline visit, except
             for oral brexpiprazole administered during the brexpiprazole tolerability testing (if
             applicable) and current oral antipsychotic medication.

          -  Use of varenicline beyond screening.

          -  Subjects who have participated in any clinical trial involving a psychotropic
             medication within 1 month prior to the administration of IMP or 5 half-lives from last
             IMP administration whichever is longer.

          -  Subjects who have a significant risk of committing suicide based on history, routine
             psychiatric status examination, investigator's judgment, or who have an answer of
             &quot;yes&quot; on questions 4 or 5 on the Baseline Version of the C-SSRS.

          -  Subjects currently in an acute relapse of schizophrenia as assessed by the
             investigator.

          -  Subjects with a current DSM-V diagnosis other than schizophrenia. Also, subjects with
