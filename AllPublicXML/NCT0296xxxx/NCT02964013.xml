  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics study of MK-7684 as monotherapy and in
      combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with metastatic solid tumors for which
      there is no available therapy that is expected to convey clinical benefit. Part A of this
      study is a dose escalation phase. Part B is a dose confirmation phase to estimate the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) for MK-7684 monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab.
      The anti-tumor activity of MK-7684 when used as monotherapy and in combination with
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors will be evaluated in Part B in a
      non-randomized study design. Part B will also evaluate 2 doses of MK-7684 in combination with
      pembrolizumab in participants with programmed death 1 (PD-1) treatment naïve cancer using a
      1:1 randomized study design. The primary hypothesis is that MK-7684 administered as
      monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab is safe when administered at the RPTD.

    <description>During an initial dose evaluation phase, participants will receive dose A, B, C, D, or E of MK-7684 on Day 1 of each infusion cycle (for a maximum of 35 cycles) until the RPTD has been established. The RPTD will be established based on the number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level. Once the RPTD is established, participants will continue receiving the RPTD of MK-7684 on Day 1 of each infusion cycle until the 35-cycle limit is reached.</description>
