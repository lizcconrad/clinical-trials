    <textblock>
      A drop off in improvement over the months and years after treatment is common. One
      contributor may be poor memory for the contents of treatment. This study seeks to determine
      whether text messages containing reminders of the content of sessions will improve treatment
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growth in the use of technology provides an opportunity to send reminders to participants
      via text messages. The early studies on text messaging interventions indicate this approach
      is enjoyable for participants and has positive effects across a range of domains and
      treatment types. Hence, this study will test whether text messages containing reminders of
      the content of sessions will improve treatment outcomes. Two text messaging methods will also
      be tested. One is to send text messages to remind participants of their goals (PUSH
      condition) and the second is to send text messages to remind participants to recall their
      goals (PULL condition). This study will be conducted within the context of an NICHD-funded
      Randomized Controlled Trial (grant number R01-HD071065; protocol registration ID
      NCT01828320). In R01-HD071065 adolescents ages 10-18 (n = 176) will receive either the
      Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TranS-C) or a Psychoeducation (PE). At the
      6-month follow-up assessment for R01-HD071065, participants will be randomized using 3 (PUSH
      text messages, PULL text messages, or no text messages) x 2 (TranS-C or PE) design. At the
      6-month follow-up assessment, a questionnaire will also be administered to establish baseline
      memory for treatment. Participants will be sent text messages once per week until they return
      for the 12 month follow-up assessment for R01-HD071065. At the 12 month follow-up assessment,
      participants will be asked to complete the same memory for treatment questionnaire completed
      at the 6 month follow-up assessment as well as a questionnaire evaluating the acceptability
      of the text message reminders. This research is a first step toward identifying whether an
      inexpensive and ubiquitous technology (i.e., text messaging) can improve memory for
      treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Scoring within the lowest quartile of the Children's Morningness-Eveningness
             Preferences Scale (CMEP; 27 or lower) and a 7-day sleep diary showing a sleep onset
             time of of 10:40 pm or later for 10-13 year olds, 11 pm or later for 14-16 year olds,
             and 11:20 pm or later for 17-18 year olds at least 3 nights per week. Must have had
             the current pattern of late bedtimes for the last 3 months.

          2. 'At risk' in one of the five health domains: emotional, behavioral, social, physical,
             and cognitive. Emotional risk will be operationalized as a score of 4 or above on any
             of the following items on the Child Depression Rating Scale: Difficulty Having Fun,
             Social Withdrawal, Irritability, Depressed Feelings, Excessive Weeping, or a T-score
             of 61 or above on the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), based on age
             group (10-11 years, 12-15 year, 16-19 years) using the MASC-10 Profile. Behavioral
             risk will be operationalized as a Sensation Seeking Scale score greater than 3.93 for
             males ages 10-13, greater than 3.19 for females 10-13, greater than 4.07 for males
             14-18, or greater than 3.19 for females 14-18; taking ADHD medication or Kiddie
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (KSADs)
             diagnosis of ADHD; current alcohol or substance abuse; or past alcohol or substance
             dependence. Social and cognitive risk will be defined as &quot;worse&quot; than others the
             teen's age in one or more social behavior from Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Section
             VI or failing one or more academic class from CBCL Section VII, respectively. Physical
             risk will be operationalized as a Physical Health Questionnaire-15 score of 4 or
             above, six or more days of school absences, or a BMI above the 85th percentile for the
             participant's sex and age.

          3. Age between 10 and 18 and living with a parent or guardian and and attending a
             class/job by 9am at least 3 days per week;

          4. English language fluency;

          5. Able and willing to give informed assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. An active, progressive physical illness (e.g., cancer, respiratory disorder) or
             neurological degenerative disease directly related to the onset and course of the
             sleep disturbance;

          2. Evidence from clinical diagnosis or report by youth or parent of sleep apnea, restless
             legs or periodic limb movements during sleep. Youth presenting with provisional
             diagnoses of any of these disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) will be referred for a
             non-study polysomnography (PSG) evaluation at the parent's discretion and will be
             enrolled only if the diagnosis is disconfirmed;

          3. Mental retardation, autism spectrum disorder, or other significantly impairing
             pervasive developmental disorder. Based on previous recruitment experiences in a youth
             depression study, it is expected that this exclusion will be invoked very infrequently
             (once every few years);

          4. Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or another current Axis I disorder if there is a
             significant risk of harm and/or decompensation if treatment of that comorbid condition
             is delayed as a function of participating in any stage of this study. Otherwise, all
             other comorbid psychiatric conditions will be allowed to (i) to maximize
             representativeness and (ii) because a byproduct may be that the treatment constitutes
             a helpful 'transdiagnostic' treatment for youth across psychiatric disorders.

          5. A medication-free group may be difficult to recruit and would likely be
             unrepresentative. Hence, participants will not be excluded on the basis of stable use
             of medications (&gt; 4 weeks). The exception was use of hypnotics and other medications
             known to alter sleep (e.g., melatonin).

          6. History of substance dependence in the past six months;

          7. Current suicide risk sufficient to preclude treatment on an outpatient basis.
