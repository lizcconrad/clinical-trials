  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consists of single chain variable fragment (scFv) and
      activation domain of T cell, and CAR-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) have the capabilities to
      recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. To a large part of
      patients with refractory or relapsed B cell malignancies, CAR-T cell adoptive immunotherapy
      can play a revolutionary effect in the field of cancer treatment. The investigators believe
      that the cells with CD137 will have a better chance of killing the leukemia cells. In the
      lab, the investigators constructed a second generation CAR containing CD137. The
      investigators start Phase I study aimed to relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CD19 CAR-T cells in
      patients.

      CD19 CAR-T has stronger effect of anti-tumor capacity. While people have been able to control
      the clinical complications now, so conducting CD19 CAR-T clinical trials has a strong demand
      and value. The investigators constructed a second generation CAR containing CD137.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically and histologically confirmed CD19 + B cell tumors, the patient is
             currently no effective treatment options, such as chemotherapy or autologous
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) / relapse after allogeneic
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) treatment; or patients voluntarily
             choose CD19 CAR-T cells as a first treatment;

          2. B cell hematological malignancies include the following three categories:

        1) B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL); 2) Indolent B-cell lymphoma (CLL, FL, MZL,
        LPL); 3) Aggressive B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, BL, MCL); 3. &lt; 60 years old; 4. Expected
        survival time &gt; 6 months; 5. Female patients around childbearing age, negative pregnancy
        test before trial, and agreed to take effective contraceptive measures during the trial
        until the last visit; 6. Voluntarily participate in this experiment and sign informed
        consent by themself, or legally authorized representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. With a history of epilepsy or other central nervous system diseases;

          2. Having graft-versus-host reaction, requires the use of immunosuppressants;

          3. The presence of clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as uncontrolled or
             symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within
             recent six months, or heart disease with cardiac function in any grade 3 (moderate) or
             4 ( severe) (according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional
             Classification System);
