    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GSK2330672
      administration for the treatment of pruritus (itch) in participants with primary biliary
      cholangitis (PBC). Participants will be treated with either placebo or one of the 4 dose
      regimens of GSK2330672 (20 milligram [mg], 90 mg or 180 mg taken once daily or 90 mg twice
      daily). Subjects on GSK2330672 will also receive placebo tablets to maintain blinding. The
      total duration of a subject's participation will be up to 45 days of screening and 24 weeks
      of study including follow-up.

             or ascites).

          -  Presence of actively replicating viral hepatitis due to hepatitis B or C (HBV, HCV)

          -  Initiation or increase in dose of colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or systemic
             corticosteroids in the 2 months prior to screening. If a change in dose in any of

             Main Study Period, if clinically indicated.

          -  Obeticholic acid use: a participant must discontinue use of obeticholic acid at least
             8 weeks prior to the start of the Initial Study Period and may not restart until after

          -  Administration of any other IBAT inhibitor in the 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Current enrolment or participation within the 8 weeks before start of the Initial
             Study Period, in any other clinical study involving an investigational study
             treatment.

          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate QTc &gt;480 millisecond (msec).

          -  History of sensitivity to the study treatment or components thereof or a history of
             drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor,

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is

             wine or 1 measure (25 mL) of spirits.
