    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common fatal malignant tumor, although with the
      popularity of health examination, most patients were diagnosed as HCC in advanced stages so
      far. Sorafenib is currently recognized worldwide as the only effective treatment for advanced
      HCC. However, sorafenib need long-term medication, and will bring a series of side effects,
      including, hand, foot and comprehensive syndrome (Hand-foot syndrome, HFS) limbs swelling,
      rash, peeling, pain.Occurrence rate of HFS is about 21%-51%, which seriously affect patient's
      quality of life.Besides, this side effects appeared to be dose-related.When severe HFS
      happened, sorafenib need to reduce dosage or discontinue administration, which could
      seriously affect the patient's survival. Therefore, investigators designed this prospective
      randomized controlled study to explore preventive effect of celecoxib for sorafenib related
      HFS, the influence on the quality of life in patients with, and also the synergistic
      anti-tumor effect of celecoxib in combination with sorafenib on HCC. This study will explore
      horizon of improving treatment for sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC,quality of life
      and tumor control.
