      An open, non-randomised longitudinal study of diabetic foot ulcers receiving standardised
      treatment, over a 16 week period conducted at out-patient level, utilising novel optical
      wound measurement technologies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers are a major burden on the healthcare system, and it is highly desirable
      to develop a practical, reliable, non-invasive means of diagnosing, assessing and measuring
      wound healing, so as to provide wound care specialists with key data with which to make
      effective decisions for clinical management.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel technique of imaging of cutaneous tissue. Using
      low-power infrared light, it is a non-invasive in-vivo imaging technique which provides
      resolution of &lt;10microns to a depth of 1 - 1.25 mm in skin, (adequate to resolve capillaries)
      utilizing the optical scattering characteristics of tissue to provide imaging contrast.

      This open, non-randomised, observational study will assess the feasibility of using OCT to
      diagnose chronic diabetic foot ulcers. One cohort of 15 patients will be scanned over a 16
      week period and results studied to determine whether there is an association between rate of
      wound healing and OCT measurements.
