  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) are a group of very rare and severe,
      pharmaco-resistant epilepsy forms characterized by an early onset, e.g. first years of life,
      and an often severe developmental delay. Genetic defects were found in different ion channels
      such as potassium or sodium channels explaining well the pathological neuronal
      hyperexcitability leading to seizures. Further mutations were also found in proteins relevant
      for cell structure, DNA/RNA processing or the synaptic vesicular metabolism. Specific and
      individualized therapies have not been established neither in the clinical routine nor in
      controlled studies. The goal of this monocentric non-blinded non-placebo controlled phase IIb
      study is the evaluation of the effectivity of anticonvulsive drugs specifically working on
      the ion channels defective in some subtypes of EEs in order to establish a standard and
      individualized therapy for these rare diseases based on the specific genetic defect.

      During the study, the sodium channel blockers phenytoin and lacosamide and the potassium
      channel blocker kinidinsulfate will be given under standardized conditions to patients with
      an early onset and pharmaco-resistant genetic epilepsy with and without mutations in the
      potassium channels KCNT1 and KCNQ2 and the sodium channel gene SCN2A. The primary endpoint
      will be a significant seizure reduction under trial medication compared to baseline.
      Secondary endpoints will be the improvement of electroencephalographic characteristics of the
      respective EEs.

    <description>Patient will receive Phenytoin, if no success is obtained, Vimpat is given, if no success is obtained Kinidinsulfat is given. In case of success after one of the treatments, the endpoint is reached. Success is defined as reduction of seizures to 50% compared to baseline.</description>
