    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, observational study of the efficacy and safety of ECT for
      BPSD. There is no control or comparison group. Subjects will be compared on outcome measures
      pre- and post-ECT (and/or with a repeated measures design). Target sample size is 30 subjects
      over three years

      The study population are patients whom have a diagnosis of dementia and has behavioural and
      psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In this study, the participants will have already
      been treated with antipsychotic medications as per usual practice but still do not have
      adequate symptoms control. One of the options in current clinical practice is to consider
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant BPSD, particularly in those with
      psychosis and/or substantial aggression. Therefore, the study involves offering ECT to these
      individuals and measuring the patient's clinical status and severity of symptoms before and
      after ECT treatments by using standardized rating scales. Further, background information
      about the patient will be collected, such as their age and medical conditions.

      ECT for BPSD has been done previously as reported in the medical literature. It has shown
      significant benefit for individuals when medication does not provide enough symptomatic
      relief. This research project is part of a larger multi-site study done in conjunction with
      Ontario Shores academic research group in Ontario, Canada. Active recruitment began in
      Ontario since October 2012, but our UBC site is hoping to recruit further subjects to the
      total of 30 participants between the two sites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe BPSD: BPSD of sufficient severity that the safety of the patient or others
             precludes the possibility of discharge to any non-hospital environment.

          -  Failed &quot;standard of care for BPSD&quot;:

               -  Non-pharmacological treatments (see Clinical Practice Guideline) are of
                  insufficient benefit to allow discharge to any non-hospital environment, and

               -  Pharmacological treatments are of insufficient benefit to allow discharge to any
                  non-hospital environment. Pharmacological treatments must consist of the
                  following prescribed specifically for BPSD:

                    -  at least three atypical antipsychotic agents each for at least 4 weeks

                    -  at least one of the following for at least four weeks: an antidepressant, a
                       cholinesterase inhibitor, and/or and NMDA receptor antagonist (i.e.
                       memantine).

          -  Provided informed (substitute) consent to their attending psychiatrist for off-label
             treatment of BPSD with ECT as per the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility
             (Admission) Act, and institutional policies and procedures.

          -  Been medically-cleared for ECT by Anaesthesia as per the usual pre-ECT work-up for
             patients admitted to the Geriatric Psychiatry Units.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that are medically unfit to undergo ECT as per consultation with an
             anesthetist.
