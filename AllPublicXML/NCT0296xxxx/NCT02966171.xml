  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human, phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of HMPL-453 in
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid malignancies who have failed or are intolerable to
      standard therapies or for whom no standard therapies exist. There are preliminary two stages
      in this study: a dose-escalation stage (stage 1) and a dose-expansion stage (stage 2). We
      will decide whether to conduct stage 2 or not one month after the last patient included in
      stage 1.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose-escalation stage (stage 1): Patients participating in the dose-escalation stage will
      take a single dose of HMPL-453 on Day 1 and will be followed for one week for safety
      observations. After one week of observation, if no safety issues occur, patients can continue
      multiple dosing of HMPL-453 QD and start on the DLT assessment cycles. Each cycle consists of
      28-days. Patients are required to draw blood samples for PK and safety analysis at specific
      time points during the treatment.

      The 3+3 design will be employed for the dose escalation and MTD determination. To limit the
      number of patients being exposed to potentially ineffective doses, one patient will be
      enrolled and dosed in the initial dose cohort. If there are no DLT or &lt; 2 CTCAE grade 2
      toxicities occur in the first treatment cycle, then the study will be escalated to the next
      dose cohort. Otherwise, the trial will revert to a standard 3+3 design.

      Dose-Expansion Stage (Stage 2): This stage is to further evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      PD profile, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HMPL-453 at the RP2D in approximately 10
      patients with advanced solid tumor. Patients with FGFR dysregulated advanced solid tumors,
      including but not limited to, advanced gastric cancer, advanced urothelial bladder cancer, or
      advanced cholangiocarcinoma (patients with cancers of the gallbladder or ampulla of Vater are
      not eligible) are preferred to be enrolled.

      Expansion stage will begin after dose-escalation stage is completed and the MTD/RP2D has been
      determined. Patients will receive HMPL-453 with 28-day treatment cycles until disease
      progression, death, intolerable toxicity, no longer benefiting from the study treatment per
      investigator's discretion, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.
