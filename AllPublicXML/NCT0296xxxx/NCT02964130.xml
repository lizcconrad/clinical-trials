  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is part of a global project that aims to better define and understand
      features of FBSS/POPS &quot;post-operative persistent syndrome patients (shortened as &quot;FBSS&quot; in
      the following project). FBSS is the acronym for Failed Back Surgery Syndrome, which has been
      defined as a chronic condition resulting from spinal interventions. Despite anatomically
      successful spine surgery, a significant proportion of patients is experiencing chronic
      refractory back and leg pain. In a recent multicentre study conducted on more than 100
      refractory FBSS patients, (ESTIMET Study), the mean delay between pain occurrence and FBSS
      diagnosis was 5 years. Therefore, FBSS pattern and potential responder stratification might
      guide us to eventually develop a decision tool for identifying FBSS patients. Easing and
      helping diagnosis of FBSS should improve referral yield to specialists and accelerate patient
      flow through the care pathway. Hence, FBSS patients, who usually present a long standing
      history of pain, would have access to &quot;appropriate&quot; therapies earlier. This could lead to
      better outcomes. The aim of this multicentre, prospective study is to collect specific data
      that are not collected in routine in order to better define and understand the potential FBSS
      population and to accelerate the diagnostic and optimize the choice of appropriate treatment.

      A multidisciplinary approach through a pain management clinical network, as it has been
      structured in Poitiers, will ensure that an exhaustive characterization of FBSS patients and
      their care pathway will be collected. In addition, since the cooperation between orthopaedic
      and neuro spine surgeons is not a common relationship found all over Europe (as it is
      observed in Poitiers), this study also aims to better understand the development of
      interactions between physicians/professionals and the substantial advantage which would
      result from bridging this gap. The N3MT (NeuroMapping Tools) software developed in Poitiers
      to collect data and assess objectively pain surface and intensity changes, before/after any
      treatment, with quantitative measurements, will be used as the central key of this project.
