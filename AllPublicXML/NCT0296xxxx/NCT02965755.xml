  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to determine if we can obtain personalized genetic
      information from a subject's blood sample that is similar to that obtained from a tumor
      tissue sample, and if we can use that information to make treatment suggestions.

      The goal of this research study is to determine if we can obtain personalized genetic
      information from a subject's blood sample that is similar to that obtained from a tumor
      tissue sample, and if we can use that information to make treatment suggestions. As tumor
      samples can be difficult to collect, we hope to be able to collect similar genetic
      information from blood or urine samples that we find in tumor tissue. Ultimately, we hope to
      identify genes important to cancer cells that could potentially identify standard-of-care or
      research-based recommendations for therapy.
