  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy and safety of
      the combination of tirabrutinib and idelalisib with obinutuzumab in adults with relapsed or
      refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      The study has a 6 patient per arm safety run-in to evaluate safety prior to the enrollment of
      subsequent participants. The primary objective is evaluation of efficacy with the secondary
      objective evaluation of safety and evaluation of additional parameters of efficacy. The
      treatment period is adaptive, with a duration of active treatment up to two years and a total
      follow-up on study of 5 years for time-dependent outcome variables.
