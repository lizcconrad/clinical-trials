  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is conceived as a pilot study aimed to determine the efficiency of the
      newly available Positron Emission Tomography (PET) - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) hybrid
      scan technique for muscular activity evaluation, creation of anatomic images of muscle
      activity and resolution of metabolic activity distribution within exercising skeletal muscle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        MRI exam inclusion criteria

          -  Male volunteer aged in the range 18 to 35 years.

          -  Acceptance of the research protocol: signature of the informed consent form after oral
             and written information about the protocol through the patient information document.

          -  Volunteers that could undergo 1h15 to 1h30 immobilization (MRI exam duration in time).

        PET/MRI exam inclusion criteria

          -  Male volunteer aged in the range 18 to 35 years.

          -  Acceptance of the research protocol: signature of the informed consent form after oral
             and written information about the protocol through the patient information document.

          -  Volunteers that could undergo 1.5 to 2.0 hours immobilization (PET/MRI exam duration
             in time).

          -  Volunteers should practice regular physical activity, defined as 50 min per day (in a
             single session), 2 days per week of physical activity as a minimum (no maximum is
             fixed).

        Exclusion criteria MRI exam exclusion criteria

          -  Pre-existing neurological or muscular lesions on the legs.

          -  Co morbidities impeding on the protocol comprehension or fulfilment.

          -  Illnesses that do not allow to lay down on an examination table.

          -  Pacemaker holder.

          -  Metal implants that would preclude MRI imaging

          -  Claustrophobia: Subjects will be questioned about possible discomfort with being in an
             enclosed space (e.g., MRI scanner). Those who report such problems will be excluded.

        PET/MRI exam exclusion criteria

          -  Medical radiation exposure within the last five years (normal population should not be
             exposed to medical radiation higher or equal to 1 mSv per year).

          -  Pre-existing neurological or muscular lesions on the legs.

          -  Co morbidities impeding on the protocol comprehension or fulfilment.

          -  Illnesses that do not allow to lay down on an examination table.

          -  Pacemaker holder.

          -  Metal implants that would preclude MRI imaging

          -  Claustrophobia: Subjects will be questioned about possible discomfort with being in an
             enclosed space (e.g., MRI scanner). Those who report such problems will be excluded.
