  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, prospective, descriptive and biomedical research with controls, without health
      product.

      Depression is the second risk factor for stroke as tobacco smoking following hypertension.
      Peripheral abnormalities in serotonin parameters were described in depression and tobacco
      smoking. The investigators hypothesized dysregulations in pathways of serotonin (5-HT), which
      has notably complex vasomotor effects and of kynurenine which could have cognitive
      dysfunction effects.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate simultaneously the involvement of serotonin and
      kynurenine pathways parameters in patients suffering from a cerebral infarction shortly after
      the onset (less than 4 hours and a half), within a 2 days follow-up (Day 1 and Day 2) and 3
      months after the cerebral infarction.

      Tryptophan (TRP), an essential aminoacid, is metabolized in the serotonin (5-HT) or in the
      kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Serotonin is catabolized to 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindole amino acid) by
      monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). The TRP to KYN transformation is regulated by indoleamine
      2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).

      The primary objective was the measurements of serotonin and kynurenine pathways parameters
      which were performed in blood and urine samples using different HPLC techniques and of
      serotonin transporters and receptors which were determined in blood platelets. The results in
      patients were compared to those measured in controls matched for age, gender, tobacco
      consumption and season of inclusion.

      The secondary objective was to evaluate the potential relationships between these 5-HT and
      Kyn pathways biomarkers concentrations, MAOA and IDO enzymatic activations and clinical
      outcome and criteria.
