  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will implement and test a unique Virtual Reality Cognitive Training (VRCT) combined
      with concurrent cycling on a recumbent stationary cycle, also known as exergame that
      seamlessly integrates specific cognitive tasks into a virtual environment and is synchronized
      with cycling to promote cognition.

      The proposed project will implement and test a unique Virtual Reality Cognitive Training
      (VRCT) combined with concurrent cycling on a recumbent stationary cycle, also known as
      exergame that seamlessly integrates specific cognitive tasks into a virtual environment and
      is synchronized with cycling to promote cognition. Cycling through an interesting virtual
      environment will motivate and engage the older adult to participate in the exercise, and VRCT
      could augment cycling's effects on cognition. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate
      the feasibility and efficacy of the exergame intervention on cognition through two phases. In
      Phase I, a prototype of the VRCT exergame will be developed, followed by a feasibility
      testing using a single-group mixed methods design. In Phase II a more fully-featured version
      of the VRCT exergame will be developed followed by a an RCT which will randomize subjects on
      a 2:1:1 allocation ratio to 3 parallel groups (exergame:cycling only:attention control).
      Mixed methods will be used to assess outcomes in both phases.

    <description>Participants will take part in the exergame, 3 times a week for a month. The session will start for 30-35 minutes of cycling on recumbent stationary cycles in session 1 and progress to moderate intensity for 50 minutes a session. Participants will do warm-up and cool-down activities before and after cycling. While cycling, participants will be playing virtual reality based games. An exercise interventionist will supervise the sessions and monitor participant's conditions and responses to ensure safety.</description>
