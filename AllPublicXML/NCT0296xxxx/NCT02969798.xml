      HYPOTHESIS: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) have distinct
      pathophysiologic etiologies. Therefore, therapeutic interventions designed to correct the
      specific underlying pathogenic abnormalities in IGT and IFG will be required to optimally
      prevent the progressive beta cell failure and development of overt type 2 diabetes.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell
           function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with isolated
           impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): (i) treatment with the renal Sodium-glucose
           co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor inhibitor, dapagliflozin; (ii) treatment with the
           inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4, also DPP4, saxagliptin ; (iii) treatment with the
           thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone; (iv) treatment with the biguanide, metformin.

        2. To examine the effect of the following pharmacologic interventions on beta cell
           function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance status in individuals with isolated
