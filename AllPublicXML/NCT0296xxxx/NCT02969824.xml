  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of standardized aerobic exercise (AE) compared to rest
      on clinical recovery from sport-related concussion (SRC) within the post-acute phase of
      injury. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: (1) Aerobic Exercise Group:
      participants will complete a total of eight exercise sessions over the course of 11 days,
      starting at Day 3 post-injury; (2) Usual Care Group: individuals will undergo a period of
      physical rest and standard care until symptoms spontaneously resolve. For the purposes of
      this study, &quot;rest&quot; will be defined as the avoidance of any activities beyond those of daily
      living, including participation in sport and physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of physical, cognitive, somatic, and emotional symptoms commonly occur following
      sports-related concussion. The current return to play (RTP) protocol advises complete
      physical and cognitive rest following SRC until patients are completely free of these
      symptoms (i.e. asymptomatic) in order to avoid making symptoms worse and furthering the
      injury. While this initial, post-injury rest period is generally assumed to be beneficial,
      there is currently no scientific evidence supporting this recommendation. In fact, a growing
      body of evidence suggests that prolonged rest may actually hinder the recovery process.

      Emerging research is beginning to show that light-to-moderate aerobic exercise (AE) actually
      provides a positive benefit on the injured brain, thereby helping the recovery process.
      Research has shown this benefit in concussion and other injuries such as stroke, whiplash,
      and low back pain. In fact, a standardized aerobic exercise protocol has been shown to
      improve recovery for individuals with persistent symptoms for an extended period of time.
      While preliminary human investigations using AE interventions after concussion have shown
      promise, these studies are either retrospectively designed, or have focused on individuals
      with persistent symptoms (&gt; 3 weeks).

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a standardized, subacute AE
      intervention in adolescents after SRC, on time to recovery compared to usual care. This study
      will provide meaningful information regarding the utility of AE intervention after
      concussion. Findings from these works may inform future usual care procedures post-injury,
      potentially providing the first known treatment to improve recovery after concussion.

    <time_frame>28 Days: assessed at Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 90 post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>Concussion-related symptoms will be assessed using the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-3 (SCAT3). The symptom score is comprised of a 22-item post-concussion symptom scale using a seven-point Likert scale rating. Total symptoms is the total number of symptoms with a non-zero score and symptom severity is obtained by summing the rated symptom score for each symptom.</description>

    <measure>Change in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days: assessed at Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 90 post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) will be assessed using the Polar heart rate V800 sports watch and corresponding chest strap heart monitor (Polar Â®, QC, Canada). HRV will be assessed for 5 minutes in the supine position, followed by a 1-minute accommodation period, a final five-minute HRV assessment in the upright-seated position will be performed. HRV measurements to be analyzed HRV was assessed using both time domain and frequency domain measures, in accordance with recommendations of the Task Force of the European Society Cardiology and North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology.</description>

    <description>Blood Pressure Variability (BPV) will be measured using the Finapres MIDI figure cuff device concurrently with HRV. Systolic BP and diastolic BP values will be acquired throughout the acquisition period.</description>

    <measure>Change in Peripheral Blood Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days: assessed at Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 90 post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood samples (approximately 20 mL) will be drawn from participants by a trained phlebotomist. High sensitivity multiplexed immunoassay will be employed to quantitate 30 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and 11 central nervous-injury specific biomarkers. Individual biomarker values will be excluded if they were above or below the manufacturers' recommended level of quantitation for each analyte, or displayed a coefficient of variance &gt;25% between duplicates. Because multiple 96-well plates will analyzed, inter-plate variance will also be accounted for; therefore, plates will only be included in the statistical analysis if the inter-plate variance was &lt;20%, calculated from internal control samples acquired on each plate. Raw values of biomarker analyte will be used in all analyses.</description>

    <description>The AE protocol will consist of eight sessions that proceed in a stepwise fashion in terms of duration and intensity over 11 days. Exercise will be performed on the Velotron Pro stationary cycle ergometer (RacerMate Inc., WA, USA), which will be digitally connected to a heart rate monitor and programmed to monitor the wattage of the bike based on the participant's heart rate. Exercise duration (15min-20min) and intensity (60%-75% max HR) will increase over the intervention period.</description>
