  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-phase study to implement the NIDA CDEs in primary care settings. Collecting and
      utilizing the CDEs in clinical practice requires a strategy for implementing screening to
      collect substance use information that populates the CDEs, and assisting primary care medical
      staff to offer appropriate interventions by providing clinical decision support (CDS) and a
      mechanism for making referrals to addiction treatment. Investigators aim to maximize the
      efficient adoption of screening, CDS, and treatment referrals by integrating all of these
      activities into the electronic health record (EHR).

      The study will be conducted at three sites, representing three large health systems. Each
      phase will include deliverables essential to move to the next phase, and an independent
      Advisory Committee will review progress and make recommendations at each transition about how
      best to progress to each subsequent phase. Based on progress during earlier phases, the
      Advisory Committee may recommend expansion to additional clinics or health systems during the
      second part of Phase 4.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. To program the NIDA CTN CDEs, the NIDA/ASAM electronic Clinical Quality Measure (eCQM),
           and a lean decision support module into Epic.

        2. To study the process of implementation of screening and referral using Epic-driven CDEs
           and CDS in three primary care clinics / practices, including defining potential barriers
           and facilitators to their adoption.

        3. To evaluate the impact of implementation on:

             -  Patient level outcomes (diagnosis, treatment referral);

             -  Medical staff level outcomes (screening and assessment, clinical interventions
                including counseling and treatment referral); and

             -  Systems level outcomes (logistics and costs of introducing the CDEs, feasibility).

    <description>Medical staff will be surveyed using the Substance Abuse Attitude Survey (SAAS) to gather information about attitudes from medical staff who do not participate in the focus groups, or may be uncomfortable sharing negative attitudes in a group of their peers. The SAAS is a validated multidimensional instrument that evaluates physician attitudes toward substance-using patients. It includes specific measures of attitudes toward permissiveness, treatment intervention, stereotypes, treatment optimism, and moralism, and has been used in prior studies of primary care physicians. Collecting information on staff attitudes toward substance users and substance use interventions will be helpful to inform about any sources for low adoption of the tools, and any needs for additional provider education and training.</description>

        Clinical implementation leaders Clinical implementation leaders are practicing primary care
        physicians (PCPs) who provide feedback to the research team and support their colleagues on
        implementing screening, using the CDS, and carrying out clinical interventions and
        referrals to address unhealthy substance use. One or two primary care providers will be
        identified from each participating clinic will advise the research team on implementation
        and to serve as a resource for their colleagues.
