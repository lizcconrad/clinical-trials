    <textblock>
      Fifty-one patients suffering from chronic post-traumatic or postoperative osteomyelitis of
      the lower extremities were included in the retrospective investigation. The patients were
      assigned to the study group of the combination therapy with antibiotic-loaded calcium sulfate
      and antibiotic-loaded PMMA or the control group of the antibiotic-loaded PMMA. Hematological
      parameters, eradication of infection, rate of infection recurrence and reoperation rate were
      evaluated during the follow-up.

    <description>To obtain a paste suitable for pellets, the following steps should be used: 1. Empty 10 cc Stimulan® calcium sulfate powder (Stimulan; Biocomposites Ltd; United Kingdom) into a sterile mixing bowl. 2. The calcium sulfate powder was mixed with 2,000 mg of vancomycin powder. 3. Add approximately 5 ml mixing solution into the above mixture. Mix thoroughly until a smooth paste is formed (approximately 30 seconds). 4. The resultant paste is uniformly smooth into the mould provided to form pellets with diameters of 4.8 mm and height of 3.3 mm. 5. Allow paste to cure undisturbed for at least 15 minutes after mixing. Flex mould to release pellets.</description>

    <description>One sachet of 40g PALACOSR®+G power containing 33.6g PMMA and with the addition of 0.5g gentamicin sulphate (Heraeus Medical Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung,Germany) was mixed with 4,000 mg of vancomycin powder in a sterile bowl. The liquid provided was poured into the resultant mixture above. Then, the mixture was stirred carefully for 30 sec. If the dough-like mass no longer sticked to the rubber gloves, it can be progressed. If the required consistency was obtained, the cement can be applied to the bony defect until it hardened completely.</description>
