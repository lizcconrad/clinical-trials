      The purpose of this study is to evaluate product performance of Magnetic Resonance (MR)
      Conditional Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED) following 3 tesla (3T) MRI
      exposure. This will be achieved by evaluating the changes in pacing capture threshold (PCT)
      measurements following 3T MRI scan exposure. This study is required by FDA as a condition of
      approval of 3T MRI compatible labeling of applicable CIED systems. This study is conducted
      within Medtronic's post-market surveillance platform, the Product Surveillance Registry
      (PSR).
