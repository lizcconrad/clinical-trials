    <textblock>
      A precise volume status assessment is critical to improve outcome of patients on dialysis.
      Yet, accurate assessment of fluid status remains a challenge. Currently, this is performed by
      clinical evaluation and regular weight measurements before and after dialysis, which is not
      always accurate. Moreover, bioimpedance technology is used in some centers for quantitative
      assessment of total body water. This approach has been validated for the assessment of volume
      status in dialysis patients, but requires the acquisition of specific tools and is time
      consuming. So far, no biomarker has been validated to quantify volume status in dialysis
      patients. Application of biomarkers might contribute to a better dialysis prescription and
      therefore to outcome improvement in dialysis. The investigators aim to investigate the role
      of a novel biomarkers (sCD146) to assess volume status in dialysis patients
