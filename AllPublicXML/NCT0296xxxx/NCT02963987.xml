  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators varied the portion size of all meals served during two 5-day
      periods. During one period, baseline amounts of all foods and beverages were served, and
      during the other, the portion size of all items was increased by 50%. The primary aim of the
      study is to determine the effect of varying the portion size of foods and beverages served
      over 5 days on energy intake in preschool children.
