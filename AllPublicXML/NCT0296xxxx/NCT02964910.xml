      This phase IV clinical study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the
      recombinant Hepatitis E vaccine(Hecolin®), manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., LTD.,
      in the chronic Hepatitis B patients on the clinical stability and aged over 30 years of age
      at enrollment. The study volunteers will receive the 3 doses of Hecolin® administered
      intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule.
