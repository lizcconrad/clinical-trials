      Questionnaire study to investigate the effect of individual characteristics such as age, sex,
      ethnicity, educational level and socioeconomic status on the preferred format of patient
      education delivery, for patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease

      An anonymous questionnaire will be used to collect basic demographic data for patients with
      the conditions of interest, in addition to information about their preferences for the format
      in which they receive patient education information. This data will be statistically analysed
      to address the primary and secondary outcomes of the study:

        1. To investigate the effect of individual characteristics such as age, sex, ethnicity,
           educational level and socioeconomic status on the preferred format of patient education
           delivery.

        2. To identify reasons for preference of patient education delivery, and whether these are
           associated with sociodemographic factors.

        3. To assess the distribution of sociodemographic factors from participants who prefer
           online education, in order to identify whether preference for online education is
           associated with particular sociodemographic factors.
