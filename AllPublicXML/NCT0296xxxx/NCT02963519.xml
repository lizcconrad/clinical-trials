      Primary objective:

      Demonstrate that in patients with acute leg wounds with skin defect, VistaCare® accelerates
      the formation of a quality granulation tissue and reduces preparation time to a cover
      gesture.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluate the success of hedging gesture

        -  Assess the quality of the bud by colorimetry

        -  Assess tolerance

        -  Collect medical and economic data on the care of patients included

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of patients

        -  Assess patient comfort

        -  Evaluate the ease of use for the caregiver
