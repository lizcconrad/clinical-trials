  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is one of the world's leading health hazards. Besides being a major risk factor in
      the etiology of COPD and lung cancer, cigarette smoke is also a causative agent lung diseases
      characterized by bronchiolar and interstitial inflammation. However, the associated lung
      pathology of smoking is not only a risk in the development of lung diseases, but also widely
      recognized as a major risk factor associated with perioperative respiratory and
      cardiovascular complications. Apart from the long term effects of cigarette smoke, acute
      effects of the inhalation of cigarettes smoke may influence the course of lung pathology. The
      inhalation of smoke causes inflammation in the lung by inducing chemotaxis and activation of
      neutrophils and macrophages and induces oxidative stress. As the acute inflammatory response
      to smoke inhalation seems to be the underlying mechanism for chronic diseases of smokers,
      exploring the field of the acute pulmonary changes after exposure to cigarette smoke is
      highly relevant. One reason for acute hypoxia and injury during smoking might be a severe
      mismatch of ventilation and perfusion of the lung. Using the multiple inert gas elimination
      technique (MIGET), a distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios in the lung can be
      calculated by analyzing data on the retention and excretion of six infused inert gases. A
      saline solution containing the gases is infused intravenously. When passing through the lung
      the gases are either eliminated from the blood or retained depending on their partition
      coefficient and local V/Q ratio. The concentrations of the gases are measured in the mixed
      venous blood or the mixed expired gas and the arterial blood allowing for the calculation of
      retention and excretion and the derivation of V/Q distribution. MIGET is the experimental
      gold standard to determine the Ventilation-Perfusion ratio of the lung. The aim of this study
      is to show the acute effect of smoking on ventilation/perfusion ratio distribution in the
      lung in otherwise healthy smokers.
