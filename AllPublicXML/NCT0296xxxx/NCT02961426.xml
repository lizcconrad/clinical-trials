      This is a Phase II/III, multicenter, multi-country, trial to assess the efficacy, safety,
      tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir plus ravidasvir for the treatment of HCV
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of SOF-RDV across all genotypes, among
      non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic with CTP class A, interferon/ribavirin naïve or experienced, HCV
      mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected subjects.

      It will also study the pharmacokinetics of RDV and, in HCV/HIV co-infected subjects, possible
      drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals.

      The treatment duration will be 12 weeks for subjects with no cirrhosis (Metavir F0 to F3) and
      24 weeks for subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Metavir F4, CTP class A). After enrollment
      of the first 300 evaluable patients is complete, enrollment will pause while data is being
      accumulated and analyzed.

      After review of interim results by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),
      and by the study Steering Committee, enrollment will resume.

      Should modification of the study design be required upon interim analysis, decision will be
      taken by the study steering committee and the amended protocol or expanded protocol will be
      submitted to the Ethics Committee for approval.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of chronic HCV infection, defined as:

        Positive anti-HCV antibody or detectable HCV RNA or HCV genotype at least 6 months before
        screening and HCV viral load ≥104 IU/mL at the time of screening In subjects without
        documented HCV test results 6 months before screening, chronic hepatitis C infection can be
        assumed if risk exposures occurred &gt; 6 months prior to screening and HCV viral load ≥104
        IU/mL at the time of screening.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Men and women age ≥ 18 years and &lt; 70 years.

             able to complete the study schedule of assessments.

          -  Women with a negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline.

          -  Women of child bearing potential who accept effective contraception from 2 weeks prior
             to study day 1 until 1 month post-treatment (Double contraceptive method including at
