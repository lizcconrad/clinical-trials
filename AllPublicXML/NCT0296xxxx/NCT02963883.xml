  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative erythrocytes transfusion is associated with morbidity and excess mortality,
      which should lead to ask the indication for RBC transfusions only on metabolic needs.
      Currently, the majority of studies used to put hemoglobin values indicating red cell
      transfusions. Two observational studies have confirmed that a transfusion strategy based on a
      metabolic index (ScvO2) individual was accompanied by a different transfusion strategy than
      using the hemoglobin threshold values. We propose to conduct the first randomized multicenter
      study to evaluate erythrocyte transfusion strategy in postoperative cardiac surgery using the
      ScvO2 each patient versus a threshold value usually recommended for all patients.
