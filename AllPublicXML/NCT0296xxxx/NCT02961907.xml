  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected
      intercourse, It affects approximately one in six couples pregnancy. Many lifestyle factors of
      the couple's pre and peri-conceptional environment (weight, diet, alcohol, tobacco, coffee,
      drugs, exercise, stress, sleep, pollution...) are risk factors for infertility. Weight gain,
      in both members of the couple, is associated with an increased risk of Assisted Reproduction
      Technology (ART) failure and adverse pregnancy outcome, while healthy lifestyle makes the
      risk of infertility three times less likely to happen. Idiopathic infertility may greatly
      benefit from lifestyle factors optimization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate and optimize periconceptional habits (diet and lifestyle factors) of unfertile
      couple may have favorable impact on conception and pregnancy.

      The investigators propose to undertake a controlled trial of the efficiency of an integrated
      global care program. This trial of an intervention on lifestyle factors will be compared with
      the &quot;&quot;cohort multiple randomised controlled trial&quot;&quot; methodology in order to strengthen
      external validity by limiting bias that may result from initial consent to randomisation, or
      from deception of allocated treatment.

      Firstly, at their first visit in any participating ART center, all attending couples will be
      invited to participate in an observational survey in order to allow access to their data. In
      this whole cohort, all eligible couples will be identified as consultations go. An &quot;&quot;on the
      fly&quot;&quot; randomisation process (ration 2 usual / 1 experimental) will select candidate couples
      from all eligible ones, who will be ten offered the experimental PEPCI intervention. In case
      of refusal of the experimental care, they will be given the usual care.
