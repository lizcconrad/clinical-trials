  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of project is to answer fundamental questions about the mechanisms underlying
      mental stress ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease, mood disorders, or both, and
      to identify potential biomarkers and psychosocial risk factors associated with this
      condition.

      To achieve this goal, investigators will use cutting-edge cardiovascular and functional
      neuroimaging tools to study mental stress ischemia in a carefully controlled laboratory
      setting in subjects recruited from four patient populations: 1) patients who recently
      sustained a myocardial infarction; 2) patients undergoing non-emergent invasive coronary
      angiography (with and without known coronary artery disease); 3) patients with a diagnosis of
      major depressive disorder; and 4) patients with a diagnosis of bipolar 1 or bipolar 2
      disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental stress ischemia occurs when a psychosocial or mental stressor triggers an imbalance
      between the supply and demand for oxygen by cardiac myocytes. Epidemiological studies
      indicate that mental stress ischemia is common, occurring in 20-25% of patients with coronary
      artery disease (CAD) and portends a poor prognosis. The underlying mechanisms are thought to
      involve stress-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system and associated effects on
      cardiovascular function. But how neurobiological and cardiovascular factors interact to
      generate mental stress ischemia is unknown. Furthermore, patients with major depressive
      disorder, bipolar disorder, and other stress-related psychiatric conditions have elevated
      rates of cardiovascular co-morbidities, including sudden cardiac death, yet mental stress
      ischemia has not been studied extensively in these psychiatric populations. The purpose of
      project is to answer fundamental questions about the mechanisms underlying mental stress
      ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease, mood disorders, or both, and to identify
      potential biomarkers and psychosocial risk factors associated with this condition.

      To achieve this goal, investigators will use cutting-edge cardiovascular and functional

      angiography (with and without known coronary artery disease); 3) patients with a diagnosis of
      major depressive disorder; and 4) patients with a diagnosis of bipolar 1 or bipolar 2

        Inclusion Criteria for Psychiatric Subjects

          1. Male and female subjects, ages 50 years or more

          2. Must be fluent English-speakers due to the design of the mental stress tasks. Able to
             provide informed consent.

          3. Subjects who are stable and meet DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive
             disorder, bipolar 1 disorder, or bipolar 2 disorder, as assessed in an initial
             screening interview by phone and confirmed by a structured clinical interview on the
             first day of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria for Psychiatric Subjects:

          1. Subjects with a history of seizure disorder, stroke, Parkinson's disease, any form of
             dementia, or head injury resulting in loss of consciousness will be excluded from this
             study.

          2. Contraindications to MRI be assessed during the screening interview and again using
             the NY-Presbyterian Hospital MRI Checklist prior to scanning and will also serve as
             exclusion criteria. They include claustrophobia; a history of metal implants
             (including braces, orthopedic implant, cochlear implant, implanted cardiac pacemaker,
             implanted cardioverter defibrillator, and ocular implant); weight over 250 pounds
             (owing to the size of the MR scanner bore); and women who are currently pregnant or
             breastfeeding.

          3. Subjects who indicate that there is a chance that they may be pregnant will be asked
             to take a pregnancy test. They will be informed of the potential for false positive
             results due to diet, vitamins, and supplements, or over-the-counter medications. A
             positive pregnancy test will necessitate exclusion from the study, and the results
             will be disclosed to the participant.

          4. Patients who are currently being treated with a beta blocker or daily (standing)
             benzodiazepines will be excluded, unless, in the judgment of the prescribing
             physician, the dose can be withheld on the morning of the each study session, due to
             the potential for these medications to mask neurobiological and cardiovascular
             responses to mental stress.

          5. Investigators will also assess for additional psychiatric exclusion criteria during
             the screening interview and structured clinical interview: patients with bipolar 1
             disorder who are currently manic; patients with any mood disorder currently
             complicated by hallucinations, delusions, or other psychotic features; patients with
             active suicidal ideation; and patients meeting DSM-V criteria for a co-morbid
             substance abuse disorder within the last 12 months will all be excluded. Other
             psychiatric co-morbidities will be permitted.

        Subjects who meet both the psychiatric and cardiac inclusion criteria will also be enrolled
        in the study.
