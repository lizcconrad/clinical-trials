  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine changes in older insomniacs' cognitive functioning following
      behavioral treatment for insomnia using a combination of two methods. A traditional repeated
      measures design will be used to look at group level differences based on performance on a
      neuropsychological battery administered prior to, immediately after, and 3 months after
      completing a 4 week behavioral treatment program for insomnia. This data will be analyzed
      using standard repeated measures analytic techniques. A time-series design will also be used
      to look at within-subject differences based on a brief cognitive battery that will be
      self-administered on a daily basis. Data from this daily battery will be examined using
      intraindividual variability modeling.

    <description>Participants will complete a daily sleep dairies throughout the study period. They will report their bedtime, waketime, sleep onset latency, and wake time after sleep onset. Total sleep time and total wake time will be calculated from the diaries.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in actigraphy-assessed sleep variability from baseline to follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to follow-up, approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants wore an Actiwatch-L (ACTL) (Mini Mitter Co., Inc.) on their non-dominant wrists continuously throughout the study. The sensor of the ACTL is sampled 32 times per second and records peak values for each second. These peak values are then summed into 30-second &quot;activity&quot; counts. These activity counts are downloaded to a personal computer and analyzed using Actiware-Sleep v. 3.3, which uses a validated algorithm to identify periods of as sleep or wake. Total sleep time and total wake time will be computed.</description>

    <description>Treatment will consist of 4 weekly, 1 hour sessions and will be conducted by a trained graduate assistant on an individual basis. Treatment components will include education about aging and sleep. It will also include instruction in techniques designed to: (a) promote good sleep habits, (b) restrict the use of the bed and bedroom to sleep and sleep-conducive activities, (c) modify bed and wake times to better match the participants sleep needs, and (d) promote relaxation. Daily home practice of these techniques will be encouraged. Participants will maintain logs of their home practice sessions and will continue to record their daily sleep habits throughout treatment.</description>
