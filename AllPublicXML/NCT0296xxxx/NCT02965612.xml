  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent interest that the Specific Immunotherapy (ITS) has aroused is due to the positive
      potential role that could be played, in particular in the forms of allergic asthma, because
      this method constitute the only intervention (unlike that pharmacologic) able to act on the
      same causes of the disease, altering the natural history. To achieve this the investigator
      has tried to use the specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), to which there are studies
      that, with scientific rigor, have demonstrated the benefits.

      The Investigator proposes to compare, in children with allergic rhinitis and / or allergic
      asthma to grasses, the pain caused by the administration of the Specific Immunotherapy (ITS)
      via epicutaneous with autoinjector (INJEX) pressure without needle vs. the traditional
      subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT).
