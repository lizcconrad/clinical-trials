  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intramuscular injection of 40 μg hepatitis B vaccine in a standard three-dose schedule or a
      four-dose schedule is recommended for hemodialysis patients. However, seroconversion rates
      are inadequate and persistence of immunity remains a challenge.

      This is a randomized, controlled trial. The study will evaluate the immunogenicity, immune
      persistence, and safety of 20 µg and 60 µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine with three
      injections at months 0, 1, and 6 in hemodialysis patients.

      Participants are randomized in a ratio of 1:1 into 20 µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine
      group or 60µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine group.The 20 µg group will receive three
      intramuscular injections of the 20 µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, while the 60 µg group
      will receive three intramuscular injections of the 60 µg dose at months 0, 1 and 6,
      respectively. HBsAg and anti-HBs will be tested during the study period. Adverse reactions
      will be recorded after vaccination.
