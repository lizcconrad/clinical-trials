  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to gain insight in the early dynamics and mechanisms of
      recovery of liver disease and sex steroid metabolism during weight loss in obese men and
      women and to investigate whether surgical weight loss has differential effects as compared to
      weight loss with life style measures. In addition, we want to evaluate the postprandial
      hypoglycemic reactive syndrome (PPHRS) in these patients using a standard chewable meal.

      Secondary objectives are investigating determinants for the changes in sex steroids, liver
      disease and PPHRS. Possible determinants to be investigated are adipocytokine secretion
      patterns, body composition, resting metabolism rate, weight loss per se and changes in fat
      distribution, parameters of fatty acid metabolism, … .
