    <textblock>
      The AMPLATZER LAA Occluder is a transcatheter, self-expanding nitinol device intended for use
      in preventing thrombus embolization from the LAA. The purpose of this study is to compile
      real world outcome data on the use of AMPLATZER LAA Occluder in subjects with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF)

      The AMPLATZER LAA Occluder device will be clinically evaluated through this post approval
      study. This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized observational post-approval study,
      on patients who will undergo an implant of the AMPLATZER LAA Occluder.

    <description>The AMPLATZER™ LAA Occluder is intended to prevent thrombus embolization from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients who have nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (AF). It may be considered for use in patients who have a high risk of stroke and bleeding and are deemed by their physician to have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to long term anticoagulants.</description>
