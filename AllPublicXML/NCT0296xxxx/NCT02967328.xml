  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immature platelets—also termed reticulated platelets (RP)—are platelets newly released into
      the circulation, and have been associated with a variety of pathological bleeding events
      including primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). They can be assessed by flow cytometry (FCM)
      after staining with thiazole orange (TO) at low concentration and expressed as a fraction of
      the total platelet count (RP%). The diagnosis of primary ITP is based on differential
      diagnosis and the measurement of RP% can serve as an alternative diagnostic test that are
      useful in daily practice. Our study aimed at distinguishing primary ITP from other
      thrombocytopenic disorders, especially aplstic (hypoplastic) or chemotherapy-induced
      thrombocytopenia by FCM. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay as well as agreement
      between RP% measurement and monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet antigen
      (MAIPA) were analyzed accordingly.

      The investigators are undertaking a multi-center, prospective blind trial of 500 adults with
      thrombocytopenic disorders with a platelet count less than 60*10^9/L from 4 medical centers
      in China. In brief, 15 μl aliquots of anti-coagulated whole blood were incubated for 70 min
      with 5 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD42b monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, Tokyo,
      Japan) and 1 ml of thiazole orange (Retic-COUNT; Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) diluted
      10 times by phosphate-buffered saline. RP% was analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACScan,
      Becton-Dickinson) by measuring 10,000 events in the CD42b-positive fraction.

      Clinical information of all participants including gender, age, platelet count and definitive
      diagnosis were recorded by an exclusive investigator. RP% results were revealed at the end of
      recruitment and after all FCM measurements were completed. The agreement between clinical
      diagnosis and RP% results were analyzed to identify primary ITP.
