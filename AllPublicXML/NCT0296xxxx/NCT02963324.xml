  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of Ivermectin (IVM) in healthy human
      volunteers and aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. Planned
      indication is the prevention of malaria transmission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug. Recent research indicates that IVM
      could potentially be used in malaria vector control.

      The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of IVM in healthy human volunteers and
      aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. This model will be used to
      characterize enterohepatic circulation, serve as a basis for drug-drug and drug-disease-state
      interaction studies, and simulations of IVM disposition in different populations, with
      special regard given to adolescents and children. With this, safety in individual
      administrations can be increased, and mass drug administration programs, e.g. oral IVM as
      malaria vector control, be simulated and planned to maximize the share of a population that
      can be included. Capillary blood concentration profiles will also be determined to assess the
      amount of IVM delivered to mosquitos in malaria vector control programs. Furthermore, this
      study will validate dried blood spot analytics of IVM which will allow easier procurement of
      pharmacokinetics (PK) data in the field.
