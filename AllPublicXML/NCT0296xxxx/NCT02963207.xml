      OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to compare a recently-developed endoscopic classification with an
      established one for colorectal lesions in a randomised trial between 2013 and 2015.

      OBJECTIVE: Current practice requires histopathological assessment to confirm diagnosis for
      colorectal lesions detected at colonoscopy. Advances in endoscopic imaging contribute for
      real-time diagnosis which, apart from being cost and time-saving, also guides decision-making
      and reduces risks. Our study aimed to compare a recently-developed endoscopic classification
      with an established one.

      DESIGN: The modified Sano's classification (MS) was compared to the Narrow Band Imaging (NBI)
      International Colorectal Endoscopic classification (NICE) in a randomised trial between 2013
      and 2015. An experimented endoscopist classified each polyp, what was compared to
      histopathology.
