    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of a prophylactic dose of ondansetron in decreasing the
      incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in cardiac surgery patients after cessation
      of post-operative sedation. In patients who have undergone open heart surgery, a single
      prophylactic dose of ondansetron 4 mg IV given at the time of discontinuing propofol sedation
      will result in a 50% reduction of the rate of post-operative nausea and vomiting in the first
      24 post-operative hours compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a significant source of morbidity for patients
      undergoing general anesthesia, and in particular, patients undergoing cardiac anesthesia.
      Despite its common occurrence, literature on PONV prophylaxis in the cardiac surgical
      population is limited relative to other surgical populations.

      A rational approach to preventing PONV would be to administer prophylaxis prior to extubation
      once post-operative sedation has ceased. This timing of administration would be more
      standardized across patients, as duration of surgery and time of extubation after surgery can
      vary considerably, rendering plasma levels of PONV prophylaxis agents highly variable across
      patients.

      At St. Paul's Hospital, PONV prophylaxis has not been a routine part of cardiac anesthesia
      care. Furthermore, there are no standardized guidelines, and practice varies between care
      providers. Following surgery, patients recover from anesthesia and are extubated in the
      cardiac surgery ICU (CSICU). They are usually sedated on a propofol infusion for one to four
      hours after surgery until they are ready for extubation. When PONV occurs, the first line
      drug for treatment is ondansetron 4 mg. The investigators therefore propose the use of a
      single, prophylactic dose of ondansetron (4 mg IV), given at the time of propofol cessation.
      A randomized, double blinded placebo controlled model will be utilized
