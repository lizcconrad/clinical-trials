  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial involving 30 individuals submitted to ACL reconstruction will be
      conducted.

      Participants will be randomized into: Group I, submitted to a muscular rehabilitation program
      based on eccentric isokinetic exercise; and Group II, submitted to a muscular rehabilitation
      program based on eccentric isotonic exercise. Concomitantly with the muscular rehabilitation
      protocols, individuals will undergo the same physiotherapeutic protocol with analgesia, edema
      reduction, range of motion, proprioception and functionality goals. Muscle rehabilitation
      programs based on eccentric isotonic and isokinetic exercise will begin 45 days after ACL
      reconstruction. The programs will last six weeks, with training frequency of two sessions per
      week, separated by a minimum interval of 72 hours.
