  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a
      medication, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), used to treat individuals with chronic hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) in Rwandan adults. A sub-cohort of participants will have limited laboratory
      monitoring to determine the minimum laboratory tests necessary.

      This is an open-label single arm study that will evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir fixed dose combination administered for 12 weeks in HCV
      treatment-naive and treatment-experienced participants with chronic genotype 1 or 4 HCV
      infection. Approximately 240 participants will be enrolled and treated with sofosbuvir (SOF)
      400 mg/LDV 90 mg fixed dose combination (FDC) one tablet once daily for 12 weeks in the
      SHARED 1 study. Sixty additional participants will be enrolled in the SHARED 2 sub-cohort
      with laboratory monitoring blinded to study clinicians.
