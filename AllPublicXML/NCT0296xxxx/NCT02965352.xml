  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has developed a peripheral to quantify the functional strength of children without
      motor change during the movement of grip and pinch. It was possible to know the exact values
      of these strengths, the range of motion that was made, and also if the grip strength was
      maintained during all the arc of motion.

      Since childhood, it has been necessary to produce sufficient force to grip and pinch, for
      performing daily tasks independently; therefore, measurements of these forces end up being
      useful markers to evaluate the performance and the physical development of the child. It was
      developed a peripheral containing three devices and instrumented for analyzing the force
      applied during execution of the cylindrical grip movement, pinch pulp-side and pinch
      pulp-pulp in different situations of the daily life of the volunteer. The data acquisition
      interface was developed in a software for data recording. For the peripheral functionality
      tests, thirty volunteers of both genders were selected. They were also students of the Sports
      Secretary, with no motor abnormalities, between seven and ten years old.

    <description>The force of cylindrical grip movement was measured through a door handle device, pinch pulp-side through a door key and pinch pulp-pulp movement through a switch. The test was measured 3 times with 1 minute interval and it was measured the strength during all arc of motion. Unit of measurement: Newton (N).</description>
