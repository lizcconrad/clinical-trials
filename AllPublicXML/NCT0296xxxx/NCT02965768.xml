  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to test if naltrexone, when taken in low doses, has an
      anti-inflammatory effect that may be associated with positive clinical outcomes in people
      with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). In part, the present study, is a continuation of prior
      work in which we showed that chronic fatigue symptoms are associated with immune activity,
      and that low-dose naltrexone might exert anti-inflammatory effects in fibromyalgia, which is
      thought to share some pathophysiological and clinical characteristics with CFS.

An encrypted and password-protected database will contain (1) information about individual group assignment, and (2) blister pack codes (medication will be dispensed in blister packs by investigators based on these codes). An investigator not involved with data collection or participant interactions will randomly assign individuals to the treatment group and provide blister pack ID codes for each individual.</masking_description>
