      The objective of the REPRISE EDGE 29 mm EU study is to evaluate performance and safety of the
      29 mm LOTUS Edge™ Valve System for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in
      symptomatic subjects with calcific, severe native aortic stenosis who are considered at
      extreme or high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).

             valve area (AVA) of ≤1.0 cm2 (or AVA index of ≤0.6 cm2/m2) and either a mean pressure
             gradient ≥40 mm Hg or a jet velocity ≥4 m/s, as measured by echocardiography and/or
             invasive hemodynamics.

          2. Subject has a documented aortic annulus size of ≥27 mm and ≤29 mm based on the site's
             assessment of pre-procedure diagnostic imaging (and confirmed by the Case Review

          3. Subject has symptomatic aortic valve stenosis with NYHA Functional Class ≥ II.

          4. There is agreement by the heart team (which must include a site investigator
             interventionalist and a site investigator cardiac surgeon) that subject is at high or
             extreme operative risk for surgical valve replacement (see Note 5 below for
             definitions of extreme and high risk, the required level of surgical assessment, and
             CRC confirmation) and that TAVR is appropriate.

             Additionally, subject has at least one of the following:

               -  Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score ≥8% -OR-

               -  If STS &lt;8, subject has at least one of the following conditions:

                    -  Hostile chest

                    -  Porcelain aorta

                    -  Severe pulmonary hypertension (&gt;60 mmHg)

                       aortic valve replacement

                    -  Childs Class A or B liver disease (subjects with Childs Class C disease are
                       not eligible for inclusion in this trial)

                    -  Frailty as indicated by at least one of the following: 5‑meter walk &gt;6

                    -  Other evidence that subject is at high or extreme risk for surgical valve
                       replacement (CRC must confirm agreement with site heart team that subject
                       meets high or extreme risk definition)

             Note 5: Risk of operative mortality and morbidity must be assessed via an in-person
             evaluation by a site cardiac surgeon and must be confirmed by the CRC (which must
             include an experienced cardiac surgeon). Extreme operative risk and high operative
             risk are defined as follows:

             Extreme Operative Risk: Predicted operative mortality or serious, irreversible
             morbidity risk ≥50% at 30 days.

             High Operative Risk: Predicted operative mortality or serious, irreversible morbidity
             risk ≥15% at 30 days.

          5. Heart team (which must include a cardiac interventionalist and an experienced cardiac
             surgeon) agrees that the subject is likely to benefit from valve replacement.

          6. Subject (or legal representative) understands the study requirements and the treatment
             procedures, and provides written informed consent.

          7. Subject, family member and/or legal representative agree(s) and subject is capable of
             returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits.

             atrioventricular block) that in the opinion of the treating physician is clinically
             significant and requires a pacemaker implantation (based on the latest available ESC
             guidelines). Enrollment is permissible after permanent pacemaker implantation.
