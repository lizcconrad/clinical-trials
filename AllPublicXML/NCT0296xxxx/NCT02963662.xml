  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and related metabolic disease has become a threat
      to our national life and health which is showing a trend. Bariatric Surgery had been
      confirmed definite therapeutic effect to obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, laparoscopic
      gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy have the similar outcome to type 2
      diabetes, but the two surgical methods and principles are completely different, which
      mechanisms are not yet clear. Lots of literature report adipose tissue releases adipokines
      and inflammatory cytokines induced chronic inflammation and obesity-related complications
      (insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes).It is not clear whether to change these
      gastrointestinal hormones, adipokines and secretion of inflammatory cytokines with the
      operation, which play a therapeutic effect of obesity-related complications and diabetes. In
      addition, the investigators are wonder whether gut hormones, adipokines and inflammatory
      cytokines have some correlation in different severity obese patients,. It is worth to explore
      that could intestinal hormones, adipokines and inflammatory factors levels guide us to choice
      the different surgical approach to different severity obese patients. The investigators tried
      to investigate different surgical methods to alleviate diabetes and other metabolic diseases
      mechanisms though hormones and inflammatory factors and adipose tissue inflammation level and
      compare the impact of intestinal hormones and inflammatory adipokines of the two surgical
      approaches.
