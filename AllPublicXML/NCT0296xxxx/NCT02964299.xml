    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of mandibular advancement bite block to
      standard bite block for prevention of hypoxemia, intervention events and adverse effects
      during endoscopic examinations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During endoscopic examinations, especially upper gastrointestinal, bile duct, or
      bronchoscopic examinations, the endoscope need to be placed through the mouth. A bite block
      is used to protect vulnerable endoscope and protect patient's teeth. During sedative
      endoscopic exams, respiratory depression, apnea or upper airway obstruction will occur under
      the influence of the sedative medications. Serious adverse events may occur such as
      hypoxemia. A nasal airway, Larson's maneuver, jaw thrust or chin lift may be needed to open
      airways.

      Mandibular advancement devices has been widely used in treating obstructive sleep apnea. A
      modified bite block that provides mandibular advancement could provide entry inlet of
      endoscope as well as provide mandibular advancement to provide patent airway during sedative
      endoscopy. In this study, we group the patients into test group using mandibular advancement
      bite block and a control group using standard bite block. After anesthetic induction, gastric
      endoscopy was performed. Degree of upper airway obstruction will be evaluated and recorded.
      Differences between the two groups will be evaluated.
