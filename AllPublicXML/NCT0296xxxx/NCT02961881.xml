      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of every 12 hours (q12h) and every 24 hours (q24h)
      administration of subcutaneous (SC) blinatumomab

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) with continuous intravenous (cIV) and SC
           administrations

        -  To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) tested for blinatumomab administered
           subcutaneously

        -  To determine the incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation following SC
           administration

        -  To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration

      Exploratory Objective:

        -  To determine the pharmacodynamics (PD) time profiles for B-and T-lymphocytes as well as
           cytokine profiles during SC administration

        -  To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration
           using Lugano criteria

             uncontrolled systemic fungal bacteria, viral, or other infection, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  A female who is pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed
             during treatment and for an additional 48 hours (Period 1) or 72 hours (Period 2),

             potential should only be included in the study after a confirmed menstrual period and
             a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test).
