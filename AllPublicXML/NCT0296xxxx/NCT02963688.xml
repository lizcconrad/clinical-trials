      PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and clinical correlation of the germline BRCA 1/2
      mutation in Korean patients with high grade(HG) serous and/or endometrioid epithelial ovarian
      cancer (EOC).

      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a nationwide case-control study on EOC conducted in Korea between
      2010 and 2015, 298 Korean women with HG serous and/or endometrioid EOC were tested for gBRCA
      1/2 mutation, regardless of the family history. Mutation screening was performed using the
      Ion AmpliSeq BRCA 1/2 Panel (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Ion PGM platform
      according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clinical characteristics including survival
      outcome was assessed in gBRCAm carriers.
