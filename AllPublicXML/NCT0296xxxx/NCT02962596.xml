  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is targeting patients with sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass that are
      being referred for clinical MR imaging. Investigators from the UW will be contributing coded
      MR images and associated health information (US results, laboratory/pathology results) to the
      EURAD trial. In addition, outcomes data on each patient will be sent at month 24 of the
      research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An adnexal mass is the most common indication for gynaecological surgery. Pre operative
      characterization is crucial and a scoring system would be useful to standardize the imaging
      report and thus, improve patients management. Recently, the coordinating center developed the
      first MR scoring system named ANDEXMR SCORING system in a retrospective study which is
      accurate and reproducible. The objectives of this trial are to perform an external
      prospective validation of this scoring system to evaluate its potential impact on therapeutic
      strategy and to test its reproducibility.

      This is a prospective large multicenter study. All patients with a sonographically
      indeterminate adnexal mass referred for MR imaging will be included from each participating
      center. One senior and one junior radiologists independently analyze the different MR
      criteria to characterize adnexal masses. The reader will then classify the mass using ADNEXMR
      SCORING system.
