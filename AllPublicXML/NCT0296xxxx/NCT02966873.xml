  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled Phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in reducing Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) severity and Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptomatology among individuals with current AUD and PTSD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed Phase II study is to evaluate the effects of
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC), in reducing (1) Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) severity and (2) Post
      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptomatology among individuals (N=200) with current AUD
      and PTSD. We will also use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate the neural circuitry and neurochemistry
      underlying comorbid AUD/PTSD and prognostic indicators of positive treatment response.
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of NAC on impairment in associated areas of
      functioning (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep, risky behaviors). In order to accomplish this
      we will (1) employ an intent-to-treat, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled
      trial that will consist of 12 weeks of treatment with NAC (2400 mg per day) or placebo
      medication; (2) examine standardized, repeated dependent measures of clinical outcomes at
      baseline, week 6, week 12, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up; and (3) employ advanced
      neuroimaging methodologies, a laboratory cue paradigm, and collect biologic measures of
      alcohol consumption. All participants will also undergo weekly individual cognitive behavior
      therapy sessions (CBT).The following specific aims are proposed:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as compared to placebo,
      in reducing alcohol use severity (i.e., total standard drinks, percent days drinking,
      abstinence rates) and craving.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as compared to placebo,
      in reducing self-report and clinician-rated PTSD symptomatology.

      Specific Aim 3: To use multimodal neuroimaging techniques to investigate the pathophysiology
      underlying AUD and comorbid PTSD, and prognostic indicators of treatment outcome.

      The proposed study will answer critical questions regarding the potential of NAC as an
      effective pharmacotherapy for AUD and comorbid PTSD, and elucidate possible mechanisms
      underlying improved outcomes. This study has the particular advantage of building directly on
      positive preliminary findings by (1) further testing NAC in the treatment of individuals with
      co-occurring AUD/PTSD using a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design; (2)
      measuring functioning in related areas, such as depression and risky behaviors; (3) employing
      innovative measurements including neuroimaging and laboratory cue paradigms; and (4)
      employing a multidisciplinary team of experts who have successfully collaborated in the past
      and are uniquely qualified to implement this type of investigation. This project is directly
      responsive to the mission of the National Institute of Alcohol and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the
      new AUD/PTSD initiative in that it seeks to evaluate a promising therapeutic agent for the
      treatment of AUD/PTSD and identify neurobiological mechanisms common to AUD/PTSD as potential
      treatment targets. The findings from this study have the potential to significantly improve
      the standard of patient care, advance the comorbidity science in this area, and decrease
      public health expenditures associated with AUD and comorbid PTSD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female; any race or ethnicity; age 18 to 70 years old.

          2. Subjects must be able to comprehend English.

          3. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria for current Alcohol Use
             Disorder (AUD).

          4. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria for current Post Traumatic
             Stress Disorder (PTSD). Subjects may also meet criteria for a mood disorder (except
             bipolar affective disorder, see Exclusion Criteria) or other anxiety disorders (panic
             disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive
             compulsive disorder). The inclusion of subjects with affective and other anxiety
             disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of the co-existence of mood and
             other anxiety disorders among patients with AUD and PTSD (Brady et al., 2000; Kessler
             et al., 2005). Subjects may meet DSM-5 criteria for another substance use disorder as
             long as AUD is the primary substance of choice.

          5. Subjects taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a stable
             dose for at least four weeks before treatment initiation. This is because initiation
             or change of medications during the course of the trial may interfere with
             interpretation of results.

          6. Must consent to random assignment to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or placebo.

          7. Must consent to complete all treatment and follow-up visits.

          8. Must live within 50 miles (one hour) of Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in
             Charleston, SC.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for a history of or current psychotic or bipolar
             affective disorders, as the study protocol may be therapeutically insufficient.

          2. Subjects with a current eating disorder (bulimia, anorexia nervosa) or with
             dissociative identity disorder, as they are likely to require specific time-intensive
             psychotherapy.

          3. Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, as evidence by a score of 10 or
             above on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA). These
             subjects will be referred for clinical detoxification and may be re-assessed for study
             eligibility after medically supervised detoxification has been completed.

          4. Individuals considered an immediate suicide risk or who are likely to require
             hospitalization during the course of the study for suicidality..

          5. Women who are pregnant, nursing or not practicing an effective form of birth control.

          6. Evidence of liver failure; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal; asthma
             or any clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator would adversely affect safety or study participation.

          7. Use of carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, methotrexate, 6 azauridine triacetate,
             or nitroglycerin within the last 14 days or any other medication felt to have a
             hazardous interaction if taken with NAC.

          8. History of childhood or adult seizures of any cause
