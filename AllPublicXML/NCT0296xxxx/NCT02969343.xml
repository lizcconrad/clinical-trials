  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Patient Safety Learning Laboratory (PSLL) focuses on
      developing health information technology (HIT) tools to engage patients, family, and
      professional care team members in reliable identification, assessment, and reduction of
      patient safety threats in real-time, before they manifest in actual harm.

    <textblock>
      The Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Patient Safety Learning Laboratory (PSLL) will develop
      systems approaches to integrating health information technology (HIT), stakeholder engagement
      mechanisms, and process design/engineering methods focused on patient safety, development and
      enhancement of tools, health care system interventions, and translation into practice. The
      three technological toolkits to be developed as part of the Patient Safety Learning
      Laboratory (PSLL) are:1) Patient-centered Fall Prevention Toolkit which aims to engage
      patients and their family caregivers in the design of HIT tools to prevent patient falls and
      related injuries during an acute hospitalization; 2) Patient Safety Checklist Tool to improve
      patient safety and quality outcomes, provider efficiency, and team communication; and 3)
      MySafeCare Patient Safety Reporting System which aims to iteratively develop and evaluate the
      impact of a patient safety reporting system on patient safety and fosters a health system
      focused on collaborative learning. The Brigham and Women's Patient Safety Learning Laboratory
      (BWH PSLL) will establish a vibrant learning ecosystem of health services, informatics, and
      systems engineering researchers, collaborating with patients and family for evolving and
      applying these approaches to adverse event prevention in hospitalized patients. In addition,
      a Systems Engineering, Usability, and Integration (SEUI) Core will leverage health systems
      engineering approaches to develop and provide a system-wide methodology to aid in the
      successful implementation and improvement of Health Information Technology (HIT) tools and a
      model known as the Patient SatisfActiveÂ® will be developed, tested, and refined to create a
      culture of patient- and family-centered care.
