        This is a descriptive study designed to examine in-market utilisation of liraglutide; thus
        there will be no hypothesis testing and a power calculation is not applicable. 100 patients
        will be enrolled for the pilot study (50 in each country, ) and additionally 300 patients
        will be enrolled for the full study (150 in each country)
