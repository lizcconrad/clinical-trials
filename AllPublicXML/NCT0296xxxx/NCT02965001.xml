  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide. In the last decade, there
      has been made substantial improvements in diagnosis, staging and treatment of HNC. The
      overall survival has improved, but for some subgroups it is unchanged and therefore new
      prognostic and surveillance methods are warranted.

      One of the hallmarks in cancer is the ability to invade the surrounding tissue and
      metastasize. Studies have shown that the urokinase proteolytic plasminogen activator (uPA)
      and its receptor (uPAR) are present at the very front of the invasive tumor and they are
      considered essential in cancer invasion and metastasis. Consequently, an uPAR-targeted tracer
      offers a very promising target for functional PET imaging and may be a stronger prognostic
      marker compared to routine FDG-PET/CT. We wish to clarify how uPAR-PET/CT correlate to
      patient outcome compared to routine FDG-PET/CT in patients with HNC in the pharynx, larynx
      and oral cavity, who are referred to curative intended radiotherapy. In this project all
      participants have an uPAR-PET/CT scan performed before initiation of the routine radiotherapy
      and the prognostic efficacy is determined by assessment of the recurrence rate and mortality
      at routine clinical follow-up.

      In this study all included patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) have an uPAR-PET/CT scan
      performed before the initiation of the curative intended radiotherapy. After the radiotherapy
      treatment the patients attend the routine clinical follow-up programme at Rigshospitalet to
      follow the loco-regional control, signs of metastasis and the overall survival. These
      relapse- and survival parameters will be correlated to the SUVmax, SUVmean and the TNM stage
      obtained from the uPAR scan and will be compared to the findings on the routine FDG scan to
      clarify which tracer is the strongest prognostic marker in HNC.

      If any previous tissue samples have been taken from the tumour before the patient enters the
      study the uPAR immunohistopathology of the tissue sample will be compared to the uPAR-PET/CT
      findings. We will not perform any biopsies or tissue samples in this study.
