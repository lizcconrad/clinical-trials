  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To perform a study that investigates the effectiveness of adding the SGLT2 inhibitor
      dapagliflozin + the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor saxagliptin vs placebo to revert
      from a BBIT regimen to a BOT regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase IV study investigating the efficacy and safety of adding the SGLT2
      inhibitor dapagliflozin together wih the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin to an intensified
      insulin treatment regimen. Because BOT is superior to BBIT in respect to the development of
      bodyweight, hypoglycaemia and patient satisfaction in type 2 diabetes, we hypothesize that
      the combined addition of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with the DPP-4 inhibitor
      saxagliptin is effective and safe to revert from a BBIT to a BOT treatment regimen.
