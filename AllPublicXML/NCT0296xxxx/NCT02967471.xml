    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has a very poor prognosis and high mortality. To
      improve the early diagnosis of ARDS, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers of ARDS.
      This project aims to detect novel biomarkers from peripheral blood , which can improve the
      early diagnosis and develop a more efficient therapy to enhance ARDS patient survival rate.
      Clinical data and blood sample were recorded before treatment and after treatment. Acute
      Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) scores were calculated at
      enrolment. Different kinds of lymphocytes from blood samples would be detected by flow
      cytometry ,which could be used for discovering high sensitivity and specificity ARDS
      biomarker.
