    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether training teacher and staff in the Incredible
      Years (IY) Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) program reduce behavior problems and promote
      social competence in student aged 6-8 years (school) and in children aged 3-6 year
      (day-care). To examine group differences from baseline to 8-9 months after, a
      quasi-experimental control group design with pre- and post-measurements was used.

      Evaluation of the Incredible Years (IY) Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) program
      implemented as a school-wide preventive intervention in regular school and day-care settings,
      have the potential to change negative behaviors in children aged 3 - 8 year. Forty-four
      schools were recruited; comprising 1518 students aged 6-8 year, and 91 day-care units
      comprising 1049 children aged 3-6 year. Multilevel analyzes were used to examine group
      differences pre-post changes for behavior problems measured with the Sutter-Eyberg Student
      Behavior Inventory-Revised (SESBI-R) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF), as well as group
      differences pre-post change for social behavior measured the Social Skills Rating System
      (SSRS). For secondary findings, group differences pre-post changes for teacher- student and
      teacher-children relationship were measured with the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale
      (STRS) (teachers N= 444), and teacher-parents interactions were measured with the
      Teacher-Parent Involvement Questionnaire (INVOLVE-T/P) (parents N = 2109), as well as group
      differences pre-post change for teachers self- and collective efficacy measured the Norwegian
      Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale (NTSES) and the Collective Efficacy Scale (CES) (teachers N =
      3240).
