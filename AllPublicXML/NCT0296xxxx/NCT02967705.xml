    <textblock>
      This cluster randomized waiting-list controlled pilot study will evaluate the effectiveness
      of pain management group activity organized by the OH on pain intensity and associated
      disability, and co-occurrence of mental or sleep problem in patients with chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is very prevalent among the working population causing a considerable amount of work
      disability days. Pain management group therapy has shown to have a significant effect on
      chronic pain. However, little is know of the effect of such therapy on work disability. There
      are especially very few studies prescribing the effectiveness of pain management groups
      provided by the occupational health service.
