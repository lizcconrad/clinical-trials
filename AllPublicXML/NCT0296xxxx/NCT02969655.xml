    <textblock>
      Daprodustat is a drug that is currently being developed as a treatment for renal anemia .
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daprodustat following a switch from
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) in Japanese HD subjects with renal anemia who are
      currently treated with ESA. The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of
      daprodustat to darbepoetin alfa. This study is a 52-week, Phase III, double-blind,
      active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study. The total duration of the study will
      be approximately 58 weeks including screening and follow-up.
