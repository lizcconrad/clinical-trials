    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase II study to
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ARGX-113 for the treatment of
      autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis (MG) with generalized muscle weakness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized in most cases by T cell and
      antibody responses to neuromuscular junction proteins such as skeletal muscle nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Antibodies against epitopes of the AChR of the neuromuscular
      junction cause failure of neuromuscular transmission, resulting in the characteristic fatigue
      and weakness associated with this severe disorder.

      The study will evaluate an innovative candidate in MG.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed
             consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related health
             information), and comply with the study protocol procedures (including required study
             visits).

          -  Male or female patients aged ≥18 years.

          -  Diagnosis of autoimmune MG with generalized muscle weakness meeting the clinical
             criteria for diagnosis of MG as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America
             (MGFA) Clinical Classification Class II, III, or IVa, and likely not in need of a
             respirator for the duration of the study as judged by the Investigator.

        The confirmation of the diagnosis should be documented and supported by:

          -  Positive serologic test for anti-AChR antibodies before Screening and

          -  at least 1 of the following 3 tests: (i) History of abnormal neuromuscular
             transmission test demonstrated by single-fiber electromyography or repetitive nerve
             stimulation or (ii) History of positive edrophonium chloride test, or (iii) Patient
             has demonstrated improvement in MG signs on oral cholinesterase inhibitors as assessed
             by the treating physician.

               -  A total score of ≥ 5 on the MG ADL at Screening and Baseline with more than 50%
                  of this score attributed to non ocular items.

               -  Patients are required to be on a stable dose of their MG treatment prior to
                  randomization. For patients receiving AZA, other NSIDs, steroids, and/or
                  cholinesterase inhibitors as concomitant medications the following conditions
                  will apply:

          -  AZA: treatment initiated at least 12 months ago and no dose changes in the last 6
             months before Screening.

          -  Other NSIDs (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and
             cyclophosphamide) treatment initiated at least 6 months ago and no dose changes in the
             last 3 months before Screening.

          -  Steroids treatment initiated at least 3 months prior to and no dose changes in the
             last month before Screening.

          -  Cholinesterase inhibitors: to be on a stable dose for &gt;2 weeks before Screening. Note:
             cholinesterase inhibitors must be held for at least 12 hours consistent with the
             revised manual for the QMG test as recommended by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of
             America Inc [MGFA]1, before the MGQoL15r, MG ADL, QMG, and MGC assessments.

               -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
                  Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 prior to administration
                  of IMP. Female of childbearing potential are defined as all female participants
                  unless they are postmenopausal (defined by continuous amenorrhea) for at least 2
                  years with a Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 IU/L or are surgically
                  sterile (i.e., who had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or have current
                  documented tubal ligation or any other permanent female sterilization procedure).
                  Determination of FSH levels can be used to confirm postmenopausal status in
                  amenorrheic patients not on hormonal replacement therapy if the test result is
                  within the postmenopausal range per the central laboratory.

               -  Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly
                  effective method of contraception (i.e., pregnancy rate of less than 1% per year)
                  during the study and for 90 days after the discontinuation of the IMP. Adequate
                  contraceptive methods include combined hormonal contraception associated with
                  inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen-only
                  hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable,
                  implantable), intrauterine devices (IUDs), intrauterine hormone-releasing system
                  (IUS), true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the participant), bilateral tubal occlusion, or a female participant
                  who is not of childbearing potential. Female participants and female partners of
                  male study participants using a hormonal contraceptive must also use a barrier
                  method (i.e., condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps]) and
                  should have been stable on their hormonal contraceptive treatment for at least 4
                  weeks before Screening.

               -  Sterilized male patients who have had vasectomy with documented aspermia post
                  procedure can be included. In addition, male patients must be advised not to
                  donate sperm during this period from signing of Informed Consent Form (ICF),
                  throughout the duration of the study, and for 90 days after the last
                  administration of IMP. Non-sterilized male patients who are sexually active with
                  a female partner of childbearing potential must use effective method of double
                  barrier contraception (e.g., condom with spermicidal cream or jelly, 1 hormonal
                  plus 1 barrier method or 2 simultaneous barrier methods). Male patients
                  practicing true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant) can be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  MGFA Class I, IVb, and V.
