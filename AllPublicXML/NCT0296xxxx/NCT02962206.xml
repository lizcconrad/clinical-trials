  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius (Colle's) fractures in adult patients are commonly reduced in the emergency
      department before casting. Standard of care currently requires that x-rays be performed
      before and after fracture reduction, and inadequate reductions may be subject to repeat
      attempts and are at a higher risk to require surgery. This study will assess the use of
      point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in addition to standard care as a tool to decrease the
      angulation at the fracture site after a reduction is performed. If this angulation is
      decreased, it would suggest that POCUS for distal radius fracture reduction could decrease
      the number of failed reduction attempts and therefore the number of repeated reduction
      attempts.
