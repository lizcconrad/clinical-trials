  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by blast effects of explosive devices has been
      called the &quot;signature injury&quot; of soldiers who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.
      mTBI can also occur from impact or hitting the head on an object or the ground. Although
      termed &quot;mild&quot; in comparison to major brain injuries, people with mTBI can have problems with
      their memory and concentration. People with mTBI can also find they are more irritable, have
      more anxiety, and have trouble with their mood and sleep.

      The purpose of this study is to see if a medication called prazosin can help treat chronic
      headaches in people with mTBI. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved prazosin
      for treating people with high blood pressure. At this time, the FDA has not approved prazosin
      in the treatment of mTBI or headaches. Some people who have posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) and have been taking prazosin for their medical conditions or who have taken it in
      research studies have said they have fewer headaches.

      Background and Rationale: Headaches following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are common,
      can be refractory to standard therapies, and may persist and worsen to become a debilitating
      chronic pain syndrome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the centrally acting alpha-1
      adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist drug prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for chronic
      posttraumatic headaches (PTHAs). The impetus for this study comes from a large open-label
      case series in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with mTBI and PTHAs and data from a
      placebo-controlled trial evaluating use of prazosin for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      in active-duty Servicemembers (SMs). Findings from these studies showed that in addition to
      decreasing PTSD-related symptoms and improving sleep quality, prazosin decreased the
      frequency and severity of headaches, which were common in the study populations.

      Study Objectives, Specific Aims, and Hypotheses: The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for persistent PTHAs, which will be
      accomplished by conducting a randomized placebo-controlled double blind trial of prazosin vs.
      placebo in active-duty SMs and Veterans who were in military service at any time from October
      7, 2001 to the present with persistent PTHAs.

        -  Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of prazosin compared to placebo on headache
           frequency, headache severity and duration, use of abortive/analgesic medications, and
           headache-related disability.

        -  Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of prazosin on sleep disturbance, PTSD symptoms,
           depressive symptoms, alcohol consumption, global cognitive function, health-related
           quality of life, and global clinical status.

             than 8 hours between attacks)

          -  Acute or serious medical illness or unstable chronic medical illness (e.g., unstable
             angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure, clinically
             significant or concerning cardiac arrhythmias; preexisting hypotension [systolic blood
             pressure&lt;110] or orthostatic hypotension [systolic drop &gt;20 mm Hg after 2 min standing
             accompanied by lightheadedness], chronic renal or hepatic failure, acute pancreatitis,
             Meniere's disease, or diagnosed but untreated sleep apnea). The eligibility of
             potential participants having acute serious and/or chronic medical illnesses other
             than those listed will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a study physician,
             PA-C, or ARNP.

          -  Use of prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist (including but not limited to alfuzosin,
             doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, terazosin) for any purpose in the 2 weeks prior to
             initial screen (P1) visit and prohibited throughout the study

          -  Participation in a HA support group or other activity such as meditation or yoga
             intended to mitigate HA or other chronic pain must be stable at least 4 weeks prior to
             beginning the initial screen (P1) visit and may not be started during the study

          -  Failure to record HA data for at least 80% of days during the Screening Period

          -  Not suitable for study per clinician judgement.

        Medication-Related Considerations:

          -  The use of HA rescue or symptom-relieving medications will be allowed during the
             study. This includes triptans, ergotamines, opioids, simple analgesics (e.g.
             acetaminophen, aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDS], and combination
             analgesics. Their use will be recorded on the concurrent medication CRF during the
             Preliminary Screening Period (P1) and throughout the remainder of the study.
             Randomization of participants will be stratified based on whether their use of HA
             medications meets ICHD-3 beta criteria for overuse of these medications, as described
             in section 5.5 below.

          -  Opioid Medications: Use of opioids for treatment of HA or non-HA-related pain or for
             any other purpose is allowed during the study. Any opioid use would ideally be
             excluded due to potential confounding effects on interpretation of response to
             treatment. However, in this population, particularly in Veterans with chronic pain or
             undergoing minor orthopedic or dental procedures, opioid use is common. Use of
             opioids, including frequency and dose, will be recorded on the concurrent medication
             CRF.

          -  Cannabis: The use of cannabis in any form is not excluded unless its use meets
             criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. All use of cannabis will be documented.

               -  Other Medications: Participants who are taking other medications on a routine
                  basis must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the Preliminary
                  Screening Period (P1), and must intend to continue the medication at the same
                  regimen for the duration of the trial unless lack of efficacy, safety, or
                  tolerability dictates otherwise. The following medications are not excluded:

               -  Psychoactive drugs (for example, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines,
                  antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics),

               -  Antihypertensive medications (including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers,
                  angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor
                  blockers),

               -  The use of magnesium in any dose that is prescribed for the purpose of HA
                  prevention or treatment must be stable for at least 4 weeks. The incidental use
                  of magnesium in multi-vitamins, laxatives, etc. is permissible but must be
                  documented.

               -  Hormones (for example, testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone) in any form.

               -  The &quot;as-needed&quot; (prn) use of psychoactive and other drugs such as antibiotics is
                  not excluded; however, such use must be discussed with a clinician prescriber and
                  documented.

          -  The use of butalbital in any form within 4 weeks of beginning the Preliminary
             Screening Period (P1) through the end of the participant's study involvement is
             exclusionary.

          -  Participants who have been taking trazodone will undergo a 2-week washout period
             before the Preliminary Screening Period (P1 visit). Combining prazosin and trazodone
             may increase the risk of priapism. We have decided to begin the washout period before
             the Preliminary Screening Period in order to remove any confounding variables while on
             the headache log and actigraphy.

          -  Sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and avanafil (Stendra)
             will not be permitted during the study drug dose Titration Period, because of
             increased risk of hypotension in combination with alpha-1 blockers, but will be
             allowed at half the usual starting dose following the study drug dose Titration
             Period, per VA prescribing guidelines.

          -  Use of supplements containing nitrates and supplements containing stimulants (such as
             ephedra) are exclusionary in the two weeks prior to initial screen (P1) visit and
             prohibited throughout the study. Participants who take these supplements will be asked
             to discontinue them for a minimum of two weeks before the Preliminary Screening Period
             (P1 visit)..

          -  Use of prescribed stimulants (such as amphetamine or dextroamphetamine containing
             medications) is exclusionary in the 2 weeks prior to the initial screen (P1) visit and
             prohibited throughout the study. Participants who take these medications will be asked
             to discontinue them for a minimum of 2 weeks before the Preliminary Screening Period.
