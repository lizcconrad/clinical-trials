      The Neurotrack Virtual Cognitive Health Study is a 6-month long, prospective,
      intent-to-treat, study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Neurotrack Virtual Cognitive
      Health Coaching Program on cognitive ability, anxiety and depression, and lifestyle behaviors
      for individuals who show signs of subjective cognitive decline. After the first 6 months of
      the study, the study researchers may extend the study and provide participants with the
      opportunity to continue participating in the study for an additional 6 months.
