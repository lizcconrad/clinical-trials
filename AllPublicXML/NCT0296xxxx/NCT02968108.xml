  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ustekinumab in subjects
      from 2 through less than (&lt;) 18 years old in the USA, or 6 through less than (&lt;) 18 years old
      in other countries and determine if it is similar to that observed in adults with moderately
      to severely active Crohn's disease (CD). Also to assess the safety, immunogenicity and
      efficacy of ustekinumab in the treatment of moderately to severely active CD. The main part
      of the study continues to Week 16, at which point all subjects who are receiving benefit from
      ustekinumab maintenance therapy (as determined by the investigator) are eligible to enter the
      long-term extension (LTE) and continue to receive ustekinumab. The study extension ends at
      Week 236.

    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Response is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 15-point reduction from baseline in the total Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score, accompanied by a total PDCAI score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 30 points. PCDAI is an index used to measure disease activity of pediatric patients with Crohn's Disease assessing abdominal pain, stool frequency, patient functioning, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, weight, height, abdominal tenderness or mass, perirectal disease, and extraintestinal manifestations. It ranges from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate more active disease.</description>

PCDAI is an index used to measure disease activity of pediatric patients with Crohn's Disease assessing abdominal pain, stool frequency, patient functioning, hematocrit, erythrocyte, sedimentation rate, albumin, weight, height, abdominal tenderness or mass, perirectal disease, and extraintestinal manifestations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be a pediatric subject 2 to less than (&lt;) 18 years old in the US, 6 to &lt;18 years old
             elsewhere, of either gender with a body weight of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10
             kilogram (kg)

          -  Have Crohn's disease (CD) or fistulizing CD of at least 3 months duration, with active
             colitis, ileitis, or ileocolitis, confirmed at any time in the past by radiography,

             per kilogram (mg/kg) at screening or ileocolonoscopy with evidence of active CD
             (defined as ulcerations in the ileum and/or colon) during screening into this study
             including at the baseline visit

          -  Prior or current medication for CD must include at least 1 of the following: Current
             treatment with at least 1 of the following therapies: oral corticosteroids, the
             immunomodulators azathioprine, 6-MP, or methotrexate, or currently have or have had a
             history of corticosteroid dependency, or have a history of failure to respond to, or

             there are currently no abscesses identified

          -  Has had any kind of bowel resection within 6 months or any other intra-abdominal
             surgery within 3 months prior to baseline

          -  Has a draining (that is (i.e.), functioning) stoma or ostomy

          -  Presence or history of any malignancy including presence or history of
