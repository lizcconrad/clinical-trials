  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with skin
      cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or other parts of
      the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      -To establish the response rate of pembrolizumab in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      -To determine the 6-month progression-free survival and 1 year overall survival of metastatic
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (cSCC) treated with pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8-12
      weeks.

             hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is
             detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Seasonal
             influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are
