    <textblock>
      Human epicardial fat is the true visceral fat depot of the heart, and its regional
      distribution and physiology is of growing scientific and clinical interest. This study aims
      to characterize the expression profile and function of the epicardial and pericardial adipose
      tissue compartments of the heart (EAT and PAT). EAT and PAT adipose biopsies will be obtained
      from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or valve replacement
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) stretches from the myocardium to the visceral layer of
      the pericardium. Adipose located on the outside of the visceral pericardium to the external
      site of the pericardium is called the pericardial adipose tissue (PAT), and is of a separate
      origin than EAT. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the global expression profile of
      the EAT and PAT compartments, in addition to characterizing the function, structure,
      metabolic and inflammatory profile. Furthermore, this study will determine whether CABG and
      valve replacement patients display different EAT and PAT characteristics
