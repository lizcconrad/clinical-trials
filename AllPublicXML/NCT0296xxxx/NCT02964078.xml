  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the interleukin-2 given in
      combination with pembrolizumab.

      Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is also called aldesleukin, or Proleukin™.

      Pembrolizumab is also called Keytruda™, or anti-PD-1 antibody.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment is organized into blocks of 9 weeks, with pembrolizumab treatment planned for
      weeks 1, 4 and 7. On the second and third blocks, interleukin-2 is added, for 5 doses at a
      time, one dose every 8 hours, on a weekly schedule on the two weeks after the week 1 and the
      week 4 pembrolizumab doses.

      There is no dose escalation portion: The dose and schedule of IL-2 is fixed, 600,000
      IU/kg/dose, with a cap of 66 mIU/dose. Doses may be omitted for safety. The dose of
      pembrolizumab is fixed, flat dose 200 mg/dose.

    <description>Overall Response According to Immune-related response criteria (irRC). Overall response rate ORR is defined with confirmation of the response status Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) among the combination treatment population patients; the binomial estimate and its one-sided 95% confidence interval will be reported. CR: Disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observation not less than 4 weeks apart.

             positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of birth control or be
             surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study

             months of start of the first treatment day. Atrial fibrillation that is rate
             controlled is allowed. Note - the first treatment day is about 9 weeks before the
             first IL-2 treatment day. If a cardiologist's evaluation determines that this is
             superfluous based on other assessments, then this may be omitted.

          -  Pulmonary function test is required, within 3 months of start.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          -  Has a known history of active Bacillus Tuberculosis (TB).

          -  The number of prior therapies is restricted as follows: (a) Zero or one prior
             therapies during the preceding one year. This serves to limit the treatment cohort to
             patients with either only slowly progressive disease, or up to one prior therapy. (b)
             No prior PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody therapies are allowed. (c) Prior IL-2 is allowed, if
             it finished more than 1 year prior. (d) The following are not counted as medical
             therapies: nephrectomy, radiation therapy, other energy-ablative techniques, or
             metastasectomy.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. - Note: Subjects
             with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the
             study. - Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately
             from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
             therapy.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Potential participants with previously treated brain metastases may
             participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for
             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment that would be exclusionary.

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with participation for the
             full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) RNA [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary stent, or
             unstable angina within one year.
