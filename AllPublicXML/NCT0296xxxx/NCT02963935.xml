    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The purpose of the trial is to
      investigate the effect and safety of liraglutide 3.0 mg as an adjunct to intensive behaviour
      therapy for obesity in a non-specialist setting (IBT-CMS: Intensive Behaviour Therapy for
      obesity in a primary care setting according to Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)
      visit schedule).
