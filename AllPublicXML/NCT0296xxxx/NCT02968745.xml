      Aim: To identify the main occupational performance problems reported by individuals with
      rheumatoid arthritis and the relationship between these activities with work status of
      participants . Methods: the investigators conducted a cross-sectional study with 81 patients
      with RA. Individuals were interviewed the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Data was
      described in frequencies and percentages, and the Pearson's chi-square test was used to
      determine the asymptotic association between the occupational performance problems with work.

      For this cross-sectional study, 81 patients were recruited by convenience at the Clinical
      Hospital (HC) of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), in Brazil.

      COPM was applied to identify the main occupational performance problems reported by
      participants. The COPM is an individual measure of self-awareness about the problems faced
      when carrying out the activities. It identifies problems in the areas of self-care,
      productivity, and leisure, and measure the individual's performance and satisfaction
      regarding these activities
