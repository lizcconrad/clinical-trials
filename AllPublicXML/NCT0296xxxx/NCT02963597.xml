      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of continuous positive airway pressure
      (PAP) therapy on pulmonary arterial (PA) pressures in acute decompensated heart failure (HF)
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study will also assess changes in functional
      parameters, biomarkers, and echocardiographic parameters.

      The ASAP-HF study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, two-center, study with a parallel
      group design, with subjects randomized to either control (no APAP) or active treatment (APAP)
      in a 1:1 ratio. Group A (active): standard medical therapy plus treatment with continuous
      APAP for 48hrs, or Group B (control): standard medical therapy only.

      Many people who have heart failure (HF) also have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which is
      breathing irregularities during sleep. These irregularities may interrupt the sleep as well
      as increase the rate of progression of Heart Failure. The ASAP-HF study is being done to see
      if certain clinical outcomes are improved in acute decompensated heart failure (HF) patients
      with SDB by using a non-invasive breathing device continuously for a short period of time (48
      hours) while patient is still in the hospital. The device is called AirSense™ 10 AutoSet
      (AutoSet). It consists of an air flow generator, air tubing, an air humidifier, and a mask.
      As the patient breathe through the mask, the AutoSet monitors breathing.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of continuous positive
      airway pressure (PAP) therapy on pulmonary arterial (PA) pressures in acute decompensated
      heart failure (HF) patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study will also assess
      changes in functional parameters, biomarkers, and echocardiographic parameters . This device
      is not currently used to diagnose sleep apnea and its utility is not well studied. This study
      will establish the utility of the device in diagnosing sleep apnea.

    <description>The AirSense 10 AutoSet is a device that provide non-invasive ventilatory support to treat patients with sleep disordered breathing. The device is intended for home and hospital use. The treatment pressure required by the patient may vary due to changes in sleep state, body position and airway resistance. In AutoSet mode, the device provides only that amount of pressure required to maintain upper airway patency. The AirSense 10 AutoSet provides a minimum and maximum pressure within the range of 4-20 cm of water.</description>
