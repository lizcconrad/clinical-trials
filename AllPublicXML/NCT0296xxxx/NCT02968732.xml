  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, investigational study to assess the accuracy of standardized cystoscopic
      evaluation with tissue sampling performed immediately prior to definitive radical cystectomy
      to predict pathologic tumor stage and identify patients who may benefit from bladder
      preservation therapy.

    <textblock>
      Archival specimen of prior diagnostic TUR will be prepared as 10-20 unstained 5-10 micron
      slides to under-go next generation sequencing and be compared to final cystectomy specimen to
      investigate potential pre-treatment signatures predictive of response to chemotherapy and to
      understand genomic evolution of primary tumors after chemotherapy. All patients will also
      have urine, PBMC, and serum/plasma collected at baseline, day of procedure, 4-6 weeks
      post-procedure, and 6 months post-procedure. The baseline samples will be collected prior to
      any chemotherapy administration and prior to the procedure.

      On the day of the patient's radical cystectomy, standard rigid cystourethroscopy will be
      performed. A urine sample will be collected from the bladder. A plasma sample will be
      collected while the patient is under anesthesia or in pre-op holding area. Visible tumor and
      prior tumor sites will be targeted for tissue sampling (no more than two sites will be
      targeted). A standardized tumor quantification system will be employed to document location
      and presence of tumor and previous biopsy sites. To this end, the investigators have
      developed a novel scoring system that allows for objective quantification of endoscopic
      findings at the time of cystoscopy and indexes presence and location of papillary tumor,
      erythema, and scar. Two additional random biopsies will be obtained, one from the posterior
      wall and one from the lateral wall for assessment of genomic signatures within
      normal-appearing mucosa.

      Tumor location and its relationship to the ureteral orifices will be noted in order to assist
      the surgeon in performance of radical cystectomy. The patient will then undergo radical
      cystectomy as per standard of care.

    <measure>To determine if genomic signature from tissue obtained on endoscopic evaluation just prior to cystectomy can help predict final pathological stage.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5years post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of baseline archival tumor tissue and final specimen will be compared for whether viable tumor tissue remains at time of surgery, for changes in total number of mutations found, whether specific mutations evolve from before to after chemo, and whether a pre-treatment genomic signature is predictive of chemo response. Specifically, DNA will be isolated from pre- and post- chemotherapy urine samples and subjected to targeted deep sequencing to support the hypothesis that mutation clearance correlates with pathologic response in the radical cystectomy specimen. These studies will provide orthogonal validation and could prove more sensitive than pathological analysis. In addition, they may serve as further basis for highly stringent selection of complete responders in whom cystectomy could be avoided in the future.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients age &gt;18 years at the time of consent.

          2. Patients with a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma clinical stage T1-T4NanyM0.

          3. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0-3.

          4. Patients must have a clinical decision to proceed with radical cystectomy by any
             conventional approach (open, laparoscopic, robot-assisted laparoscopic). Time from
             decision to surgery is usually 3-8 weeks for those who do not receive neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy and 10-14 weeks for those who receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
             treatment. During this time, eligibility for study participation will be verified.

          5. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA
             authorization document or a legally authorized representative who has the ability to
             understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA authorization
             on behalf of the participant.

          6. Women of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive
             measure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who undergo cystectomy with non-curative intent will be excluded.

          2. Patients who have undergone any prior pelvic irradiation.

          3. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Radical cystectomy and prolonged general
             anesthesia would place the fetus at considerable risk of demise. The prolonged
             recovery and debility of the patient would severely limit the patient's ability to
             nurse and care for an infant.
