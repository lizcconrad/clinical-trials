  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a home-based adapted physical
      activity during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2+ breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the assessment of their physical fitness, a home-based adapted physical activity
      program composed by aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises will be delivered to each
      patient. The aim of the intervention is to reach international recommendation in a
      progressive way during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
