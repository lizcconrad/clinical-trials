      Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer has been successfully proven to be a non-inferior
      alternative regarding resection quality, and oncological outcomes of patients as compared to
      open surgery in mangy clinical trails. Moreover, laparoscopic surgery is advantageous over
      open surgery with regard to operative invasiveness, patient's recovery, and wound related
      complications. Thus, laparoscopic surgery has gained great popularity over the past decades.
      However, specifically for mid and low rectal cancer, laparoscopic surgery is technically
      demanding, which sometimes leads to high morbidity and unsatisfactory resection quality,
      especially in challenging cases such as bulky mesorectum, enlarged prostate, irradiated
      pelvis, etc. Under this circumstance, transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) , the so
      called &quot;down-to-up&quot; alternative, has emerged as a promising solution to these problems in
      recent years and more and more small studies have proven the feasibility and advantages of
      this technique, making it become a hot topic among both literature and conferences. However,
      TaTME is still at early birth, higher-level evidences, either multicentric, or comparative
      study with conventional surgery is strikingly lacking. Thus the investigators conduct this
      multicentre randomised clinical trial, comparing transanal TME versus laparoscopic TME for
      mid and low rectal cancer, aiming to prove the hypothesis that TaTME may achieve better
      resection quality and result in non-inferior oncological outcome, as well as short term
      operative morbidity and mortality.

      Background:In recent years, transanal mesorectal excision (TaTME) has emerged as a promising
      surgical alternative for rectal cancer, especially for mid and low rectal cancer.
      Theoretically, TaTME holds the potential advantage of providing better access to mobilize the
      distal rectum, and thus could achieve better pathologic outcomes, such as lower involved
      circumferential margin (CRM) and incomplete resected mesorectum, which could translate into
      better oncological outcome for the patients in the long term. However, until now, the
      feasibility and the non-inferiority (compared with laparoscopic total mesorectal excision,
      LpTME) of this technique has only been validated in studies with limitations of small sample
      size, retrospective nature.

      Study Objective:This study aims to evaluate the TaTME technique compared with conventional
      laparoscopic rectal surgery, focusing on resection quality, as well as long-term survival
      results.

      Study design This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel
      group trial. The randomisation ratio of TaTME over LpTME will be 1:1. A central electronic
      data capture (EDC) system will be utilized for randomization, electronic CRF and data
      collection. All comparative analyses will be conducted on an &quot;intention to treat&quot; basis.

      Sample size:The projected 3-year disease free survival rate for the conventional laparoscopic
      surgery group was 77%. According to the noninferiority design, at a randomisation ratio of
      1:1, to generate a power of 80% (based an α of 0.05 and a margin delta (δ) of 10% ) with an
      expected dropout rate of 20%, it was determined that a total of 1114 patients are required
      for inclusion for this trail (557 patients at each group).

      Study Endpoints:The primary end point of this study is 3 year disease free survival(DFS).
      Secondary endpoints include: 1) resection quality, mainly including circumferential
      involvement rate, and completeness of mesorectum. Resected specimen was pathologically
      processed and assessed at each center by trained and qualified pathologists
      independently.2)short term operative results such as morbidity and mortality, etc.; 3) long
      term oncological outcome such as local recurrence, and overall survival. Besides, functional
      outcome and quality of life are also evaluated.
