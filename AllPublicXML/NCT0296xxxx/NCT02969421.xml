    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial that compares methods of tenaculum placement during intrauterine
      device insertion and their effect on pain. The two methods being compared are slow tenaculum
      placement versus tenaculum placement at time of cough. Subjects will be asked to rate their
      pain using visual analog scale. Primary outcome measured is pain at time of tenaculum
      placement. Secondary outcomes are overall pain with intrauterine device insertion and
      provider satisfaction with tenaculum placement.

    <textblock>
      The two commonly described strategies for tenaculum placement, slow versus having the patient
      cough while the tenaculum is placed are utilized by providers based on preference and/or
      their previous training. There is no published study that compares these methods to one
      another. The investigators aim to compare these strategies, slow tenaculum placement versus
      the cough method, and their effects on pain at time of placement. 96 subjects will be
      randomized to each method. The subject will be asked to rate their pain using a 100-mm visual
      analog scale after speculum placement, after tenaculum is placed, and after completion of the
      procedure. The provider will be asked to rate their satisfaction with tenaculum placement on
      a Likert-type 5 point satisfaction scale. 1: not at all satisfied, 2: slightly satisfied, 3:
      moderately satisfied, 4: very satisfied, 5: extremely satisfied. All data to be collected
      using REDCap database.
