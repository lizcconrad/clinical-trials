  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the present study is that in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy a
      specific pharmacological blocking of peripheral glutamate-receptor N-methyl-d-aspartate
      receptor type1 (NMDAR) glutamate receptors will result in pain alleviation. Activated NMDAR1
      has been demonstrated to be crucial for pain regulation in various pain disorders, and in
      biopsies from patients with tendinopathy, NMDAR1 was found to be activated.

      To test this hypothesis a specific NMDA receptor antagonist, ketalar (ketamine), will be
      injected guided by ultrasound into the subacromial space in patients with rotator cuff
      tendinopathy, and subsequently the pain response will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy by exercise-related shoulder pain with positive
             impingement tests as described by Hawkins and Neers, and MRI findings consistent with
             tendinopathy.

          -  Symptom duration at least 1 year to ensure neuronal ingrowth and NMDAR expression

        Exclusion Criteria:
