  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the impact of progressive
      resistance exercise (PRE) in PD patients with akinesia and rigidity (AR-subtype). The
      investigators hypothesized the intervention would have a beneficial effect on the study
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>

      Twenty-eight patients with PD AR-type of both sexes, were recruited for this trial. Each
      participant were assigned randomly to either intervention (N=13) or control (N=15) group.

      The intervention group participated in sixteen PRE training sessions for eight weeks: two
      sessions per week on non-consecutive days, sixty-seventy min each one. The control group
      followed their usual weekly physical activity routine.

      All patients underwent antrophometrical and neuromuscular function assessment (CoP
      measurements -primary outcomes- and the Ten-Meters Walk Test -TMWT- -secondary outcomes-). In
      addition, they were asked to provide ratings for the Spanish validated versions of the the
      Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q, 6-item version) -secondary outcomes-, the 39-item
      Parkinson ́s disease Questionnaire (PDQ39) -secondary outcomes- and the MDS-UPDRS -secondary
      outcomes-. Additionally, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg &gt;6-20 scale) - secondary
      outcomes-, were recorded at the end of each PRE training session. Tests were carried out at
      three times: pre-test (before the training program), post-test (eight weeks after pre-tests,
      at the end of the training period), and four weeks after the post-test (re-test).
