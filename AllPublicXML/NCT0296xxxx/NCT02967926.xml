      Patients This study recruited patients who suspected/confirmed CBDS from clinical
      manifestation, liver function tests and imaging studies. With CBD sized between 5 and 15
      millimeters, which measured from transabdominal ultrasonography (US), computed tomography
      (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).
      The exclusion criteria were history of bile duct surgery, bile duct stricture, bile duct
      tumors, severe comorbid diseases, unstable vital signs, pregnancy, and coagulopathy. All
      patients were informed and wrote informed consent for the procedure.

      Procedures Non-fluoroscopic CBDS removal was performed by experienced endoscopists, using
      standard side-viewing duodenoscope. After identified major papilla, the investigators
      performed bile duct cannulation with guidewire assisted technique. Successful cannulation
      confirmed by visualized bile aspiration. If the patients had difficult cannulation, double
      guidewire technique was used. After the successful bile duct cannulation, the investigators
      performed endoscopic standard sphincterotomy (EST). Precut sphincterotomy was not used in
      this study. Non fluoroscopic balloon extraction was performed. The balloon was pushed up to
      hilum then the investigators sweep until suspected complete CBD clearance. After that the
      investigators used digital SpyGlassTM to confirm the complete clearance of CBDS. If
      SpyGlassTM showed residual CBD stone, the investigators repeat balloon extraction. If
      SpyGlassTM showed complete clearance, the investigator proceed to perform final cholangiogram
      as reference standard for this study.
