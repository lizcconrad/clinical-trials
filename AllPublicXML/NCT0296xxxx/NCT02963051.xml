    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and optimal dosing of intravenous copper
      chloride and disulfiram in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
      Eligible men will have neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), adenocarcinoma CRPC with
      non-liver/peritoneal metastases (lymph nodes, bone, or lung) or adenocarcinoma CRPC with
      liver and/or peritoneal metastases. Subjects will receive three doses of intravenous copper
      chloride and take disulfiram and oral copper gluconate until disease progression (up to two
      years). Subjects will also undergo a PET scan with radioactive copper 64 to measure the
      levels of copper in their tumor. The central hypotheses of this project are that (a) copper
      chloride and disulfiram are safe to give together and that (b) the combination of disulfiram
      with copper will have efficacy for both mCRPC and NEPC.

             York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV heart disease or cardiac ejection fraction
             measurement of &lt; 50% at baseline.

          7. Symptomatic atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmia for which the therapy is
             not stable or requiring changes in therapy within 1 month of treatment initiation.
             Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmia which is clinically stable on stable
             therapy is allowed.

          8. Corrected QT interval calculated by the Bazett formula (QTcB) &gt;480 msec.

          9. Other malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer, with a ≥ 30% probability of death
             within 24 months.
