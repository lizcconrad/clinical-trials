    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of the SaeboFlex orthosis in
      improving upper extremity recovery for people in the early phases of rehabilitation post
      stroke. The objectives of the study are:

        1. to explore the effectiveness of the SaeboFlex orthosis in improving upper extremity
           function, strength, movement, spasticity and self-perceived occupational performance, in
           addition to conventional therapy, with continued use immediately after discharge from
           inpatient stroke rehabilitation and while waiting for outpatient occupational therapy
           services

        2. to explore the relationship between the participants' level of self-efficacy and use of
           the SaeboFlex orthosis in the home environment

        3. to explore the participants' experience of use of the SaeboFlex orthosis in the home
           environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although intensive and repetitive use of the paretic upper extremity has been shown to
      improve upper extremity outcomes post stroke, few therapeutic approaches allow those with
      moderate to severe upper extremity impairment to independently participate in repetitive
      grasp and release activities. The SaeboFlex orthosis is a dynamic wrist-hand orthosis that
      assists with finger and thumb extension after functional grasping with the paretic hand and
      therefore may allow those with more affected upper extremities post stroke to participate in
      repetitive grasp and release activities that they otherwise would be unable to do. More
      research is required on the effectiveness of this orthosis in improving upper extremity
      recovery post stroke especially when used at home as a continuation of therapy received
      during inpatient rehabilitation. It has been suggested that guided home rehabilitation
      programs can improve the ability of stroke survivors to be more independent in their
      activities of daily living. This study is a mixed methods study combining a quantitative
      single subject ABA design and qualitative post study individual interviews to first capture
      quantitative information on the effectiveness of the SaeboFlex intervention and then
      qualitative information that will build on and further explain the quantitative data. Three
      participants who are using a SaeboFlex orthosis as part of their upper extremity
      rehabilitation program will be recruited from an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit as they
      are being discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and will be seen by the principal
      investigator in their homes for 1 hour 3 times a week for 2 weeks and then once a week for 6
      weeks while they are on the waiting list for outpatient occupational therapy services. The
      intervention will follow a set protocol of grasp-release activities using the SaeboFlex
      orthosis for 50 minutes at least 3 times per week, followed by 10 minutes of grasp-release
      activities without the orthosis, both of which will be graded to provide optimal upper
      extremity challenge throughout the intervention period. Repeated baseline assessments will be
      completed by a trained research assistant, in the participants' homes, within one week of
      discharge from inpatient stroke rehabilitation and will be repeated after 4 and 8 weeks of
      intervention, followed by individual interviews in the participants' homes.

    <measure>Arm Activity Measure (ArmA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline upper extremity function to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Arm Activity Measure (ArmA) is a self-report tool designed for use with upper extremity spasticity management interventions. The ArmA was chosen because it provides a comprehensive assessment at the activity level of both active and passive upper extremity function; it is comprised of an 8 item passive function subscale and a 13 item active function subscale. Both subscales have been found to have high internal consistency and test-retest reliability.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline upper extremity function to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory-7 (CAHAI-7) is a commonly used upper extremity functional assessment post stroke. It is comprised of seven bilateral functional tasks and has been found to have excellent test-retest and inter-rater reliability as well as internal consistency.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline upper extremity impairment to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) is a widely used measure of motor impairment post stroke and is comprised of 33 items related to upper extremity movement. The FMA-UE has excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliability as well as construct validity in persons with stroke.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline perception of recovery to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a well known and well studied measure of stroke survivors' perception of their recovery post stroke. The SIS has been widely used in stroke intervention studies.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline spasticity to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) is a well known measure of spasticity post stroke. The MAS assesses the resistance to passive muscle stretch and is graded on a 6 point ordinal scale. The participants' elbow, wrist and finger flexors will be assessed with the MAS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand Grip Strength (measured using dynamometry)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline grip strength to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of hand grip strength using dynamometry is common post stroke and has excellent test-retest and inter-rater reliability. An average of 3 grip strength trials will be taken at each measurement point using dynamometry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline self-efficacy to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SSEQ) was designed to assess self-efficacy related to functional performance and self-management post stroke. The SSEQ is comprised of two subscales that are scored separately and correlate strongly with other measures of self-efficacy post stroke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline perception of occupational performance to 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a valid and responsive measure of occupational performance and has been widely used in stroke research. The COPM uses a semi-structured interview format where performance and satisfaction scores will be identified for the participants' self-identified occupational performance issues.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Individual interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individual interviews will be conducted at 8 weeks, after the intervention is complete, to generate discussion about the perceived usability of the SaeboFlex orthosis in the home environment, the perceived effect on upper extremity recovery as well as the perceived relationship between self-efficacy and use of the SaeboFlex orthosis in the home environment.</description>
