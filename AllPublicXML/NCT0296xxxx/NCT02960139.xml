      The Cohera Sylys® Surgical Sealant study is a pivotal, prospective, randomized, controlled,
      multicenter superiority clinical study comparing standard anastomosis closure technique
      (Control) to standard closure technique plus Sylys® Surgical Sealant (Test) during stapled
      colorectal and ileorectal anastomosis procedures.
