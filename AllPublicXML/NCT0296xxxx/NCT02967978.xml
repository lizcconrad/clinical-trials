  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at investigating whether the natural calcium isotope ratio (δ44/40Ca) in urine
      and serum differs between postmenopausal women aged 50 to 75 years suffering from
      osteoporosis and a healthy control group and whether δ44/40Ca in urine and serum can be used
      for the diagnosis of osteoporosis or whether further parameters have to be included.

    <textblock>
      According to the operational definition of WHO in the year 1994 osteoporosis is present if
      bone mineral content as assessed by DXA densitometry of the lumbar spine and/or proximal
      femur (total area or femoral neck) deviates from the mean of a 20 to 29 years old women by at
      least -2.5 standard deviations (DXA T-Score ≤ -2.5). This definition of osteoporosis is only
      valid after exclusion of other disorders, which may be associated with a reduction of bone
      mineral content and exclusion of osteomalacia.

      By an individual screening 100 women will be included in the study who are characterized
      concerning existing or non-existing osteoporosis according to the guidelines of DVO 2014 and
      ISCD 2015, respectively.

      According to the EPOS study results the prevalence of osteoporosis in Germany in
      postmenopausal women aged 50 to 60 years is about 15% and at the age of more than 70 years
      about 45%. In case of risk factors, such as hip fracture of father and/or mother, smoking,
      lactose intolerance, vegan nutrition, underweight (BMI &lt; 20), diabetes, intake of loop
      diuretics, glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors a higher
      prevalence can be assumed. Thus by electing women with at least one risk factor of
      osteoporosis a higher proportion may meet the criteria of osteoporosis.

      Since some women are expected to present with low vitamin D levels and so far are expected to
      present with osteomalacia, and since other exclusion criteria may occur, N = 100 women will
      be investigated, in order to obtain data from N = 80 women who may meet the criteria of the
      target group (about N = 40 with osteoporosis and about N = 40 without osteoporosis (normal
      control).
