        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female aged between 20 and 85 years.

          -  Patients fulfilling one of the following diagnosis:

          -  Five patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy on both clinical
             and neurophysiological grounds.

          -  Five patients with proven genetic diagnosis of CMT1a

          -  Five patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy.

          -  Electrophysiological parameters worsening for the past 3 years

          -  Available EMG record, performed during the past 6 months to assess variability of NCV
             parameters

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any general chronic handicapping disease other than peripheral neuropathy

          -  Impossibility to perform the 10 meters walking test

          -  Impossibility to assess electrophysiological parameters

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hepatic disorder, renal or cardiovascular disease, or
             cancer,

          -  Patients with hypersensitivity to MD1003 excipients (lactose)

          -  Laboratory tests out of normal range according to the reference laboratory values.
             Deviations may be accepted if considered by the investigator as not clinically
             significant with regards to the study continuation,

          -  Patients with history or presence of alcohol abuse or drug addiction,

          -  Patients likely to be non-compliant to the study procedures or for whom a long-term
             follow-up seems to be difficult to achieve.

          -  Any new medication for neuropathy initiated less than 3 months prior to inclusion. For
             CIDP patients, relapse in the past 3 months before inclusion.
