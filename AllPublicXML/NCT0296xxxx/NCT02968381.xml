  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.
      Tobacco quit lines are effective at helping smokers to quit, but quit lines are
      underutilized, especially by men and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is effective at
      helping people quit smoking, and is appealing to males and diverse racial groups, but has
      limited reach. The proposed study will develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of
      a guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention that is delivered by a combination of quit
      line coaches and an interactive website. The investigators hypothesize that guided mental
      imagery delivered using the quit line &quot;coaching model&quot; combined with an interactive website
      could be an effective intervention strategy.

      The objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a
      theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking
      cessation.

      Aim 1. Develop a theory-based, guided mental imagery tobacco cessation intervention for quit
      line callers with input from expert consultants in health disparities and a Community
      Advisory Board representing diverse populations and tobacco control stakeholders. The
      intervention will include phone-based coaching, an interactive website, and optional
      cessation medication. It will be focus tested with 40 smokers (from diverse racial/ethnic and
      age groups with at least 40% males), and usability tested with 5 smokers.

      Aim 2. Develop training and competency standards for, and train, four coaches in the
      implementation of the guided imagery and control interventions. Coaches will be assessed at
      6-weeks and 6-months post-training for implementation fidelity and satisfaction.

      Aim 3. Conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on the effects of the
      guided mental imagery intervention on quit line callers' tobacco use, cravings, and
      self-efficacy to quit smoking, and to refine study procedures, including recruitment,
      retention, and use of intervention components. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either the Imagery Intervention (N=50) or an attention control condition (N=50) as
      delivered by study coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months
      post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged
      abstinence of tobacco use. Biochemical validation will be conducted on a sub-sample to
      determine validity of self-reported abstinence in this population. Secondary outcomes will be
      self-reported cravings and self-efficacy.
