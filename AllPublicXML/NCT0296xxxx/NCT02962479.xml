    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare biological communities in stool samples obtained from age, diet
      and BMI-matched subjects in five study groups: subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
      never treated with tumor necrosing factor (TNF) inhibitors, subjects with ankylosing
      spondylitis previously or currently treated with TNF inhibitors, subjects with
      non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nrSpA) never treated with tumor necrosing factor
      (TNF) inhibitors, subjects with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis previously or
      currently treated with TNF inhibitors and healthy participants.

      The differences in fecal microbiota composition will be explored using shotgun metagenomic
      sequencing through the University of Washington. The investigators predict that this study
      will confirm a significant difference between the fecal microbiota composition (FMC) of both
      AS and nrSpA patients and controls.

      Subjects will have the option to provide additional consent for specimens to be retained by
      the research team indefinitely for research purposes. These samples will be identified only
      by the numeric study ID; no personally identifying information will be associated with the
      retained samples. The samples could be used to make new products, tests or findings, which
      may have value and may be developed and owned by the research team and/or others.
      Investigators will not be able to provide subjects with results from any future research that
      is done using their samples.

        At least 50 subjects, male and female, aged 18 or older, will be recruited to the study and
        assigned to one of five groups:

          1. Ten TNF blocker-naïve ankylosing spondylitis patients

          2. Ten TNF blocker-exposed ankylosing spondylitis patients

          3. Ten TNF blocker-naïve nrSpA patietns

          4. Ten TNF blocker-exposed nrSpA patients

          5. Ten healthy age, diet and BMI-matched controls Inclusion and exclusion criteria will
             vary by study group. It is anticipated that the TNF-blocker naïve groups will be the
             most difficult to recruit, so these groups will serve as the baseline for age and diet
             matching for the other two groups. Up to seventy (70) additional TNF-treated axial SpA
             and healthy subjects may be asked to complete the dietary questionnaire, but will not
             provide stool samples unless age, diet and BMI-matched with a TNF-blocker-naïve axial
             SpA subject.
