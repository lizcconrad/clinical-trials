      The investigators intend to conduct a randomized controlled study to find if combining HIPEC
      (hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy) with post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy D2
      resection could improve survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer, while comparing
      with the traditional approach of D2 resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer, as the second common malignant tumors in china, is marked by its poor
      prognosis and high recurrent rate. Although R0 resection could be achieved in most advanced
      gastric cancer(AGC) patients without metastasis, age-standardized 5-years survival rate was
      no more than 27.4%. Peritoneal metastasis accounts for 50% of the recurrent case and remain
      to be the most fatal recurrence pattern.

      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy ( HIPEC ), has been proved as one of the
      most efficient approach against peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer and recommended
      in the guideline for gastric cancer published by the health committee of china. However, its
      role as prophylactic treatment after curative has never been determined. HIPEC works by
      delivering heat and cytotoxic drug to the cancer cell and is more effective on the tumor with
      small size. As present study suggest that Peritoneal metastasis is related to lymph node
      dissection during surgery while opening lymphatic channels and spreading viable cancer cells
      into the peritoneal cavity, HIPEC might be a reasonable approach to destroy the remaining
      cancer cells after curative surgery. Thus this research aim to explore the efficacy and
      safety of combining HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy) with
      post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy D2 resection.

    <description>After receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and D2 radical resection, Hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy is conducted,4 catheters are placed in 4 position in the peritoneal cavity: ① under the left diaphragm ② hepatorenal recess ③ left pelvis ④ right pelvis.catheters, all four tubes are connected to the perfusion device.Perfusion prescription: cycle 1, Paclitaxel 75mg/ m2 diluted with 3000ml normal saline heated up to a fixed temperature of 43°C circulate continuously for 60min at a speed of 400-500ml/h; cycle 2 start within 24-48 hours after cycle 1, dosage of paclitaxel adjust to 100mg/ m2, the rest of the same. A total of two cycle is administered, routine adjuvant chemotherapy using SOX (oxaliplatin plus S-1 capsule)or XELOX regimens follows within 4-6 weeks.</description>
