  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim is to determine whether licorice gargling provides meaningful analgesia after
      oral surgery. Specifically, we propose to test the primary hypothesis that gargling with
      licorice solution reduces pain after oral surgery more than gargling with sugar water.
      Because effective analgesia can reduce pain and/or opioid consumption, we will jointly
      evaluate verbal response pain scores and overall morphine consumption considering licorice to
      be beneficial only if it proves non-inferior on both measures and superior on at least one.

    <description>A joint outcome of average pain score and total opioid consumption between the end of surgery and the first two postoperative hours. Joint hypothesis testing will be used, meaning that Licorice gargling will be deemed better than sugar-water only if found noninferior on both opioid consumption and pain score and superior on at least one of the two.</description>

    <description>Postoperative pain intensity and opioid consumption between the end of surgery and the first postoperative morning.

    <description>pain intensity and total analgesics (metamizole or mefenamic acid) consumption in the first three days after surgery. Joint hypothesis testing will be used, meaning that Licorice gargling will be deemed better than sugar-water only if found noninferior on both opioid consumption and pain score and superior on at least one of the two.</description>
