  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this sub-study is to provide expanded access of AZEDRA (Ultratrace Iobenguane
      I 131) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZEDRA in subjects with iobenguane-avid
      malignant and/or recurrent pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MIP-IB12B, the pivotal phase 2 study evaluating efficacy and safety of AZEDRA in patients
      with malignant relapsed/refractory PPGL, has completed its anticipated enrollment. The
      purpose of this sub-study, MIP-IB12B-EAP, is to provide expanded access to AZEDRA for newly
      enrolled subjects with iobenguane-avid metastatic and/or recurrent PPGL and to collect
      additional safety data.

    <description>Subjects will receive a dosimetry dose of AZEDRA and will undergo 3 whole body scans. If the scans indicate tumor avidity for AZEDRA, the subjects will receive up to 2 therapeutic doses of AZEDRA each at 500 mCi (or 8 mCi/kg, for subjects weighing 62.5 kg or less) approximately 90 days apart.</description>
