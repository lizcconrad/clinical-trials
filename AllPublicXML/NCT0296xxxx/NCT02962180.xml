    <textblock>
      Actually the methods for melanocyte delivery are invasive and often sophisticated. The
      dermarolling system with needles causing tiny microinjuries in the epidermis could offer a
      minimally invasive and painless method of melanocyte transplantation. The purpose of the
      study is to develop a new and simple method for transepidermally delivering keratinocytes and
      melanocytes into vitiligo skin.

      Condition: stable lesion of non segmental and segmental vitiligo of adults.

      Background: The best method to transepidermally deliver isolated cells (melanocytes) is not
      yet defined. Microneedle treatment of the &quot; ex vivo &quot; human skin caused many thin vertical
      epidermodermal fissures and a variable depth of injury into the dermis regarding the length
      of the needles. This kind of treatment could be able to create small epidermal defects which
      allows to deliver melanocytes to an epidermal site. An approach to replenish melanocytes by
      injection of dissociated epidermal cell suspension with a syringe was recently successfully
      used. So, we hypothesize that the use of dermaroller with 0.2mm needle length which causes
      tiny microinjuries strictly in the epidermis could offer a simple, minimally invasive and
      painless method of melanocyte transplantation.

      Main objective: To demonstrate the efficacy and the interest of dermaroller use with 0.2mm
      needle length in the transplantation of basal cell layer suspension in the epidermis of
      depigmented vitiligo skin.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To assess as control the effect of the use of dermaroller alone on the vitiligo lesion.

        2. If transplantation is successful, to assess the duration needed to obtain a good
           coalescence and a complete repigmentation of the vitiligo lesion.

    <description>o The dermaroller is passed on the treated depigmented area. This technique is based on tiny microwounds performed using 540 microneedles (0.2mm length) which should allow the penetration of the suspension cells into the epidermis to obtain a good repigmentation.</description>
