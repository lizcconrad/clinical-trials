  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venipuncture is one of the most common iatrogenic painful and stressful procedures performed
      on children. Interventions aimed at reducing the distress related to this experience are
      widely and strongly recommended. Pain and anxiety management is even more essential because
      it may modify children's memory for procedural pain and the subsequent acceptance of later
      health care painful interventions. Distraction is the most studied psychological technique to
      relieve venipuncture related pain and distress, with a strong evidence supporting its
      efficacy in children and adolescents.

      In recent years several studies showed the effectiveness of a specific tool named Buzzy® (MMJ
      Labs, Atlanta GA, USA), in relieving pain and distress in children. Buzzy combines
      distraction and physical analgesia (vibration and cold) and it was positively tested during
      venipuncture, intravenous cannulation and painful injections in children. Even though its
      efficacy it's well established, most of the published trials did not compare Buzzy with other
      interventions, so that little data are available about its usefulness compared with other
      distractions techniques.

      Hand-held computers are reusable tools, which offer a technological-based active distraction.
      There is evidence supporting their used during painful procedures such as venipuncture and a
      recent published study showed that hand-held computer distraction was as effective as
      nurse-led passive distraction techniques in children.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Buzzy versus hand-held computer in
      pain relief during venipuncture.
