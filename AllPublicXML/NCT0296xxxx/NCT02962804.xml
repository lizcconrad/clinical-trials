  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two primary aims in the study: 1) to determine the tolerability and feasibility of
      combination hypofractionated radiation therapy and PD-1 inhibition with nivolumab, and 2) to
      determine the ability of hypofractionated radiation therapy to enhance response rate from
      PD-1 inhibition versus PD-1 inhibition alone by comparing the observed response rate under
      the combination therapy with a previously reported response rate under inhibition alone.

      Patients with metastatic or recurrent renal cell cancer who have progressed on standard
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy and who have metastatic or primary tumors suitable
      for palliative radiation will be eligible for this study. Treatment will consist of nivolumab
      plus hypofractionated radiation therapy. The primary endpoint will be objective response
      rate, which will be compared against the historical control of 25% using nivolumab alone as
      established in the CHECKMATE 025 clinical trial. Patients will continue on nivolumab until
      disease progression or withdrawal of consent. Follow-up will continue for 2 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed history of renal cell carcinoma (all variants are acceptable)

          2. Progression or recurrence after at least one prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy
             including, but not limited to: sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib.

          3. At least 1 site (primary or metastasis) amenable to hypofractionated radiation therapy
             and appropriate for radiation therapy as part of standard of care per medical,
             urologic or radiation oncologist discretion. NOTE: CT / MRI imaging to have been
             completed no more than 30 days before enrollment on study.

             Potential indications for radiation therapy include (but are not limited to):

               -  Painful bone or soft tissue metastasis

               -  Symptoms from mass effect caused by tumor

               -  Prevention of impending symptoms from tumor

               -  Hemoptysis due to tumor

               -  Limited oligometastasis

               -  Isolated region of progression

          4. Patients with prior IL-2 treatment are eligible

          5. At least 14 days since any prior therapy
