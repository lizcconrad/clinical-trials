  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, open-label, dose escalation, safety, activity, and PK study to
      determine the MTD and optimal dosing regimen of Oradoxel. No control group has been included.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and activity study.
      Eligible subjects will be adults with advanced solid malignancies.

      Groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive a single dose of Oradoxel and will be followed for
      toxicity. If non linearity in PK is observed, additional subjects will receive Oradoxel as 2
      single daily doses once every three weeks. Subjects who tolerate the drug and have stable
      disease or better response will be eligible to receive ongoing treatment.
