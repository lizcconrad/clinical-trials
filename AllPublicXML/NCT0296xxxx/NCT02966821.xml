      A phase II, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      sulfatinib as a second-line treatment in patients with surgically unresectable or metastatic
      biliary tract carcinoma

      This study adopt Simon's two-stage designs method based on the primary endpoint of 16-week
      PFS rates. In the first stage, 16 patients will be recruited. If there are 3 or fewer
      patients without progression or death out of these 16 patients at week 16, the study will be
      stopped. Otherwise, 16 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 32 evaluable
      patients.

      Sulfatinib will be orally administered within 1 hour after breakfast once a day (QD) for
      every 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other
      protocol specified end-of-treatment criteria is met (which comes first).
