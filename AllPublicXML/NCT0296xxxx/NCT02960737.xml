      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a specific rehabilitation program
      with oral screen used in stroke patients with persistent oral-and pharyngeal dysphagia.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of oral screen training in stroke patients with
      persistent oral- and pharyngeal dysphagia 6 (±2) weeks after stroke onset.

      Interventional study with PROBE-design (prospective randomized open-label blinded evaluator).
      Randomization will be made web-based with minimization program. Patient with oral-and
      pharyngeal dysphagia within 96h after stroke stroke onset enrolled at Umeå stroke centre will
      be followed up at 6 (±2) weeks after stroke onset. Sixty stroke patients (30 intervention
      group; 30 control group) with persistent oral-and pharyngeal dysphagia 6 (±2) weeks after
      stroke onset will be included in the present study. The intervention group will be offered to
      undergo oral screen training alongside traditionally compensatory training for 3 months. The
      control group will only be offered traditionally compensatory training for 3 months.

      The participants' status regarding swallowing function, dysarthria, oral health, quality of
      life related to swallowing and somatic-and neurologic function will be assessed before and
      after completed intervention period, and 12-18 months post-intervention.

      The investigators hypothesis that swallowing intervention with oral screen is more effective
      than traditional rehabilitation.
