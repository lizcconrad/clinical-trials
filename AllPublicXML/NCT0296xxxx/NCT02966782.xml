      This is a Phase 1b, dose-ranging, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax as a single-agent and in combination with
      azacitidine in participants with higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) after
      Hypomethylating Agent (HMA)-Failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Subject must have failure of prior therapy with HMA for HR MDS as first-line MDS
        treatment with HMA-failure being defined as i) Relapse after initial complete or partial
        response or hematological improvement after at least 6 cycles of azacitidine or at least 4
        cycles of decitabine within the last 2 years or ii) Failure to achieve complete or partial
        response or hematological improvement after at least 6 cycles of azacitidine or at least 4
        cycles of decitabine within the last 2 years.

        Note: High-Risk MDS is defined as comprising International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)
        risk categories Int-2 or High (IPSS overall score ≥ 1.5)

          -  Subjects must have presence of ≥ 5% and &lt; 20% bone marrow blasts per bone marrow
             biopsy/aspirate at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has received more than 1 prior therapy for MDS. Note: Prior supportive care in

          -  Supportive care should be discontinued ≥ 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Subjects may continue oral corticosteroids for management of conditions other than MDS
             (e.g., asthma, rheumatoid arthritis) at a stable daily dose equivalent to ≤ 10 mg
             prednisone during screening and study participation.

          -  Subject had received prior HMA therapy with HMAs for lower-risk MDS with IPSS risk
             categories Low or Int-1 (overall IPSS score &lt; 1.5).

          -  Subject has received therapy other than azacitidine or decitabine for the treatment of
             MDS.

          -  Subject has received prior therapy with a BH3 mimetic.

          -  Subject has therapy-related MDS (t-MDS).

          -  Subject has MDS evolving from a pre-existing myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).

          -  Subject has MDS/MPN including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic
             myeloid leukemia (CML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and unclassifiable
             MDS/MPN.

          -  Subject has received allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplantation.
