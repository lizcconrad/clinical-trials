    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab induces relatively high response rates and
      promising response depth in late stage melanoma. Nevertheless, it takes time till responses
      occur and still a significant number of patients do not benefit from treatment, due to rapid
      progressive disease or resistance to therapy.

      In contrast to immunotherapies targeted therapies (BRAF or MEK inhibitors), can induce faster
      and higher response rates, but often of shorter duration, even when combined.

      Initial attempts of combining vemurafenib or dabrafenib + trametinib with ipilimumab failed
      due to toxicity.

      Patients with elevated levels of serum LDH are less likely to respond to immunotherapy
      compared to patients with normal LDH levels. This does not mean that such patients do not
      benefit at all from immunotherapy.

      This raises the question, whether response rates upon immunotherapy can be improved by
      upfront reduction of tumor burden and normalization of LDH.

      The investigators postulate that induction therapy with combined BRAF+MEK inhibition, and
      subsequent LDH normalization, can improve response rates to the rates seen in LDH normal
      patients.

      To address this question the investigators have setup a randomized phase 2 trial in
      metastatic melanoma patients with elevated serum LDH comparing the response rates upon
      ipilimumab + nivolumab versus ipilimumab + nivolumab preceded by 6 weeks of vemurafenib +
      cobimetinib induction.

      Furthermore, less than half of the patients treated with the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab received maintenance nivolumab, and approximately 40% of all patients discontinued
      treatment for toxicity. In 70% of patients responses were ongoing despite discontinuation of
      treatment due to toxicity. This raises the question, to what extent does maintenance therapy
      add clinical benefit to an ongoing immune response. Preclinical data indicate even that
      continuous restimulation of T cells can result in activation induced non-responsiveness
      (anergy).

      Therefore, a secondary objective of this trial will be, to test a response-driven nivolumab
      scheme

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective • To compare efficacy of induction vemurafenib + cobimetinib followed by
      ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm A) versus upfront ipilimumab + nivolumab treatment (Arm B).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe duration of response and overall survival induced by vemurafenib +
           cobimetinib followed by the combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm A) as compared to
           ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm B)

        -  To describe the rate and quality of toxicity observed in the two study arms

        -  To describe the rate of ongoing responses upon response-driven flat dose (240mg, q2w)
           nivolumab maintenance

        -  To determine the immune-activating capacity of induction therapy with vemurafenib +
           cobimetinib followed by the combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab.

        -  To evaluate the changes in systemic immune competence

      Study design:

      This is a two-arm phase 2 study consisting of 200 BRAFV600E/K mutation-positive late-stage
      melanoma patients with an elevated baseline LDH level (&gt; ULN, &lt; 3xULN) randomized 1:1
      (stratified according to LDH) to receive either vemurafenib + cobimetinib directly followed
      by ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm A) or standard first line ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm B).
      Subsequently, patients in both arms will receive flat dose (240mg, q2w) nivolumab maintenance
      in a response-driven manner.

      Study population:

      Stage IV, or unresectable stage III, BRAFV600E/K mutation positive melanoma patients, naïve
      for BRAF/MEK, PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 targeting therapy, 18 years and older.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 6 weeks vemurafenib 960 mg bid +
      cobimetinib 60 mg QD 21-day on, 7-day off (21/7) schedule, directly followed by 4 courses of
      ipilimumab 3mg/kg q3wk + nivolumab 1mg/kg q3wk (Arm A) or first line standard 4 courses of
      ipilimumab 3mg/kg q3wk + nivolumab 1mg/kg q3wk (Arm B).

      Subsequently, patients in both arms will receive nivolumab maintenance flat dose (240mg, q2w)
      in a response-driven manner according to their response at week 18.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary Endpoints

      • Compare the best overall response rate (BORR) according to RECIST 1.1 of both arms at week
      18 from start of treatment.

      Secondary Endpoints

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Percentage of grade 3/4 toxicities according to CTCv4.03

        -  Percentage of ongoing response, percentage of patients requiring re-induction, response
           percentage upon re-induction

        -  Changes in tumor-specific T cell responses
