      This study is conducted to obtain information about prostate cancer patients with bone
      metastases before the end of 2013. The incidence of second primary malignancies and overall
      survival in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer are of particular interest.
      Information from this study will serve as a historical reference for the REASSURE study
      (Background incidence study)

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men. Once it becomes
      metastatic, it poses a serious threat to the patients' quality of life and survival. The most
      common site of metastases is the skeletal system: Among castration-resistant prostate cancer
      patients bone metastases are involved in over 90% of metastatic cases.

      The development of new treatments has led to improved quality of life and prolonged lifetime
      among castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with metastases (mCRPC). A recent
      randomized clinical trial indicated significant improvement in survival and quality of life
      among patients with bone metastases treated with alpha emitter radium-223 as compared with
      placebo. To further evaluate the safety profile of Radium-223 in patients with castration
      resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases, Radium-223 alpha Emitter Agent in
      non-intervention Safety Study in mCRPC popUlation for long-teRm Evaluation (the REASSURE
      study), an international prospective observational single-arm cohort study was implemented as
      a post-marking requirement requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
      European Medicines Agency (EMA).

      In the case that new treatments improve the length and quality of life substantially, it can
      be challenging to obtain an appropriate comparison group in the post-authorization phase.
      This study is conducted to obtain information about prostate cancer patients with bone
      metastases before the end of 2013. The incidence of second primary malignancies and overall
      survival are of particular interest. Information from this study will serve as a historical
      reference for the REASSURE study

      <textblock>
        Patients with PC diagnosis in 1.1.1998 - 31.12.2013 and with bone metastases diagnosis or
        bone-directed treatments in 1.1.1998 - 31.12.2013 will be initially included into the large
        study population. From this initial population, the main analyses will concentrate on the
        following two populations:

          -  Prostate cancer patients with bone metastases (mPC), and

          -  Castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases (mCRPC)
