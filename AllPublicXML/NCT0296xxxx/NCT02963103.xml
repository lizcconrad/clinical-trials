          -  Patients received a kidney transplant at least 12 months before enrollment.

          -  Patients whose dosage of previous immunosuppressants has not been changed and remained
             for at least 4 weeks before enrollment, and blood trough level of cyclosporine is 100
             to 200 ng/mL.

          -  Patients who have the side effects (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gingival hyperplasia
             and hypertrichosis/hirsutism) during use of cyclosporine.

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.3 mg/dl at enrollment

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to enrollment, and agreed to use effective contraception during the trial.

          -  Patients considered clinically stable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have previously received an organ transplant other than a kidney.

          -  Patients who have had acute transplant rejection within 12 weeks, or acute transplant
             rejection requiring antilymphocyte therapy within 24 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients newly diagnosed malignant tumors after organ transplant, but the patients
             treated completely with basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are excepted.

          -  Patients who have an underlying disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

          -  Patients who have &quot;Creeping creatinine&quot; (a 20% increase in their creatinine for six
             months before their enrollment).

          -  Patients whose Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and/or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
             is twice higher than the normal range in the center.

          -  Patients who have liver cirrhosis.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients who had been HIV-positive.

             study's objectives.

          -  Patients who are receiving prohibited concomitant medications or who received those
             medications within 28 days of their enrollment.

          -  Patients who are currently participating in another clinical trial or who received the
