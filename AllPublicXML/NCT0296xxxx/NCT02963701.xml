      Primary objective To demonstrate the bioequivalence of a fixed dose combination tablet
      containing 400 mg Ibuprofen and 60 mg Pseudoephedrine-HCl vs. RhinAdvil® (2 tablets
      containing 200 mg Ibuprofen and 30 mg Pseudoephedrine-HCl) as a fixed dose combination tablet
      with respect to the analytes, ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine.

      Secondary objective To assess the bioequivalence of a fixed dose combination tablet
      containing 400 mg Ibuprofen and 60 mg Pseudoephedrine-HCl vs. RhinAdvil® (2 tablets
      containing 200 mg Ibuprofen and 30 mg Pseudoephedrine-HCl) as a fixed dose combination tablet

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy males and females according to the following criteria:

          -  Based upon a complete medical history, including physical examination, vital signs
             (Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical
             laboratory tests

          -  Age ≥21 to ≤50 years

          -  Minimum weight 50kg - both males and females

          -  Body Mass Index ≥18.5 to ≤29.9 kg/m2

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
             (GCP) and local legislation prior to admission to the trial

          -  Male or female patients. Women of childbearing potential1 must be ready and able to
             use highly effective methods of birth control per International Committee on
             Harmonisation (ICH) M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year
             when used consistently and correctly e.g. implants, injectables, combined hormonal
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, or surgical sterilisation (including
             hysterectomy). In addition to this, also a barrier method (e.g. male condom) will be
             required, if the female is not surgically sterilised. A list of contraception methods
             meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information. Abstaining from sexual
             activity (if this is the usual lifestyle of the subject) is considered an acceptable
             method of birth control.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate and
             Electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance at the discretion
             of the investigator

          -  Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          -  Any relevant Gastrointestinal (e.g. ulcera, hernia, bleedings and spasm), hepatic,

          -  Any relevant surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or
             relevant neurological disorders at the discretion of the investigator

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its
             excipients) as judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt;24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than
             10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to first drug administration

          -  Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the
             knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 14 days prior to randomisation

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day)

          -  Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration of the
             trial drug in this study)

          -  Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomisation or during the trial

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance at the
             discretion of the investigator

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre

          -  Unwilling to avoid excessive sunlight exposure

          -  Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong
             the QT/QTc interval within 14 days prior to administration or during the trial, and
             CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, amodiaquine, paclitaxel, rosiglitazone,

        Special exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with history of bronchospasm, rhinitis or urticaria associated with
             Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) - Asthma

             malabsorption or sucrase isomaltase deficiency

          -  Regular treatment with any systemically available medication (except hormonal
             contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy e.g. estrogens, L-thyroxine)

          -  Subjects, who report a frequent occurrence of migraine attacks

          -  For female subjects of childbearing potential only:

        Positive pregnancy test, pregnancy or planning to become pregnant during the study or
        within 2 months after study completion

          -  No adequate contraception during the study including three months before first dosing
             until 2 month after study completion.

          -  Lactation

        Administrative reasons:

          -  Subjects suspected or known not to follow instructions

          -  Subjects who are unable to understand the written and verbal instructions, in
             particular regarding the risks and inconveniences they will be exposed to during their
             participation in the study

        The exclusion criteria are chosen to assure that subjects with specific risks for
        administration of the investigational medicinal products and subjects with conditions,
        which may have an impact on pharmacokinetic parameters, cannot be included
