    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia is a common disease in children. Treatment of this disease by laparoscopic
      high ligation of the hernia sac has been accepted by domestic and foreign scholars. Since
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia was introduced in 1990,it has now become the most commonly
      performed hernia repair in children. The conventional approach this is done with2small
      trocars to 1trocar . however the wound complications of infection and pain and the recurrent
      rate have not been resolved. The aim of the study was to described a new way of
      extra-peritoneal high ligation of hernia sac. This method combines the single-port
      laparoscopic could eliminated rate of wound complications and recurrence in inguinal hernia
      repair in children. The investigators hoped that this study will prove that the
      extra-peritoneal single-port laparoscopic repair is at least a s effective and efficient as
      the conventional technique in the cure of inguinal hernia and may results in lower recurrence
      and reduce incidence of wound complications.
