    <textblock>
      In this 3-year successive research plan, investigators will conduct a prehospital randomized
      controlled trial to address the following question: In adult patients with non-traumatic
      cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitated by emergency medical technician
      (paramedic level) in the prehospital setting, will receiving endotracheal tube intubation
      cause a better chance of sustained recovery of spontaneous circulation and other survival
      outcomes like neurologically favorable status, comparing to those who receiving supraglottic
      airway device.
