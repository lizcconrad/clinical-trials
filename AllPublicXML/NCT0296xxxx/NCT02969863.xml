  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct an outpatient study testing two configurations of the bionic pancreas (bi-hormonal
      and insulin-only) with and without remote monitoring of hypoglycemia in 25 adult (≥ 18 years
      of age) subjects with type 1 diabetes in a random-order crossover study versus usual care
      with an insulin pump with and without remote monitoring of hypoglycemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to measure the safety of eliminating the glycemic monitoring
      that the investigators have done in all of the previous outpatient studies under both insulin
      only and bihormonal bionic pancreas control. The investigators are planning to transition the
      outpatient studies to an integrated bionic pancreas, the iLet, in the near future. The
      intended use of this device does not include remote monitoring, which would not be feasible
      on a commercial scale. Therefore, in this trial the investigators will test the effects on
      hypoglycemia of eliminating blood glucose related monitoring. In addition, the investigators
      will perform a pilot trial testing the effects of the bionic pancreas on food intake,
      exercise, weight and body composition. The primary purpose of this pilot is to assess the
      feasibility of performing these measurements in the context of a larger trial and to collect
      data that can be used to power sub-studies of pivotal trials looking at these outcomes.
      Finally, the investigators will test the accuracy of two new CGM devices to see if they have
      sufficient accuracy to provide glucose data to the bionic pancreas. If so, this would provide
      new options for users who may have difficulties with the only currently validated CGM for
      this purpose, the Dexcom G4 AP / G5 platform.

             not affect the safety of the study and are not expected to affect any outcome of the
             study, in the judgment of the principal investigator)

          -  Live within a 60 minute drive-time radius of the central monitoring location

             shows a technical problem or severe biochemical hypoglycemia without subject response
             and the subject does not answer their telephone (up to two individuals can share this
             role, but they must be willing to carefully coordinate with each other and the subject
             so that one of them is clearly designated as having this responsibility at any given
             time)

          -  Willing to wear one or two infusion sets and one Dexcom CGM sensor and change sets
             frequently (at least one new glucagon infusion set daily during bi-hormonal arms, and
             insulin infusion set every other day throughout the study)

          -  Willing to wear two additional CGM sensors that must be placed in the upper arm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent (e.g. impaired cognition or judgment)

             impaired memory, unable to speak and read English)

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment
             of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or the safety
             of the subject

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception Subjects must use
             acceptable contraception for the two weeks prior to the study, throughout the study
             and for the two weeks following the study.

        Acceptable contraception methods include: Oral contraceptive pill (OCP), Intrauterine
        Device (IUD, hormonal or copper), Male condoms, Female condoms, Diaphragm or cervical cap
        with spermicide, Contraceptive patch (such as OrthoEvra), Contraceptive implant (such as

          -  Unwilling or unable to refrain from drinking more than 2 drinks in an hour or more
             than 4 drinks in a day or use of marijuana during the trial

          -  Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the
             dose is stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia unawareness
             while taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics, even if by
             prescription, may be excluded according to the judgment of the principal investigator)

          -  History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia
             action of glucagon (e.g. liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e. active
             hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver, hemochromatosis,
             glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes significant compromise
             to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

             myocardial infarction, proximal LAD critical stenosis (Wellen's sign), prolonged QT
             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.
