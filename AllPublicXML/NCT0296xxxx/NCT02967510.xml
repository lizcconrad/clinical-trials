      A Phase 2, Dose-ranging, 12-week Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Parallel-group
      Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Three Formulations of Ultra-low Dose Estriol
      Vaginal Gel (0.005% Estriol Vaginal Gel, 0.002% Estriol Vaginal Gel, 0.0008% Estriol Vaginal
      Gel) for the Treatment of Vaginal Dryness in Postmenopausal Women with Vulvovaginal Atrophy.

      Vulvovaginal atrophy is a natural consequence of the progressive estrogen deficiency that
      occurs in menopause. Epidemiological data have indicated that about 50% of otherwise healthy
      women over 60 years of age experience symptoms related to urogenital atrophy such as vaginal
      dryness, dyspareunia, burning, itching, as well as urinary complaints or infections of the
      lower urinary tract. As these alterations frequently affect the quality of life of
      postmenopausal women, it is important for doctors to detect their presence and offer
      treatment options. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment of moderate to severe
      symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. One advantage of local treatment with estrogen is
      avoidance of first-pass liver metabolism, making it possible to use lower doses of estrogen
      compared with oral therapy; the local route also minimize systemic adverse effects. The
      search for therapeutic alternatives which may present improvements in relation to the current
      products has been encouraged.
