    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a severe disease, burdened with a poor prognosis (30% mortality at 2
      years, 30% of rehospitalization within 1 month). It is also a major cause of health burden
      representing between 1.5 and 2 billions euros per year in France. Approximately 75% of these
      costs are due to hospitalization.

      Besides physical examination and echocardiography, biology may help refine the diagnosis, but
      also could provide powerful prognostic parameters.

      This study aims to assess the value of ST2 in the management of patients admitted for HF to
      reduce readmission at one month.

      Background and rationale:

      Heart failure (HF) is a severe disease, burdened with a poor prognosis (30% mortality at 2
      years, 30% of rehospitalization within 1 month). It is also a major cause of health burden
      representing between 1.5 and 2 billions euros per year in France. Approximately 75% of these
      costs are due to hospitalization.

      Besides physical examination and echocardiography, biology may help refine the diagnosis, but
      also could provide powerful prognostic parameters. The natriuretic peptides are already
      available and widely used to this purpose. Other biomarkers such as fibrosis markers are
      promising. In a recently published preliminary work of a cohort of 180 cardiac patients, ST2
      is proving to be a powerful prognostic biomarker.

      This study aims to assess the value of ST2 in the management of patients admitted for HF to
      reduce readmission at one month.

      Primary and secondary endpoints:

      Primary endpoint:

      - Interest of ST2 to decrease rehospitalization at one month in patients admitted for HF in
      the cardiology department and / or Internal Medicine.

      Secondary objective:

        -  economic evaluation

        -  Clinical Target: mortality, stay at hospital duration

        -  Impact on biological markers of HF, renal function Population: Any adult being
           hospitalized for any type of HF. A total of 300 patients will be over a period of 36
           months, divided into 2 arms.

      Methods: interventional, randomized, opened: the two strategies &quot;ST2 available&quot; versus &quot;ST2
      not available&quot; will be compared The duration of patient participation is 12 months.
