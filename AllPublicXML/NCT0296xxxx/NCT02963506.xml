        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), determined by documented radiologic
             evidence fulfilling the Modified New York criteria for AS including symptoms for &gt;=3
             months and age of onset &lt;45 years

          -  Subject has moderate to severe active disease as defined by each of the following:

               1. BASDAI score &gt;=4

               2. Spinal pain &gt;=4 on a 0 to 10 NRS (Numeric Rating Scale; from BASDAI item 2)

          -  Subjects must have at least 1 of the following:

               1. inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy

               2. intolerance to administration of at least 1 NSAID

               3. contraindication(s) to NSAID therapy

          -  Subjects who are regularly taking NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors as part of their AS therapy
             are required to be on a stable dose for at least 14 days before Baseline

          -  Subjects taking corticosteroids must be on an average daily dose of &lt;=10mg/day
             prednisone or equivalent for at least 14 days before Baseline and should remain on a
             stable dose up to Week 16

          -  Subjects taking methotrexate (MTX) (&lt;=25mg/week) are allowed to continue their
             medication if started at least 12 weeks prior to Baseline, with a stable dose for at
             least 8 weeks before randomization

          -  Subjects taking sulfasalazine (up to 3grams/day) or hydroxychloroquine (up to 400mg
             per day total) are allowed to continue their medication if started at least 12 weeks
             prior to Baseline, with a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before randomization

          -  Subjects may be tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor-naïve or may have received 1
             prior TNF inhibitor. Subjects who have been on a TNF inhibitor previously must have:

               1. experienced an inadequate response to previous treatment given for at least 12
                  weeks

               2. been intolerant to administration (eg, had a side effect/adverse event that led
                  to discontinuation)

               3. lost access to TNF inhibitor for other reasons

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a total ankylosis of the spine, or a diagnosis of any other inflammatory
             arthritis eg, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or
             reactive arthritis

          -  Subjects with any current sign or symptom that may indicate an active infection

             life-threatening infection within the 6 months prior to the Baseline Visit

          -  Subjects receiving any live vaccination within the 8 weeks prior to Baseline

          -  Subjects with known tuberculosis (TB) infection, at high risk of acquiring TB
             infection, with latent TB infection or current or history of nontuberculous
             mycobacteria (NTMB) infection

          -  Subjects with concurrent malignancy or a history of malignancy during the past 5 years
             will be excluded, with following exceptions that may be included:

               1. &lt;= 3 excised or ablated basal cell carcinomas of the skin

               2. One squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (stage T1 maximum) successfully excised,
                  or ablated only (other treatments, ie, chemotherapy, do not apply), with no signs
                  of recurrence or metastases for more than 2 years prior to Screening

               3. Actinic keratosis (-es)

               4. Squamous cell carcinoma-in-situ of the skin successfully excised, or ablated,
