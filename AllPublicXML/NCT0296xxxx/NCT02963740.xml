  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that breast cancer survivors who need to lose
      weight are able to follow a weight loss program which combines modest calorie restriction
      with a graduated activity program..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feasibility will be assessed by 1) the number of women that complete the 3--month program; 2)
      the number of women that can achieve the targeted amount of physical activity per week by the
      end of the program; and 3) the median amount of physical activity achieved group by all
      subjects that complete the program.
