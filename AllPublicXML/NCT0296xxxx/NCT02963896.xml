  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical removal of vestibular schwannoma causes acute vestibular symptoms, including
      postoperative vertigo and oscilopsia due to nystagmus. In general, the dominant symptom
      postoperatively is vertigo. Preoperative chemical vestibular ablation can reduce vestibular
      symptoms postoperatively.

      Surgical removal of vestibular schwannoma causes acute vestibular symptoms, including
      postoperative vertigo and oscilopsia due to nystagmus. In general, the dominant symptom
      postoperatively is vertigo. Preoperative chemical vestibular ablation can reduce vestibular
      symptoms postoperatively. We used 1.0 ml of 40 mg/ml nonbuffered gentamicin in three
      intratympanic installations over 2 days, 2 months preoperatively in 10 patients. Reduction of
      vestibular function was measured by the head impulse test and the caloric test. Reduction of
      vestibular function was found in all gentamicin patient groups. After gentamicin vestibular
      ablation, patients underwent home vestibular exercising for two months. The control group
      consisted of 10 patients who underwent only home vestibular training two months
      preoperatively. Postoperative rate of recovery and vertigo in both groups were evaluated with
      the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), the Glasgow Health Status Inventory (GHSI) and the
      Dizziness Handicap Inventory questionnaires, as well as survey of visual symptoms by specific
      questionnaire developed by us.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The GBI questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The GBI questionnaire consists of 18 questions. The response to each question is based on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from a large deterioration to a large improvement in health status. The GBI questionnaire is scored into a total score, and also three subscales: a general subscale (12 questions), a social support subscale (three questions), and a physical health subscale (three questions). Score ranges were calculated and varied from -100 to +100. Score all questions so that a score of 1 is given to the answer with the worst change in health status and 5 to the answer with the best change in health status.</description>

    <measure>The GHSI questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The GHSI questionnaire contains of 18 questions; again, the response to each question is based on a five-point Likert scale ranging from high to low health status. It is also scored into a total score and three subscales: general, social, and physical health subscales. All these scores range from 0 to +100. Score all questions so that a score of 1 is given to the answer with the worst change in health status and 5 to the answer with the best change in health status.</description>

    <measure>The DHI questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The DHI contains 25 items and the range score is from 0 to +100, with a higher score indicating a more severe handicap.</description>
