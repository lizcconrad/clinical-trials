    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to design and evaluate a school-based hand washing program for
      children in Malawi, Sub-Saharan Africa, using a cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT),
      so as to improve proper hand washing, increase knowledge level and also reduce school
      absenteeism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) design with pre-, mid- and post-interventions
      and follow-up measures will be randomized into intervention or control groups. A simplified
      5-steps hand washing program will be implemented in the intervention group while the control
      group will continue with their usual practice where schoolchildren do not follow any standard
      recommended handwashing technique.
