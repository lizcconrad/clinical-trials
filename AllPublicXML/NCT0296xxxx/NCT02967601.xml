      Background Shivering occurs in circa 50 percent of cases during caesarean section under
      spinal anesthesia. The phenomenon's reasons and its mechanism are unclear, and while it does
      not endanger the patients' health, the sensations proved to be unpleasant and a subject of a
      number of patients' complains.

      Objectives The main objective of the study is to establish the anxiety factors that influence
      the risk of muscle-shivering and a detailed assessment of the probability of existence of the
      link between increased anxiety levels with the shivering in case of patients undergoing the
      elective caesarean section.

      Moreover, the outcomes of the study could help to further understand the phenomenon, reduce
      its occurence and as a result of that - improve the comfort of the patients in the
      perioperative period, as well as reduce the frequency of pharmacological treatment to halt
      the symptoms of muscle shivering.

      Methodology Patients would be asked to fill the STAI (State - Trait Anxiety Inventory)
      questionaire in the morning preceding the surgery. Results would be interpreted by one of the
      investigators, who obtained a masters degree in psychology. Caesarean section under spinal
      anesthesia would be performed according to standard procedures used in the Samodzielny
      Publiczny Szpital Kliniczny Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego (SPSK CMKP) hospital,
      with standard non-invasive monitoring (HR, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), oxygen
      saturation (SpO2), Temperature). Additionally, the anesthesiologist would note the incidence
      of shivering and its precise timing 1. since the spinal block 2. since the child-birth.
      Moreover, patients would rate anesthesiology team influence on her anxiety level during the
      cesarean section in 5 grade scale - data would be collected by psychologist.

      The survey is planned for a one year timespan or until 200 patients have enrolled.
