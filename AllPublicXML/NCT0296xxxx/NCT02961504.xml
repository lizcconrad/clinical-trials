    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HLCM051 on functional
      outcome in subjects with acute ischemic stroke and to evaluate the safety of HLCM051 in
      subjects with acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase 2/3 trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous administration of HLCM051 compared with
      placebo in subjects with acute ischemic stroke (within 36 hours of onset). Japanese subjects
      who developed a subcortical ischemic stroke and are eligible to participate in the trial will
      be evaluated.

      Approximately 220 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (HLCM051 group [n=110] or
      placebo group [n=110]) to receive a single infusion of HLCM051 or placebo.
