  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of VisioCyt test,
      which would improve the early diagnosis of bladder cancer in order to optimize the management
      of individual patients as part of a cancer diagnostic monitoring. The diagnostic method of
      VisioCyt® device is based on the analysis by transmission and fluorescence, of urinary
      cytology slides prepared according to the protocol VisioCyt.

      This clinical trial is divided into two main phases:

      I. The first one involves the construction of better image processing algorithm from a
      learning sample. The learning sample will include 600 virtual slides made from the urine
      sample of the first 600 patients enrolled.

      II. The second one, will evaluate from an evaluation sample, the diagnostic performance of
      the test VisioCyt, to identify patients with versus without bladder tumors, using as
      comparator the results of the examination of reference: histology. The evaluation sample will
      include 400 slides, made from the urine sample of the last 400 patients enrolled.
