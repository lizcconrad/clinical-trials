      This study is a Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase Ⅲ Trial to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of Live-Attenuated
      influenza Vaccine(LAIV) among healthy children and adolescents aged 3-17 years old. The
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio of LAIV to placebo. Each subject will be
      vaccinated with a single dose of LAIV or Placebo. For evaluation of efficacy, subjects
      meeting the protocol-defined clinical case definition the 14th day post-vaccination will have
      a nasal swab collected for testing by RT-PCR or virus culture for evidence of influenza virus
      infection. All adverse events will be collected 30 minutes, 0-30 days after vaccination and
      all serious adverse events during the entire trial period. Blood samples will be collected
      from a part of subjects before vaccination and at the 30th day after immunization. Serum
      samples will be centrifuged for detection of antibodies to H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B.
