  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is an important cause of disability and the third leading cause of death.

      Approximately 30 to 40 % of all strokes are estimated to be cryptogenic (i.e. no cause can be
      found). There have been few previous studies regarding risk stratification for stroke
      recurrence in patients with cryptogenic stroke.

      Recent studies have suggested that left atrial (LA) function is an important determinant of
      stroke risk. However, most studies focus on volume indices and LA dimensions, we also want to
      investigate other echocardiographic parameters. The aim of this study is to assess the
      predictive value of left atrial function for the risk of stroke recurrence and/or atrial
      fibrillation by transthoracic echocardiography in cryptogenic stroke patients with no proven
      atrial fibrillation (AF) and no indication for anticoagulants.

      Study design and population The investigators used a retrospective mono-centric case-control
      design and analyzed all patients admitted for cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient
      ischemic attack (TIA) between 2011 and 2014. The investigators searched for patients who had
      a recurrent CVA/TIA and/or who were diagnosed with newly documented AF during the study
      duration. Clinical, demographic and laboratory parameters were assessed. Echocardiographic
      parameters, measured on first admission, were analyzed using EchoPAC version 112.

      Statistical analysis Univariate analysis was performed for all covariates using the Cox
      proportional hazards model. Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine significance for
      all parameters.

      If covariates were significant at the 25% significance level, they were used in the
      multivariate model.

      Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model with backward
      elimination model selection. The Wald Chi-Square test was used to determine significance at
      5% significance level. The program used for analysis is SAS version 9.4.
