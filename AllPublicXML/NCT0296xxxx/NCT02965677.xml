      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Paclitaxel Releasing Peripheral Balloon Dilatation
      Catheter (LEGFLOW) compared with the standard balloon (Admiral Xtreme) for the treatment of
      stenosis or occlusions in femoral popliteal artery.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, prior desiged, randomize and controlled study, planned to
      enrol 172 subjects. all these subjects will be allocated 1:1 to the LEGFLOW OTW group n=86
      and Admiral Xtreme group n=86. and accept the treatment of LEGFLOW and Admiral Xtreme
      balloon. and followed up at day 0-30, month 6, 12 by DUS and clinical examination. all the
      endpoint data will be assessed by DUS core-lab, CEC, then be statisticed.

         15. Uncorrected bleeding disorder.

         17. Stenosis or occlusions due to non-atherosclerosis, such as thrombotic occlusive
             vasculitis or vasculitis.

         20. Pre-dilation resulted in a major (≥ Grade D) flow-limiting dissection or residual
             stenosis &gt; 70%.

             has not completed the primary endpoint.
