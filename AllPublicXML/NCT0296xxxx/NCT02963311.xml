  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females, â‰¥12 years of age with a diagnosis of homozygous familial
             hypercholesterolemia by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on a
             history of an untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration &gt;500
             mg/deciliter (dL) [13 millimoles/liter (mmol/L)] together with either xanthoma before
             10 years of age or evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in both
             parents.

          -  Stable on a low-fat diet.

          -  Stable on pre-existing, lipid-lowering therapies (such as statins,
             cholesterolabsorption inhibitors, bile-acid sequestrants, or combinations thereof) for
             at least 4 weeks with no planned medication or dose change for the duration of study
             participation.

          -  Fasting central lab LDL-C concentration &gt;130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) and triglyceride
             concentration &lt;400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L).

          -  Body weight of 40 kilograms (kg) or greater at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  LDL or plasma apheresis within 8 weeks prior to the screening visit, and no plan to
             receive it during the study because of the attendant difficulty in maintaining stable
             concentrations of LDL-C while receiving apheresis.

          -  Use of mipomersen or lomitapide therapy within 5 months of screening.

          -  Previous treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed towards PCSK9 within 8 weeks of
             screening.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.
