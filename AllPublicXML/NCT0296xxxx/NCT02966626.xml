    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is creating a health pandemic globally. Management of type 2 diabetes
      involves combination of lifestyle intervention and drug intervention, which includes
      sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin
      (ForxigaÂ®) was approved by the Malaysian Drug Authority for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
      in 2014. This study will describe the characteristics of patients who are prescribed
      dapagliflozin by diabetologists/endocrinologists in a tertiary referral center and describe
      their glycaemic control, weight, and renal function at baseline and during use of
      dapagliflozin.

      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes among adults &gt;18 years old is 17.5% in Malaysia, where half
      of them are undiagnosed. Diabetes also accounts for 14.5% of all-cause mortality worldwide,
      with close to half of the deaths are in subjects &lt;60 years old. These highlight the
      importance of early diagnosis of disease, timely intervention with appropriate therapy, and
      treating type 2 diabetes patients to goal to prevent the development of complications.

      Asian type 2 diabetes phenotypes are different than Caucasians, i.e. significant pancreatic
      beta-cell dysfunction, higher visceral adiposity, more vulnerable to cardio-renal
      complications. Although clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors have been published, real-world
      data on the use of this new class of antidiabetic medication is still lacking, in
      particularly among Asians.

        All adult type 2 diabetes patients who received at least one prescription for dapaglifozin
        for the first time between March 2014 and December 2015 in the University of Malaya Medical
        Center (UMMC) will be recruited. UMMC is an academic medical institution with 1,300 beds,
        serving a population of 1.8 million in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

        The date of the first prescription for dapaglifozin in the Hospital Pharmacy Database is
        defined as the index date. Dapaglifozin is only available at the study site from March 2014
        onwards.
