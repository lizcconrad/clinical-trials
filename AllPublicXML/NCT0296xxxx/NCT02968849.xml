      This study will evaluate the preventive vaccine efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) + Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 in HIV-seronegative South African adults

      This study will evaluate the preventive vaccine efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the
      ALVAC-HIV vaccine + Bivalent Subtype C gp120 protein adjuvanted with MF59 in HIV-seronegative
      South African adults over 24 months from enrollment.

      Participants will be randomized to receive ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438), or placebo, by intramuscular
      injection at weeks 0 and 4; they will receive ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) + Bivalent Subtype C
      gp120/MF59, or placebo, by IM injection at weeks 12, 24, and 52.

      In addition to the vaccination visits, participants will attend study visits at weeks 26, 39,
      54, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130, 142, and 156. All study visits, including vaccination visits,
      will include HIV risk reduction counseling, a physical exam, and an interview/questionnaire.
      and pregnancy testing for participants capable of becoming pregnant. Select study visits will
      include a medical history review, physical exam, blood collection, urine collection, HIV
      testing, and pregnancy testing for participants capable of becoming pregnant.

          -  Any other contraceptive method approved by the protocol safety review team;

               -  Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having been diagnosed with premature
                  menopause (with no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral

                       through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro
                       fertilization until 3 months after the last vaccination

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Blood products received within 90 days before first vaccination

          -  Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination

          -  Intent to participate in another study of an investigational research agent or any

             the study

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For volunteers who have received
             control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 702 PSRT will determine eligibility
             on a case-by-case basis.

          -  Non-HIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine
             trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure.
             For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the
             protocol safety review team will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis. For
             volunteers who have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago,
             eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the protocol safety review team on a
             case-by-case basis.

             participation: a volunteer who had a non-anaphylactic adverse reaction to pertussis

             process includes but is not limited to:

               -  A process that would affect the immune response,

               -  A process that would require medication that affects the immune response,

               -  Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws,

               -  A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert
                  grave danger to the volunteer's health or well-being during the study period,

               -  A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with
                  reactions to vaccine, or

               -  Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria below.

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol
             adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a volunteer's ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension: systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mm Hg

          -  Bleeding disorder (diagnosed by a doctor) contraindicating IM injection and/or blood
             draws, based on investigator's judgment

             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)
