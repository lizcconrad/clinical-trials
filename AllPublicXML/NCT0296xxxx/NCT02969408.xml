  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the relationship between ABS
      eMDPI and clinical asthma exacerbation (CAE) in adult patients at least 18 years of age with
      exacerbation-prone asthma. The ABS eMDPI dose will be 90 mcg, 1 to 2 inhalations every 4
      hours as needed, but patient dosing will not be limited to this dosing regimen. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the relationship between albuterol dosing and CAE.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has had at least 1 episode of a severe CAE over the past 12 months before
             screening.

          -  The patient is using a moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) equivalent to at
             least 440 mcg daily of fluticasone propionate.

          -  The patient's baseline asthma therapy regimen, including oral corticosteroids,
             leukotriene antagonists, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, long-acting beta agonist (LABA),
             long-acting muscarinic agent, or cromolyn, biologicals, theophylline, or mepolizumab,
             is allowed.

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study requirements as specified in

          -  The patient is willing to discontinue all other rescue or maintenance short-acting
             beta2 agonist (SABA or antimuscarinic agents and replace them with the study-provided
             ABS eMDPI for the duration of the trial.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or â‰¥2 years postmenopausal)
             must have exclusively same-sex partners or use a highly effective method of birth

          -  The patient has used an investigational drug within 5 half-lives of it being
