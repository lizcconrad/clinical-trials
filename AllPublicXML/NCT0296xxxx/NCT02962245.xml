    <textblock>
      The research aim to find out whether berberine can reduce the annual recurrence rate of
      ulcerative colitis in remission.

      A total of 238 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission will be randomly divided into
      two groups.One will receive regular treatment,and the other group will receive extra oral
      berberine 300 mg three times daily for a year.

      The end of the study for every patient is disease recurrence(Mayo Clinic score of 3 points or
      more ).

      The primary analysis is annual recurrence rate, and both endoscopy and Mayo Clinic disease
      activity index scores at the baseline and final assessments.

    <description>The primary analysis is disease exacerbation through day 14 among patients who underwent randomization, had Mayo Clinic disease activity index scores at the baseline and final assessments. Disease exacerbation is defined as a total Mayo Clinic score of 5 points or more and an increase in the endoscopic score of 1 point or more.</description>
