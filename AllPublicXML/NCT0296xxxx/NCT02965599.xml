  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3117391 has the potential to complement existing therapies in the treatment of chronic
      inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral GSK3117391 (Dose A) administered to subjects with
      severe RA despite treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This is a
      randomised, double-blind (sponsor open), multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study. The total maximum study duration is approximately 10 weeks. Following a screening
      period of up to 28 days, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to placebo or GSK3117391 (Dose A)
      administered orally for a period of 28 days. Subjects will be followed up for 7 to 14 days
      post final dose. Approximately 40 subjects with severe RA will be randomised into the study.

    <description>The DAS is a derived measurement with differential weighting given to each component. The DAS 28(CRP) will be calculated at each assessment timepoint. The components of the DAS 28 arthritis assessment include: Tender/Painful Joint Count (28), Swollen Joint Count (28), C-reactive protein (CRP), Subject's Global Assessment of Arthritis</description>

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, other situations judged by physician, is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function</description>

Similarly, ACR50 and 70 are calculated with the respective percent improvement.</description>

                  or T-spot test not approved or registered in country of participation, then a
                  negative tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction as per local guidelines is required
                  (it is strongly recommended that subjects with a history of BCG vaccination be
                  tested with QuantiFERON gold test).
