    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of
      participants with radioiodine (131 I)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and
      radiographic evidence of disease progression within the prior 12 months treated with
      lenvatinib 24 mg by continuous once daily (QD) oral dosing versus placebo.

      This study will be conducted in 3 phases: a Prerandomization Phase, a Randomization Phase,
      and an Extension Phase. The Extension Phase will consist of the Optional Open Label (OOL)
      Lenvatinib Treatment Period and the Follow-up Period.

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurred first) or up to approximately 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) as determined by blinded independent imaging review (IIR) conducted by the imaging core laboratory using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Disease progression, per RECIST v1.1, is defined as at least a 20% relative increase and 5 millimeter (mm) absolute increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study), recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurred first) or up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in the short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug until date of death from any cause or up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up and participants who are alive at the date of data cut-off will be censored at the date the participants were last known to be alive.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>For each participant, from the time of administration of the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the administration of the last dose of study drug or up to resolution of adverse event or up to study completion or up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. TEAEs are defined as AEs that start/increase in severity on/after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the final dose of study drug. An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: results in death; is life threatening; results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life function; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or can be defined as any other important medical event.</description>
