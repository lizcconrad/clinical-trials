  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our multi-disciplinary research group works closely with people who have obstructive sleep
      apnoea (OSA). This is a life-long illness that causes breathing to stop during sleep, which
      leads to low-oxygen in the blood. Breathing restarts when the airway at the back of the
      throat reopens, usually during arousal from sleep. In some people the repeated arousals from
      sleep cause daytime sleepiness. Our research has shown that the low blood oxygen levels
      affect thinking and feeling, and in some cases we think it damages the brain cells involved
      with memory, attention, emotions and decision-making.

      This study will investigate the relationship between the amount of oxygen in the blood and
      the loss (if any) of brain cells. Also how the ability to perform complex tasks is affected
      in patients that suffer from sleep apnoea. The results will show whether the brain damage in
      patients with sleep apnoea can be reversed with treatment. These findings will guide doctors
      in the treatment for sleep apnoea and they will cast light onto the process of memory decline
      with the aim to preserve brain function.

      This is a prospective, observational physiological study, which is anticipated to last for 4
      years. It has been calculated that a minimum of 14 patients with untreated OSA will be
      studied.

      In order to study the mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in OSA, participants will start
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment following the confirmed diagnosis of
      sleep apnoea. CPAP is the treatment of choice for patients with moderate to severe OSA who
      are sleepy during the day. It is also used in patients with mild OSA if they are excessively
      sleepy or suffer from cardiovascular risk factors. It is recommended by the the National
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a treatment for adults with moderate or
      severe OSA (Sleep apnoea - continuous positive airway pressure, NICE 2008). In the proposed
      study the initiation of CPAP will be within the 18 week period set out in the National Health
      Service (NHS) Improvement Plan and Standards for Better Health (Standards for Better Health,
      Department of Health 2004). No patient with a diagnosis of OSA will commence treatment with
      CPAP later than advised by the NICE guidelines of clinical judgement for the best interest of
      the patient.

      In order to investigate the neuroinflammation process and discrete changes in the brain of
      patients with OSA, 7 patients with mild and 7 patients with moderate to severe OSA will
      undergo 3 months of CPAP treatment following initial sleep (assessment) study. They will
      undergo a dynamic Positron Emission Tomography Magnetic Resonance (PET-MR) scan with the
      translocator protein (TSPO) tracer [18F]DPA-714 at the time of enrolment to the study and
      after 3 months of treatment. Each participant will also have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) scan before and after 3 months of treatment with a CPAP mask.

    <description>All participants in both groups will be started on Auto-titrating CPAP treatment, using standard clinical procedures. In order to facilitate the smooth initiation of CPAP all participants will receive a telephone call after 1 week from a member of the research team. This can be followed up by a hospital visit if required. CPAP is the gold-standard treatment for OSA and can be delivered using a number of different masks. Each of these is CE marked and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of OSA, the interface used will be determined by clinical availability and patient preference. Treatment compliance will be considered as a cofactor.</description>

      Participants will be invited to donate samples (blood or saliva) to the BRC Bioresource. In
      order to have statistical power for genetic analysis, samples from INcOSA participants will
      need to be combined with those from the OSA BioResource (Research Tissue Bank) volunteers who
      have provided consented biological samples for future research.

      These samples may be used for genetic, epigenetic, metabolomic or proteomic analysis.
