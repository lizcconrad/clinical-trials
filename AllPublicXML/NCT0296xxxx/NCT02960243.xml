  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is the gold standard treatment for Essential Tremor (ET). ET is
      a movement disorder which causes the arms, feet, fingers, head or voice to involuntarily
      shake. The DBS surgical procedure involves implanting an electrode deep within the brain
      which blocks damaging signals that cause the tremor. Essential Voice Tremor (EVT) is the
      vocal manifestation of ET and a number of individuals have both ET and EVT, and when these
      patients are implanted for their ET, their EVT symptoms are often also mitigated. This study
      aims to quantify the effects of DBS on EVT by testing on these ET+EVT patients. In addition
      to this, we hope to determine which hemisphere of the brain is responsible for larynx
      control: left or right.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in adults, affecting approximately
      5% of individuals over the age of 65. Of this 5%, roughly 20% of these patients suffer from
      Essential Voice Tremor (EVT): the phonatory manifestation of ET. Patients with EVT lose their
      ability to speak due to a tremor in the muscles of the larynx, pharynx, palate, and tongue.
      Because of this, an individual's quality of life is limited because they can no longer
      communicate effectively.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify to what degree Deep Brain Stimulation improves
      Essential Voice Tremor. In addition to this, we hope to examine which brain hemisphere is
      responsible for these positive results: right, left, or both, in a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded manner. By finding out more about the subcortical control underpinning speech,
      we will be able to improve our treatments and understanding of EVT and other neurological
      speech disorders.

    <description>Participants with bilateral thalamic DBS will be tested four times over 90 minutes. The four tests will include the following in a randomized, double-blinded order:
First test: both stimulators on for 15 minutes Second test: left stimulator off, right stimulator on for 15 minutes Third test: left stimulator on, right stimulator off for 15 minutes Fourth test: both stimulators off for 15 minutes
In between switching to each test, there will be a 5 minute washout period.</description>
