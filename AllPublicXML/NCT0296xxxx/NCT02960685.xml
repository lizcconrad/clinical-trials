  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Given that an experienced physician is not always available 24 hours a day,
      immediately and always available echocardiography is usually impossible in the emergency
      department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU). To compensate this limitation, the
      investigators have investigated that offsite expert guided, inexperienced
      practitioner-performed ultrasonography could be effectively performed. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to investigate whether the offsite expert can effectively evaluate the
      visually estimated ejection fraction (EF) while watching and guiding the echocardiographic
      procedure of onsite novice examiner using the social network video calling chat.

      Methods: sixty patients presenting to the ICU and requiring echocardiography will be
      included. Sixty novice practitioners without any previous experience of echocardiography will
      participate. Prior to their procedure, the onsite expert complete the echocardiography in
      advance and determine the EF using the modified Simpson's method (MSM, Reference value).
      Then, the novice physicians perform the echocardiography again with the offsite expert's
      guidance via video call. They obtain parasternal long and short axis view and EF is visually
      estimated to the nearest 5% (ex. 40%, 45% and etc) by the offsite expert while watching the
      ultrasound video on the smartphone display. The subjects requiring immediate management due
      to severe symptoms were excluded in this study. Interobserver variability between the
      calculated by onsite expert and visually estimated by offsite expert was assessed. The
      agreement of the visual estimated EF obtained by onsite expert and offsite expert via
      smartphone was evaluated by linear regression and Bland-Altman plots.
