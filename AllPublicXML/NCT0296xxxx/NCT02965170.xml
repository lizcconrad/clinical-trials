  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Validating a peptide-based laboratory test enabling the measurement of Tysabri® serum levels
      (pharmacokinetics, PK) in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing therapy. The results of this
      newly developed test will be compared to Tysabri® serum levels measured in parallel using an
      independent test. We will also simultaneously measure a pharmacodynamic marker of Tysabri®,
      receptor saturation levels on blood immune cells, which is thought to correlate with Tysabri®
      serum levels.

    <textblock>
      From a single site, consenting patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis who are
      currently begin treated with Tysabri® (natalizumab) and meeting the eligibility criteria will
      be asked to provide blood samples on the same day, and prior to, a scheduled infusion of
      Tysabri® 300 mg IV. Up to 500 patients will be enrolled in this study. Each patient may be
      asked to donate blood up to 2 times (one blood draw per cycle) to obtain longitudinal data
      points. Each patient will also be asked to fill out a wellness patient reported outcome (PRO)
      questionnaire along with the blood draws
