  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab work in
      treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma. Biological therapies, such as talimogene
      laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Giving talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with
      melanoma by shrinking the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the durable response rate of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC)
      in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) following progression on prior anti-PD-1 or
      anti-PD-L1 therapy alone or in combination with other agents different from T-VEC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial
      responses) in the injected lesions.

      II. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) in the non-visceral, non-injected lesions.

      III. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) in the visceral lesions (Cohort A).

      IV. To estimate the overall objective response rate (ORR). V. To estimate the median
      progression-free survival (PFS). VI. To estimate the median overall survival (OS). VII. To
      evaluate the toxicity of the regimen.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether adding T-VEC to PD1 blockade can increase T-cell infiltration into
      tumors and whether change in T-cell infiltration is associated with response.

      II. To evaluate whether adding T-VEC to PD1 blockade can increase T-cell receptor (TCR)
      clonality in tumors and in peripheral blood and whether increased TCR clonality is associated
      with response.

      III. To evaluate whether intra-tumoral injection of T-VEC is associated with the tumor immune
      microenvironment.

      IV. To evaluate whether tumor mutational load and mutations in the IFN pathway is associated
      with response to T-VEC plus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) therapy in the anti-PD1/L1 therapy
      refractory melanoma patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intralesionally (IL) and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18
      courses for talimogene laherparepvec and 36 courses for pembrolizumab in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2
      years and then annually for a total of 5 years.

RECIST 1.1 will be applied, but with the following restrictions: 1) considering only the injected lesions as target lesions, 2) considering only the non-injected lesions as target lesions,3) considering only the visceral lesions as target lesions and 4) across all lesions. 95% confidence intervals will be constructed for the estimated rates.</description>

    <measure>DRR (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the association between durable response rate and CD8 T-cell infiltration in the injected tumors using a two-sample t-test to test for difference in mean quantitative CD8 expression between patients who have a durable response and patients who do not have a durable response. If the distributions are far from normal or subject to influential points, then instead of t-tests, robust, rank based or non-parametric alternatives such as the Wilcoxon test will be used. The analysis will be repeated to assess the association between durable response rate and CD8 T-cell infiltration in the non-injected tumors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in T-cell infiltration (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>CD8 expression levels will be compared using a paired t-test. Among patients that progress, the analysis will be repeated to compare CD8 expression at progression to baseline with the understanding that there is potentially informative missingness in that patients who do not progress may have higher infiltration.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in increased T-cell infiltration (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Associated with higher DRR. The change in CD8 expression between week 2 and baseline will be computed and compared to the change in CD8 expression between durable responders and non-durable responders using a two-sample t-test at the two-sided 0.05 level.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in T cell receptor (TCR) clonality levels assessed in peripheral blood (Cohort A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Will compute the clonality metric as the normalized Shannon entropy for all patients at baseline and week 2. The change in clonality metric will be computed and compared between durable responders and non-durable responders using a two-sample t-test with significance determined at the two-sided alpha=0.05 level.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in TCR clonality within tumor assessed in peripheral blood (Cohort B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Will test for difference in mean normalized Shannon entropy for all patients. The analysis will be repeated to compare TCR clonality at progression to baseline among patients who progress. To assess the hypothesis that TCR clonality is higher in patients who respond to the combination therapy, suggesting that the T-cells are targeting the tumor, the clonality metric will be computed as the normalized Shannon entropy for all patients at baseline and week 2. The change in clonality will be compared between durable responders and non-durable responders using a two-sample t-test with significance determined at the two-sided alpha=0.05 level. The analyses examining TCR clonality in peripheral blood will be repeated.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in tumor microenvironment following talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Will examine the expression of approximately 10 candidate immune markers: PD-L1, PD-1, dendritic cell markers (CD80, CD86), immune suppressive cell markers (anti-FoxP3 for regulatory T cell [Treg], anti-CD68 antibody for macrophage, clone PG-M1, DAKO, anti-CD14 for monocyte, and CD15 for granulocytes). For each marker, a difference in expression will be tested between baseline and the 2 weeks using paired t-tests at the alpha = 0.005 level to accommodate multiple comparisons. The association between change in expression level of each marker (from baseline to 2 weeks) with response using a two-sample t-test at the alpha = 0.005 level will be tested.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>T-VEC effect on mutational load (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The per megabase mutation rate for each individual will be calculated. Then a paired t-test will be used to compare the mutation rate at 2 weeks to the mutation rate at baseline. To estimate the anticipated power, it is assumed that a paired t-test will be used (although the distribution of mutational load is highly skewed, the change in mutational load may be sufficiently well behaved).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mutational load (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the association between overall mutational load at each time point, separately, and durable response rate. Logistic regression to regress response status on the mutation rates (at baseline or at week 2) and use a 1-df test to obtain a p-value for the association between durable response and mutation rate will be used.</description>

             &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12
             consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective
             contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent
