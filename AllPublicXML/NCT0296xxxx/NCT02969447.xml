    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized trail which compare 2 regimens for third-stage management after second
      trimester medical pregnancy termination : 10UI intra venous oxytocin or no additional
      medication after fetal expulsion. Primary outcome was the incidence of placental retention.

    <textblock>
      Complication of third stage of labor in second trimester medical pregnancy termination is not
      well studied. Accord to publications, the placental retention rate is 30 to 40% in these
      situations. Placental retention may be associated with increased blood loss, increased
      requirement for blood transfusion anesthetic and operative complications, and infectious
      morbidity. The high incidence of retained placenta is an area of clinical concern.
      Publications reveal a wide variation in practices but there are only few studies about third
      stage of labor in second trimester medical pregnancy termination. The study is a prospective
      randomized trial. Two third stage management strategies are compared: 10 units of intra
      venous oxytocin (group 1) and no additional medication (group 2) after fetal expulsion. It
      concerns pregnancies between 14 and 28 weeks gestation.
