  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to investigate how smoking increasing potency of
      THC (i.e., the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) changes tobacco cigarette smoking
      behavior, urges, subjective effects, and abuse liability. This study will be a
      within-subjects, placebo-controlled study in our clinical laboratory of the effect of active
      vs. placebo marijuana on cigarette puff topography, exhaled carbon monoxide, urge, subjective
      effects, and abuse liability among 7 adults who smoke both marijuana and tobacco cigarettes.

      The study requires a total of three visits to Battelle's laboratory: one screening visit and
      two experimental visits. The screening visit will determine eligibility into the study. If
      eligible, participants will smoke a tobacco cigarette through the Clinical Research Support
      System (CReSS) puff topography device. Enrolled participants will attend two separate 5-hour
      experimental visits. Participants will be randomly assigned the order of THC potency (active
      or placebo), with the assignment blocked by sex. When participants arrive at the laboratory
      for each visit, they will provide biologic samples to verify compliance with pre-study
      instructions and then will be taken to a specially ventilated smoking chamber. They will be
      connected to a continuously-monitoring heart rate and blood pressure machine so that their
      vital signs can be observed throughout the smoking session. A research assistant will give a
      marijuana cigarette to the participant. A research assistant will light the cigarette and
      then exit the room. Participants will follow tape-recorded instructions for smoking the
      marijuana cigarette through the CReSS device. Upon completion of smoking the marijuana
      cigarette, participants will complete the Tobacco Craving Questionnaire via paper and pencil
      and will then be allowed to smoke one of his own tobacco cigarettes through the CReSS puff
      topography device. Participants will be allowed to smoke as many tobacco cigarettes as they
      would like for the next 3 hours. Participants will then be given lunch and sent home via
      taxicab. All participants will receive both potencies (i.e., active and placebo) of
      marijuana. The active potency of marijuana will be 5.6% THC.
