      This is a study of health economics longitudinal cohort on the evaluation of direct medical
      cost of a surgical technique based on the use of an innovative device (the da VinciÂ® surgical
      robot Si) and its comprehensive care.

      Over 50,000 thyroidectomies are performed each year in France. The externally surgery
      produces satisfactory results, but it nevertheless remains a risk of complications in the
      order of 10 to 20%. Moreover, the patients operated by traditional externally have a
      basi-cervical visible scar which is a major concern for many of them. The team of Montpellier
      University Hospital is a pioneer in the use of the technique of endoscopic thyroidectomy
      under robotic assistance that saves totally cervical scarring for patients, but also decrease
      the rate of complications. This technique based on the use of the da Vinci robotic system if
      justified, depending on the manufacturer and the scientific literature, with its minimally
      invasive character, an amplitude of greater movement than the hand of man, and movements
      called intuitive that reduce tremors instruments during the operation (Patel 2008). In France
      and in Europe, there is a growing demand from patients and surgeons to access the surgical
      technique. An assessment of the real and specific cost of this technique and its overall
      management is essential in order to assess the financial impact of the introduction of this
      surgery for our hospitals, or no data is available on this in Literature.

      The main objective of this study is to describe the direct medical cost of the treatment of
      thyroid Lobo-Isthmectomy Robot-Assisted (LIRA) with a follow-up 12 months. The secondary
      objectives of this research are to determine the rate of laryngeal paralysis, the rate of
      complications specific to access axillary robot, the size of the incision made for surgery,
      the number of channel conversion transaxillary assisted robot traditional externally, to
      assess the satisfaction of each patient over his scar, pain over time, the evolution of
      potential disorders sensitivity of anterior chest wall, the vocal functional suites and
      quality of life self-administered questionnaire (Voice handicap Index VHI 10 and Short Forme
      SF-36), and finally to compare the cost of care by the robot with the average cost of a
      conventional surgery.
