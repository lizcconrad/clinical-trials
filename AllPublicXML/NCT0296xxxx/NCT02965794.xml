      EVALUATE THE CARE PROCESS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR ADULT CANCER PATIENTS WHO ARE ADMITTED
      FOR COLORECTAL SURGERY

    <textblock>
      This descriptive study uses an interrupted time series approach combining a retrospective
      with a prospective multicenter design to evaluate the current state of the care process for
      adult colorectal cancer patients who are admitted for surgery. This study will give attention
      to evidence based key interventions, follow-up and interprofessional teamwork necessary to
      provide appropriate care. In 4 countries (Belgium, Germany, France and The Netherlands) 3
      hospitals will participate (total number of hospitals is 12). They will perform a clinical
      audit of the actual organization of the care process, and a team audit on the level of
      interprofessional teamwork. Each team will develop and implement a quality improvement
      initiative based on the concept of care pathways, the findings from the audit and the
      available evidence, and will measure the effect of their improvement strategy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All consecutive scheduled admissions starting September 2, 2013;

          2. Minimum age of 18 years;

          3. Elective admission for colorectal cancer surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Emergency (not planned) admission for colorectal cancer surgery;

          2. Patients with severe dementia (DSM IV) or severe concomitant disease that may affect
             very short-term outcome (life expectancy less than 3 months) and hence influence
             deviations from standard acute care.
