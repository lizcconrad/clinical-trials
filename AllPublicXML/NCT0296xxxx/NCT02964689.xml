  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of binimetinib in combination
      with pemetrexed and cisplatin, and to demonstrate that the combination is feasible and has
      preliminary activity in previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC and documented KRAS
      mutations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for more effective therapies for patients with advanced NSCLC driven by the
      RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. These tumors are generally aggressive, are almost exclusively of
      non-squamous histology, and represent the largest group of patients with advanced NSCLC
      harboring specific driver mutations in Western populations.

      Based on recent preclinical and clinical evidence, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
      (MEK)-inhibition plus first-line chemotherapy is a promising new treatment for patients with
      NSCLC and KRAS [v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog] mutations.

      Binimetinib is a medication without marketing authorization. Pemetrexed and cisplatin have
      marketing authorization in Switzerland and in EU for the treatment of non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) and will be administered as standard backbone treatment according to their
      Swissmedic-approved indication, dose and route of administration. Binimetinib, pemetrexed and
      cisplatin are IMP in the context of this phase I trial.
