      Phase 1 study to evaluate two doses of Alum Adjuvanted Zika Virus Purified Inactivated
      Vaccine (ZPIV) administered 28 days apart. The study will enroll 75 flavivirus naïve healthy
      adult subjects into 3 equal groups sequentially. Each group will include 20 ZPIV recipients
      and 5 placebo recipients. Group 1 will receive two ZPIV or placebo doses 28 days apart. Those
      in Group 1 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive 5.0 mcg dose of ZPIV or placebo
      administered IM on Day 224. Group 2 subjects will receive a two-dose regimen of IXIARO® 28
      days apart; two ZPIV or placebo doses three months later 28 days apart. Those in Group 2 who
      consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on Day 336. Group 3 subjects will receive one
      dose of YF-VAX® followed three months later by two ZPIV or placebo doses 28 days apart. Those
      in Group 3 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on Day 308. In each group, those
      who do not agree to receive the third ZPIV dose will be followed based on the schedule. The
      primary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose homologous
      prime boost regimen of ZPIV among flavivirus-naïve, YF-VAX® primed, and IXIARO® primed
      subjects; 2) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a third dose of ZPIV in consenting
      subjects.

      This study is a single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, Phase 1
      study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two doses of alum
      adjuvanted Zika Virus Purified Inactivated Vaccine (ZPIV) administered 28 days apart. The
      study will enroll 75 flavivirus naïve healthy male and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female
      adult subjects (ages 18-49, inclusive) into 3 equal groups sequentially, starting with Group
      1 followed by Group 2 and then Group 3. Screening will occur within 40 days of first
      vaccination. Each group will include 20 ZPIV recipients and 5 placebo recipients. Two
      sentinel subjects from Group 1 will be enrolled first and will receive ZPIV in an open-label
      fashion first. The next 23 subjects (18 ZPIV, 5 placebo) will be randomized into Group 1.
      This will be followed by the randomization of 25 subjects into Group 2 (JE priming). The
      remaining 25 subjects to enroll will be randomized into Group 3 (YF priming). Group 1
      subjects will receive two 5.0 mcg doses of ZPIV or placebo administered IM on Days 1 and 29.
      Those in Group 1 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive 5.0 mcg dose of ZPIV or
      placebo administered IM on Day 224. Group 2 subjects will receive a two-dose regimen of
      IXIARO® (Valneva) 28 days apart; two ZPIV or placebo doses will be administered three months
      later IM 28 days apart. Those in Group 2 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on
      Day 336. Group 3 subjects will receive one dose of YF-VAX® (Sanofi Pasteur) followed three
      months later by two ZPIV or placebo doses administered IM 28 days apart. Those in Group 3 who
      consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on Day 308. In each group, those who do not
      agree to receive the third ZPIV dose will be followed based on the schedule. The primary
      objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose homologous prime
      boost regimen of ZPIV among flavivirus-naïve, YF-VAX® primed, and IXIARO® primed subjects; 2)
      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a third dose of ZPIV in consenting subjects. The
      secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28 days
      after the first and second ZPIV administration, and 112, 196, 280, and 364 days after the
      first ZPIV administration for each of the three groups in subjects who consent to two doses
      of ZPIV; 2) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28 days after the first
      and second ZPIV administration, and 112, 196, 224 days after the first ZPIV administration
      and at 28, 84, and 168 days after the third ZPIV administration for Group 1 subjects who
      consent to third dose; 3) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28 days
      after the first and second ZPIV administration, and 112, 224 days after the first ZPIV
      administration and at 28, 84, and 168 days after the third ZPIV administration for Group 2
      and 3 subjects who consent to third dose.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be a male or non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female between the ages of 18 and 49
             years, inclusive, at the time of screening and enrollment.

          2. Must be willing and able to read, sign, and date the informed consent document before
             study-related procedures are performed.

          3. Must be willing and able to comply with study requirements and be available for
             follow-up visits for the entire study.

          4. Must have a means to be contacted by telephone.

          5. Must have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;/=18.1 and &lt;35.0 kg/m2.

          6. Must have acceptable screening laboratory findings within 40 days before day 1.

               -  Acceptable clinical laboratory parameters include no more than Grade 1 on
                  toxicity scale.

               -  White Blood Cell (WBC), Hemoglobin, and platelet count will be reported as part
                  of the Complete Blood Count (CBC). These labs will be graded according to the
                  toxicity scale. Other results included on the CBC panel will not be graded. They
                  will be reviewed by an investigator who will determine clinical significance and
                  may be used to determine additional workup.

               -  Sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, random glucose, total
                  protein, albumin, calcium, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase
                  will be reported as part of the Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP). These labs will
                  be graded according to the toxicity scale. Other results included on the CMP
                  panel will not be graded. They will be reviewed by an investigator who will
                  determine clinical significance and may be used to determine additional workup.

             Note: If laboratory screening tests are out of acceptable range, repeat of screening
             tests is permitted one time, provided there is an alternative explanation for the out
             of range value.

          7. Must be in good health based on the investigator's clinical judgment when considering
             findings from past medical history, medication use, vital signs, and an abbreviated
             physical examination.

             Note 1: Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in
             the exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical exam and vital
             signs. If the subject has a preexisting condition not listed in the exclusion
             criteria, the condition cannot meet any of the following criteria: first diagnosed in
             the last 3 months; worsening in terms of clinical outcome in the last 6 months; or
             involves need for medication that may pose a risk to the subject's safety or impede
             assessment of AEs or immunogenicity if they participate in the study.

             Note 2: An abbreviated physical exam differs from a complete exam in that it does not
             include a genitourinary and rectal exam.

             Note 3: Vital signs must be normal by protocol toxicity grading scale or determined to
             be normal-variant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal heart rate or blood
             pressure due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10
             minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be re-measured.
             Repeated vital signs may be used to determine eligibility.

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately prior to each vaccination.

             Note: All female subjects are considered of childbearing potential unless
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile and &gt;/=3 months have passed since sterilization
             procedure. Postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea for &gt;/=12 months without an
             alternative medical cause. Permanent female sterilization procedures include tubal
             ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or successful
             Essure placement.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception from
             one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination until at least 60 days after the
             last vaccination.

               -  Acceptable methods of contraception include the following: Use highly effective
                  contraceptive methods, defined by &lt;1% failure rate per year independent of user
                  adherence, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC):
                  progestin-releasing subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUD). Use
                  effective contraceptive methods, defined by 5-9% failure rate with typical use
                  and &lt;1% failure rate with consistent and correct use, including: prescription
                  oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, combined pill, progestin-only
                  pill, hormone-releasing transdermal patch or vaginal ring, and depot
                  medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (Depo-Provera). Have one male sex partner
                  who has had a vasectomy &gt;/=3 months prior. Male partner with barrier protection
                  plus the use of vaginal spermicide. Practice abstinence defined as refraining
                  from heterosexual intercourse from 30 days before first vaccination until at
                  least 60 days after last ZPIV vaccination.

         10. Female subjects must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) from the start of
             screening period until at least 60 days after receiving the last ZPIV vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has plans to become pregnant, or is currently pregnant or breastfeeding.

          2. Has plans to travel to an area with active ZIKV, DENV, YFV, or JEV transmission during
             the study or returned from an endemic area with these diseases within 30 days of
             screening.

             NOTE: Refer to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for areas with
             active ZIKV transmission: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo

                  pressure due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10
                  minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be
                  re-measured. Repeated vital signs may be used to determine eligibility.

         15. Has current or past history of substance abuse that in the investigator's opinion
