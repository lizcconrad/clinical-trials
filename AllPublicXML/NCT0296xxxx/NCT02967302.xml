  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate pain and inflammatory parameters (cytokines, immune cells) in knee joint
      tissue of chronic arthritis patients following intraarticular (i.a.) injections of morphine,
      a standard steroid or placebo.

      The primary hypothesis is that i.a. morphine results in significantly lower pain scores and
      supplemental analgesic consumption than placebo during the first week after injection, an
      efficacy comparable to standard i.a. steroid (triamcinolone) medication.

      3 arm, double blind, placebo controlled, prospective, mo-nocenter study, which will be
      conducted in the Department of Rheumatology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Cam-pus
      Benjamin Franklin in collaboration with several rheu-matology and orthopedic practices in the
      Berlin area. Ultra-sound guided synovial needle biopsy and interventions will only be
      performed at CBF.

      Eligible patients will be treated with either morphine 3 mg i.a., NaCl 0.9% i.a. or
      triamcinolone 40 mg i.a. at Baseline. The entire study period will be 2 weeks per patient.

      Assessment of the primary outcome parameter will be at week 1. The patients will be monitored
      closely throughout the entire study period with a total of 4 visits (screening, baseline,
      week 1, week 2).

      Safety data will be collected in the adverse events form, vital parameters, physical
      examination and laboratory tests dur-ing the whole study.
