  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center open-label pilot study will enroll 15 non-ambulatory children with
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy at least 8 years of age and who demonstrate pre-clinical
      cardiomyopathy (defined as a cardiac ejection fraction &gt;55% with abnormal LV strain by
      cardiac MRI). They will receive (+)-epicatechin at one of three doses during an 8-week
      dose-ranging study with assessments at baseline, 2 Weeks, 4weeks, and 8 weeks. The study will
      determine optimal dosing for future cardiac efficacy studies based on serum / plasma
      biomarker response using follistatin: myostatin ratio, nitrite/nitrate ratio, cardiac
      troponins and cardiac BNP. Secondary endpoints will include additional biomarker assessments
      by SOMAscanTM, cardiac functional evaluations by cardiac MRI (LV strain), and echocardiogram
      (LV strain by speckle tracking) and measures of strength, range of motion and mobility, and
      clinical safety assessments. Results of secondary endpoint analysis will be used to refine
      design of subsequent clinical trials powered to detect changes in clinical outcomes.
