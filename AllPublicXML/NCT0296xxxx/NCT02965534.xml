  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced quality of vision and glare in twilight or night are frequently mentioned complaints
      within the optometric examination. A reason for these problems could be a myopic refractive
      shift in dark light conditions, commonly known as night myopia or twilight myopia.

      The aim of this study was to investigate whether quality of vision in twilight or night could
      be improved by a spectacle correction optimized for mesopic light conditions. Moreover,
      objective refraction in large pupils measured by aberrometry was compared to subjective
      mesopic refraction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining informed consent, aberrometry was performed in a darkened room (0.1 lux).
      Subjective photopic refraction and visual acuity were measured before light was turned off
      and mesopic refraction was obtained after a dark adaptation period of five minutes. Finally,
      frames and lenses were fitted by a centration system. Lens grinding was executed centralized
      by a grinding workshop. In the course of this study, subjects were randomly assigned to wear
      two glasses double-masked in turn. One with photopic subjective refraction data and another
      with mesopic subjective refraction data. Both were worn for 14 Â± 2 days each.

      Follow Up 1:

      After two weeks, participants were asked for their subjective experiences with the first
      correction by a visual analogue scale questionnaire. After the evaluation, glasses were
      changed.

      Follow Up 2:

      Two weeks later, subjective experiences were evaluated again. After visual analogue scale
      questionnaire, subjects were asked to compare the two glasses concerning quality of mesopic
      vision and subjective safety level during night driving.

Both glasses (study and control glasses) were tested for two weeks each. After the two weeks test, each of the glasses was evaluated. For evaluation a visual analogue scale questionnaire (Scale 0 - 100) was used.
Question:
How would you evaluate vision comfort with the tested glasses in dark light conditions? Answer: visual analogue scale slider from 0 (insufficient) to 100 (very good)</description>
