      The purpose of the study is to investigate these effects of Second-Generation Antipsychotic
      (SGAs) on glucose and lipid metabolic parameters in patients with schizophrenia, and explore
      the relationship between genes polymorphisms (such as drug metabolic enzyme, Endogenous
      Cannabinoid Receptor Type 1(CB1) and so on) and the SGAs-induced glucose and lipid metabolic
      disorder in Chinese Han persons with schizophrenia who are taking one of the SGAs(olanzapine,
      risperidone or ziprasidone).

    <textblock>
      SGAs now is used as the main tool to treat schizophrenia, however，the mechanism of glucose
      and lipid metabolism disorder it brings is still unclear. Based on the previous studies, the
      investigators found that the CB1 gene has a close connection with the metabolism disorder.The
      investigators suppose that the CB1 also has a significant role in regulation of energy and
      metabolism in hypothalamus. In this study ,the investigators will recruit 300 Patients with
      schizophrenia who defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5), aged 18 to 60,and
      all the participants will receive a 6-week systematic treatment by one of the SGAs(including
      olanzapine, risperidone oral solution, ziprasidone capsules), and a battery of assessments of
      treatment effect and safety. Plasma concentration will be tested regularly, and these genes
      polymorphisms of CB1 and other associated with energy metabolism will be conducted by the
      second generation of gene detection techniques.This study could provide evidence and data to
      achieve the aim of individualized medication, reduce the drugs' side effect, also throw light
      on the production of medication for correct the metabolism disorder.

    <description>Following the baseline assessment, subjects will enter an open treatment group with Olanzapine(Zyprexa) lasting 6 weeks. The subjects will start with a dose of 5-10mg/d , which would be adjusted to as low as 10 mg/d or as high as 20 mg/d, based on clinical response.And drug dose adjustments must be completed within 1 week.</description>

The subjects will start with a dose of 1ml/d , which would be adjusted to as low as 4 ml/d or as high as 6 ml/d, based on clinical response.Drug dose adjustments interval is generally not less than 2 days, and should reach a effective dose of 4~6ml/d within 1 week.</description>
