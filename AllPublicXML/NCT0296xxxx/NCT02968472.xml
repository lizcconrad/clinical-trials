      A chimeric antigen receptor gene-modified T cells (CART: 4SCAR19)by targeted the CD19
      (cluster of differentiation antigen 19), treat patients with CD19 positive malignant B cells
      tumor, assess treatment safety, and observe therapeutic effects. At the same time,the change
      process of the CART and residual tumor status of the patient are observe dynamicallyï¼Œ which
      summarizes the best therapeutic effect.

             CD19 molecules.

          -  the Karnofsky performance status score over 80 points, is expected to patients
             survival time is more than 3 months.

          -  the important viscera function meet: heart ultrasound tip heart ejection fraction 50%
             or higher, electrocardiogram (ecg) not seen obvious abnormality;The blood oxygen
             saturation 90% or higher;Creatinine 2.5 times normal range or less; aspartate
             aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase3 times normal range or less, total
             bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dl or less.

          -  or greater Hgb 80 g/L.

          -  no contraindications to solid and cell separation

          -  the patient and family to have a strong willingness to participate in clinical trials,
             and are willing to bear all the consequence caused by the test failed, and sign the
             informed consent.

          -  the panel discussion, combined with patient general condition, think the benefit is
             greater than the risks involved in the clinical trials.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  accompanied with other active disease, the treatment is difficult to correct.

          -  bacteria, fungus, or virus infection, unable to control.

             week.

          -  confirmed before used CAR - but invalid patients treated T cells, after in the
             physical examination, experts discuss confirmed by a team doesn't fit in the CAR again
             - T treatment.Before used gene therapy method.

          -  the researchers believe that might increase risk subjects or interfere with the test
