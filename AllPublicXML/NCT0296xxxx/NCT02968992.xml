  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) which is
      a partially iron saturated form of lactoferrin produced and purified from rice grain may
      improve mobility and memory in older adults with chronic inflammation. Lactoferrin, is a
      known multifunctional protein, and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. A
      recombinant human version of this protein was recently developed and produced from rice. This
      is now available from the Ventria Bioscience Company in a controlled, pharmaceutical grade
      capsule. As part of this double blinded and randomized study, participants will take daily
      dosages of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) or its matched placebo; to measure the
      effects of rhlactoferrin on chronic inflammation and its association with improving mobility
      and memory over a 6 month time period. During the study all participants will be asked to
      provide blood samples and will have physical and cognitive tests administered to them. By
      measuring biomarkers in the blood as well as changes in physical and cognitive measures, the
      investigators will gain an understanding of how rhlactoferrin may safely improve measures of
      chronic inflammation in older adults. As well as a better understanding of whether it has the
      potential to meaningfully influence important measures of physical and cognitive function
      known to be influenced by Chronic Inflammation (CI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine in a double blinded and randomized trial
      the efficacy of Recombinant Human lactoferrin (rhLF) in reducing chronic inflammation as
      measured by IL-6 and sTNFR1 in the bloodstream. The primary end point is to gather
      information about the tolerability of and adherence to oral rhlactoferrin (rhLF) among older
      adults with CI over a six-month period. The exploratory objective is to assess the efficacy
      of rhlactoferrin (rhLF) in attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the Digit Symbol
      Substitution Test and Trail Making Test, as well as improving physical mobility as measured
      by performance on 4 meter and six-minute walk tests. Further physical and functional
      measurement data will be gather using an Acti-graph link Activity monitor, the raw data
      collected will be used to : (i) characterize cumulative daily activity, (ii) assess daily
      circadian patterns of activity, (iii) assess physical activity variability, (iv) model
      patterns of daily activity, and (iv) estimate walking speed. This additional datad will
      complement mobility measures by describing function enacted in daily life

    <measure>Attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the digital symbol substitution test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test taker is given a key consisting of numbers 1-9 that are paired with a unique symbol. Below the key is a randomly generated list of the numbers repeated several times. The test taker is allowed 90 seconds to assign the correct symbol to the number on the list. The test administrator then scores the number of correct answers over the 90 second test time, and assigns a total score based on one point for each correct answer.</description>

    <measure>Attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the trail making test A and B.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For test A, the test taker is given a sheet of paper that has the numbers 1-25 within individual circles randomly distributed on the page. The test taker is asked to connect the numbers sequentially over a period of 4 minutes (240 seconds). The score is recorded as the time it takes to complete the task in seconds. For test B, the test taker is given a piece of paper that has numbers 1-13 and letters A-L. Each letter or number is inside of a circle. The test taker must then draw a line from one circled number to the next circled letter (ie. 1 to A to 2 to B to 3 to C etc.) over a period of 6 minutes (360 seconds). The time it takes to record this task correctly is recorded in seconds.</description>
