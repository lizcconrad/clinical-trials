      Oral supplementation with branched chain amino acids (BCAA) increases the levels of
      circulating BCAA, stimulates BCAA uptake in muscles, and decreases amino acid release from
      muscle, eventually promoting muscle anabolism. However, uptake of oral BCAA by muscle is not
      complete, pointing out that non-muscular tissues, as the splanchnic bed and gut microbiota,
      may play a role in BCAA metabolism.

      This protocol aims at studying the impact of protein-energy wasting (PEW) and of refeeding
      with branched chain amino acids (BCAA), on gut barrier including gut microbiota, in chronic
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. The investigators speculate that:

        1. HD patients with PEW have altered composition and function of gut microbiota, increased
           permeability of epithelial gut barrier, increased systemic inflammation but decreased
           fecal immunoglobulin A (IgA), and a dysbalance of plasma appetite mediators in favor of
           anorexigenic mediators, compared to HD patients without PEW, non dialyzed patients with
           chronic kidney disease and well-nourished non obese subjects,

        2. BCAA supplementation of HD patients with PEW reverses these changes, thereby improving
           nutritional state, physical function, quality of life and resistance to infections.

      General description :

      This protocol is multicenter (University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) and Lausanne (CHUV) and
      Sion (HVS)) and encompasses two parts, a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study:

        1. Cross-sectional study: It is performed to differentiate the respective impact of uremia
           and protein-energy wasting (PEW) on gut barrier and gut microbiota. It will compare gut
           barrier of hemodialysis (HD) patients with PEW, with gut barrier of age-matched HD
           well-nourished patients, non dialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and
           healthy non obese volunteers (10 in each group). This study part is essential for
           interpretation of the changes occurring in the longitudinal study.

        2. Longitudinal double blind randomized crossover study: HD patients with PEW (36
           patients), receive, in a randomized double-blind order, either BCAA or an isocaloric
           isonitrogenous placebo for 4 months each, with a wash-out period of 1 month.

      Randomization :

        1. Cross-sectional study: No randomization will be performed. HD patients without PEW, non
           dialyzed patients with CKD and healthy non obese volunteers will be included if matched
           for gender and age with the included HD patients with PEW.

        2. Longitudinal study: Sequence assignment will be randomized separately in each center to
           ensure an equal percentage of each sequence in both centers. For this purpose, the
           investigators will generate 2 lists of randomization with the method of randomly
           permuted blocks with random block sizes of 2 and 4.

      Recruitment :

      Patients will be recruited among the outpatients of the Nephrology Divisions or Services of
      the HUG, CHUV and HVS. Healthy volunteers will be recruited among hospital staff or their
      relatives.

      Inclusion Criteria :

        1. HD patients with PEW

             -  Age ≥ 18 years.

             -  Maintenance HD for at least 3 months.

             -  Fasting predialysis plasma albumin &lt; 38 g/l in the absence of an known acute

                oral nutritional supplements, as intakes below 20 kcal/kg/d request artificial
                nutrition.

             -  Absence of any systematic antibiotic treatment for an acute infection in the month
                preceding the inclusion.

        2. HD patients without PEW

             -  Patients matched for age and gender to HD patients with PEW.

             -  Maintenance HD for at least 3 months.

             -  Fasting predialysis plasma albumin ≥ 40 g/l, in the absence of any known acute
                infection during the last 2 weeks

             -  Dietary intakes (24h dietary recall) &gt; 30 kcal/kg/d and &gt; 1.2 g protein/kg/d, once
                during screening.

                preceding the inclusion.

        3. Non dialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4

             -  Patients matched for age and gender to HD patients with PEW.

             -  Chronic kidney disease, stage 4, not requiring HD.

             -  Fasting predialysis plasma albumin ≥ 40 g/l, in the absence of any known acute
                infection during the last 2 weeks

             -  Dietary intakes (24h dietary recall) &gt; 30 kcal/kg/d once during screening.

             -  Absence of any systematic antibiotic treatment for an acute infection in the month
                preceding the inclusion.

        4. Healthy non obese volunteers

             -  Subjects matched for age and gender to HD patients with PEW.

             -  Body mass index &lt; 30 kg/m2

             -  Absence of any systematic antibiotic treatment for an acute infection in the month
                preceding the inclusion.
