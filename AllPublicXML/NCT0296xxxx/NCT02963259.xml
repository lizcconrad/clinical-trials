    <textblock>
      This post-marketing evaluation has been designed to consistently investigate the subject's
      preference when switching from a Medtronic® constant voltage or constant current device to a
      St Jude Medical Infinity™ or St Jude Medical BrioTM constant current system. As electrodes
      will not be re-positioned, differences in subject's preference are to be explained by the
      difference in shape of the delivered pulse or waveform between the two systems.

        Subjects who have a diagnosis matching the approved indication and are being considered for
        an IPG replacement comprise the target population of this study. All subjects who meet the
        inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and have signed an Ethics Committee (EC) or
        Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent will be considered enrolled in
        the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject signed the approved Informed Consent;

          -  Subject is ≥18 and ≤ 74 years of age;

          -  Subject is bilaterally treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic
             nucleus (STN) using a constant voltage device (i.e. Soletra™, Itrel™, Kinetra™,
             ActivaPC™ or ActivaRC™ IPG) and in the Investigator's opinion, is responding
             satisfactory to CV stimulation;

          -  In the physician's opinion the subject is a suitable candidate for an IPG replacement
             with different stimulation paradigm;

          -  Subject needs and/or requests an IPG replacement within 12 months after consent and
             the current IPG has at least 2.6 V output left (i.e. approx. 30% of full battery
             capacity) at the time of subject enrollment;

          -  PD symptom onset is no longer than 20 years;

          -  Subject has a Hoehn &amp; Yahr score &lt;IV (on stim);

          -  Subject with a normal cognitive function (MMSE ≥ 25);

          -  Subject is fluent speaker (as judged by the investigator) of the language spoken in
             the country where the investigational site is located.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IPG battery has less than 30% battery life at the time of consent;

          -  Need to replace or reposition the leads or extensions during the IPG replacement
             procedure;

          -  Subject had &gt;10 recurrent falls experienced in the 3 months prior to consent;

          -  Subject is unwilling to change to either a St Jude Medical InfinityTM or a St Jude
             Medical BrioTM DBS system for the IPG replacement;

          -  Subject is unable to attend the study visits.
