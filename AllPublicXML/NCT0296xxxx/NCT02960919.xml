      This is a prospective observational study assessing the clinical outcomes of children 2 to 59
      months of age with both pneumonia and other co-morbidities presenting to a tertiary hospital

          -  Male or female, 2 to 59 months of age.

          -  Excluded from enrollment in Innovative Treatment in Pneumonia (ITIP) 1 and ITIP2
             clinical trials due to presence of any of the following:

          -  Hypoxia (SaO2 &lt; 90% on room air, as assessed by a pulse oximeter).

          -  Severe respiratory distress (e.g., presence of grunting, nasal flaring, head nodding,
             or severe chest-indrawing).

          -  Severe malaria, classified by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on hospital
             care for children, including a positive malaria rapid antibody test result.

          -  Severe anemia, classified by WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)
             guidelines (i.e., severe palmar pallor) only if a positive malaria rapid antibody test
             result.

          -  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) (i.e., weight for height/length &lt; -3 SD, mid-upper arm
             circumference (MUAC) &lt;115, or edema).

          -  HIV-1 seropositivity or HIV-1 exposure, assessed as follows: An HIV-positive result
             upon rapid antibody testing.

          -  If a child is less than 24 months of age and has an HIV-negative result upon rapid
             antibody test documented from the past three months, the child's biological mother's
             HIV status will need to be assessed. If the mother is HIV-positive, the child will be
             included. If the mother does not have documentation of an HIV-negative test result
             from the past 3 months, she will be tested via rapid antibody testing to determine the
             child's eligibility for this study.

          -  Ability and willingness of child's caregiver to provide informed consent and to be
             available for follow-up (in the inpatient ward, returning to KCH for a scheduled study
             follow-up visit, and by phone) for the planned duration of the study.

             negative malaria rapid antibody test result.

          -  Known allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin.

          -  Receipt of an antibiotic treatment in the 48 hours prior to the study based on
             caregiver's self-report and/or documentation in child's medical record.

          -  Living outside Lilongwe urban area, the study catchment area.

          -  Any medical or psychosocial condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the

             participation might jeopardize the child's health.

          -  Participation in a clinical study of an investigational product within 12 weeks prior
             to enrollment or planning to begin participation during this study.

          -  Prior participation in ITIP1, ITIP2 or ITIP3 during a previous pneumonia diagnosis.
