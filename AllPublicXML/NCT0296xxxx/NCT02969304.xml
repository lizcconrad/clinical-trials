      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of DMF use that is
      prescribed &quot;on-label&quot; versus &quot;off-label&quot;. The secondary objectives are: To describe the
      demographic characteristics and medical history of DMF users; To describe prescription drug
      history and concomitant medication use of DMF users; To describe the duration of therapy in
      participants newly initiating DMF treatment; To describe the medical specialties of DMF
      prescribers.

        Retrospective analysis of a research database, which contains German sick fund claims, to
        assess the usage of dimethyl fumarate in Germany. The research database is comprised of
        German sick fund data, which is compiled by Gesundheitsforen Leipzig (GFL). This GFL
        database currently contains sick fund claims data for approximately 4 million patients,
        which accounts for approximately 5-6% of the total sick fund population in Germany.
