  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of adding a new drug, durvalumab (also called
      MEDI4736), to chemoradiation using two standard chemotherapy drugs, carboplatin and
      paclitaxel. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this
      combination has on the patient and cancer.

    <description>&quot;Unacceptable toxicity&quot; is defined as any of the following toxicities: &gt;1 episode of grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia &lt;75,000/μL (despite prior dose reduction) during chemoradiation any toxicity that results in &gt;2 week cumulative delay in chemoradiation any toxicity that is attributed to durvalumab which results in a delay of &gt;8 weeks in surgery, i.e. surgery &gt;16 weeks from the end of radiation, for a potentially operable patient any reason that is attributed to durvalumab which leads to death within 30 days of surgery</description>

    <description>Patients will receive one dose of durvalumab 1,500 mg on Day 1 as induction therapy prior to concurrent chemoradiation. Chemotherapy consists of carboplatin AUC 2/paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 weekly ×5 with concurrent radiation (1.8 Gy/fraction ×28 fractions for total dose of 50.4 Gy). One dose of durvalumab 1,500 mg will also be given with the first dose of carboplatin/paclitaxel. Radiation will be administered starting on Day 29-30; it will commence on a Monday or Tuesday and continue weekly from Monday through Friday (except for public holidays).Following chemoradiation, patients undergo surgery 6-8 weeks later. In the adjuvant setting, all patients who have undergone R0 resections will receive durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks ×6 doses starting within 12 weeks of surgery. Initially, 6 patients will be treated and then followed for 30 days after surgery.</description>
