    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease is a chronic progressive fibrosis lung disease that with a highly
      variable clinical process.thence it is significant for the patient to search a convenient and
      accurate prediction method. The objective of this study was to determine whether peripheral
      blood biomarkers can predict disease .

    <textblock>
      The median follow-up period was 12 months, each patient received 4 or 5 follow-ups in our
      center, 336 person-times in study enrollment totally. The patients with interstitial lung
      disease had significantly higher serum baseline KL-6 and MMP-7 levels compared with healthy
      control.They divided into progressive group and non-progressive group according to disease
      change. Serum KL-6 and MMP-7 levels were elevated in patients if disease progression, but
      baseline level of biomarkers in progressive group were not significant higher compare with
      non-progressive group .Binary logistic regression showed △KL-6 and △MMP-7 were significant
      predictors for disease progression. Multivariate Cox analysis showed KL-6 and MMP-7 were
      significantly associated with survival along with other variables.

      The serum levels of KL-6 and MMP-7 were elevated in the individuals with interstitial lung
      disease compared with healthy controls. The rate of poor prognosis and mortality more
      associated with the variability increased biomarker concentrations，rather than the baseline
      concentration.Therefore，Serial measurements of biomarkers contribute to the disease
      monitoring in clinical management.

    <description>Serum samples were prospectively collected from 70 patients including baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 6 months and 12 months, which were tested for a panel of Krebs van den Lungen-6 antigen (KL-6), by latex agglutination test.We have demonstrated that an increase in serum KL-6 levels, but not the level at any one point in time, predicts poor prognosis.</description>
