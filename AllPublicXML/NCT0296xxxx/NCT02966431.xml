      The purpose of this study is three-fold: 1) Determine whether an 8-week, patient-centered,
      weight loss intervention can be successfully implemented in overweight, college-age females
      for promotion of weight loss and prevention of weight regain at 8-weeks, three months, and
      six months follow-up; 2) Determine the effects of the intervention on established markers of
      calorie restriction, energy expenditure and body composition; 3) Determine the effects of a
      liquid meal on physiological and subjective markers of hunger and satiety from pre- to post-
      8wk intervention in the intervention group vs control group.
