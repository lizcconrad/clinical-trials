    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing public health problem and the number of patient
      with chronic kidney disease is increasing worldwide. Bone abnormalities are found almost
      universally in patients with CKD requiring dialysis and in the majority of patients with CKD
      stages 3-5. Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex disorder of
      bone and mineral metabolism, which is associated with disorder in circulating levels of
      hormones and development of secondary hyperparathyroid disease. The abnormalities of mineral
      homeostasis impair bone remodeling and mineralization and results in cortical and trabecular
      defects and an increased fracture risk. There is also an association with increased morbidity
      and mortality. CKD-MBD is also associated with development of calcification of the blood
      vessels. During the last decade it has been increasingly acknowledged that mineral and bone
      disorder contribute to the excessively high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
      patients with chronic kidney disease. The pathophysiology behind the disorder varies a lot
      and can be divided into three groups; high turnover renal bone disease, low-turnover disease
      and mixed-uremic osteodystrophy. The treatment of CKD-MBD depends of the subtype of the
      disorder.

      The diagnosis of CKD-MBD is still challenging. Biomarkers such as parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are used to evaluate bone turnover and formation, but both
      biomarkers have several limitations and are both unspecific. Many biomarkers have been used
      in research applications, but yet none of them is in clinical use. Dual X ray absorptiometry
      (DXA) is used to measure fracture risk in patients with normal kidney function, but is not
      useful in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3 - 5. Different imaging techniques have
      been investigated, but still bone biopsy is the golden standard for diagnosing and
      classification of the subtypes of CKD-MBD. Bone biopsy is invasive and is not available in
      every center.

      This study`s goal is to evaluate, if 18-Fluor-Positron emission tomography-computed
      tomography (18F-PET-TT) can be used in the assessment of CKD patients. The hypothesis is that
      18-PET-TT correlates with the histomorphometry of bone biopsy and with the calcification
      score in CKD patients and that 18F-PET-TT maybe can be used as a diagnostic imaging technique
      in the future.

      This is a prospective study which will recruit patients with severely decreased kidney
      function (eGRF below 20ml/min) and who have secondary hyperparathyroidism. Also patients who
      have received a renal transplant will be included, if they have hyperparathyroid disease. A
      control group will be needed to validate the F18-PET-TT method.

      The goal is to include 10-20 patients in each group and 10 persons in the control group.
      Group I: patients in hemodialysis, group II: patients in peritoneal dialysis, group III
      predialysis patients, group IV: patients with a kidney transplant and group V: healthy
      controls. Blood tests measuring the bone formation and turnover will be taken during the
      normal clinical controls of the patients. Echocardiogram, which is reasonable sensitive, is
      done to detect and evaluate valvular calcification. Bone biopsy is done in the day care unit.
      To obtain information about dynamic parameters of the bone the patient should have a double
      labeling of the bone surface, which is achieved by giving tetracycline in two periods. The
      biopsy is taken in local anesthesia from the anterior iliac spine vertically. Bone biopsy
      gives the possibility to evaluate the histomorphometry of the bone and to diagnose the
      subtypes of CKD-MBD.

      18F-PET-TT is done within one month from the bone biopsy. PET with the short half-life bone
      seeking 18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), provide an unique way of assessment of regional bone
      metabolism. 18F-NaF binds to sights of new bone formation and serves as a marker of bone
      blood flow and osteoblastic activity. A dynamic 18F-PET-TT imaging is first done of the
      lumbar region of the spine, following with a static PET-TT and also measurement of
      calcification score using PET-TT. 18F-NaF is injected intravenously by direct venipuncture or
      intravenous catheter. All the patients are also asked for permission to use DNA-samples if
      needed.
