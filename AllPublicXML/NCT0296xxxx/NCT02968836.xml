      in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.

    <textblock>
      This monocentric trial will be a parallel, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.
      Patients hospitalized in the ICU for sepsis will be enrolled.

      The treatment group (n=15) will be administered the study product (amino acid blend) and the
      negative control group (=15) will be administrated maltodextrin only. The mode of
      administration is nasogastric probe.

      The treatment period is 21 days. Subject will be followed during stay in High care and
      intermediate care units up to 2 months or after hospital discharge with a follow up until 12
      months.

      Recruitment will stop when 30 patients (15 in each group) have reached V4.
