  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy (PA) has been well studied and its prevalence was estimated up to 1.3% in
      Europe. Tree nut (TN) allergy and PA are clinically similar and often coexist, TN allergy
      prevalence ranged from 0.05 to 4.9 %. TN allergy is longlasting and nearly all TN have been
      associated with fatal allergic reactions . Other legumes or TN also contain seed storage
      protein orthologs of the globulins (Ara h1, Ara h 3) and 2S albumins (Ara h 2) of peanut,
      susceptible to provoke allergic reactions, but cross-reactivity to TN and other legumes in PA
      patients could also appear through primarily sensitization. These possible IgE-binding
      cross-reactions bring to recommend the avoidance of TN and other legumes which have never
      been eaten in PA children. In this context, diagnosis work-up of relevant cross-allergy
      versus asymptomatic cross-sensitization will impact directly children's health-related
      quality of life (HRQL).

      When physicians suspect food allergy, many parameters have to be considered, such as clinical
      background, clinical history, type of symptoms related to the suspected food and
      cross-allergy to other foods. Then, to objectively confirm a food allergy and to assess its
      severity (related to the threshold reactive dose and symptoms), an oral food challenge (OFC)
      is demanded, and double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is considered as
      &quot;the gold standard&quot;.

      Although OFC are more and more available in the diagnosis of PA, the assessment of
      cross-allergy to every single allergenic TN and legumes requires full allergy work-up and
      often many years of follow-up. Few studies investigated cross-allergy to TN and other legume,
      with rates of cross-allergy to TN between 28% and 50%. However, targeting patients with
      severe or cross-allergic phenotypes would greatly assist the allergist in management and
      follow-up of PA patients (i.e., planning OFC to cross-reactive food).

      Our main objective is to identify different disease phenotypes of PA children with cluster
      analysis. This statistical approach has never been performed to identify cross-allergic
      phenotypes. We also will describe cross-allergy in PA and will identify possible risk factors
      for cross-allergy to TN and other legumes in PA children.
