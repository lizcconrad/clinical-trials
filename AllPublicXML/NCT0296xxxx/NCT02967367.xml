  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During last years, numerous sleep trackers have been commercialized. They are intended to
      give indications about sleep quality/duration in order to give people an internet-based
      feedback about their own sleep.

      For clinical and research purposes, tri-axial accelerometers/multi-sensors devices are used
      routinely to assess objective sleep quality/patterns. Their use is also validated to estimate
      sleep in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA).

      The purpose of the present study is to compare the accuracy of consumer-level sleep trackers
      and validated tools to measure sleep in OSA patients.
