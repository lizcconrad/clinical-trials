  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the length of continuous albuterol administration between
      two different albuterol formulations, BAC containing albuterol versus preservative free
      albuterol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the length of continuous albuterol
      administration between patients receiving BAC containing albuterol versus preservative free
      albuterol. Secondary objectives include comparison of therapy escalation, asthma scores,
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at discharge, length of hospital stay, and
      cost.
