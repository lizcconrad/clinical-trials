  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the frequency of cachexia and the management of
      cachexia and associated symptoms in a patient population with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional, European (France and Belgium), multicentric
      prevalence study, conducted on a representative population of 500 patients with NSCLC, to
      assess the frequency and the management of cachexia and associated symptoms.

      The study will be conducted in accordance with the professional code of ethics and the good
      epidemiological practices guidelines developed by the ADELF (the Association of
      French-Speaking Epidemiologists) and in accordance with the STROBE recommendations for the
      drafting of reports and publications related to the study.

      The information will be collected during a single visit to the oncologist/lung specialist as
      part of the usual patient management of his/her lung cancer. The physician will explain the
      purpose of the study to the patient with an information form specific to the study and will
      inform him/her of the option to refuse or withdraw from participation. The patient
      information form in France or a specific consent form in Belgium will be signed by the
      patient and a copy will be given to him/her (the original will be kept by the physician).

      This study does not require any additional specific data. Data will come from the medical
      file and from the routine disease management. Furthermore, the following self-completion
      questionnaires will be proposed to patients: Visual analogue scale for dietary intake
      (dietary intake VAS), assessment of the concerns associated with the anorexia/cachexia
      (Anorexia-Cachexia module of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy [FAACT]
      questionnaire), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), and assessment of physical activity (IPAQ,
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire).

    <description>This endpoint will be derived from the following variables, assuming refractory cachexia is not present:
Weight loss, calculated based on the weight measured at the inclusion visit and the weight 6 months before (either recorded in patient's file or according to patient statement if not available).
BMI, calculated based on the measured patient height and weight
The presence of sarcopenia determined by the muscle mass index at the 3rd lumbar vertebra (L3), on an axial CT scan section at L3 if the CT scan is available in patient's file.</description>
