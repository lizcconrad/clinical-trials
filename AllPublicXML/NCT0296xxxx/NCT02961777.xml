  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases, and more precisely patients with ST - elevated myocardial infarction
      are globally responsible for a large number of hospitalizations and deaths. Monitoring the
      quality of care for these patients is very relevant topic. Investigators developed indicators
      from the scientific literature on the quality of care for patients with STEMI at both the
      patient level and hospital level. The indicators were subsequently validated by a RAND
      modified Delphi - study of multidisciplinary experts in the care of patients with STEMI.

      In this study, the following objectives are set:

        1. ) Study of the quality of care for patients with STEMI in 16 Flemish hospitals with
           cardiology department by retrospective and prospective audit of 20 patient records per
           participating hospital .

        2. ) Study of the interdisciplinary relationships and communication within teams involved
           in the care of patients with STEMI in the participating hospitals 3) Study of perceived
           organization of care for patients with STEMI in the participating hospitals

      In accordance with the objectives of the research, the study consists of three phases:

        1. ) A retrospective observational audit of 20 patient records of patients with STEMI each
           participating hospital.

        2. ) A prospective observational audit of 20 patient records of patients with STEMI each
           participating hospital.

        3. ) A survey using validated instruments of interdisciplinary relationships and
           communication on the one hand and on the other by the teams involved in the care of
           patients with STEMI perceived organization of care .

      Data collection is performed by local researchers and remains their property. The data is
      coded and kept confidential. Only the local researcher has access to the encryption key. The
      data are protected by the Belgian law on privacy and medical confidentiality, only to be used
      in the context of this study. The results are published anonymously.
