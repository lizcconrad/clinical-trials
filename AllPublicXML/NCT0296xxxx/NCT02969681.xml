    <textblock>
      Preclinical study has shown that human colorectal cancer cells harboring KRAS or BRAF
      mutations are selectively killed by high levels of ascorbic acid (AA). High dose of AA aslo
      impairs tumor growth in Apc/KRASG12D mutant mice. Previous phase Ⅰ studies have found that
      high dose iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients.This protocol is a phase Ⅲ study of AA
      infusions combined with treatment with FOLFOX/FOLFIRI +/- bevacizumab versus treatment with
      FOLFOX/FOLFIRI +/- bevacizumab alone as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or
      advanced colorectal cancer.

      Linus Pauling and Dr Ewan Cameron have published two retrospective studies about using high
      dose vitamin C to treat cancer patients forty years ago. Their studies have shown that high
      dose vitamin C usage could significantly prolong overall survival of patients with advanced
      cancer. Recently, preclinical study has shown that human colorectal cancer cells harboring
      KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed by high levels of ascorbic acid (AA). High dose
      of AA impairs tumor growth in Apc/KRASG12D mutant mice. Previous phaseⅠ clinical trials have
      found that high dose (1.5g/kg or 90g/m2) iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients. This
      protocol is a phase Ⅲ, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with
      FOLOX/FOLFIRI +/- bevacizumab versus treatment with FOLFOX/FOLFIRI +/- bevacizumab alone as
      first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or advanced colorectal cancer.
