  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose
      of odalasvir (ODV) in participants with severe renal impairment and compare with the PK in
      matched participants with normal renal function.

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilogram (kg) divided by the
             square of height in meters) of 18 to 36 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), extremes
             included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg

          -  Participant must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions

             estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than (&lt;) 30 milliLiter per minute
             (mL/min)/1.73 m^2

          -  Participant must have stable renal function that is no significant change in renal
             function as evidenced by the (mean) screening serum creatinine value within +/-25
