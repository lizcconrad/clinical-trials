  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The orthotics are auxiliary therapeutic resources indicated for the relief of pain, improves
      functional standard or correction of deformities. There is a lack of studies that analyze the
      biomechanical changes promoted by the Orthotics in functional pattern of the upper limb. The
      objective of this proposal is to analyse biomechanical changes in the functional upper limb
      pattern with the use of orthoses for patients with dysfunctions arising from musculoskeletal
      system trauma or burns, aiming to contribute with scientific evidence to clinical practice.
      The project will analyze the changes in the pattern of the upper limb functional through the
      use of dynamic and static Orthotics by means of kinematic and electromyographic analysis
      while conducting a functional task. These comparisons will be carried out with and without
      the use of functional Orthotics, and the controls are the patients themselves. Methods: 25
      patients will be included over 18 years with malfunctions resulting from orthopaedic trauma
      and Burns of the upper limb with indication and Orthotics for improving functional pattern.
      For characterization of the sample will be performed: esthesiometric , hand and the
      (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) DASH Questionnaire. Biomechanical assessment
      will be used for the analysis and electromyographic kinematics. For statistical analysis will
      be applied the method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures, and when
      necessary, the post hoc Bonferroni test. Will be adopted as significance level p ≤ 0.05.
