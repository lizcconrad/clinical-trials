    <description>TheraSphere® is delivered into the liver tumor through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. The hepatic artery provides the main blood supply to the tumor in the liver, whereas the portal vein supplies blood to normal liver parenchyma. TheraSphere® is embolized within the tumor and exerts a local beta radiation radiotherapeutic effect with relatively limited concurrent injury to surrounding normal tissue.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be recruited from the patient population referred to the principal
             clinician for regional liver cancer therapy.

          -  Potential candidates are those diagnosed with primary or secondary liver neoplasia.
             The histopathology confirmation criterion may be waived in patients with a
             radiographically identifiable liver mass, known laboratory or clinical risk factors
             for cancer or elevated tumor markers and clinical findings. Guidelines from the
             American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European
             Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) describe in detail the approach and
             algorithm for diagnosing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).
