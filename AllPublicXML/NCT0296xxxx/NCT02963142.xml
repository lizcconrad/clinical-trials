  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe community acquired pneumonia is common and associated with high mortality.
      Conventional microbiological diagnostics identify pathogens in approximately half of cases,
      which is inadequate for both clinical and epidemiological purposes. This study applies
      next-generation sequencing based metagenomic techniques to patients with extremely severe
      community acquired pneumonia, to investigate the microbiome of severe community acquired
      pneumonia and evaluate metagenomic approaches as diagnostic tools.

    <description>Metagenomic sequencing data obtained will be compared to results obtained from conventional diagnostic tests undertaken as part of the participant's routine clinical care. Data will be used to evaluate the ability of each technique to detect any pathogens found.
The conventional microbiological tests that will be used for comparison include those undertaken as part of the participants routine clinical care and will include urinary antigen tests (Pneumococcal and Leigonella); blood, sputum and bronchial lavage culture including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Legionella spp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae and respiratory viral PCR multiplex assays. The results of serological tests and PCR for Influenza A &amp;B from nose and throat swabs will also be compared.</description>
