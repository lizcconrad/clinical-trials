  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some candidates to cochlear implantation can have residual low frequencies hearing. The EVO
      electrode lead has been specifically designed to preserve this residual hearing through
      surgery. It is then possible to provide the patient with a electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS)
      which combines both an acoustical stimulation for the preserved low frequency hearing and an
      electrical stimulation through the cochlear implant. The major aim of this study is to
      evaluate hearing preservation after implantation with the EVO electrode lead.

      The secondary outcome is to evaluate the benefit of EAS stimulation provided by the Zebra
      speech processor.

      Some candidates to cochlear implantation can have residual low frequencies hearing. The EVO
      electrode lead has been specifically designed to preserve this residual hearing through
      surgery. It is then possible to provide the patient with a electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS)
      which combines both an acoustical stimulation for the preserved low frequency hearing and an
      electrical stimulation through the cochlear implant. Literature showed the EAS stimulation
      can lead to better speech understanding, especially in noisy situation, and can provide
      important information about intonating or melodic contours, thus increasing sound quality and
      music perception.

      Objectives The major aim of this study is to evaluate hearing preservation after implantation
      with the EVO electrode lead.

      The secondary outcome is to evaluate the benefit of EAS stimulation provided by the Zebra
      speech processor.

      Methods Unaided tonal audiograms are measured for cochlear implant candidates with low
      frequency residual hearing before and after cochlear implantation with the EVO electrode
      lead.

      Aided tonal audiograms and speech intelligibility in quiet and in noise are measured after
      implantation with the three modes of stimulation (acoustic stimulation AS, electric
      stimulation ES, and electro-acoustic stimulation EAS).
