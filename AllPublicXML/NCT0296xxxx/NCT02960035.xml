  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicentral clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      of Recombinant Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Receptor Ⅱ IgG Fc fusion protein injection
      (Yisaipu®) in the treatment of peripheral enthesitis in active axial spondyloarthritis(SpA)
      patients. Mardird sonographic enthesis index (MASEI) was one of the most wide used scoring
      systems for peripheral enthesitis and the only one based on OMERACT definition of
      enthesopathy by EULAR. The primary purpose is to assess the MASEI to discover the value of US
      in diagnosis and prognosis. The second prupose is to assess different maintaining treatment
      programme in SpA patients with improvement of MASEI. The trial will include 96 patients with
      stable NSAIDs therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of
      Yisaipu®. Then at the second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA,
      ASDAS&lt;2.1) at 24th week will be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu®
      group, half-dose of Yisaipu® group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 24
      weeks. Patients who complete the 48-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the
      blind stage would finish the study.
