    <textblock>
      Without high diagnostic efficacy of endoscopic forceps biopsy (EFB) and with low diagnostic
      efficacy of narrow band imaging (NBI) in novice endoscopists and endoscopists of community
      hospitals in China, it is urgent to improve diagnostic efficacy for gastric cancerous
      lesions.The investigators will conduct a study to develop and validate a diagnostic model
      based on NBI for early gastric cancerous lesions under endoscopic observation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic forceps biopsy (EFB) is considered the gold standard and most commonly used for
      histological diagnosis of gastric epithelial neoplasia before proper management.Many studies
      have shown that there exist considerable discrepancies between EFB and subsequently resected
      specimens with discrepancy rate of 27.1-44.5%. On the other hand, with low diagnostic
      efficacy of narrow band imaging (NBI) in novice endoscopists and endoscopists of community
      hospitals in China, not higher diagnostic accuracy of gastric cancerous lesions could be
      observed. Here, the investigators will conduct a study to develop and validate a diagnostic
      model based on narrow band imaging for early gastric cancerous lesions under endoscopic
      observation, trying to improve overall diagnostic efficacy for gastric cancerous lesions.
