      To investigate changes in the concentration of glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glycerol in the
      extracellular fluid of the skeletal muscle following levosimendan administration in patients
      with septic shock.

      The study was designed as a prospective, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial and
      performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit. After achieving normovolemia and a mean
      arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg, 20 septic shock patients were randomized to receive
      either levosimendan 0.2 μg/kg/min, or dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min. Interstitial tissue
      concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were obtained by using muscle
      microdialysis. All measurements, including data from right heart catheterization were
      obtained at baseline and every 6 hours for the following 72 hours after randomization.

    <description>Interstitial tissue concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were determined at baseline and then every six hours for the following 72 hours after randomization.
During the study period, conventional treatment was continued as per usual practice. Fluid challenges were performed, and repeated as necessary, to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) ≥8 and pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAOP) ≥12 mmHg. Norepinephrine was titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg. Packed red blood cells were transfused when Hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations decreased below 7 g/dL, or if the patient exhibited clinical signs of inadequate systemic oxygen supply.</description>
