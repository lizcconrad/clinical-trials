  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic data consistently indicate that colorectal cancer survivors can improve their
      quality-of-life and prognosis by engaging in physical activity. This study aims to build on
      this epidemiologic work and translate the findings to inform and change patient behavior. The
      specific aims are to: (1) Develop a mobile technology physical activity intervention among
      colorectal cancer patients who have completed therapy. (2) Conduct a 3-month pilot randomized
      controlled trial utilizing mobile technology to increase physical activity among 40 men and
      women who have completed standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for primary stage I-III colorectal
      cancer at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Participants in the
      intervention arm will receive a Fitbit® for self-monitoring, interactive text messages, and
      educational print materials; participants in the control arm will receive educational print
      materials at baseline and will be given a Fitbit® after completion of the 3-mo. follow-up
      assessment.
