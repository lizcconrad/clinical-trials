      This study is a randomized, blind, single-center, controlled phase I clinical trial. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a live attenuated varicella vaccine
      manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd. The positive control is a
      commercialized live attenuated varicella vaccine manufactured by Shanghai Institute of
      Biological Products Co., Ltd. (SIBP), and the negative control is diluent of lyophilized
      vaccine manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd. All participants are
      healthy, and will be randomly assigned into experimental group, positive control group, or
      negative control group in the ratio 1:1:1.
