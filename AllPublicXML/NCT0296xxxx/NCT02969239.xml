      The purpose of this study is to compare norepinephrine and phenylephrine on the effects of
      maintaining the cardiac output in Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.

      CO was measured using the NICOMÂ® monitor. Bioreactance, a development from impedance
      technology, is also emerging as an accessible mode of continuous CO monitoring in the
      operating room and can provide valuable insight into the hemodynamic effects of our
      interventions. This method of monitoring provides continuous CO, stroke volume (SV) and heart
      rate (HR) monitoring, and intermittent BP and SVR assessments at 1-minute intervals.

      Either phenylephrine (100 mcg/ml) or norepinephrine (0.5 mcg/ml) in 50-ml syringe that were
      labeled &quot;study drug&quot;. She was not involved in patient's care or study assessment.

      The hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;80% of baseline or &lt; 90 mmHg, and
      managed with study drug (1 ml) intravenously. The bradycardia was defined as HR &lt; 60
      beats/min and was recorded and managed with atropine (0.5 mg) intravenously as HR &lt; 45
      beats/min. The presence of nausea and vomiting was measured on a 3 point scale (1 = no nausea
      and vomiting, 2 = nausea only, and 3 = both nausea and vomiting) and managed with ondansetron
      (4mg) intravenously.
