  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how successful ibrutinib is at putting follicular
      lymphoma into full remission. In this study, remission will be determined by achieving a
      normal PET scan after treatment. A PET scan is an imaging test that looks for active
      lymphoma. People who don't have a complete remission on PET after their first treatment are
      at high risk for having their lymphoma return. This study will investigate if ibrutinib will
      help participants achieve a complete remission without giving additional chemotherapy. The
      study will also investigate any possible side effects of the study drug ibrutinib.

Response to treatment will be determined by FDG-PET imaging every 6 months, or as clinically indicated, in conjunction with clinical assessment by a physician, including physical examination, every 4 weeks from day 1 (baseline) for the first 3 months and then every 3 months until the end of treatment at 2 years.</description>

Treatment will continue for 2 years and there will be no planned treatment breaks. The dose of Ibrutinib will be initiated at 560mg per day, which will remain constant throughout the study period, unless otherwise specified.</description>
