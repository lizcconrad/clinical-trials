    <textblock>
      This is a study of treatment with ruxolitinib in patients who present with transfusion
      dependent or independent anemia at screening defined as an hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL with 10 mg BID
      starting dose with subsequent up titrations depending on safety and efficacy. This dosing
      approach for anemic MF patients will be systematically studied in this prospective
      multicenter phase II open label single arm trial to determine if the levels of spleen length
      reduction and symptom improvement are consistent with those reported in previous clinical
      trials with ruxolitinib in patients with anemia and doses according to platelet counts at the
      moment of treatment initiation, and whether this lower starting dose and up titration
      approach may minimize the initial hemoglobin and platelet declines and transfusion
      requirements.
