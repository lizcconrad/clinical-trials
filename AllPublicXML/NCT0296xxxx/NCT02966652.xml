  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DITEST is an oral formulation of native testosterone for the treatment of androgen deficiency
      in men. The proposed study is a Phase 1 clinical study in hypogonadal men, defined according
      to FDA and Endocrine Society Guidelines, designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      characteristics of DITEST, and to assess the safety and tolerability of DITEST in the target
      population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in male subjects from 18 to 80 years of age requiring
      testosterone replacement therapy for primary or secondary hypogonadism. The study is a
      randomised, active control, single dose, 2-way cross-over study in 2 cohorts. In each cohort
      subjects who meet the entry criteria at screening and baseline will be randomised to one of 2
      sequences:

      Cohort 1: single dose of 120 mg (3 x 40 mg) DITEST followed by a single dose of 80 mg (2 x 40
      mg) testosterone undecanoate or a single dose of 80 mg (2 x 40 mg) testosterone undecanoate
      followed by single dose of 120 mg (3 x 40 mg) DITEST. The two treatments are separated by a
      minimum of a 7-day washout period, with both treatments given in the fed state.

      Cohort 2: single dose of 200 mg (5 x 40 mg) DITEST (fed) followed by a single dose of 200 mg
      DITEST (fasted) or a single dose of 200 mg DITEST (fasted) followed by single dose of 200 mg
      (5 x 40 mg) DITEST (fed). The two treatments are separated by a minimum of a 7-day washout
      period.

      12 subjects will be recruited into each cohort, resulting in a total of 24 subjects being
      administered study medication in this study (note subjects from Cohort 1 cannot be entered
      into Cohort 2). Subjects will not be recruited into Cohort 2 until the results of subjects
      treated in Cohort 1 have been evaluated (this review will determine if the intended dose for
      Cohort 2 needs to be adjusted). No other testosterone treatments are allowed for the duration
      of the study (including the washout periods).

      Each subject will be required to attend the study centre for a minimum of either 4 or 5
      visits: a screening assessment, an evaluation of baseline testosterone levels after the
      washout period from the subject's current medication (only for subjects currently on
      testosterone replacement therapy), both dosing days, and a follow-up visit at the end of the
      study.

      There is an unmet need for a native oral testosterone therapy for men with androgen
      (testosterone) deficiency. Ideally such a treatment should have reproducible PK, does not
      need to be taken with fatty meals, can be taken once or twice daily, and provides
      physiological exposure to testosterone. This Phase 1, randomised, open-label, 2-cohort,
      cross-over study was therefore designed to evaluate the PK characteristics of DITEST in both
      the fed and fasted states according to FDA guidelines, and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of DITEST in the target population.
