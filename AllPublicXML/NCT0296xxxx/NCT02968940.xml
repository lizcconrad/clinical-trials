  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      Avelumab and radiation is for IDH mutant gliomas that have transformed to glioblastoma after
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human antibody of
      the immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) isotype that specifically targets and blocks the Programmed
      death-ligand 1(PD-L1) for Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1).

      Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the
      suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells,
      resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.

             chemotherapy.

          4. Histopathological evidence of glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) on a progressive tumor
             specimen after treatment with temozolomide or PCV chemotherapy. The diagnosis of
             glioblastoma must be confirmed on central review by a study-designated
             neuropathologist at NYULMC at screening.

        Exceptions to this eligibility include the following:

        a. Any progressive glioma with IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, regardless of WHO grade,
        histopathological diagnosis, or prior therapy, will be eligible if the progressive tumor

             transformation to glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) or a progressive specimen that harbors
             one of the genetic alterations specified in Inclusion Criteria 4a. a. If a tumor block
             cannot be submitted, then 20 unstained slides (preferably 10 slides from two different
             tumor blocks from the same surgery) from the tumor specimen must be submitted.
