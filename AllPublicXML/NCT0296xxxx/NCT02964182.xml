  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about the effects of different nicotine
      levels in cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarettes use water vapor
      to deliver nicotine.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 480 participants will be screened to take part in the study, but only about 160
      participants will be enrolled. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Length of Study:

      You will have 5 visits over 10-15 weeks. You will be taken off study if you develop serious
      medical problems, intolerable side effects occur, you are not able to follow the study
      directions, or you become pregnant. Your participation may also be stopped by the study
      doctor at any time for any reason.

      Your participation on this study will be over after the follow-up call (30 days after your
      last study visit).

      Smoking Schedule:

      There are 4 phases to this study. Phase 1 (Week 1), Phase 2 (Weeks 2-4), Phase 3 (Weeks 5-7),
      and Phase 4 (Weeks 8-10).

      During Week 1, you will be asked to smoke your usual cigarette brand as you normally would.

      During Weeks 2-4, you will be asked to smoke only the study cigarettes provided to you. You
      will receive a larger supply than you normally smoke. You may choose to smoke either menthol
      or non-menthol study cigarettes.

      During Weeks 5-10, you will be asked to smoke only the cigarettes and e-cigarettes provided
      to you. You will smoke either low- or high-nicotine content e-cigarettes for the first 3
      weeks (Phase 3) and then switch to whichever one you have not yet received for the remaining
      3 weeks (Phase 4). Neither you nor the study staff will know the order in which you are
      receiving the high- and low-nicotine content e-cigarettes. However, if needed for your
      safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.

      Study Visits:

      At your second visit, you will be given a smartphone to use during the study. If you lose the
      smartphone, you will need to file a police report since the phone is the property of MD
      Anderson. You will not be financially responsible due to the loss of the smartphone. This
      will not affect your compensation. You will receive instructions on how to use it to answer
      questions about your nicotine cravings and mood, and to log your daily smoking activity every
      day for up to 75 days. It should take about 10-15 minutes each day to complete these
      questions. You will be asked to return the smartphone when your participation on the study is
      complete.

      At Visits 1, 2, 3, and 4:

        -  Your CO level will be measured.

        -  A cheek swab will be collected to measure e-cigarette exposure.

        -  You will complete questionnaires about mood, nicotine withdrawal symptoms and smoking
           behavior. These questionnaires will take about 30 minutes to complete.

        -  You will complete an electronic survey about your opinion of the study cigarettes. This
           survey should take about 1 hour to complete.

        -  Urine will be collected for testing for substances that are related to tobacco.

        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. To take part
           in this study, you must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

        -  At Week 1 you will be able to taste test the available e-cigarette flavors and choose
           which one you will use during the study.

      On or about Day 10 of Phases 2, 3, and 4, you will be asked to collect your urine in the
      morning at home to bring to your Visit 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4 for testing for substances
      related to tobacco. Your smartphone will alert you when it is time to collect the samples.
      You will be given a cup to collect your urine in and a biohazard storage bag. You will store
      the cup inside the bag and then will store the bag inside the refrigerator until your next
      visit.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days after your last study visit, you will be called by a member of the study staff
      to ask about how you are doing. This call should last about 10 minutes.
