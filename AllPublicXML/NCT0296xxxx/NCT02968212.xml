  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clofazimine is an orphan antibiotic drug that is no longer available through pharmacies in
      the United States. It is approved for the treatment of Mycobacterium leprae (leprosy)
      infections. Clofazimine has been used for many years off-label against other Mycobacterium,
      including Mycobacteria avium complex (MAC) lung disease, an increasingly prevalent infection
      in older Americans. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently oversees clofazimine use
      to treat MAC lung disease through a special investigational drug access program. However, to
      date, there is little understanding of the benefits and risks of clofazimine when used to
      treat MAC lung disease. Accordingly, the investigators have developed a randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of clofazimine.
      To be eligible, participants must have MAC lung disease, positive sputum cultures for MAC,
      and not currently taking antibiotics for MAC. Eligible participants (102 total enrolled) will
      be randomly given either clofazimine or placebo for 6 months, and followed closely by their
      treating physician. The percentage of participants who become culture negative in each group
      will be compared, as it is suspected that participants treated with clofazimine will be more
      likely to become culture negative. The safety of clofazimine will be measured as well as
      other potential benefits of the therapy including changes in lung function and quality of
      life.
