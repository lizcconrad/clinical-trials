  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is common and the leading cause of therapeutic failure.
      The investigators need better ways to measure adherence in patients on PrEP. This application
      will address the need to measure adherence by evaluating an integrated technology system,
      Proteus Discover, when combined with Truvada. The Proteus Sensor System (PSS) will confirm
      that Truvada was taken, monitor adherence in both recent and long term dosing, and provides
      feedback to encourage adherence. The goal of this study is to determine whether the use of
      the PSS with Truvada will vary the drug concentrations of FTC/TDF. Participants will have 2
      study visits where they will be randomized to either start with the combined PSS with Truvada
      or just Truvada alone. Study participants will come to the Clinical &amp; Translational Research
      Center (CTRC) in the morning and take the assigned dose and will then have blood drawn at
      about .25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 hours after medication is taken. Participants will then
      return to the CTRC for blood draws 24, 48, and 72 hours after they took the dose on the first
      day. The second visit will mimic the first except that the participant will take the other
      dose form.
