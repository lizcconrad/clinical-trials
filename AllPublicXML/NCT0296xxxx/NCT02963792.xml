  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to their difficult and stressful work surgeons are under continuous physical and mental
      stress exposing them to increased risk for burnout and lack of professionalism. The present
      intervention focuses on providing time and a safe space to debrief and explore personal and
      group experiences and dilemmas, as well as acquire coping skills related to burnout,
      communication and professionalism.
