    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCV-116CCB (candesartan
      cilexetil and amlodipine besylate fixed-dose combination) in Chinese participants with mild
      to moderate hypertension who do not reach target blood pressure following 4 weeks of
      treatment with amlodipine monotherapy.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TCV-116CCB (candesartan cilexetil and
      amlodipine besylate fixed-dose combination). This study will look at blood pressure in
      Chinese participants with grade 1 or 2 essential hypertension.

      The study will enroll approximately 370 patients. Prior to the start of study treatment,
      participants will undergo run-in period of 2 weeks followed by single-blind treatment period
      of 4 weeks. Upon completion of single-blind treatment period, participants will be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will
      remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Amlodipine 5 mg

        -  TCV-116CCB (Candesartan 8 mg Plus Amlodipine 5 mg)

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet/capsule at the same time each day
      throughout the study up to 8 weeks.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted China. The overall time to participate in this study
      is 19 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by
      telephone plus a final visit 14 days after receiving their last dose of drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
