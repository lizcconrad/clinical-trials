  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part Phase 1/2 dose escalation and dose expansion study of the GMCSFencoding
      adenovirus, ONCOS-102, in combination with anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PDL1) antibody,
      durvalumab, in adult subjects with peritoneal disease who have failed prior standard
      chemotherapy and have histologically confirmed platinum-resistant or refractory epithelial
      ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer.

    <description>Clinical laboratory tests, vital sign and weight measurements, physical exams, performance status evaluation, imaging scans and any other medically indicated assessments, including subject interviews, will be performed to detect new abnormalities and deteriorations of any pre-existing conditions. The investigator will evaluate any laboratory abnormalities for clinical significance, and clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded as adverse events. All clinically significant abnormalities and deteriorations from time of signing the informed consent to the end of study visit will be recorded in the Case Report Forms as adverse events and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03.</description>

    <description>During Phase 1 of the study, subjects will be evaluated for DLTs before proceeding to a subsequent cohort. Dose escalation for the determination of RCD will be performed based on the available dose levels and the respective rules for a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation study design.
For Cohort A, ONCOS-102 (1 x 10^11 VP) will be given as monotherapy the first six weeks, and then durvalumab (1500 mg) will be starting on day 71.
For Cohorts B and C, ONCOS-102 will be administered for a total of 6 weeks while durvalumab will be given for a total of 12 four-week cycles.</description>
