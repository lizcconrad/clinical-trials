    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer with positive is defined as stage IV disease in 7th AJCC/UICC TNM staging
      system. Controversy exists on the treatment of this part of patients. This trial aimed to
      explore the optimal treatment strategy for stage IV gastric cancer with positive peritoneal
      cytology as the only non-curable factor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 7th AJCC/UICC TNM staging system, gastric cancer with positive peritoneal cytology
      (CY+) is defined as stage IV disease. In NCCN clinical practice guidelines, it is suggested
      that positive peritoneal cytology in the absence of visible peritoneal implants should be
      considered as M1 disease and surgery as initial treatment is not recommended for patients
      with positive peritoneal cytology. However, in the Japanese gastric cancer treatment
      guidelines 2014, it is suggested that standard gastrectomy can be proposed for patients with
      no other non-curative factors and if the CY+ status was revealed after surgery, postoperative
      treatment with S-1 can be recommended as the tentative standard. Previous studies have also
      proved that extensive intraperitoneal lavage(EIPL) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal
      Chemotherapy(HIPEC) are effective methods for the treatment of peritoneal metastasis.

      In order to optimize the treatment strategy of this part of patients, this trial is designed
      to compare the effectiveness of 2 treatment strategies.

    <description>Patients will receive hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) during laparoscopic staging. Then 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy and clinical evaluation of chemotherapy will be performed. If the patient's disease is evaluated as progressed, the patient will receive systemic therapy. If it's stable or remission, a second time laparoscopic staging and peritoneal cytology examination will be performed. If peritoneal implant is observed, the patients will receive systemic therapy. If the peritoneal cytology is still positive, the treatment will be decided according to the suggestion of MDT discussion. If the peritoneal cytology is converted negative, standard gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and extensive intraperitoneal lavage (EIPL) will be performed. Postoperative chemotherapy will be determined according to the pathological evaluation of preoperative chemotherapy response.</description>
