  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hospitalizations for a diagnosis of angioedema doubled from the year 2000 to
      2009. Although some of the cases represented hereditary angioedema or ace-inhibitor induced
      angioedema, the majority of episodes were idiopathic. Idiopathic Angioedema (IAE) can be
      life- threatening especially when affecting tissues within the respiratory tract. No clear
      guidelines exist for management of this important condition for clinicians. Current therapies
      typically include avoidance of potential triggers and use of medications either for
      prophylaxis or for acute events, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine.
      There remains a critical need for therapeutic options to provide more effective prophylaxis.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial which will
      study the effects of omalizumab on patients with 2 or more episodes of Idiopathic Angioedema
      (IAE) in the past 6 months, despite current therapy. This study has three periods; screening,
      treatment, and follow-up. Subjects in the screening period will be consented and screened for
      eligibility criteria. 40 qualified individuals will enter the treatment period. Individuals
      will be randomized to either monthly subcutaneous administration of omalizumab 300mg (20
      subjects) versus monthly placebo injection (20 subjects) in addition to their previously
      prescribed management plan for a total of 6 months. Individuals will then enter a follow-up
      period of 4 months. Study visits will occur monthly during the treatment period for update of
      clinical status and administration of omalizumab/placebo injection. After, the treatment
      period individuals will be seen twice for follow-up period. The entire study will consist of
      10 study visits and will last approx. 10 months.
