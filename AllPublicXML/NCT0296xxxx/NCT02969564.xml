  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of metastases in a patient with primary or recurrent prostate cancer has major
      prognostic implication.

      The purpose is to compare, in a pilot study, the diagnostic performance of 18F-NaF-PET/MR
      with respect to the results of the scintigraphy 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT (routine exam) for
      determining the presence or absence of bone lesions in prostate cancer patient, with up to
      five metastases (oligo-bone metastatic) based on scintigraphy 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT. The gold
      standard will be a combination of clinical follow-up, additional imaging and biopsy, as
      indicated by the multidisciplinary discussion at the tumor board. The findings from
      whole-body 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT, 18F-NaF-PET/MR, and the combination of the 2 modalities will
      be categorized by 2 teams of 2 readers as benign or probably benign, equivocal, or malignant
      or probably malignant and compared with the results of follow-up for JAFROC and ROC analysis.
