    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of peanut allergy. In this research the investigators
      would like to learn more about ways to treat peanut allergies. There is currently no known
      cure for peanut allergy. The primary aim is to assess safety and tolerability of oral FMT in
      patients with peanut allergy aged 18-40 years.

      This is a study of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of peanut allergy.
      The primary aim is to assess safety and tolerability of oral FMT in patients with peanut
      allergy aged 18-40 years. A total of 10 patients with peanut allergy will be enrolled after
      they fail a screening food challenge to peanut. Participating will be given oral encapsulated
      frozen FMT over 2 days. Patients will undergo a second and third food challenge after
      receiving FMT. The expected duration of the study for each subject will be one year. Stool
      collection, skin testing and blood samples will be done serially.
