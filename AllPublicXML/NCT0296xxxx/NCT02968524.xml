  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will focus on testing the accuracy of ThermoSpot -a low-cost, color-based,
      temperature indicator in estimating the body temperature of Nigerian babies exposed to
      ambient temperature conditions. The particpants will be recruited among babies receiving
      Filtered Sunlight Phototherapy (FSPT) at Bowen University Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso and
      other babies in the nursery at Bowen University Teaching Hospital.

      There will also be an educational session to teach health workers and mothers about the signs
      for hypothermia and hyperthermia on the indicator. Then, the investigators will collect
      observational cross-sectional data on random days to see how many of the trained health
      workers and mothers were able to accurately recognize and provide appropriate response to
      warning signs on the indicator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ThermoSpot is a liquid crystal display thermometer. It comes as a sticky disc (12mm in
      diameter) which can be applied to the skin over the liver, in the armpit, or over the neck
      blood vessels of an infant. ThermoSpot was designed as a non-invasive hypothermia indicator
      for infants. The device changes color when the baby's core body temperature changes, allowing
      it to be understood even by a non-literate parent. It has been tested and proven to
      accurately detect hypothermia in Malawi, Nepal and India. However, no large-scale studies
      have been performed on babies exposed to ambient temperatures for long periods such as those
      under FSPT.

      The main objective of the project is to determine whether ThermoSpot can be used to detect
      hypothermia or hyperthermia in babies receiving FSPT instead of thermometers. The ability of
      a parent to respond in a timely manner to the temperature indicator will help provide
      critical information on technical, as well as educational components required for FSPT
      scale-up in Nigeria and other resource-limited countries with health worker shortage.

      Specific objectives

        1. Compare the performance of ThermoSpot in the detection of hypothermia or hyperthermia
           with the standard axillary thermometer measurement.

        2. Determine if parents are able to correctly interpret the color indicators on ThermoSpot

        3. Determine whether parents carry out the appropriate action based on the ThermoSpot
           indicator.
