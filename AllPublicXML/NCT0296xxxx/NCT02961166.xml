  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      57 patients with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring Extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) therapy were analyzed retrospectively. 28 patients had received
      immunglobulin M-enriched immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG); 29 patients did not receive IVIG
      therapy.

      These patients were analyzed regarding length of stay in intensive care unit (LOS ICU),
      length of stay (LOS) in hospital and regarding mortality.

      57 patients with ARDS requiring ECMO therapy were analyzed retrospectively. 28 patients had
      received IgM-enriched immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG); 29 patients did not receive IVIG
      therapy.

      Patient characteristics, like Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) and
      Sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SAPS) Score, preexisting diseases, origin of
      infection, duration of ECMO therapy were analyzed in these patients.

      These patients were further analyzed regarding LOS ICU, LOS in hospital and regarding
      mortality.
