    <masking_description>Glucagon and placebo were blinded by the research pharmacy. Subjects were given bags of blinded medication labeled with which day they were to be used, and then were asked to label the bags with which day the medication was actually used. The contents of the bags were verified with the research pharmacy's blinding key upon completion of the study.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21 years or older with a gastric bypass for more than 1 year.

          -  Post-bariatric hypoglycemia with prior episodes of neuroglycopenia, unresponsive to
             dietary intervention (low glycemic index, controlled carbohydrate portions) and trial
             of acarbose therapy at the maximally tolerated dose. Other therapies will not exclude
             a subject as long as the therapy is continued during the study.

          -  Otherwise healthy (mild chronic disease such as asthma, hypertension, and depression
             will be allowed if well controlled).

          -  Self-reported frequency of documented hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 60 mg/dl verified by
             capillary blood glucose measurements) of at least 2 times per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Unable to comply with study procedures.

          -  Current participation in another hypoglycemia related clinical trial other than one
             that is primarily observational in nature.

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception.

          -  Use of insulin and/or insulin secretogues as sulfonylurea, metglitides, and
             glitazones.

          -  History of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, type 1 diabetes or other pancreatic disease.

          -  End stage renal disease on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).

          -  Any known liver or biliary disease including cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease,
             non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, any form of viral
             hepatitis.

          -  Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or
             orthopnea).

          -  Acute illness or exacerbation of chronic illness at the time of the study.

          -  Known insulinoma or predominantly fasting pattern of hypoglycemia

          -  Adrenal insufficiency. Congenital hyperinsulinemia presenting with hypoglycemia during
             infancy.

          -  History of pheochromocytoma. Fractionated metanephrines will be tested in patients
             with history increasing the risk for a catecholamine secreting tumor:

          -  Paroxysms of tachycardia, pallor, or headache.

          -  Personal or family history of MEN 2A, MEN 2B, neurofibromatosis, or von Hippel-Lindau
             disease.

          -  Episodic or treatment refractory (requiring 4 or more medications to achieve
             normotension) hypertension.

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and/or any psychiatric hospitalization in
             the last year).

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days) or substance
             abuse (any use within the last 6 months of controlled substances without a
             prescription).

          -  Unwilling or unable to refrain from drinking more than two drinks in an hour or more
             than four drinks in a day during the trial.

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be
             susceptible to RF interference.

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and
             vomiting.

          -  Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen during the study period.

          -  Any factors that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with
             the safe completion of the study procedures.
