  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 6-week, proof-of-concept, open trial of vortioxetine for 20 patients with
      major depressive disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved vortioxetine to treat major depressive
      disorder in 2013. Researchers believe vortioxetine may improve pattern separation and pattern
      completion (i.e., a neurological function) in people with major depressive disorder; thus,
      this research study aims to determine how vortioxetine increases a person's ability to think.
      The current study is an open label trial, therefore, all participants will receive
      vortioxetine. Furthermore, participants receive the vortioxetine at no cost. It will take
      participants 6 weeks to complete this study. Participants are asked to come to the Mass
      General Hospital campus for 1 screening visit which includes a full psychiatric evaluation,
      and 5 additional study visits. During study visits, participants will meet with a clinician
      and then complete computer based cognitive tests.
