  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to pilot cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-AR)for
      avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in 10 youth with ARFID (ages 10-21y).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to pilot the CBT-AR treatment in youth with ARFID to determine
      treatment acceptability and efficacy.This includes evaluating the efficacy and acceptability
      of CBT-AR in reducing primary ARFID symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, and to assess
      whether improvement in individual symptoms is related to the timing of relevant
      interventions. The investigators hypothesize that from pre-treatment to post-treatment,
      subjects with ARFID will increase percentage of calories coming from fruits, vegetables, and
      protein; and decrease severity of self-reported ARFID symptoms, decrease self-reported
      anxiety and depression, and improve psychosocial functioning. The investigators further
      hypothesize that overall, subjects with ARFID will have reduced phobic avoidance, sensory
      sensitivity, and/or low appetite in comparison to their pre-treatment symptoms.
