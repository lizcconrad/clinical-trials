    <description>Patients should apply Nailner 2 in 1 daily in the affected nail 2X a day, morning and night for 30 days. After 30 days passed to apply only 1x daily. No need to sand the nail before the application and the product should be applied on the entire nail, including the sides and the area affected by ringworm. Avoiding wett the nail after application and expose the nail.
They should also apply ciclopirox 8% nail polish in the first month of treatment every other day (day in and day out). In the second month applied twice a week. In the third month applied once a week. Apply on the affected nails, previously sanded. On the application of two products, Ciclopirox should be applied between the investigational product applications, e.g., in the middle of the day and the investigational product at the beginning and end of the day in the sun.</description>
