  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic data suggest that a Western dietary pattern after diagnosis of colorectal
      cancer increases risk of disease recurrence and death. High intake of red and processed meat,
      dairy, refined grains, and sweets/desserts characterize a 'Western dietary pattern'. This
      study aims to translate the epidemiologic findings into a patient-centered, web-based dietary
      intervention with text messaging to inform and modify users' dietary choices. The
      investigators' specific aims are to: 1) Develop a web-based dietary intervention with text
      messaging for colorectal cancer survivors; and 2) Conduct a 12-week pilot randomized
      controlled trial to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the dietary intervention
      among 50 colorectal cancer survivors. All participants will receive standard of care print
      materials regarding diet following a colorectal cancer diagnosis. Participants in the
      intervention group will also receive access to a web-based dietary intervention with text
      messaging for 12 weeks. This study will generate preliminary data on the effect of the
      intervention on dietary choices among colorectal cancer survivors for future studies.
