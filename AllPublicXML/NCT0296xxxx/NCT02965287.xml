  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a diagnostic test for the evaluation of the presence of
      fetal malformations through metabolomic analysis of maternal peripheral blood serum by
      chromatographic techniques and mass spectrometry, and subsequent mathematical modeling
      analysis of the data by means of multivariate mathematical models specifically developed for
      this purpose. The study aims at determining the performance parameters (specificity,
      sensibility, positive predictive value (PPN), negative predictive value (NPV), etc.) of the
      test and its applicability. To do this, the investigators will use the serum samples of the
      patients enrolled in New Zealand in the SCOPE Study (www.scopestudy.net), an international
      study conducted between years 2004-2008.

  <detailed_description>

      The test has been developed in a case-control study. In this clinical trial the investigators
      will test it in a large cohort that is likely to resemble a real population. The purpose of
      validation is to see if the test is able to recognize the few malformed fetuses in the entire
      population and especially its specificity in real conditions. In addition, the investigators
      will check whether particular maternal conditions (such as preeclampsia, gestational
      diabetes, etc.) or fetal conditions (Small for gestational age, Large for gestational age,
      etc.) affect the test results.

    <description>The test validation will be performed on the 1943 serum samples of pregnant women at 19-21 weeks' gestation recruited in New Zealand for the SCOPE Study.
All the samples will be analyzed to extract and purify the whole metabolome. Metabolites will be characterized through mass spectrometric techniques. These data will be interpreted by means of a bioinformatic algorithm specifically designed for this purpose.</description>

    <ipd_description>Test validation of the screening technique will be conducted blinded. The investigators will have access only to the serum samples identified by their unique ID. At the end of the analytical phase, the database containing results will be locked. The database will be transferred to an independent investigator (Prof. Alessio Fasano at Mass General Hospital for Children, Boston, USA) for data analysis. At the same time, information related to pregnancy outcomes (in terms of presence or absence of fetal anomaly) will be transferred from the University of Auckland to the Mass General Hospital for Children, which will provide the blind break and will procced to the estimation of the test performance.</ipd_description>
