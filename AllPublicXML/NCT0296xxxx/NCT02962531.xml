    <textblock>
      An open-label, randomized, three-period, three-way crossover trial of single doses of IX-01
      in 12 healthy male subjects. In each period, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 1600
      mg IX-01, either as an aqueous dispersion in a fasted state, or as caplets in the fed or
      fasted state

      This is a Relative Bioavailability Study to compare single oral doses of 1600mg IX-01, either
      as an aqueous dispersion in a fasted state, or as caplets in the fed or fasted state. Each
      volunteer in the study will receive each of the formulations listed below. Each formulation
      will be separated by at least a 5-day drug-free (washout) period.

        -  Treatment A: A single 1600 mg (4 x 400 caplets) oral dose of IX-01 under fasted
           conditions

        -  Treatment B: A single 1600 mg (4 x 400 caplets) oral dose of IX-01 under fed conditions

        -  Treatment C: A single 1600 mg aqueous dispersion (20 mL) oral dose of IX-01 under fasted
           conditions.

      In the fasted treatment periods, dosing will follow an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.

      In the fed treatment period, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a standard
      high-calorie, high-fat breakfast meal will be given 30 minutes prior to administration of the
      study drug.

      There will be a final follow-up visit 7-10 days after the final dose of study medication.
