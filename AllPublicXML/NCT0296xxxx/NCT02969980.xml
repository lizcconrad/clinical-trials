    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of post-transplantation
      cyclophosphamide with myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

  <detailed_description>

      -  Conditioning regimen for lower risk diseases A) Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day i.v. daily
           for 2 days (days -6 and -5) B) Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day i.v. daily for 5 days (days -6
           to -2)

        -  Conditioning regimen for higher risk diseases A) Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day i.v. daily For 4
           days (days -6 to -3) in patients aged &lt; 55 years For 2 days (days -6 and -5) in patients
           aged ≥ 55 years B) Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day i.v. daily on days -6 to -2 (for 5 days)

        -  Harvest and infusion of donor hematopoietic cells Harvested peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells of donors via leukapheresis will be infused to recipients on day 0. Additional
           infusion on day 1 can be made based on the judgement of attending physician.

        -  GVHD prophylaxis A) Cyclophosphamide 25 mg/kg/day i.v. daily on days 3 and 4 (for 2
           days) B) Cyclosporine: 1.5 mg/kg i.v. every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and changed to
           oral dosing when oral intake is possible. The dosage will be tapered beginning between
           day 30 and 60.
