      The primary objective of this study is to determine the difference in disease specific
      quality of life outcome measures between patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the
      shoulder joint whom require a total shoulder replacement between the following study arms:
      1)TSA using an augmented component compared with TSA using a standard component with
      eccentric reaming in patients 65 years of age or younger or 2) TSA using an augmented
      component or reverse shoulder arthroplasty in patients older than 65 years of age as measured
      by the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS) score at post-operative
      time intervals (ie. 3, 6, 12 and 24 months).

      The secondary objective is to determine the difference in disease specific quality of life
      between treatment allocations in both age groups as measured by the Constant score, the
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment form (ASES) and the
      EuroQol Group EQ-5D-5L score at post-operative time intervals (ie. 3, 6, 12 and 24 months).

      A secondary objective will be to determine the survivorship of the components as measured by
      the degree of radiographic lucencies and component alignment determined by a CT scan at 1 and
      5 years post-surgery between study allocations in both age groups.

    <measure>the Constant score</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant Score reflects an overall clinical functional assessment. This instrument is based on a 100-point scoring system calculated from a self-assessment portion that evaluates pain and ability to perform tasks of daily living, and a clinical assessment which tests active range of shoulder motion and strength.</description>

    <description>The ASES is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL).</description>

    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire is a brief, easy to administer generic health status questionnaire, consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. It also includes a visual analogue scale for recording an individual's rating of their current health-related quality of life (scale 0 to 100).</description>

    <description>All patients will undergo treatment with shoulder arthroplasty. Patients 65 years of age or younger will be randomly assigned to one of two standard of care treatment groups:
Total Shoulder Arthroplasty with Eccentric Glenoid Reaming: Pre-operative CT imaging and surgical planning software based on pre-operative CT scans will be used in each case to determine the degree of eccentric (&quot;high side&quot;) anterior reaming to within &lt; 15 degrees of neutral glenoid version.
Total Shoulder Arthroplasty with Augmented Glenoid Component Implantation: Patients will undergo standard glenoid preparation and implantation of a posteriorly augmented glenoid component. The degree of posterior augment will be based on pre-operative CT scan assessment and templating software with the goal of correcting glenoid retroversion to within 10 degrees of neutral version.</description>

          1. Patients who have failed standard non-surgical management of their shoulder arthritis
             who would benefit from a shoulder arthroplasty. Failed medical management will be
             defined as persistent pain and disability despite adequate standard non-operative
             management for 6 months. Medical management will be defined as:

             retroversion.
