    <textblock>
      This research trial studies the gut microbiome in fecal samples from patients with cancer
      that has spread to other parts of the body who are undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
      Studying samples of feces from patients with metastatic cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn if the make-up of the gut microbiome has a positive or negative influence to a
      patient's response to chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantitatively determine the composition of the microflora and their gene and protein
      expression levels in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer being treated with
      fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy, or anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the changes in species composition and in the metabolic activities (as determined
      in the primary objective) with response to chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

      II. Compare the changes in species composition and in the metabolic activities (as determined
      in the primary objective) with toxicities and side effects resulting with chemotherapy or
      immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of fecal specimens at baseline, prior to start of each course of
      chemotherapy or immunotherapy, at the end of weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8, at the end of course 3 and
      courses thereafter of chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and at the time of disease progression
      or going off-treatment. Fecal specimens are analyzed via 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      gene sequencing, meta-transcriptomics analysis, and meta-proteomics analysis.
