  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to understand how to improve retention in care and treatment services to HIV
      positive pregnant women and their babies in Swaziland. The investigators will evaluate
      outcomes of patients who are lost-to-follow-up (LTF) under a new approach for prevention of
      mother-to-child (PMTCT) called Option B+, where all HIV positive pregnant women initiate
      lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of their disease stage. The goal is to
      understand the outcomes of patients who are LTF from care, and the reasons for disengagement
      from care in the context of PMTCT in order to inform efforts to improve retention in care
      among patients under Option B+.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted among approximately 1,600 women and their infants who received
      Option B+ PMTCT services at ten facilities in Swaziland. These facilities were included in
      another study on Option B+ called Safe Generations in which routinely collected patient-level
      data was abstracted from medical registers. This study has three parts: the first is a review
      of alternative patient medical records among women and their infants who were documented as
      LTF in the Safe Generations study. The second component consists of tracing women who are LTF
      on the phone or in the community to administer a questionnaire. Lastly, an in-depth interview
      will be conducted among a sub-group of women to explore patterns of care.
