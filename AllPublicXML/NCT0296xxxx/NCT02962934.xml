      The purpose of this study is to try to find out how critically ill patients receiving the
      antibiotic, ceftolozane-tazobactam, process it in their body. Investigators would like to
      study if the antibiotic concentrations during a dose of this antibiotic reaches the right
      concentrations necessary to kill the bacteria that is causing the infection. The process by
      which a drug travels through the body in blood, how it is broken down and removed by the body
      is called pharmacokinetics (PK). We can measure the PK by taking blood samples at specific
      times after the antibiotic is given.

      Investigators would like to do the study in patients receiving dialysis and patients who are
      not receiving dialysis. This information about how the antibiotic is processed in the
      critically ill patient is unknown and it is important to know whether the doses doctors give
      patients to fight infection are adequate. If antibiotic concentrations are low in the blood,
      it gives the bacteria an opportunity to become resistant to the antibiotic which can lead to
      the antibiotic being less effective against bacteria potentially exposing future patients
      with infections to a limited range of effective antibiotics.

      Patients will be consented, and given the antibiotic as prescribed. Blood samples will be
      taken from the drip that is already in the patients arm just as the antibiotic starts, at 15
      and 45 minutes, at 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 hours. Patients who are on dialysis will have the
      blood samples taken from the dialysis machine before the blood reaches the dialysis filter
      (same blood samples as the non dialysis patients) and also bloods samples taken after the
      filter at 45 minutes, 2 and 6 hours. Dialysis patients will also have 5 separate samples of
      ultrafiltrate taken (approximately 10mls) - ultrafiltrate is the waste product of the
      dialysis process. The total amount of blood will be 40mls which is equal to about 2
      tablespoons. The dialysis patient will have 50mls of blood taken.Information about the
      patients ICU stay will also be recorded.

    <textblock>
      Ceftolozane-tazobactam has recently emerged as a highly valuable option for the management of
      severe Gram-negative infections including those caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR)
      organisms, demonstrating superior antibacterial activity against the pathogens most
      frequently causing serious infection in the critically ill, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      and Enterobacteriaceae spp, when compared with other commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics.

      Although the continued reduction in the pathogen susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics
      in ICUs could be multifactorial, the potential contribution from inappropriate antibiotic
      exposure is undoubtedly very significant. Numerous clinical studies have reported
      sub-therapeutic antibiotic concentrations in ICU patients across different antibiotic
      classes, with conventional dosing regimens. This is due to marked changes in the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of antibiotics in the critically ill arising
      from disease-related physiological changes. Ceftolozane being a structural analogue of
      ceftazidime, shares similar PK properties of ceftazidime, and other beta-lactams, with a
      short half-life of about 2 hours, distribution into extracellular fluid, and predominant
      renal elimination, which all make it vulnerable to disease-related PK alterations in the
      critically ill.

      Inappropriate antibiotic exposure in the ICU can also arise due to use of extracorporeal
      therapies such as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Many beta-lactam antibiotics
      share similar physicochemical and PK properties with ceftolozane and are efficiently cleared
      by CRRT machines. However the extent of total drug clearance during CRRT is variable not only
      due to the different modalities and operational settings across different institutions, but
      also due to the variable residual renal clearance associated with the degree of renal
      impairment. The traditional dosing considerations in patients undergoing CRRT mainly focus on
      the notion of renal impairment and generally consider low doses without giving appropriate
      consideration to the possibly high extracorporeal clearance, and thus risking under dosing.
      In a similar fashion, the product information for ceftolozane-tazobactam or the prescriber's
      information by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommends a ten-fold
      lower-than-normal dose for use during renal replacement therapy (maintenance dose of 150mg
      versus 1.5g in those with normal renal function). However, to date there is limited data from
      clinical studies during CRRT in ICU patients to confirm if such a low dose provides
      appropriate antibiotic exposure. Lessons from studies on other beta-lactams suggest that
      ceftolozane may be subject to extensive but variable clearance during CRRT. It is therefore,
      essential to describe the adequacy of dosing in patients receiving CRRT, given that fact and
      that several additional pathophysiological factors affect the PK and PD of antibiotics even
      in the absence of extracorporeal circuits.

      This prospective observational study will describe, firstly, the PK of ceftolozane-tazobactam
      in ICU patients who are not receiving CRRT, and secondly, the influence of CRRT on the PK and
      dosing requirements of ceftolozane-tazobactam in critically ill patients. This study will
      generate new PK data in ICU patients describing the exposure to ceftolozane-tazobactam from
      the recommended dosing regimen thereby allowing assessment of its adequacy and/or defining
      appropriate dosing. Further, it will provide invaluable insight into the altered dosing needs
      of patients receiving CRRT to enable its use in such patients through prediction of any
      necessary dosing corrections to account for the due effect of CRRT.
