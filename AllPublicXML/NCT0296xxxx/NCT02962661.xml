      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
      to standard of care drugs can help control heart failure that may have been caused by
      anthracyclines. The safety of the MSCs will also be studied.

      MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many
      different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart
      failure. The MSCs used in this study were collected from healthy donors and are stored and
      grown in a lab at MD Anderson.

      This is an investigational study. MSCs are not FDA-approved or commercially available. They
      are being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how they are designed
      to work.

      Up to 72 participants will be take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in a roll of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive MSCs by vein and standard of care drugs for
           heart failure at MD Anderson.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive MSCs injected into your heart at Baylor St.
           Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC) and standard of care drugs for heart failure at MD
           Anderson. You will have an additional screening visit 1 week before your procedure. At
           this visit you will sign an additional consent form for the screening and procedure
           visits at BSLMC.

        -  If you are in Group 3, you will only receive standard of care drugs for heart failure.

      You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are in Group 1, you will receive MSCs by vein over about 10-20 minutes 1 time each
      week for 4 weeks in the outpatient clinic at MD Anderson. You will remain in the clinic for
      up to 6 hours after each MSC infusion so the study staff may check you for any side effects.
      You will also receive standard of care drugs for heart failure. The study doctor will tell
      you which drugs you are taking, their risks, and when you should take them.

      If you are in Group 2, you will sign separate consent forms at BSLMC. You may have to have
      additional screening tests and/or screening tests repeated. This will be explained to you.

      You will have a procedure where the doctor will insert a long, narrow tube, called a
      catheter, into a blood vessel, usually in your leg, and then guide the catheter to your heart
      with the help of a special x-ray machine. X-ray dye is then injected through the catheter so
      that the x-ray machine can take pictures/video of your heart. This procedure is called a
      cardiac catheterization/left heart ventricular angiography. The doctor then uses a special
      device, called NOGA, which monitors your heart function. This procedure, referred to as NOGA
      mapping, will help your doctor find out which part of your heart muscle is still healthy but
      is not receiving enough blood and oxygen because this is the part that is most likely to
      respond to the MSC injections. This helps the doctor decide where to inject the MSCs.

      Your doctor will use a special catheter with a retractable needle to inject the study product
      into the damaged area of your heart muscle. This catheter is investigational and not approved
      by the FDA. There will be about 15 injections of a very small amount (a drop) of fluid
      containing millions of cells into your heart muscle. Following the procedure, you will be
      watched overnight.

      If you are in Group 3, you will receive standard of care drugs for heart failure. The study
      doctor will tell you which drugs you are taking, their risks, and when you should take them.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1, 14, 21, and 28 (+/- 5 days), if you are in Group 1 or 3:

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your heart and
           liver function.

        -  On Day 28 only, you will have an ECHO.

      If you are in Group 2, on the day of the procedure:

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your heart and
           liver function.

        -  You will have 3 EKGs in a row and an ECHO.

      One (1) time each month during Months 1-6, all participants:

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your heart and
           liver function. At Months 3 and 6, this blood will also be used for biomarker testing.
           At Month 6, this blood will be used for antibody testing.

        -  You will have a follow-up visit with your cardiologist. If you are in Group 3, you will
           have a follow-up visit with your cardiologist one (1) time each month during Months 2-6.

        -  You will have a follow-up visit with your transplant doctor. If you are in Group 3, you
           will have a follow-up visit with your transplant doctor one (1) time each month during
           Months 2-6.

        -  At Months 3 and 6 only, you will have an EKG.

        -  At Months 2 and 6 only, you will have an ECHO.

      At Month 12:

        -  You will have a follow-up visit with your transplant doctor.

        -  You will have a follow-up visit with your cardiologist.

        -  You will have an EKG and ECHO.

      Length of Study:

      If you are in Group 1, you will be able to receive up to 4 infusions of MSCs. If you are in
      Group 2, you will be receive about 15 injections of MSCs during the procedure.You will no
      longer be able to receive the MSCs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      If you are in Group 3, your length of treatment will depend on the standard of care therapy
      chosen.

      Your participation in this study will be over after Month 12.
