      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Paclitaxel Eluting Hemodialysis Shunt Balloon
      Dilatation Catheter (APERTO) compared with the Balloon Dilatation catheter (OHICHO II) for
      the treatment of Arteriovenous Fistulae Stenosis in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled, open-label, superiority study. A
      total of 160 subjects will be enrolled from 10 sites in China. All subjects enrolled will be
      randomly assigned to the test group (APERTO group, n=80) and the control group (OHICHO II
      group, n=80) with randomized allocation ratio of 1:1. Subjects in the test group and the
      control group will be treated with APERTO OTW or OHICHO II respectively.

             trial. He or She volunteers to participate in this trial and can provide written
             informed consent, and is willing to accept the scheduled follow-up in specific time
             points.

             access dysfunction due to stenosis lesions.

          -  Patients with indications of the percutaneous endovascular therapy, that is, the AVF
             stenosis is related to hemodynamics and ≥ 50%, and with any of the following clinical
             and physiological abnormalities (referred to NKF-K/DOQI guideline definitions):

               5. Unexplained decreases in dialysis dose

               6. Decreased access flow

          -  Target lesion is a de novo or restenosis. The number of target lesions is 1.

             arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to the distal end of subclavian vein, except the
             anastomosis of native AVF.

          -  If patient has non-target lesion, it must be successfully treated using PTA before
             treating target lesion.

          -  Reference vessel diameter of target lesion ≥ 4.0 mm and ≤ 7.0 mm by visual estimate

          -  Patients who have participated in another investigational drug or device trial.

             days of entry into this study

          -  Immature AVF, which cannot be used for Dialysis or has not been used successfully due

             flow volume.

          -  Patients with AVG.

          -  AVF has been previously implanted with stent.

          -  Lesion in AVF has been previously treated with DEB.

          -  Target lesion is located in the anastomosis of native AVF.
