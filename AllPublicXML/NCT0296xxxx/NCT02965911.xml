  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease, ursodeoxycholic acid
      (UDCA) is the only drug approved for the treatment of PBC. Although UDCA can improve the
      clinical outcomes in patients with PBC, about 40% of PBC patients show an incomplete
      biochemical response to this treatment, accordingly have a significantly increased risk of
      developing liver transplantation or death. Therefor there is a urgently needed for better
      therapies for these patients. The development of new treatments is therefore needed. The
      Fenofibrate is the candidate, there is now a substantial body of circumstantial evidence
      supporting that Fenofibrate is well tolerated and can improve biochemical response in PBC
      patients with incompleted response to UDCA. The purpose of this protocol is to conduct a
      trial in a selected population of patients with PBC based on an incomplete biochemical
      response after 12 months of UDCA therapy.
