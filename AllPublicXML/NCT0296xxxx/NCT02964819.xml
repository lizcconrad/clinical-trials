      This project will analyze the influence of interferential current therapy in an exercise
      program for individuals with a unilateral impact syndrome diagnosis. To that end, volunteers
      of both genders, aged 18-59 years, had an unilateral, unilateral pain in the shoulder with
      more than 3 months duration, at least grade 4 pain by the numerical scale of pain assessment,
      positivity In at least 2 of 3 orthopedic tests for impact syndrome, will be randomized into
      the following groups: exercise group, exercise + ultrasound group, exercise group +
      interferential current. Sixteen consecutive treatment sessions will be performed, and the
      volunteers will be evaluated before and after, by means of the following instruments:
      Numerical scale of evaluation of pain, Shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI),
      Pain-Related Catastrophizing Thoughts Scale, being applied the Numerical scale of evaluation
      of pain at the end of Each session and one month after the end of treatment.

    <description>The Shoulder pain and disability index in the numerical version consists of 13 items distributed in the domain of pain (five items) and function (eight items), each item being scored on a numerical rating scale of 0 to 10 points. The final score of the questionnaire, as well as the score obtained separately by each domain, is converted into a percentage for values ranging from 0 to 100, with the highest score indicating worse shoulder dysfunction condition.</description>

    <description>Addition to the exercise protocol performed in the exercise group the interferential current. Four self-adhesive electrodes (8x5 cm), two upper and two lower ones (forming a square) will be placed around the center of the shoulder. The electrodes will be positioned crosswise, following the parameters: 4KHz (carrier frequency), 1/1 second (swing pattern), 100 Hz Frequency modulation amplitude (AMF), 50 Hz (sweep frequency), automatic vector mode, With intensity at the motor threshold of sensation, with duration of 50 minutes.</description>

    <description>In addition to the exercise protocol performed in the exercise group, an ultrasound device will be used. The appliance will be used off, without any individual participant having knowledge. For this, the individual will be asked to position himself in the dorsal position on the stretcher, the therapist will perform the application of the transducer head, with gel on its surface, in the anterolateral region of the affected shoulder.</description>
