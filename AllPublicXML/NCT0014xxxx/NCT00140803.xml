  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether VISUDYNE therapy in combination with 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone
      will reduce the average loss from baseline of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as compared
      with Visudyne therapy without intravitreal triamcinolone at 12 months in subjects with occult
      subfoveal and minimally classic subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. The intravitreal
      triamcinolone will be given as either a 1 mg or 4 mg dose. This study will also evaluate the
      safety of Visudyne therapy in combination with intravitreal triamcinolone. An interim
      statistical readout will be performed when the first 60 patients have completed 6 months of
      follow-up evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-masked (VA examiners, angiographic graders), multi-center, Phase
      2 study with 3 arms comparing VISUDYNE therapy in combination with intravitreal injection of
      either a 1 mg or 4 mg of triamcinolone with VISUDYNE therapy without intravitreal
      triamcinolone in a 1:1:1 ratio.

      Re-treatment may be administered at 3 month intervals ( 14 days) if evidence of CNV leakage
      is detected by fluorescein angiography.

      At baseline and at 3 month (+ 14 days) intervals patients will undergo the following
      assessments: ophthalmic examination, best corrected visual acuity, fluorescein angiography,
      and color fundus photography. The eligibility criteria for inclusion into the study and
      re-treatment of patients will be based on fluorescein angiography. Patients receiving
      treatment at day-1, week-3, and week-6 following the treatment will have best corrected ETDRS
      visual acuity testing and ophthalmic. Those patients not being re-treated will have will have
      best corrected ETDRS visual acuity testing and ophthalmic examination at week-6 following the
      re-treatment evaluation visit.

      Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study.

      Expected time for recruitment is 6 months; all patients will be followed for the period of 12
      months in the study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Age 50 years or older

               -  Subfoveal CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration

               -  Area of the CNV at least 50% of the area of the total neovascular lesion

               -  The lesion is either minimally classic or occult with no classic

               -  If the lesion is occult with no classic then subjects must have presumed recent
                  disease progression in the study eye in the judgment of the Investigator and as
                  defined by presence of blood associated with the lesion or vision loss or lesion
                  growth reported or objectively recorded within the preceding 3 months before
                  randomization to treatment

               -  Baseline BCVA score between 73 and 19 letters on the ETDRS scale (approximately
                  20/40 to 20/400)

               -  Lesion size &lt; 5400 microns

               -  Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may not be randomized to treatment if they:

               1. Have evidence of predominantly classic CNV, clinically significant intraocular
                  inflammation, angioid streaks, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, axial
                  myopia greater than –6 diopters, or other precursors of choroidal
                  neovascularization

               2. Have additional eye disease that compromises the visual acuity of the study eye.

               3. Are receiving or require chronic concomitant therapy with systemic or topical
                  ocular corticosteroids or NSAIDS. Chronic concomitant therapy is defined as
                  multiple doses taken daily for 3 or more consecutive days at any time during the
                  course of the 12-month study). A low dose (up to 100 mg po qd) of aspirin (ASA)
                  taken for prophylaxis of MI and/or stroke is permitted during the study.

               4. Are using coumadin.

               5. Have known hypersensitivity to verteporfin or triamcinolone

               6. Have CNV that does not involve the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone,
                  as determined by color photography and fluorescein angiography

               7. Are unable to be photographed to document CNV, e.g. due to media opacity, allergy
                  to fluorescein dye or lack of venous access

               8. Have lens opacities which, in the investigator’s opinion, would progress during
                  the course of the study and would affect central vision in the study eye. Such
                  cataracts may be removed at least 2 months before entering the subject in the
                  study

               9. Have a history of treatment for CNV, other than confluent laser photocoagulation,
                  in the study eye (e.g., PDT, submacular surgery, radiotherapy or macular scatter
                  “grid” laser photocoagulation

              10. Are participating in another clinical trial requiring follow-up examinations or
                  are receiving or have received any experimental treatment for CNV or any other
                  investigational new drug within 12 weeks prior to the start of study treatment

              11. Have an intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg on or off medication on entry
                  to the study.

              12. Have received prior treatment with another anti-angiogenic compound (e.g.,
                  Sandostatin®, LY333531, Macugen, RhuFab, etc.) within 6 months prior to screening

              13. Are unwilling or unable to follow or comply with all study-related procedures.
