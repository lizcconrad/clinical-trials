  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of literature showing that stressful life events can increase the
      risk of developing exacerbations and new brain lesions among people with multiple sclerosis.
      The purpose of this study is to examine the hypothesis that stress management programs can
      reduce the occurrence of new brain lesions and exacerbations. We will also examine potential
      immune and neuroendocrine pathways.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS is a frequently disabling autoimmune disease affecting approximately 350,000 people in the
      United States. More than two decades of research has consistently shown a relationship
      between stressful life events (SLEs), in particular non-traumatic family and work stressors,
      and subsequent clinical exacerbation. Furthermore, we have shown that non-traumatic SLEs
      increase the risk of the subsequent appearance of new gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) brain lesions, an early marker of MS inflammation and blood-brain
      barrier (BBB) breakdown. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of cognitive
      behavioral stress management for MS (CBSM-MS) in reducing the occurrence of new brain lesions
      in people with relapsing forms of MS. Patients must have a documented new Gd+ MRI brain
      lesion or clinical exacerbation within the previous 12 months to be enrolled. One hundred and
      twelve patients will be enrolled for 12 months. Patients will be randomly assigned to either
      an intensive CBSM-MS program, consisting of 16 individual meetings with a behavioral medicine
      specialist, or a condensed CBSM-MS program, consisting of a one-day workshop offered after
      the 10th month of participation. Outcomes include MRI, clinical neurological end-points, and
      psychosocial functioning. We will also enhance our understanding of mechanisms by examining
      potential psychosocial, immune, and endocrine mediators of the relationship between SLEs and
      clinical and neuroimaging markers of MS inflammation.

    <description>Gd+ is Gadolinium-enhancing MRI brain lesion, A marker of the opening of the blood-brain barrier and is typically used as a primary endpoints in phase II trials because of its high sensitivity to ongoing MS disease activity and its association with clinical exacerbation. The single value was calculated by summing up the lesions from week 8 to week 24.</description>

    <description>Stress management therapy for multiple sclerosis (SMT-MS) is a manualized, validated, published stress management program designed for patients with MS. Participants met with a therapist for 16 individual 50-minute sessions conducted over 20-24 weeks. The first 6 sessions focused on teaching problem solving skills, relaxation, increasing positive activities, cognitive restructuring, and enhancement of social support. Participants were able to tailor the treatment to meet their needs using optional treatment modules including communication and assertiveness training, fatigue management, anxiety reduction, pain management, management of cognitive problems, insomnia treatment, and management of sexual dysfunction.</description>

        <description>Gd+ is Gadolinium-enhancing MRI brain lesion, A marker of the opening of the blood-brain barrier and is typically used as a primary endpoints in phase II trials because of its high sensitivity to ongoing MS disease activity and its association with clinical exacerbation.
