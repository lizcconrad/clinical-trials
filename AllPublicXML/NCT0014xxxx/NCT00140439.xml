  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about how ED-based programs can help to reduce pediatric ED visits for
      asthma. The current study evaluated a novel intervention in which the ED itself became the
      site of highly individualized, comprehensive follow-up asthma care. It sought to determine if
      such an intervention could decrease subsequent unscheduled visits for asthma while improving
      asthma quality of life.

      Prospective, randomized clinical trial of a single visit to a specialized emergency
      department-based asthma follow-up clinic occurring 2-15 days after emergency department care
      for an acute exacerbation. All patients were followed for 6 months. Analysis was by
      intention-to-treat with adjustment for baseline differences. Our primary hypothesis was that
      this intervention would decrease subsequent unscheduled visits (both to EDs and other sources
      of urgent care) for asthma over a six-month follow-up period. We further hypothesized that
      the intervention would decrease hospitalizations for asthma, improve compliance with an
      individualized medical plan and with trigger control, increase scheduled primary care
      practitioner (PCP) visits for routine asthma care, and decrease asthma symptoms while
      improving asthma quality of life (QOL).

    <description>The clinical activities of the intervention followed a fully specified protocol and provided education and care in three domains:
Asthma self-monitoring and management: Educators first reviewed the basic physiology of asthma with emphasis on its chronicity. After evaluating asthma severity and treatment history, the physician completed an individualized medical action plan (MAP) and provided any necessary device teaching.
Environmental modification and trigger control: After evaluation of potential environmental triggers in the home, each family was educated on their control. Each child was provided hypoallergenic bed encasings.
Linkages and referrals to ongoing primary care: Clinic staff stressed the importance of longitudinal asthma care by a PCP. A full report of the clinic visit was mailed to each child's PCP. In addition, the asthma educator scheduled a follow-up appointment with the PCP within 4 weeks</description>
