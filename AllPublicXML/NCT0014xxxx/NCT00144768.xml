  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the development of antibodies to laronidase
      in patients with MPS I receiving Aldurazyme® impairs the clearance of GAG substrate.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a documented diagnosis of MPS I confirmed by measurable signs and symptoms and
             deficient α-L-iduronidase activity (&lt;10% of the lower limit of normal).

          -  For a patients receiving Aldurazyme therapy prior to study entry: Have available as
             baseline data the results of urinary GAG levels and IgG antibody titers collected
             prior to the patient's first Aldurazyme infusion.

          -  Provide signed, written informed consent prior to any protocol-related procedures
             being performed. Consent of a legally authorized guardian(s) is (are) required for
             patients under 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have previously received Aldurazyme without the collection of baseline samples as
             specified.

          -  Have a suspected hypersensitivity to Aldurazyme or a know hypersensitivity to
             components of infusion solution.

          -  Have received a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, injection fibroblast therapy,
             or major organ transplant.

          -  Are receiving chronic immunosuppressant therapy.

          -  Have a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstances that may interfere with study compliance including all prescribed
             evaluations and follow-up activities.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating

          -  Have received investigational drug within 30 days prior to study enrollment
