  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the lipid-lowering effect and safety of colesevelam therapy
      administered to heterozygous familial pediatric patients 10 through 17 years of age who are
      on a stable dose of a pediatric-approved statin monotherapy (atorvastatin, lovastatin,
      simvastatin or pravastatin), or who are treatment naive to lipid-lowering therapy.

          <title>Tanner Stage</title>
          <description>Tanner Stage represents a scale measuring physical development in children based on primary and secondary sexual characteristics. The scale has five stages, with Stage I representing prepuberty and Stage 5 representing adult physical development. Please refer to Tanner, JM; Growth at Adolescence, @nd ed. Oxford, England, Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1962 for complete definitions of each Tanner Stage of development.</description>
