      A randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a 12-month telephone-supervised,
      home-based physical activity intervention, delivered via health educators versus supervised,
      trained peers, on physical activity patterns. Inactive men and women ages 50 years and older
      will be randomly assigned to one of these two programs or to an attention-control arm.

      BACKGROUND:

      Despite the recognized benefits of regular physical activity, older adults remain among the
      most inactive segments of the U.S. population. A number of studies have demonstrated the
      health impact and resultant reduction in chronic disease risk achieved by improving physical
      activity patterns. Effective telephone-based counseling approaches for promoting and
      sustaining regular physical activity among older adults have been developed and validated.
      Such mediated interventions provide a level of individual tailoring and ongoing support to
      long-term adherence, while allowing for ongoing program delivery that is more flexible,
      convenient, and potentially lower-cost than face-to face program delivery formats.
      Telephone-based delivery format also allows for potentially greater reach into segments of
      the older population that may find it difficult or unappealing to come to community settings
      on a regular basis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A 12-month randomized trial in which women and men ages 50 years and above living in the San
      Francisco Bay area who meet medical and physical activity criteria, following a baseline
      evaluation, be randomized to one of three study arms: telephone-supervised, home-based
      physical activity instruction via a trained health educator; telephone-supervised, home-based
      physical activity instruction via a supervised peer facilitator; or an attention-control arm
      consisting of health educator-based telephone delivery of non-physical activity oriented
      health information and support. All subjects will have a follow-up evaluation at 6 and 12
      months.
