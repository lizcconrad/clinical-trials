      The purpose of this study is to determine whether antiepileptic drug oxcarbazepine is
      effective in the treatment of chronic asthma.

      Effective therapy of asthma still remains quite serious problem. According GINA definition,
      asthma is an inflammatory disorder. Consequently, modern pharmacotherapy of asthma provides
      wide use of anti-inflammatory drugs. But asthma also is a paroxysmal disorder: many
      specialists and even some guidelines underline paroxysmal clinical picture of asthma. Besides
      this, according to some authors, neurogenic inflammation may play important role in asthma
      mechanism. But some other neurogenic inflammatory paroxysmal disorders exist, and they are
      migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. Some antiepileptic drugs, like carbamazepine and
      valproate, are very effective in therapy of migraine and trigeminal neuralgia - more than in
      80% of cases. If bronchial asthma also is paroxysmal inflammatory disease, like migraine and
      trigeminal neuralgia, it is possible that some antiepileptic drugs also are very effective in
      asthma therapy.

      We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month trial for evaluation of oxcarbazepine
      efficacy in therapy of bronchial asthma. Oxcarbazepine is antiepileptic drug of new
      generation, produced by Novartis, and it is more effective and safe derivative of well-known
      antiepileptic drug carbamazepine.

      Comparison: Patients received investigational drug in addition to their usual routine
      antiasthmatic treatment, compared to patients received placebo in addition to their usual
      routine antiasthmatic treatment.
