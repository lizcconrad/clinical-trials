  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to define the problem of results that return after patient discharge and to
      study the implementation of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-based system for tracking
      these results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transfer of care at hospital discharge is complex and requires the transmission of large
      amounts of data between inpatient physicians (hospitalists) and outpatient physicians (PCPs),
      including information about pending tests. Frequently, laboratory and radiology tests are not
      finalized until after a patient is discharged, and when the responsibility for these pending
      results is not clearly defined, they can be missed. Our project aims to define the problem of
      these post-discharge results and to study the implementation of an EMR-based system
      (Hospitalist Results Manager, HRM) for tracking these results on the hospitalist services at
      Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The project
      consists of two phases: a cross-sectional study before intervention to define the
      epidemiology of post-discharge results, and a randomized trial of HRM to determine its effect
      on physician awareness of these results.
