      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy between a single dose of oral
      misoprostol 100 microgram and vaginal misoprostol 50 microgram for induction of labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is widely carried out all over the world in cases where continuation of
      pregnancy is hazardous to both the mother and/or fetus. The induction in a ripe cervix is not
      difficult but complications are significantly increased when the cervix is unripe. The only
      agent approved for cervical ripening and induction of labor in patients with an unripe cervix
      is dinoprostone(PGE2). Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analogue marketed for the prevention
      and treatment of gastro-duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol costs much less than dinoprostone and
      does not require refrigeration and has few systemic side effects.In addition, it is rapidly
      absorbed orally and vaginally. Although misoprostol is not registered for such use, it has
      been widely used for obstetric indications such as induction of abortion and of labor.
      Misoprostol for induction of labor in preceding literatures mainly prescribed in multiple
      dosing regimen. The adverse effects on uterus potentially occur owing to the frequent
      administration of misoprostol. The objective of this study was to compare a single dose oral
      misoprostol with vaginal misoprostol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A live singleton pregnancy at a gestation of &gt;37 weeks, with obstetric or medical
             indications for induction, and unfavorable cervix (the initial Bishop score of &lt;717),
             vertex presentation, reactive fetal heart rate pattern, absence of labor, and intact
             membranes without previous stripping. Post-term inductions were considered when
             gestational age was &gt;41 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspected cephaloâ€“pelvic disproportion, estimated fetal weight of &gt;4000 grams,
             maternal age of &lt;18 years, parity of &gt;5, previous cesarean delivery or history of
             uterine incision, any contraindication for vaginal delivery or prostaglandins
             administration and suspected chorioamnionitis.
