  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-component email health
      promotion program on employee adoption of health promoting behaviors and secondarily on
      health status, work productivity and health care costs.

      The Specific Aims are:

        -  To demonstrate the feasibility and assess the acceptability of email health promotion
           among diverse employee groups;

        -  To evaluate short and intermediate-term changes in health behaviors (e.g., daily
           fruit/vegetable intake, weekly physical activity) at 6 and 12 months;

        -  To assess change in health status (SF-12), work productivity, and healthcare costs among
           email program users and controls;

        -  To identify person predictors of sustained voluntary participation in a 6 month email
           health promotion program among the workforce population;

        -  To disseminate the results to maximize influence on e-health promotion, employer health
           promotion programs, health insurance policy, and research.
