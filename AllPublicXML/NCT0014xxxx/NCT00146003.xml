  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a measurable improvement on a validated scale in
      a small population of adult patients with atopic dermatitis (eczema).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves administration of efalizumab (previously approved for psoriasis) to ten
      adult patients with atopic dermatitis. Biologic plausibility rests on similarities in
      pathophysiology of the two conditions. The drug (efalizumab) will be administered according
      to the dosing approved for plaque psoriasis for a period of 24 weeks. The subjects will
      self-administer efalizumab weekly and measurements will be performed on a monthly basis.
      Efalizumab is not being compared to placebo or other drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (18 years or older) with atopic dermatitis with 5% or more body surface area
             involvement

          -  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of &quot;moderate&quot; or worse

          -  In general good health with well-controlled medical problems

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study.

          -  If a female of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test and commitment to the
             use of two forms of effective contraception (birth control) for the duration of the
             study are necessary.

          -  If a non-sterile male, commitment to the use of two forms of effective contraception
             (birth control) for the duration of the study is necessary.

          -  Normal platelet count

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to efalizumab or any of its components

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

             moisturizer) within 1 week

          -  Medical condition which would make use of efalizumab unsafe; would limit compliance
             with study requirements; or would limit accurate assessment of efficacy.

          -  Ongoing, active, serious infection

          -  History of malignancy (except excised basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin)
