      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of preventive treatment with a selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (escitalopram) in the first year after acute coronary syndromes
      (ACS).

      Methods: 240 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ST-elevation myocardial infarction
      [STEMI]), non-STEMI or unstable angina) will be enrolled within 8 weeks after ACS and will be
      randomly assigned to treatment with escitalopram/placebo (5-20 mg) in 52 weeks. Primary
      outcome measures are the diagnosis of depression and HDS (Hamilton Depression Scale).
      Psychiatric measurements: SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), HDS,
      HAS (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect
      Rating Scale, ESSI (Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease [ENRICHD] Social Support
      Instrument), SF-36 (Short Form-36 Health Survey), SCL-92 (Symptom Check List) and BDI (BeckÂ´s
      Depression Inventory). Cardiological measurements are blood pressure, electrocardiography,
      echocardiography (left ventricular ejection fraction), heart rate variability and use of
      medicine.

      Discussion: ACS patients with mental illness are usually only diagnosed to a very small
      extent during admission in a cardiologic department. These patients mainly remain untreated
      with an increased risk of somatic comorbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is in accordance
      with ethical principles to conduct a double blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the
      interface between anxiety, depression and ACS. Even in this blinded study, where one of the
      groups are treated with placebo, there will be a higher degree of treatment of depressive
      symptoms due to the low recognition of this problem.

      Conclusion: The DECARD study is the first study evaluating the effect of prophylactic
      treatment of depression in patients with ACS. The study will show if prophylactic treatment
      will improve cardiac prognosis.
