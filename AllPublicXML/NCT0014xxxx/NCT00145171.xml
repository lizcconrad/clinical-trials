  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APO303 is a sub-study of patients enrolled in APO401 (the long-term open label safety
      protocol) and was designed to evaluate adverse events, particularly blood pressure drops when
      standing up during first dose in patients who have not been exposed to apomorphine before.

      The primary objective of this study was to determine the electrocardiographic and orthostatic
      effects of apomorphine during controlled in-patient dose introduction in apomorphine-naïve
      late stage Parkinson’s disease patients. Although safety observations represented the primary
      objective of the study, a control group was considered essential to properly interpret
      adverse events that occurred during dose titration. Additional data comparing the efficacy
      and safety of subcutaneous apomorphine, placebo and standard antiparkinson (anti-PD) therapy
      was derived from this experience.

      This was a two-phase study that involved a controlled in-office dose titration phase followed
      by a 6-month outpatient open-label treatment phase. During the in-patient dose titration
      phase, subjects were evaluated on separate days for the response to single doses of
      medication administered during an observed “Off” event (defined as first “Off” event that
      occurs at least one hour after administration of the normal morning dose of oral
      antiparkinson medication). Evaluation of the acute response to oral anti-PD medication
      (Baseline) and to apomorphine dose escalation between 2 and 10 mg (Titration Visits) was
      conducted under unblinded conditions. At the 0.4-mL titration level, placebo was randomly
      introduced under double-blind crossover conditions.

               1. Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum (Beta HCG)
                  pregnancy test within 14 days of the study start.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must have used an acceptable form of
                  contraception

          3. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, ie. not induced
             by drugs or caused by other diseases.

          4. Patients classified as stage II - V of the Hoehn and Yahr scale for staging the
             severity of Parkinson's disease (Appendix 16.1.12.3).

          5. Patients with refractory motor fluctuations of any frequency or duration. These
             included but are not necessarily limited to patients with the following symptoms:

               1. Immobility resulting from regular dose failures.

               2. Severe “Off” period discomfort.
