      The main purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of one dose of
      botulinum toxin type A (Dysport) associated with rehabilitation treatment on pain control in
      patients with a type of back pain called primary myofascial pain syndrome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with primary myofascial pain syndrome of cervical and dorsal localization,
             less than two years of length, who must have been diagnosed with the evidence of
             &quot;trigger points&quot; in which conventional treatment with oral analgesia, rehabilitation
             and local anesthesia has not been clinically successful for more than 15 days.

          -  Punctuation of 4cm or more in a 10cm visual analog scale.

          -  Previous positive response (self-limited reduction -less than 15 days- of pain) after
             an anaesthetic infiltration in the trigger point.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia or with a spread pain.

          -  Patients having received previously botulinum toxin.

          -  Patients having received anesthetic injections at the trigger points within the month
             before the visit.

          -  Patients having received corticosteroids injections at the trigger points within three
             months before the selection visit.
