  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings that range from high (manic) to low
      (depressed) states. Sometimes, symptoms of both depression and mania are present (mixed
      episodes). Asenapine is an investigational medication for the treatment of manic or mixed
      episodes of bipolar disorder. Patients who completed the 3 week trial (A7601004 or A7501005)
      continued on the same treatment that they received in the short term study: asenapine or
      olanzapine (a medication already approved for the treatment of bipolar mania) for 9
      additional weeks. The short term studies (A7501004 and A7501005) were not unblinded until the
      9 week extension study was unblinded. Patients treated with placebo in the 3 week short term
      study were crossed over and treated with Asenapine in the 9 week extension study. Patients
      who complete the 9 week extension study were eligible to continue in another extension
      (A7501007) study for an additional 40 weeks.
