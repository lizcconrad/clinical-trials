  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether personally controlled electronic health
      records can be used for health promotion in a workplace setting.

    <textblock>
      In response to the call for research of the new Health Protection Research Initiative at the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we propose to adapt newly mature
      informatics technology to shift the paradigm for health alerting and health promotion in the
      workplace. The goal is to firmly ground these activities on real time information collected
      from and delivered to employees, in an interactive, secure, electronic environment. We will
      study influenza prevention and control, an archetype of public health practice requiring
      surveillance, communication, and timely influence of health-related behaviors. Complex
      information gleaned from surveillance will be processed, translated and provided to
      employees. The goal is to provide employees with timely, individualized health promotion
      messages to improve their knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding influenza and to
      increase the rate of seasonal influenza immunization for them and their household members.
      The approach will be evaluated in a group randomized design at several worksites of a major
      corporation.
