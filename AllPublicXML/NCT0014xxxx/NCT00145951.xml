  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the feasibility of a combined primary
      care/web-based depression prevention intervention. Primary care physicians (PCP) currently
      lack an alternative behaviorally-based approach to antidepressant medications for individuals
      with depression symptoms or minor depression, but who have not yet developed Major
      Depression.

      The objective of this study is to compare the feasibility and efficacy of motivational
      interviewing (MI) versus brief advice in primary care to engage adolescents with a web-based
      depression prevention intervention.

      There is no population-based approach to prevent the onset of major depression in
      adolescence. Adolescents with current sub-threshold depression symptoms (not meeting criteria
      for major depression, 5 &lt; symptoms including depressed mood, irritability or loss of
      pleasure), a personal history of a depressive episode in the past or with a family history of
      depressive disorders are at increased risk. Because most adolescents have regular contact
      with primary care physicians, the primary care clinics could provide a setting to disseminate
      evidence-based preventive approaches. We have developed a combined primary care/Web-based
      preventive intervention to reduce the risk of developing depressive disorders in adolescents
      and young adults by adapting interventions of demonstrated benefit in study settings to a
      primary care/Web-based format in collaboration with leading investigators in the field. The
      goal of this research program is to evaluate the feasibility and possible efficacy of an
      alternative delivery mechanism for evidence-based behavioral approaches to depression
      treatment and prevention that have already demonstrated benefit with face-to-face delivery in
      study settings. Each component this intervention will need to be carefully evaluated for
      acceptability, safety, feasibility and efficacy. The focus of this study is the primary care
      component.

        -  Subjects are between the ages of 14-18 years and

          -  have one risk factor for developing depression in the next two years:

          -  sub-clinical depressed mood (not meeting criteria of major depression),

          -  a family history of depression in a parent or sibling, or

          -  past personal history of depression or personal perception of risk depression and
             desire to participate

        Inclusion criteria include:

          -  (1) age 14-18 years and

          -  (2) one risk factor for developing depression in the next two years: sub-clinical
             depressed mood (not meeting criteria of major depression),

          -  a family history of depression in a parent or sibling, or past personal history of
             depression or personal perception of risk depression and desire to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  criteria include meeting criteria or undergoing active treatment for major depression
             (5 or more symptoms nearly every day with functional impairment, minor depression),

          -  bipolar disorder,

          -  panic disorder,

          -  conduct disorder,

          -  substance abuse or having suicidal ideation.

          -  Active treatment for depression is defined as receiving anti-depressant medication or
             counseling within one year of remission of symptoms from the most recent episode.

          -  Those who meet DSM-IV criteria for minor depression (3-4 symptoms) or who report
             significant functional impairment (very difficult or above on the Prime MD functional
             impairment scale) will be notified and offered a referral for an evaluation by a
             mental health specialist (and will be strongly encouraged to attend).

          -  Those with 1-2 symptoms of depression will also be offered evaluation and treatment
             from a mental health specialist. In each case, the primary care physician will be
             notified and the parents (if under the age of 19).
