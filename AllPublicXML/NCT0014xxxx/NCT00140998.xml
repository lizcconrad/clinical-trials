  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study attempts to evaluate if the way of administering estrogen, the principal female
      hormone, via patches or orally, affects the way estrogen works in girls with Turner Syndrome.
      These are girls who are very short and whose ovaries do not work. We will examine changes
      bone, protein and fat metabolism under the influence of estrogen delivered by a patch trough
      the skin vs estrogen taken orally. These studies are conducted while the girls are taking GH
      therapy.

    <textblock>
      Girls with Turner Syndrome, between the ages of 10-16 years, were chosen as the study
      population. The study requires 3 overnight admissions to an in-patient Clinical Research
      Center(CRC). A baseline study is performed using stable isotope tracers of leucine, glycerol
      and glucose and serial blood sampling to measure protein and fat metabolism. Indirect
      calorimetry is used to measure substrate oxidation rates and total energy expenditure. DEXA
      scan is used to measure bone mineral density and body composition. Once the baseline study is
      complete subjects are randomly assigned to receive either estrogen orally or through a patch
      placed onto the skin in increasing doses changed every 2 weeks. After 6 weeks of estrogen
      treatment a second metabolic study, identical to the first, is performed, followed by a wash
      out period of 4 weeks. Subsequently, the subjects are switched to the alternate form of
      estrogen. At the end of 6 weeks a third and final metabolic study is repeated. All subjects
      continue to be on growth hormone throughout the study procedures.
