  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarpogrelate is an antiplatelet agent that decreases 5-hydroxytryptamine( 5-HT )levels in
      platelets via blockade of 5-HT2 receptors, has been used in atherosclerotic peripheral
      arterial disease.

      The present double-blind controlled clinical pharmacology study was performed on 45 patients
      with cerebral infarction, who were given 75, 150, or 300 mg three times daily of sarpogrelate
      for 7 days in order to evaluate the dose-response relationship in terms of the precisely
      measured inhibition of platelet aggregation.
