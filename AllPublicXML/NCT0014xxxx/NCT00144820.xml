  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      251 consecutive patients with knee arthrosis were randomized to one of three interventions:
      Four weekly injections of 2 ml isotonic saline (placebo), 2 ml sodium hyaluronate
      (hyaluronan) or 20 ml isotonic saline (excessive saline).

      They all suffered from clinically and radiologically verified arthrosis of the knee with
      daily pain that did not respond to treatment with analgetics.

      Results were evaluated at weeks 1,2,3,4,8,12,16 and 26. Biochemical markers for bone and
      cartilage degradation were measured in urine/blood.
