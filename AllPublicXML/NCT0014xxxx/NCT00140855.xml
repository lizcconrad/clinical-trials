      The purpose of this study is to determine whether immune therapy with anti-CTLA4 antibody is
      effective in people with advanced synovial sarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 750-900 people in the United States each year develop synovial sarcoma, a rare
      form of cancer of connective tissue. This tumor frequently metastasizes to other parts of the
      body such as the lungs. Chemotherapy can sometimes decrease the size of the recurrent tumors,
      but these results are usually only temporary, and the tumors grow again.

      We are trying to exploit some of the proteins made by synovial sarcoma (cancer-germ cell or
      cancer-testis antigens) as targets for the immune system. Specifically, we are investigating
      if immune-based therapy with anti-CTLA4 antibody once every 4 weeks for three treatments will
      activate the immune system enough to attack recurrent synovial sarcoma. In this study the
      tumor itself serves as the &quot;vaccine&quot; or source of protein, as we try to activate
      tumor-fighting T cells with the anti-CTLA4.

      Anti-CTLA4 takes the brakes off the immune system to allow otherwise hidden immune responses
      to become more active. In so doing, there could be other side effects, such as immune system
      attacks against the normal organs of the body. We will follow both the anti-tumor immune
      responses with frequent blood tests and follow and treat side effects people develop on this
      study to determine if anti-CTLA4 is worth pursuing in a larger number of patients with
      synovial sarcoma or other sarcomas.
