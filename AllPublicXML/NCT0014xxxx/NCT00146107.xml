    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of weight loss and exercise on physical
      function, body fat and muscle mass, bone strength, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity causes serious medical complications and impairs quality of life. Moreover, in
      elderly persons, obesity can lead to frailty by exacerbating the decline in strength,
      endurance, balance and mobility associated with aging and physical inactivity. The primary
      objectives of the proposed research are to evaluate the independent and combined effects of
      weight loss and exercise on physical function, body composition, bone and muscle metabolism,
      and quality of life in frail, obese elderly men and women. The central hypothesis is that in
      frail obese elderly subjects, weight loss will improve physical function and quality of life,
      while the addition of exercise will not only augment improvement in these outcomes, but also
      attenuate the adverse effects of weight loss on bone and muscle masses. To test this
      hypothesis, 110 elderly (65-85 years old) obese men and women (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 30
      kg/m2) with physical frailty will be randomized to 4 treatment groups: 1) control, 2) 10%
      weight loss, 3) exercise training, and 4) 10% weight loss plus exercise training.
