    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of priming vaccinations,
      and subsequent boosting vaccinations with GVAX® Vaccine for Prostate Cancer. Clinical
      observations and laboratory measurements will be monitored to evaluate safety and toxicity.
      Additionally, the antitumor effects of GVAX® Vaccine for Prostate Cancer on serum PSA levels,
      will be evaluated and antitumor responses will be quantitated.
