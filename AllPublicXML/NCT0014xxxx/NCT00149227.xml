      The KYOTO HEART Study is to assess the add-on effect of valsartan, an Angiotensin-Receptor
      Blocker, on top of the conventional treatment in high risk patients in Japan with
      hypertension in terms of the morbidity and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many reports show that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are
      superior for prevention of cardiovascular events, previous data are not enough for the
      patients who have more than one risk factor and for anti-atherosclerotic effects of ARB. In
      Japan, there were only a few large-scale trials for cardiovascular disease prevention, and it
      has not been clarified whether the evidence in Western countries could be unqualifiedly
      applied to Japanese patients as a long-range strategy. The KYOTO HEART Study is to assess the
      add-on effect of valsartan, an Angiotensin-Receptor Blocker, on top of the conventional
      treatment in high risk patients with hypertension in terms of the morbidity and mortality.

    <measure>New Onset or Recurrence of Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>five years</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke events included brain hemorrhage, infarction, and TIA. They required hospitalization with neurological symptoms and were diagnosed by CT and/or MRI. The first of any of these events to occur in a specific patient was classified as an event to be counted in the primary endpoint by the Endpoint Committee. We estimated the number of enrolled patients to validate the hypothesis under the assumption that the valsartan add-on group achieves a 20% risk reduction compared with the conventional treatment group and gives 80% statistical power for detecting a clinical signiﬁcance with a two-tailed 5% statistical signiﬁcant level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>New Onset or Recurrence of Transient Ischemic Attack</measure>
    <time_frame>five years</time_frame>
    <description>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) was defined as hospitalization with sudden onset of neurological deficit persisting for less than 24 hrs, and without abnormal findings using by CT and/or MRI. The first of any of these events to occur in a specific patient was classified as an event to be counted in the primary endpoint by the Endpoint Committee. We estimated the number of enrolled patients to validate the hypothesis under the assumption that the valsartan add-on group achieves a 20% risk reduction compared with the conventional treatment group and gives 80% statistical power for detecting a clinical signiﬁcance with a two-tailed 5% statistical signiﬁcant level.</description>

    <description>Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed with hospitalization, ECG- change, and biomarkers for myocardial infarction. The first of any of these events to occur in a specific patient was classified as an event to be counted in the primary endpoint by the Endpoint Committee. We estimated the number of enrolled patients to validate the hypothesis under the assumption that the valsartan add-on group achieves a 20% risk reduction compared with the conventional treatment group and gives 80% statistical power for detecting a clinical signiﬁcance with a two-tailed 5% statistical signiﬁcant level.</description>

    <description>Heart failure event was defined as requiring hospitalization and clinical symptoms together with left ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography according to the guidelines of the AHA/ACC. The first of any of these events to occur in a specific patient was classified as an event to be counted in the primary endpoint by the Endpoint Committee. We estimated the number of enrolled patients to validate the hypothesis under the assumption that the valsartan add-on group achieves a 20% risk reduction compared with the conventional treatment group and gives 80% statistical power for detecting a clinical signiﬁcance with a two-tailed 5% statistical signiﬁcant level.</description>

    <description>Angina pectoris event required hospitalization and was diagnosed by both ECG changes corresponding with chest symptoms and coronary angiography showing 75% stenosis according to AHA/ACC guidelines. The first of any of these events to occur in a specific patient was classified as an event to be counted in the primary endpoint by the Endpoint Committee. We estimated the number of enrolled patients to validate the hypothesis under the assumption that the valsartan add-on group achieves a 20% risk reduction compared with the conventional treatment group and gives 80% statistical power for detecting a clinical signiﬁcance with a two-tailed 5% statistical signiﬁcant level.</description>

        <title>New Onset of Acute Dissecting Aneurysm of the Aorta</title>
        <description>Dissecting aneurysm of the aorta required hospitalization and was diagnosed by imaging technique, CT and/or MRI. The first of any of these events to occur in a specific patient was classified as an event to be counted in the primary endpoint by the Endpoint Committee. We estimated the number of enrolled patients to validate the hypothesis under the assumption that the valsartan add-on group achieves a 20% risk reduction compared with the conventional treatment group and gives 80% statistical power for detecting a clinical signiﬁcance with a two-tailed 5% statistical signiﬁcant level.</description>
