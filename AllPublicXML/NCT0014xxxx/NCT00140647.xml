  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if ramipril and/or rosiglitazone retard the
      progression of atherosclerosis as evaluated by serial carotid intermedial thickness
      measurements.

      STARR is a multi-centre, international, randomized controlled clinical trial with a 2x2
      factorial design, that will evaluate the effects of ramipril and of rosiglitazone on
      atherosclerosis progression, as determined by B-mode carotid ultrasound (US). It is designed
      as a substudy of DREAM (Diabetes Reduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone
      Medications) Trial. The study is designed to enroll 1,200 study participants and follow is
      proposed for an average of 3.75 years.

      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH: With regards to ramipril this study will provide
      important mechanistic data regarding potential benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy on
      atherosclerosis and by inference in reducing CV risk in a lower risk younger population than
      studied in previous trials. In this population a clinical outcome trial focusing primarily on
      CV events would be difficult to conduct due to the expected fairly low event rate. If the
      study on atherosclerosis is positive, this may provide a rational for therapy in this subset
      of patients without overt CVD or diabetes, but with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired
      fasting glucose.
