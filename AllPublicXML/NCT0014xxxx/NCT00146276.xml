  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

        -  To analyse time to tumor progression in patients cystectomized for locally advanced
           transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, who are not suitable for
           cisplatin-based chemotherapy (i.e. postoperative reduced renal function, advanced age).
           Patients are randomized to receive either adjuvant gemcitabine immediately after radical
           operation (treatment arm A) or no treatment (control arm B). Patients in the control arm
           are to be treated with gemcitabine as soon as tumor progression becomes evident
           clinically and/or radiologically.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  Estimation of time-specific survival probabilities irrespective of causes of death.

        -  Assessment of toxicity and tolerability of gemcitabine

        -  Description of survival experience of patients in the control arm beyond the time of
           initiating chemotherapy.

        -  Assessment of quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of
           Cancer [EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire [QLQ]-C30).

      Study Design:

      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 two-arm study
      using gemcitabine as a single agent in chemonaive cystectomy patients with locally advanced
      TCC of the bladder in an adjuvant setting. The patients will receive the following treatment:

      Arm A (treatment): gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 2 weeks (days 1 and
      8) followed by 1-week rest period. Repeat cycle on day 22. Maximum of 6 cycles. Begin
      treatment until 3 months after radical operation (within first 6 weeks is recommended).

      Arm B (control): No immediate post-surgery treatment. Watchful waiting; treatment only
      conditionally in case of progression with gemcitabine (dose and schedule as in arm A).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Status after radical cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, stages
             pT3a, pT3b, pT4a and/or pN1, pN2 (but no more than 5 lymph nodes positive for tumor)
             [International Union Against Cancer (UICC) criteria, 1997]. Transitional cell
             carcinoma may be with or without squamous cell carcinoma and/or adenocarcinoma
