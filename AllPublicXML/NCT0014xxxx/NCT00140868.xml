      The purpose of this study is to assess quality of life and bowel symptoms after treatment.The
      main objective is to compare the effect on quality of life of minimally invasive bowel
      surgery and endoscopic stent placement in the treatment of malignant large bowel obstruction.

      Large bowel obstruction is a common presentation among cancer patients, including those with
      non-colorectal malignancies. This study will evaluate patients with malignant large bowel
      obstruction who undergo palliative treatment with minimally invasive surgical diversion or
      endoscopic colorectal stent placement, in terms quality of life, symptom relief from bowel
      obstruction, and treatment-related complications. Assessments in changes in quality of life
      and symptom relief over time for each group will be done.

      Traditionally malignant bowel obstruction is treated with surgery. In the last decade,
      creation of an ostomy can be completed with minimally invasive surgery, which reduces
      morbidity, mortality, and recovery time.wishes.

      In the last several years, endoscopically inserted colorectal stents have emerged as an
      option for palliative treatment. This involves a simple procedure, often completed on an
      outpatient basis. This allows the intestinal lumen to remain open without the need for
      surgery.

        -  Primary Objective: is to compare the effect on quality of life of minimally invasive
           surgical bowel diversion and endoscopic stent placement in the treatment of malignant
           large bowel obstruction.

        -  Secondary Objectives: are to evaluate the symptom response (including abdominal pain,
           distention, bowel frequency and consistency, and nausea and emesis) and complication
           rate of treatment of malignant large bowel obstruction with endoscopic stent placement
           or minimally invasive surgical bowel diversion.
