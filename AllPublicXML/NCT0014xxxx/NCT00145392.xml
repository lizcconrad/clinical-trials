  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will clarify the degree of insulin resistance and characterise muscle
      glucose metabolism and gene expression in a group of overweight healthy women. The study will
      clarify how overweight influences body glucose metabolism and thereby in the long-run
      increases the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the study may clarify why some
      overweight women develop hormone disorders and diabetes while others remain healthy.

      The study is essential as many patients suffer from diseases aggravated by overweight. In
      addition, a genetic disposition for diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome may give rise to
      the disease if the patient gains weight. It is therefore important that weight-matched
      control subjects are included in projects with overweight patients.

      This clinical trial includes 10 overweight women with regular hormones and normal level of
      male sex hormone. The patients included must be healthy, take no medications influencing the
      study results. The subjects must take no contraceptive pills or receive any other hormone
      treatment.

      In connection with the investigation, the following will be carried out on all patients:
      clinical examination, blood tests, hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, muscle biopsies, bone
      scan.

      The purpose of the study is to gain more knowledge of how overweight influences women's risk
      of developing hormone diseases and diabetes.
