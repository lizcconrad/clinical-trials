  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the efficacy of two low-cost low intervention
      packages to prevent and treat severe anemia in pregnant women in Zanzibar, Tanzania. The two
      packages are Standard of Care as described by the WHO (presumptive treatment for malaria and
      helminths plus daily iron + folic acid supplements) and Enhanced Care (Standard of Care plus
      daily multivitamins and a 2nd dose of anthelminthic.)

      This is a clinic-randomized trial involving 8 antenatal clinics and approximately 2500 women.
      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of the current internationally recommended standard of care,
      as described by the WHO, for the prevention of severe anemia among pregnant Zanzibari women.
      This aim will be achieved through a pre-post intervention comparison.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced treatment regimen in comparison to the current
      standard of care to prevent severe anemia among pregnant Zanzibari women.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy of the current internationally recommended standard of care,
      as described by the WHO, for the cure of severe anemia among pregnant Zanzibari women.

      Aim 4: To evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced treatment regimen in comparison to the current
      standard of care to cure severe anemia among pregnant Zanzibari women.
