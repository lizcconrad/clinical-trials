  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We intend to conduct a phase III b trial to verify Oxcarbazepine's effect in agitation and
      aggression in patients with dementia. We designed the study as a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled multi center trial. Hundred patients will be included. The treatment
      period will be eight weeks, with a further follow up of four weeks.

      The primary outcome measure will be the reduction in aggression and agitation as measured by
      means of NPI-NH-subscale agitation / aggression (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home
      Version). Secondary outcomes are reduction in aggression as measured by BARS (Behavior
      Agitation Rating Scale)and reduction in the burden to health-care personnel as measured by
      NPI-NH.

      Inclusion criteria: Patients of either gender, 55 years of age or older, living in a nursing
      home diagnosed with or a strong suspicion of dementia of Alzheimer’s type or vascular origin,
      and BPSD in form of agitation / aggression as measured by subscale of NPI-NH and BARS.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients that have any other kind of dementia as FTD, PD or LBD; patients
      with hepatic or renal failure, or diseases that make it impossible to follow the study
      schedule; patients on antiepileptics or antipsychotics.
