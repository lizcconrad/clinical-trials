    <textblock>
      PD-0332991 may work in cancer by stopping cancer cells from multiplying. PD-0332991 is in a
      new class of drugs called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK inhibitors). This research study is
      the first time that PD-0332991 will be given to people. PD-0332991 is taken by mouth daily.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>DLT: an adverse event occurring after initiation of PD 0332991 that met any following criteria: 1) Grade 4 hematologic toxicity (platelets less than [&lt;] 25000 per microliter (mcL), absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500/mcL, hemoglobin [Hb] &lt;6.5 gram per deciliter [g/dL]; 2) ANC &lt;1000/mcL associated with documented infection or fever greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 38.5 degrees Celsius; 3) &gt;=Grade 3 non-hematologic treatment-related toxicity. In an asymptomatic participant, Grade 3 corrected QT (QTc) prolongation (&gt;500 millisecond) (only if persisted with repeat testing and after correction of reversible causes [electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia]); and 4) Inability to receive next dose of PD 0332991 within 1 week (+/-1 day) of last dose due to lack of hematologic recovery (platelets &lt;50000/mcL, ANC &lt;1000/mcL, and Hb &lt;8.0 g/dL) or due to prolonged non-hematologic toxicities of &gt;=Grade 3 severity. Occurrence of a DLT necessitated immediate interruption of scheduled study treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Administered Dose (MAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Three new evaluable participants were to be assessed at each new dose level. The minimum time that these participants were to be followed after starting treatment was 1 cycle (28 or 21 days) before a new dose level could be opened. If none of these 3 participants experienced a DLT, the next higher dose level was to be opened on that schedule. If 1 participant developed a DLT, 3 more evaluable participants were to be enrolled at that dose level; if none of these additional 3 participants developed a DLT, the next higher dose level was to be opened on that schedule. If &gt;=2 participants experienced a first cycle DLT at the same dose level and schedule, that dose level was to be defined as the MAD for that schedule. No additional participants were to be entered at the MAD for that dosing schedule. DLT is defined in Outcome Measure 1.</description>

Occurrence of a DLT necessitated immediate interruption of scheduled study treatment.</description>

        <description>Three new evaluable participants were to be assessed at each new dose level. The minimum time that these participants were to be followed after starting treatment was 1 cycle (28 or 21 days) before a new dose level could be opened. If none of these 3 participants experienced a DLT, the next higher dose level was to be opened on that schedule. If 1 participant developed a DLT, 3 more evaluable participants were to be enrolled at that dose level; if none of these additional 3 participants developed a DLT, the next higher dose level was to be opened on that schedule. If &gt;=2 participants experienced a first cycle DLT at the same dose level and schedule, that dose level was to be defined as the MAD for that schedule.

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Categorized by Severity</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. For clinical description of nature (severity) of AEs, AEs were grades as: Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening or disabling AE; and Grade 5: death related to AE. AEs during Cycle 1 and AEs post Cycle 1 are reported separately.</description>

        <description>To determine the impact of food (specifically a high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In this crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. The first 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, the next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results are reported as per fed and fasted conditions. The high-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of the total caloric content.</description>

        <description>To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results are reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

        <description>To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results were to be reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

        <description>Area under the plasma concentration time-curve from zero to the last measured concentration (AUClast). To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results are reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results were to be reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

          <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results were to be reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

        <title>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) on Day 1: Food Effect</title>
        <description>Volume of distribution: theoretical volume in which total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce desired plasma concentration. To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results were to be reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

        <description>Terminal phase rate constant: absolute value of slope of a linear regression during terminal phase of natural-logarithm transformed concentration-time profile. To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results were to be reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

        <title>Percent Dose Recovered Unchanged (Percent Ae) in Urine: Food Effect</title>
        <description>The percent Ae is defined in Outcome Measure 44. To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results were to be reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Best Response</title>
        <description>Number of participants with best response. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Partial Response (PR): &gt;=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of lesions taking as reference baseline sum LD and no unequivocal progression in non-target lesions. Progressive disease (PD): &gt;=20% increase in sum of LD of lesions taking as a reference smallest sum of the LD since treatment start, or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesion or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD): neither shrinkage for PR nor increase for PD taking as reference smallest sum of LD since treatment start. SD was assessed following the first 2 cycles of treatment (&gt;=2 cycles), 4 cycles of treatment (&gt;=4 cycles), and 10 cycles of treatment (&gt;=10 cycles). Participants may be reported in more than 1 category of SD. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>

          <description>Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein by Cdk4/6 is typically required for human cancer cell proliferation. Tumor biopsies were to be performed, to demonstrate inhibition of Cdk4/6 based on reduction in phosphorylated Rb (p-Rb) in tumor tissue, in correlation with tumor response.</description>
          <population>Data was reported in individual participant listings and not summarized due to change in planned analysis, where baseline and post-baseline tumor biopsies for biomarkers were no longer required and were not obtained for all participants.</population>
