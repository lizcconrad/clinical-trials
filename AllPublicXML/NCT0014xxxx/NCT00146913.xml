  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty % of CML patients treated by Imatinib mesylate achieved a major cytogenetic responses
      (CCR) at 18 months. So, 40% of the patients must receive additional treatment. In vitro, it
      has been shown that IM and Interféron-alpha have synergic anti-proliferative effect on
      chromosome Ph+ cell lines. By using Peg-Interféron and IM combination, we hope to increase
      the cytogenetic response of patients.
