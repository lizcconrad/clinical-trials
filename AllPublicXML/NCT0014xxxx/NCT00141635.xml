      Implementation and Evaluation of Implementation of Quality of Life Diagnostics and Therapy in
      Individual Patients with Breast Cancer. A prospective study including 170 patients, 5 clinics
      and 38 general practitioners as coordinating doctors for quality of life therapies.
      Correlational study including several comparisons such as patients and their doctors.

      Improving cancer patients' quality of life (QL) requires that QL-diagnostics, the
      availability of QL-enhancing treatment options and treatment decisions are being integrated
      into a clinical path. This description presents the development and implementation of such a
      clinical path in the Tumorcenter Regensburg.

      The acting persons and institutions in this clinical path are the breast cancer patients, the
      hospitals, the family doctors or gynaecologists, and a QL-study team. Starting point is the
      QL-assessment either in the hospital or in doctors' practice (EORTC QLQ-C30 plus BR-23). The
      caring physician documents the patients' health status. Based on these two pieces of
      information, the QL-study team writes up a medical/QL-opinion plus therapy recommendation.
      This report is sent to the caring physician. The effectiveness of the therapy recommendation
      is assessed in the following QL-assessment. This clinical path is implemented via three
      interrelated methods of implementation: local opinion leaders, outreach visits, and quality
      circle.

      A total of 38 physicians were made familiar with QL-diagnostics through outreach visits, and
      12 opinion leaders were identified and convinced to support this project. The quality circle
      provided regular CME meetings on QL-enhancing therapy options (pain control, psychotherapy,
      physiotherapy, nutrition, social rehabilitation). A total of 170 QL-reports were sent to
      physicians. All 38 doctors found the QL-profiles comprehensible and the therapy
      recommendations clinically relevant. The most common QL-problems were emotional functioning,
      fatigue, and arm/shoulder problems.

      QL-diagnostics is a new way to individualise and to rationalise patient care. It transforms
      the QL-concept into a decision-relevant, integral part of a clinical path that aims to
      provide high quality patient care.
