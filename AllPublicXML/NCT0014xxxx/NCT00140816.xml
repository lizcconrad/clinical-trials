  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foods containing more dairy fat (and thus a higher proportion of short and medium chain fatty
      acids and possibly some other nutrients or micronutrients with effect on energy intake,
      satiety or energy metabolism) affect energy balance and metabolic profile in subjects prone
      to develop abdominal adiposity and metabolic syndrome.

      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that intake of dairy products has a favorable
      effect on markers of the metabolic syndrome.

      To explore such a hypothesis the participants have to be in a free living situation during an
      extended study period.
