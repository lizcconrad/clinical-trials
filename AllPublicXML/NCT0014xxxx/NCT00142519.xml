  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase II study testing the effectiveness of the combination of morphine
      and methadone versus morphine alone in relieving pain. A second goal is to further evaluate
      any side effects of the combination of morphine and methadone.

      Rationale: Experimental data demonstrates a profound analgesic synergy between morphine and
      methadone when co-administered systemically in mice. If this type of synergy can be
      demonstrated in clinical pain, it will be a relatively unique example of translating concepts
      of fundamental aspects of opioid actions seen in the laboratory to the clinical area, and
      provide a basis for offering new and scientifically- based analgesic regimens. This may
      provide better pain relief with less opioid related side effects in clinical practice.

      Purpose:

      This is a randomized, double blind, parallel arm Phase II study comparing a single dose of
      1:1 combination of methadone and morphine with morphine alone in patients with post-operative
      pain.

        -  The primary objective of this randomized, double blind, parallel arm Phase II study is
           to compare the analgesic effects of a combination of morphine and methadone with
           morphine alone to determine synergistic activity of mu opioid analgesics in patients
           with post-operative pain.

        -  A second goal is to further evaluate any side effects of the combination of morphine and
           methadone.
