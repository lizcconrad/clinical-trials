    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of bevacizumab when given in combination with
      gemcitabine and oxaliplatin and to see what effects (good or bad) it has on patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      -  Treatment is given in cycles, each cycle (except for cycle 1) is 4 weeks long. Cycle 1
           is only 2 weeks long.

        -  During cycle one only, bevacizumab will be given intravenously on day one. Two weeks
           after receiving bevacizumab, the patient will return to the clinic for treatment with
           all 3 study drugs.

        -  During cycle 2 and every cycle thereafter patients will receive; bevacizumab
           intravenously on day one and day 15; gemcitabine intravenously on day 2 and day 16;
           oxaliplatin intravenously on day 2 and day 16.

        -  The following evaluations will be conducted on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle (once
           every 2 weeks): physical examination, vital signs, medical history, blood tests and
           urine tests.

        -  Tumor measurements done by CT and/or MRI will be repeated at the end of cycle 3 and
           every 2 cycles thereafter.

        -  Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) of the liver and
           Perfusions CT scans will also be done on days 10-12 following bevacizumab treatment
           during cycle 1, and the Perfusion CT will be repeated at the end of cycle 3.

        -  Once study treatment is stopped the following evaluations will be performed: physical
           exam, vital signs, blood work, urine tests, CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis, and
           tumor measurements by CT or MRI scans.

        -  Follow-up will consist of physical examinations and blood tests every 6 months.

        -  Patients will continue to receive study treatment as long as there is no disease
           progression or unacceptable side affects.

    <description>For cycle 1 (14 days), bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was administered alone on day 1. For cycle 2 and beyond (28 days/cycle), bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was administered on days 1 and 15, gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 was administered as a dose rate infusion at 10 mg/m2/min followed by oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m2 on days 2 and 16. All drugs were administered intravenously until progression, intolerance, patient withdrawal, or death.</description>
