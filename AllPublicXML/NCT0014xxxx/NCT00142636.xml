  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have been shown to have high coronary calcium
      scores (CAC), but the temporal association between Glomerular Filtration Rate, CVD risk
      factors and CAC has not been described. This is a single-center, longitudinal, observational
      study. Subjects included adults aged 18 years to 65 years old without preexisting coronary
      artery disease (CAD). The CKD subjects (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min) and the control subjects (GFR
      &gt;/=60ml/min) were recruited. Laboratory measurements and MDCT scan were performed at baseline
      and after 12 months. Baseline CAC and average intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level were
      significantly greater in the CKD group. Baseline CAC scores of the CKD group were twice the
      value of the control group; however, CAC scores over one year were unchanged from baseline.

      Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have been shown to have high coronary calcium
      scores (CAC), but the temporal association between Glomerular Filtration Rate, CVD risk
      factors and CAC has not been described. This is a single-center, longitudinal, observational
      study. Subjects included adults aged 18 years to 65 years old without preexisting coronary
      artery disease (CAD). The CKD subjects (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min) were recruited from the Nephrology
      Clinic, and the control subjects (GFR &gt;/=60ml/min) were recruited from the Internal Medicine
      Clinic. Laboratory measurements and MDCT scan were performed at baseline and after 12 months.
      Baseline CAC and average intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level were significantly greater
      in the CKD group. Baseline CAC scores of the CKD group were twice the value of the control
      group; however, CAC scores over one year were unchanged from baseline. These observations
      suggest that CAC begins in earlier stages of CKD. Moreover, novel CVD risk factors including
      iPTH may accelerate CAD progression in CKD.
