  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the impact of two educational strategies (an education program versus a
      pamphlet) on participants preferences for insulin and their perceptions about insulin and
      injections after attending an educational session with a diabetes educator about insulin.

      Main research question: Among adults with type 2 diabetes who are potential candidates for
      insulin therapy, does an education strategy that involves a personal letter from the family
      physician, a presentation about insulin, and information about giving an injection, versus a
      pamphlet education strategy, effect: preference to accept insulin therapy; perceptions about
      insulin therapy; or perception about the injection?

    <textblock>
      Many people with type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy are often reluctant to start using
      insulin to manage their diabetes. This may be because they are worried about giving an
      injection and do not know enough about insulin to make an informed choice. This research is
      important because it will help researchers and health care providers better understand the
      feelings and educational support that patients need when they are thinking about starting
      insulin. This can help health care providers to better tailor the care they give to patients.
