    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel group trial in healthy male
      and fem ale subjects in regular employment. The duration of dosing will be 28 '(+/- 1)' days
      and assessments w ill be made on two visits (visits 2 and 3) with a training on the CDR
      system at the screening visit.

      The subjects will receive one bottle with 35 tablets [of either Ginseng G115 40 mg,
      multivitamin, mu ltimineral '+' Paullinia cupana extract PC102 75 mg (Guarana) or placebo]
      from the pharmacy at the in vestigational site. The subjects should take the study drug from
      day 0 to day 28 '(+/- 1)' Subjects will be assigned to one of the two treatment groups
      randomly. The allocation ratio is 2:1..

      Study Hypothesis:

      H0: No difference exists between the treatment and the placebo groups in terms o f
      baseline-adjusted change in Power of Attention after 28 days and averaged over 4 and 6 hour
      time point. H1: A difference exists between the treatment and the placebo groups in terms of
      baseline-adjusted change in Power of Attention after 28 days and averaged over 4 and 6 hour
      time point. The null and alternative hypotheses for the secondary endpoints are set up accor
      dingly. The statistical testing will be carried out at the 0.05 level of signifi cance. The
      test will be performed two-tailed.

      Comparison(s):

      The comparator is a matching placebo film-coated tablet without active ingredien ts.
