  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACE inhibitors are thought to modify the endothelium in a number of ways. Quinapril is an
      effective and well-tolerated ACE-I for the treatment of patients with hypertension and
      congestive heart failure. Quinapril produces favourable haemodynamic changes and improves
      ventricular and endothelial function in patients with various cardiovascular disorders. These
      effects are mediated through the binding of quinaprilat to both tissue and plasma-ACE.

      Quinapril 10 to 40 mg once daily improved endothelial function (as measured by improved FMD
      or reduced vasoconstrictive/increased vasodilative response to Ach) in patients with CAD and
      hypertension over 2 to 6 months of therapy; improved endothelial function was also observed
      in patients with CHF receiving a single infusion of quinaprilat. In general, quinapril showed
      neutral or beneficial effects on lipid profiles, glycaemia and renal haemodynamics. (3) There
      are no data available considering effects of quinapril on endothelial dysfunction in post-
      menopausal woman with mild to moderate hypertension and with pathological endothelial
      function.
