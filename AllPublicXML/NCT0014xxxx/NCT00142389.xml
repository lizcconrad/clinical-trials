  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized evaluation of pneumococcal vaccine immunization of pregnant
      mothers, followed by pneumococcal conjugate immunization of their children is designed to
      assess the effects of these strategies on the immunogenicity and safety of both vaccines. We
      hypothesize that maternal followed by infant immunization will be safe and will provide
      higher levels of antibody from birth through 12 months of age.

      This is a randomized vaccine evaluation in 4 groups of mothers and their infants, to assess
      the effect of maternal immunization on the infants' response to pneumococcal vaccine.
