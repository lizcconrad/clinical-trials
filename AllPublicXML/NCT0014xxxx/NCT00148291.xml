  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vinorelbine is currently the standard treatment for elderly patients with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Docetaxel has also shown promising results against elderly patients
      in phase II studies. We conducted a randomized phase III trial to evaluate whether docetaxel
      provided better overall survival than vinorelbine in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-naïve patients with histologically or cytologically
        diagnosis of stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and who were ≧ 70 years old with measurable or
        assessable disease were eligible for this trial. They had to have a life expectancy of at
        least 3 months. Additional entry criteria were as follows: (a) a performance status (PS) 0
        to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale; (b) adequate function of bone marrow
        (leukocyte count ≧ 4,000/μL, absolute neutrophil count ≧ 2,000/μL, hemoglobin concentration
        ≧ 9.5 g/dL, platelet count ≧ 100,000/μL), kidney (serum creatinine ≦ 1.2 mg/dL), liver
        (total bilirubin ≦ 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal, transaminase of AST
        and ALT ≦ 2.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis or apparent dementia were ineligible. Patients
        with active concomitant malignancy, massive pleural effusion or ascites, active infection,
        severe heart disease, grade 2 or higher ECG abnormality, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
        ileus, pulmonary fibrosis, diarrhea, and a bleeding tendency were excluded.-
