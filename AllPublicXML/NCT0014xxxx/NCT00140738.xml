      Patients will receive a maximum of 18 injections of dHER2 vaccine in a treatment schedule
      that will last for up to about a year, and thereafter there will be a follow-up period of
      about one more year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II study will be conducted according to a multicenter, open-label design. At
      least 20 patients will receive the vaccine as first-line and at least 20 as second-line
      treatment. The treatment will comprise a maximum of 18 injections of dHER2 vaccine. Follow-up
      phase: This will commence with the end-of-treatment examination, followed by examinations
      three months, six months and twelve months after the last study vaccination. The Protocol
      Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
