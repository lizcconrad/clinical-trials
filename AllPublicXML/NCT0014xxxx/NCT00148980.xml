  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal bone marrow function depends on the coexistence of normal hematopoietic stem cells and
      a microenvironment mostly located in the medullary part of the bones. Stem cells cannot
      function properly in the absence of an adequate microenvironment. Whereas in malignant and
      non-malignant hematologic diseases caused by a deficiency or abnormal stem cells, stem cell
      transplantation is the treatment of choice that results in a cure, in diseases such as MDS,
      myelofibrosis, and other conditions associated with an abnormal microenvironment,
      pancytopenia may occur despite the presence of apparently normal hematopoietic cells with no
      recognizable cytogenetic abnormality.

      We, the investigators at Hadassah Medical Organization, proved in experimental studies that
      the entire osteohematopoietic complex consisting of trabecular bone, hematopoietic
      microenvironment (of stromal origin) and hematopoietic tissue has been successfully
      transferred directly into ablated bone marrow cavity in a one-step transplantation procedure.

      The goal of this study is to enhance hematopoiesis in patients with myelofibrosis syndrome by
      intraosseous inoculation of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) together with allogeneic bone
      marrow cells (BMC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with impaired marrow stem cells by cytogenetic analysis or morphology
             (blasts), considered normal candidates for allogeneic BMT. Such patients will also be
             entitled to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with intraosseous DBM.

          -  Patients with documented myelofibrosis will be entitled to allogeneic bone marrow
             transplantation with intraosseous DBM.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with anticipated life expectancy of &lt; 4 weeks.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Patients with an unrelated disease or relevant clinical problem that may not permit
             evaluation of the results of the study.

          -  Patients under 18 years old.
