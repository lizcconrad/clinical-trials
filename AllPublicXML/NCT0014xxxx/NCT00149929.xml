      Aim of study is to collect long term safety and tolerability data on enteric-coated
      mycophenolate sodium with regard to adverse events, serious adverse events, and patient and
      graft survival. After successful completion of study CERL080A301 study, patients who
      previously were on enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium or MMF were given opportunity to
      remain on enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium or convert from MMF to enteric-coated
      mycophenolate sodium.
