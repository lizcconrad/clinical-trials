      This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2a plus
      ribavirin in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1b infection, compared with
      peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy.

      Additionally, the study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of peginterferon
      alfa-2a plus ribavirin in patients with CHC who had failed to respond to previous
      conventional-interferon based therapy.

      Treatment-naïve patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 48 weeks of double-blind
      treatment with subcutaneous, once-weekly injections of 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD)
      plus either twice-daily oral ribavirin (600 to 1000mg/day) or placebo.

      All patients who had received previous treatment with conventional interferon but had failed
      to respond (no suppression of HCV-RNA below detection limits of a sensitive assay) or had
      relapsed (reversion to HCV-RNA positive state after suppression) received the combination of
      peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) plus ribavirin for 48 weeks at the dosages stated above.
