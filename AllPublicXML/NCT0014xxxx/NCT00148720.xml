  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) taking capecitabine for
      12 weeks before surgery will have on women with breast cancer.

      -  Prior to the start of treatment, patients will have a small metal clip inserted into the
           tumor bed to identify the tumor site to the surgeon. At that time, a needle biopsy of
           the breast tumor or a sentinel (underarm) lymph node biopsy will also be performed.

        -  Patients will take capecitabine orally twice daily for 14 days. This treatment will
           repeat every 21 days (1 cycle). Patients will receive 4 cycles of this treatment.

        -  A physical exam and blood work will be done every three weeks after starting therapy to
           monitor side effects.

        -  After two weeks of capecitabine a biopsy from the tumor will be done to generate
           information about the characteristics of the tumor that may respond to capecitabine.

        -  After completing 4 cycles (12 weeks) of capecitabine, patients will then undergo surgery
           to remove any remaining breast cancer (lumpectomy or mastectomy). Post-surgical
           treatment (radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy) is at the discretion of the
           patients physician.
