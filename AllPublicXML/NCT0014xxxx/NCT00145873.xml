  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of longer term
      intravenous (IV) infusion of the study drug, nesiritide in patients with acutely
      decompensated chronic heart failure. Nesiritide (Natrecor) is a man-made version of a human
      hormone that dilates veins and arteries. Nesiritide (Natrecor) is currently FDA-approved for
      short-term inpatient IV treatment of acutely decompensated chronic heart failure.

      Hypothesis: Nesiritide, administered by continuous intravenous infusion in the outpatient
      setting, is a safe treatment for refractory Class III &amp; IV chronic heart failure due to
      systolic or diastolic dysfunction, regardless of renal function when administered over a
      12-week period.

      Corollary #1: Nesiritide, when infused continuously over 12 weeks will improve the overall
      condition of patients with chronic heart failure. These mechanisms include reducing
      hospitalizations when compared with the previous six months, improving symptoms as measured
      by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure short questionnaire, and improving functional
      capacity as measured by 6-minute walk testing.

      Corollary #2: Nesiritide infusion will be associated with a statistically significant
      decrease in N-terminal pro-BNP levels and cyclic GMP levels compared with patients receiving
      placebo infusions.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled pilot study to
      evaluate the effects of nesiritide in patients with chronic heart failure. This study will
      only take place at the University of Chicago Hospitals. It is double-blinded, which means
      that the neither subject nor their study doctor will know which study drug the subject will
      receive. However, in an emergency, this information can be obtained quickly. The study is
      placebo-controlled, which means subjects will not receive study drug at some point during the
      study; however because it is a cross-over study, subjects will be receiving nesiritide at
      some point in the study. Subjects will receive the study drug nesiritide for six out of the
      12 weeks of the studyâ€”either the first six weeks or the last six weeks.

      The procedures for the study consist of: informed consent, questions about the subjects heart
      failure, blood sample, assessment of heart failure severity based on symptoms, six minute
      walk test and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, history of heart failure
      symptoms and emergency room visits, diuretic and baseline medication history, long term IV
      for medication infusions, adjustment of study drug and regularly taken medications, 6 weeks
      of receiving long term IV infusion of drug, blood taken for lab tests at each clinic visit
      and an informational card provided for subjects to use for on-call physicians.

      Up to ten consecutive patients who decline participation in the study will be asked to
      participate in a registry to follow their course over the study interval. Baseline data,
      obtained from medical records will be recorded as will the number of hospitalizations/ER
      visits and NYHA class during the study period. These subjects will be surveyed by telephone
      monthly for the duration of the study.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Candidates for enrollment in this clinical trial are limited to adult patients (age&gt;21)
        diagnosed with chronic heart failure &gt; one year who are managed by heart failure
        specialists at the University of Chicago. Patients primarily managed by physicians other
        than the investigators will be enrolled with the concurrence of the treating physician.
        Study patients are characterized as &quot;high risk&quot; by fulfilling one or more of the following
        criteria:

          1. Refractory class III or IV heart failure despite optimal medical therapy by a heart
             failure specialist: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin
             receptor blockers (ARB), beta-adrenergic blockers (BB), spironolactone (spiro),
             digoxin (dig), diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (CCB).

          2. Frequent hospitalizations or ER visits (&gt;1/month on average).

        Additionally, patients must be capable of giving informed consent and have adequate social
        supports to manage chronic, continuous IV infusion therapy with the assistance of home care
        nursing and the study coordinator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Nesiritide infusion &gt;24 hours in the previous 30 days.

          2. Stable chronic heart failure or NYHA Class I or II.

          3. Aortic stenosis greater than mild degree as determined by echocardiogram or
             catheterization.

          4. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with an outflow tract gradient.

          5. Isolated right heart failure (cor pulmonale).

          6. Unstable coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction&lt; 3 months prior to enrollment.

          7. Chronic hypotension with systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg.

          8. Terminal noncardiovascular illness with life expectancy &lt;6 months. Moribund patients
             will not be considered for enrollment.

          9. Active substance abuse.

         10. Inadequate social support.

         11. Contraindication to long term IV access.

         12. Pregnant or lactating females.
