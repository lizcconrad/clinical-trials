  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral hepatitis C prognosis is related to the presence of a fibrosis and to the risk of
      developing cirrhosis or hepatic cancer. The study will evaluate the efficacy of prazosin to
      make hepatic fibrosis regress, in patients with chronic hepatitis C and severe fibrosis.

    <textblock>
      Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon and ribavirin has a virological effect. Viral
      hepatitis C prognosis is related to the presence of a fibrosis and to the risk of developing
      cirrhosis or hepatic cancer. In vitro studies of prazosin suggest an effect against hepatic
      fibrosis, but the clinical effect of prazosin on the hepatic fibrosis induced by hepatitis C
      infection is unknown. The purpose of this multicentric national study is to compare the
      effects among the hepatic fibrosis of peg-interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin with prazosin or
      not (placebo). 112 patients with a viral hepatitis C, genotype 1 or 4, and severe fibrosis,
      will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: peg-interferon alpha 2b and
      ribavirin, with prazosin or with placebo. Peg-interferon alpha 2b will be administered once a
      week (1.5 micro g per kg) during 48 weeks, ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg per day (according to
      weight) during 48 weeks, prazosin/placebo 5 mg (2 pills) per day during 96 weeks. Evaluation
      will be done at 96 weeks. The primary end-point is the proportion of patients presenting a
      decrease of fibrosis. Secondary end-points are other criteria of histological response,
      virological response, biochemical response.
