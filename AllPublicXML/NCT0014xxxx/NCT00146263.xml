  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The aging of the population has lead to a significant increase in the number of older people
      suffering from cognitive impairment and dementia. The present lack of effective drug therapy
      for these conditions makes it imperative to investigate other potential therapeutic
      interventions.

      Cognitive training has been described as possibly useful in improving cognitive function in
      elderly subjects with mild impairment and early dementia. However, there have been few
      well-designed studies to date and the results are equivocal. Most studies have relied on the
      use of paper-based neuropsychological assessment instruments with limited accuracy and
      reproducibility. The investigators have developed a validated computerized neuropsychological
      assessment battery with increased test-retest reliability.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a computerized training program on
      cognitive function in older persons with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and
      early dementia.

      Description:

      A randomized prospective AB/BA crossover study.

      Methods:

      Eligible males and females aged 60 years and older following initial computerized
      neuropsychological assessment will be randomized to receive either a 12-session computerized
      cognitive training program, or no treatment. Repeat neuropsychological assessment will be
      followed by a 4-week no treatment phase, reassessment and crossover phase. Repeat assessments
      will be performed at three and six months.
