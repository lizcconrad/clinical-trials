      This registry will provide detailed patient demographics and characteristics at the time of
      enrollment and will also provide data regarding predictors of clinical outcomes such as heart
      failure decompensation, heart failure hospitalization, NYHA class, and quality of life.

      The CRT RENEWAL Registry aims to characterize patient demographics and clinical attributes at
      enrollment and overall event rates as defined by heart failure decompensation, heart failure
      hospitalization, death, and ventricular arrhythmic events. The registry will also assess
      clinical outcomes including quality of life (QOL), physical activity habits, and events
      rates, along with device diagnostics such as Activity Log Index and heart rate

             devices

             non-Guidant epicardial leads

          -  Patients who have had an ejection fraction measured within six months of enrollment

          -  Patients who sign and date a Patient Informed Consent form at the enrollment visit

          -  Patients who remain in the clinical care of the enrolling physician in approved

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another observational registry or
             investigational study that would directly impact the treatment or outcome of the CRT
             RENEWAL Registry. Each instance will be brought to the attention of Guidant's Clinical
             Application Research Studies (CARS) Department to determine eligibility
