  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of continuing or discontinuing 3TC
      treatment in the presence of HIV virus with 3TC resistance for persons who are on a regimen
      including least three other anti-HIV drugs. The overall aim is to determine whether
      continuing 3TC is of benefit in HIV-positive persons who have already shown resistance to
      this drug.
