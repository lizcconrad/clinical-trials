      The purpose of this study is to estimate the MTD of Mg pidolate in combination with HU in
      patients with sickle cell disease who have been on a therapeutic dose (15-30 mg/kg/day) of HU
      for at least 6 months.

      This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating the combination of hydroxyurea and magnesium
      pidolate for patients with sickle cell disease with either hemoglobin SS disease or
      hemoglobin S beta thalassemia. Hydroxyurea and magnesium pidolate will be tested in pediatric
      and adolescent patients with sickle cell disease who already have been treated with
      hydroxyurea for a minimum of six months. Magnesium pidolate will be given in combination with
      hydroxyurea for six months. In successive small groups of patients, the dose of magnesium
      will be increased in order to eventually determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) for magnesium when given in combination with hydroxyurea. The maximum
      tolerated dose is the highest drug dose that can be given safely to participants. The dose
      limiting toxicity is determined when drug side effects prevent an increase in dose.

    <description>Intervention Description: Mg pidolate in combination with HU in patients with sickle cell disease who have been on a therapeutic dose (15-30 mg/kg/day) of HU for at least 6 months. Mg pidolate will be given at an initial dose of 0.6 mEq/kg/day divided into 2 daily doses for the first cohort of patients. This dose will be escalated for the subsequent patient cohorts as defined by a classic Phase I design (according to toxicity).</description>
