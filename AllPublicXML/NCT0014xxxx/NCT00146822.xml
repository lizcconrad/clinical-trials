      The REFLEx Study will evaluate if ENDOTAK RELIANCE G defibrillation leads with GORE
      ePTFE-covered coils are as good as or better than other comparative commercially available
      defibrillation leads with respect to electrical performance and termination efficacy in
      spontaneous tachyarrhythmic episodes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet current ICD or CRT-D indications

          -  Patients who are going to be implanted with one of the aforementioned ICD or CRT-D
             devices

          -  Patients who are going to be implanted with active-fixation, dual-coil, endocardial
             defibrillation leads with compatible connectors (i.e., ENDOTAK RELIANCE G or
             study-comparative ICD leads)

          -  Patients who sign and date a Patient Informed Consent form prior to device implant

          -  Patients who remain in the clinical care of the enrolling physician in approved
             centers

          -  Patients who are at least 18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a preexisting transvenous lead system that is not completely
             explanted

          -  Patients who are hypersensitive to a single dose of approximately 1.0 mg of
             dexamethasone acetate

          -  Patients who are expected to receive a heart transplant during the duration of the
             study

          -  Patients whose estimated life expectancy is less than 12 months due to other medical
             conditions

          -  Patients who currently have or who are likely to receive a tricuspid valve prosthesis

          -  Patients who are likely to have an open-chest surgery in the next three months

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study that would
             directly impact the treatment or outcome of the REFLEx study.

          -  Patients who are mentally incompetent and cannot sign a Patient Informed Consent form
             or comply with the study

          -  Patients who are pregnant
