      This study will be an open, non-randomised, clinical phase 2 trial, which will involve 30
      women diagnosed with uterine papillary serous cancer. The researchers will investigate the
      effect of four cycles of paclitaxel/carboplatin, followed by whole pelvic external beam
      radiotherapy to a standard pelvis field (50.4 Gy) with or without a para-aortic boost with
      respect to the safety and efficacy of treatment, and patterns of recurrence.

      Trial Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin +/-
           pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of UPSC.

        -  To observe the patterns of recurrence following the administration of the combination of
           Paclitaxel and Carboplatin +/- pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of UPSC.

        -  To assess the QOL, overall survival and disease free survival.

      Treatment

      Surgery: Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, +/- pelvic and aortic
      node sampling, omentectomy, peritoneal cytology.

      Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy commences at the surgeon's and the medical oncologist's discretion
      and the time between surgery and start of chemotherapy will be recorded. One treatment cycle
      consists of 3 weeks.

      Paclitaxel and Carboplatin will be administered as follows:

      Day 1:

        -  Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or po or phenergan 12.5 - 25 mg IV

        -  Cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg IV

        -  Dexamethasone 20 mg IV

        -  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2

        -  Carboplatin AUC 6

      Day 22: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the second cycle.

      Day 43: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the third cycle.

      Day 64: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the fourth cycle.

      Day 85: After the fourth cycle of chemotherapy patients

      Patients with stage 4 disease will continue with chemotherapy for a total of 6 cycles.

      Patients with surgical stage 1b to 3c disease will receive whole pelvis external beam
      radiotherapy (50.4 Gy RD over 5 and a half weeks +/- paraaortic boost +/- vaginal vault
      brachytherapy boost). Radiotherapy will start 4 to 6 weeks after commencement of chemotherapy
      when the haematological count has recovered.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed UPSC at surgical stage 1b to 4 disease. The
             serous-papillary component of the specimen must be at least 30 percent. Patients with
             surgical stage 1a disease should not be enrolled.

          -  Females aged &gt;= 18 years old.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients may not have received any prior chemotherapy regimens for UPSC.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic and neurologic function.

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of the study and sign an
             informed consent form.

          -  Patients with previous malignancy are eligible only if the patient has been
             disease-free for &gt;= 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with pre-existing &gt;= grade 2 neurotoxicity.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, (systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg) or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or diabetes
             mellitus

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancy within the last 5 years that could affect
             the diagnosis or assessment of UPSC.

          -  Patients who have a history of serious cardiac disease that is not adequately
