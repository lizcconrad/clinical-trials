  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to date there is no worldwide accepted standard chemotherapy for the 1st-line treatment of
      advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.A combination of epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU (ECF)
      is the best examined combination and widely used. Recent studies (Thuss-Patience et al, J.
      Clin. Oncol. 2005) could show that a combination of docetaxel and 5-FU might be similarly
      effective as ECF. 5-FU and docetaxel +/- cisplatin combinations are investigated by many
      groups and may be a future reference treatment. Many data suggest that 5-FU infusion can be
      replaced by oral capecitabine with equal efficacy.

      As docetaxel/5-FU is probably similarly effective as epirubicin/cisplatin/5-FU and a
      replacement of 5-FU infusion by capecitabine makes the chemotherapy more comfortable for the
      patient we investigate in this study a chemotherapy of docetaxel and capecitabine as 1st-line
      therapy for metastatic or advanced gastric cancer.

      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma who did not receive any
      prior chemotherapy for advanced disease can be enrolled in the study.

      Patients are treated with oral capecitabine 1000mg/sqm twice per day on the days 1-14 and
      docetaxel 75 mg/sqm on day 1 as a 1 hour i.v. infusion. chemotherapy is repeated every 21
      days. Staging by imaging is performed every 2 cycles.

      After 40 included patients an amendment was done and the starting of chemotherapy has been
      reduced to further improve tolerability. Starting dose of docetaxel was amended to 60 mg/sqm,
      d1, and starting dose of capecitabine reduced to 800 mg/sqm twice per day, d1-14. The patient
      number to be included was increased to 70 pts.

      Therapy is continued up to tumor progression to a maximum of 10 cycles. Therapy is stopped in
      case of severe side effects, tumor progression or withdrawal of consent.

      This investigator initiated study is supported by Hoffmann-La Roche and by Sanofi-Aventis.
