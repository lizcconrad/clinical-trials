  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of and immune response to the
      investigational HIV vaccine, EP HIV-1090, in HIV uninfected adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through the development of a safe and
      effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. DNA vaccines are inexpensive to construct,
      readily produced in large quantities, and stable for long periods of time. EP HIV-1090 is a
      DNA HIV CTL vaccine; the proteins for which its genes code are designed to interact with CD8
      cells (CTL) and cause CD8 cell proliferation. The DNA plasmids in EP HIV-1090 code for
      proteins conserved among HIV subtypes A, B, C, D, F, and G, which encompass the HLA subtypes
      of 85% of the worldwide general population.

      Participants will be enrolled in this study for 1 year. Group 4 participants will receive EP
      HIV-1090 or placebo at study entry and Months 1, 3, and 6. There will be 11 study visits that
      will occur at screening; study entry; and Months 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12. A
      physical exam and risk reduction/pregnancy prevention counseling will occur at each visit.
      Participants will be asked about their adverse experiences from vaccination at each visit.
      Blood and urine collection will occur at selected visits.
