    <textblock>
      Many cocaine dependent individuals are also dependent on alcohol. Such individuals respond
      poorly to existing treatments and have received little research attention in the past. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of naltrexone and disulfiram is
      useful in decreasing alcohol use and cravings in people diagnosed with both cocaine and
      alcohol dependence.

      Many cocaine dependent individuals are also dependent on alcohol. Such individuals respond
      poorly to existing treatments and have received little research attention in the past.
      Naltrexone and disulfiram are medications currently approved for treating alcohol dependence.
      These two medications have different mechanisms of action in the body. In combination they
      might be effective in treating individuals dually diagnosed with cocaine and alcohol
      dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of naltrexone
      and disulfiram is useful in decreasing alcohol cravings in individuals who are dependent on
      both cocaine and alcohol.

      Participants in this 5-year, double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive
      disulfiram, naltrexone, both, or placebo. Treatment will occur for a 3-month period, after
      which alcohol, cocaine use, and other biopsychosocial measures will be assessed at Months 6
      and 9.
