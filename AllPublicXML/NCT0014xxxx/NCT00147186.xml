  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Hylan G-F 20 as a treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee has become popular
      in recent years. Typical treatment of OA of the knee includes NSAIDs and physical therapy
      protocols to strengthen local muscle groups and decrease pain. When these conservative
      treatment modalities have been exhausted, the next step is arthroplasty of the knee. Hylan
      G-F 20 treatments provide physicians with an intermediate mode of treatment prior to surgery.
      Hylan G-F 20 is a cross-linked, high molecular weight derivative of hyaluronan which can be
      found within the synovial capsule of the knee. This form of viscosupplementation is intended
      to reduce the pain suffered by those with OA by increasing the fluid levels within the
      synovial space, providing a cushion between the bony surfaces within the knee joint. Current
      studies have only looked at self-reported pain relief or Outcomes Inventories. This study
      aims to determine the ability of Hylan G-F 20 treatment to improve the parameters of gait of
      individuals who suffer from OA.

      Typically, when an adult suffers from OA of the knee, they are presented with two choices:
      conservative treatments consisting of NSAID therapy and physical therapy or surgical
      intervention to replace the affected knee joint. There is a third avenue of treatment that
      has become available in recent years. This treatment modality is viscosupplementation.
      Viscosupplementation consists of replacing hyaluronic acid in the synovial fluid contained in
      the knee joint. It has been observed that the synovial fluid of OA sufferers has less
      hyaluronic acid (HA), and the HA that remains is of lower molecular size and concentration
      Replacement of the HA contained in the synovial fluid through the use of Hylan G-F 20 has
      been shown in clinical studies to be clinically safe, and have the ability to provide pain
      relief with a minimum of adverse reactions. Clinical studies concerning the use of Hylan G-F
      20 have focused on safety and efficacy in regards to pain relief in those who suffer OA. To
      date, there have been few studies performed looking at the efficacy of Hylan G-F 20 on the
      kinematics and kinetics of gait. This study will provide data on the ability of Hylan G-F 20
      treatment to improve the temporal-spatial parameters of gait in those who suffer OA, as well
      as the ability of Hylan G-F 20 to reduce joint reaction forces in the affected knee.
