  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether zinc can be used in combination with
      standard antibiotics to reduce the duration of illness and the likelihood of treatment
      failure among children less than two years old who have non-severe, outpatient pneumonia.

      This study is a follow up to an earlier study among hospitalised children less than two years
      old with severe pneumonia who were administered zinc as an adjuvant along with standard
      antimicrobial agents. That study found a 20% reduction in illness duration and
      hospitalisation, as well as a 3 - 9 fold reduction in treatment failure for children given
      zinc along with standard antimicrobial management. However, since most pneumonia is managed
      in an outpatient setting, it is important to know if it works in this setting as well. We
      hypothesise that zinc may act as an acute phase reactant in the early stages of outpatient
      non-severe pneumonia to reduce both the duration of illness and the likelihood of treatment
      failure.

      To test this, we will randomise children less than two years old to receive either zinc or
      placebo can as an adjuvant to standard oral antimicrobial agents in the acute treatment of
      non-severe pneumonia in an outpatient urban setting. Oral antibiotics will be given for a
      standard five-day course, while zinc (20 mg) or placebo will be administered once-daily for
      10 days. Patients will be followed up on a daily basis at home to monitor their progress and
      document compliance.

      Outcomes will be a comparison between zinc and placebo groups on duration of illness, as
      measured by specific signs of pneumonia, and treatment failure, as measured by change of
      antibiotics or hospitalisation for failure to improve or worsening condition.
