  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to examine the cortical activity during speech perception and speech
      production in idiopathic stutterers compared to fluent speakers. Therefore, the noninvasive
      method of magnetoencephalography (MEG) is used. A better understanding for the complexity of
      speech perception and its pathology should be developed.

      Fundamental properties of stuttering are repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. In most
      cases stuttering emerges between 2 and 5 years of age. The auditory feedback should become
      less important during development, as soon as information about mispronounced words does not
      occur anymore. During speech development this control function should be adopted by other
      systems. In stutterers the dominance of the acoustic control should remain.

      Brain imaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) show defects in the network of motor system, in the lateralization of speech areas, and
      functions of the auditory cortex. Magnetoencephalographic studies describe a similar variety
      as cause of stuttering. There may be defects in the auditory feedback, a modification of the
      lateralization of speech areas, or an alteration of co-action of motor planning and auditory
      system.

      The benefit of magnetoencephalography is a very good temporal resolution in the range of
      milliseconds combined with good spatial resolution. Therefore, it is well suited to examine
      the dynamics of cortical processing during stuttering. In this study evoked components of the
      auditory systems related to complex sounds, vocals, consonant-vocal combinations, and single
      words are analyzed. Differences of these components in the auditory cortices of stutterers
      and fluent speakers are hypothesized as well in temporal structure as in localization and
      lateralization.
