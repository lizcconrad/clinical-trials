  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the amount of metabolites of ATL-962 in the blood
      and to investigate the effect of ATL-962 on the amount of fat that is excreted in the faeces
      in subjects who are obese

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a significant and increasing clinical problem. There is a need for effective
      therapeutic agents to help people reduce weight. ATL-962 is a lipase inhibitor which could
      reduce the amount of fat absorbed from a person's diet, leading to weight reduction.
