      A definable and significant withdrawal syndrome occurs upon cessation of chronic, heavy
      marijuana use. Bupropion (Zyban) is a medication currently used to treat withdrawal symptoms
      associated with tobacco use. The purpose of this study is to determine if bupropion will help

      A definable and significant withdrawal syndrome occurs upon cessation of chronic, heavy
      marijuana use. This syndrome includes alterations in mood, sleep disturbances, and cognitive
      performance. Many of nicotine's withdrawal symptoms are similar to those observed with
      marijuana withdrawal. Bupropion has been shown to be effective in treating nicotine
      addiction.The purpose of this study is to determine if bupropion is effective in treating
      marijuana dependent individuals. Specifically, this study will determine if bupropion
      alleviates withdrawal symptoms associated with marijuana abuse.

      Participants in this 21-day, double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      bupropion or placebo. Treatment with bupropion will occur for one week before stopping
      marijuana use (quit day). Bupropion will be administered at 150 mg per day for 3 days,
      followed by 300 mg per day for the remainder of the study. Quit day will occur on Day 8, at
      which time participants will be required to remain abstinent from marijuana for the duration
      of the study. Participants will provide daily urine specimens. Changes in vigilance, memory,
      reaction time, and psychomotor performance as well as withdrawal symptoms will be evaluated.
