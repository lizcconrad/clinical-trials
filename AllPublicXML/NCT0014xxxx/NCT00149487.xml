      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a tailored problem solving
      intervention in increasing adherence to asthma management behaviors in African American
      adolescents with asthma.

      BACKGROUND:

      Children and adolescents who are unable to adhere to their medical regimen for the management
      of chronic illness present considerable challenges to health care providers and researchers.
      Pediatric asthma is a chronic illness where the consequences of non-adherence are
      particularly detrimental and widespread, especially among economically disadvantaged minority
      children and their families. Studies of intervention of asthma management are needed for this
      population.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The aim of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a problem solving intervention that
      is tailored to the observed adherence behaviors and identified barriers to increasing
      adherence in African American children and adolescents with asthma, and their families.
      Patients are randomized to either a Tailored Problem Solving Intervention, or a control group
      who will receive Family Education Intervention. Duration of the intervention is four months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  African American

          -  Family income to be below the poverty line

          -  Physician-based diagnosis of asthma of at least 12 months

          -  Moderate to severe asthma (moderate asthma includes daily symptoms, daily use of
             inhaled short acting beta-agonist, exacerbations greater than 2 times per week that
             affect activity, and nighttime symptoms greater than once a week, FEV1 or Peak Flow
             PEF between 60 and 80 percent predicted and PEF variability greater than 30 percent;
             severe asthma includes continual symptoms, limited physical activity, frequent
             exacerbations together with frequent nighttime symptoms, FEV1 or PEF less than 60
             percent predicted, and PEF variability greater than 30 percent)

          -  Likely to be on a stable and daily medication (inhaled steroid) that can be modified
             electronically for the time period required to participate in the study
