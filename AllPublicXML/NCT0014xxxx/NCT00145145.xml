  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine whether immunization with the MAGE-3.A1 peptide
      mixed with CpG 7909 results in a detectable immune response; to determine the safety of this
      vaccine and; to document the tumor response to the vaccine.

      Patients will be vaccinated every two weeks on six occasions. On each vaccination day, the
      MAGE-3.A1 peptide (300 µg) mixed with CpG 7909 (5 mg) will be administered twice
      intradermally (10% of the dose each) and twice subcutaneously (40% of the dose each) in the
      arms and thighs.

      Tumor staging will be performed before inclusion and at week 13. PBL collections will be
      performed before starting the treatment, and at weeks 3, 7 and 13. They will provide the T
      lymphocytes for the immunological analysis.

      Additional cycles of immunization will be proposed to patients without tumor progression
      requiring another treatment. A second cycle of 3 injections at 6-week intervals will be
      started at week 17 with the same vaccine, followed by a third cycle of 12 injections at
      3-month intervals starting at month 11. At any time, progression of the disease necessitating
      any treatment not allowed during the study, will result in study withdrawal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven cutaneous melanoma, or clear cell sarcoma, which is considered
             as a subtype of melanoma.

          2. Melanoma must be at one of the following AJCC 2002 stages:

               -  Regional metastatic disease (any T; N2b, N2c or N3; M0).

               -  Distant metastatic disease (any T; any N; M1a, M1b or M1c), except brain or
                  leptomeningeal localizations, and except elevated LDH.

          3. Patients must be HLA-A1.

          4. Melanoma must express the MAGE-3 gene, as determined by RT-PCR.

          5. Presence of at least one measurable or non-measurable tumor lesion, excluding
             leptomeningeal metastasis (see Section 7.3).

          6. Expected survival of at least 3 months.

          7. Karnofsky performance scale ≥70 or WHO performance status of 0 or 1.

          8. Within the last 4 weeks prior to study day 1, vital laboratory parameters should be
             within normal range, except for the following laboratory parameters, which must be
             within the ranges specified:

             Lab Parameter Range

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl or ≥ 6,25 mmol/l

               -  Granulocytes ≥ 1,500/µl

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl or ≤ 34.2 mmol/l

               -  ASAT and ALAT ≤ 2 x the normal upper limits

               -  LDH ≤ the normal upper limit.
