  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if an angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan
      160 mg/day is more effective to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events as compared to
      40 mg/day in patients with moderate renal dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that patients with renal dysfunction have a poor prognosis concerning
      cardiovascular diseases. That is called &quot;cardiorenal syndrome&quot;. It was reported that
      valsartan was effective in reducing the urine albumin extraction rate in patients with hyper-
      or normotension. We hypothesized that valsartan was more effective to prevent cardiovascular
      events by the intermediary of improving renal function.

      The primary endpoints are:

        -  cardiovascular events (cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina
           requiring rehospitalization, congestive heart failure requiring rehospitalization,
           revascularization procedures including coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass
           grafting;Stroke or transient ischaemic attack, dissociation aneurysm of the aorta
           needing hospitalisation;Lower limbs artery obstruction needing hospitalisation .

        -  end-stage renal dysfunction (introduction of hemodialysis or kidney transplantation)

        -  50% reduction of creatinine clearance

      The secondary endpoints are:

        -  systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle estimated by echocardiography (%
           FS and E/A ratio)

        -  specific biochemical markers for cardiac or renal function (urine microalbumin, plasma
           B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor, plasma
           cystatin C)

        -  % changes of creatinine clearance between start and end of the study period

        -  transition of 1/(serum Cr) in patients whose u-prot/u-Cr is equal to or more than 1.0

        -  transition of serum K

        -  HbA1c

        -  New onset Atrial Fibrillation

        -  New onset Diabetes

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The number of actual events was extremely low. We extended the study period, but it was still
    not enough. Also, many patients were loss of follow up.
