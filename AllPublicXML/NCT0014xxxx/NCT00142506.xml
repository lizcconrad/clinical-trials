  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation sometimes affects the ability for a person to have a normal erection. Complete loss
      of erections after radiation treatment can happen in 40-50% of treated patients. There are
      medications, like sildenafil (also known as Viagra), that can help the ability to get back
      erections in almost 70% of such patients.

      The purpose of this study is to see if taking Viagra every day starting right before, during
      and for about 6 months after treatment, could reduce the risk of long-term erectile
      dysfunction.

      This protocol is a randomized prospective study comparing prophylactic and on demand
      Sildenafil Citrate usage administered during and after radiotherapy in combination with or
      without hormone therapy versus radiotherapy alone for the preservation of erectile function
      in potent patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The primary objectives of this
      protocol are to determine if prophylactic and on demand usage of Sildenafil Citrate can
      preserve spontaneous erectile function as well as diminish the time to restoration of
      erectile function in potent men receiving radiotherapy with or without hormone therapy for
      localized prostate cancer. Secondary objectives of this study are: to determine whether
      prophylactic and on demand use of Sildenafil Citrate during therapy may improve the long-term
      response to the drug following treatment; to determine whether prophylactic and on demand use
      of Sildenafil Citrate during therapy will reduce acute and late urinary effects of
      radiotherapy; to determine the impact of dosimetry and radiation exposure to both the
      neurovascular bundle and bulb of the penis on erectile function preservation in the study
      population undergoing brachytherapy and hormone therapy; to asses the impact on quality of
      life following prophylactic and on demand Sildenafil Citrate usage in the study population;
      to determine the relationship between testosterone levels, erectile function and efficacy of
      prophylactic and on demand Sildenafil Citrate usage in the study population.

    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is used for the evaluation of male sexual function and diagnostic evaluation of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) severity. There are 5 domains of the IIEF: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each question of the IIEF. Total IIEF scores range from 0-75. Lower scores indicate severe erectile dysfunction (0=severe erectile dysfunction), while higher scores indicate less erectile dysfunction (75=no erectile dysfunction).</description>

Hormone therapy patients will complete assessments at baseline (within 4 weeks of start of study treatment) each month (only IIEF and QOL) before start of radiotherapy, at start of radiotherapy and at months 3, 6, 9, 12 18 and 24 from start of radiotherapy.

        <title>Assessment of Erectile Dysfunction</title>
        <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is used for the evaluation of male sexual function and diagnostic evaluation of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) severity. There are 5 domains of the IIEF: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each question of the IIEF. Total IIEF scores range from 0-75. Lower scores indicate severe erectile dysfunction (0=severe erectile dysfunction), while higher scores indicate less erectile dysfunction (75=no erectile dysfunction).</description>

sildenafil citrate and questionaires: Hormone therapy patients will be instructed to begin the study drug simultaneously or within 1 month of start of hormone therapy. These patients will then continue to take the study drug for approximately 6 months following start of radiotherapy.In addition, during prophylactic phase (drug and placebo prophylactic arms) patients will have the opportunity to utilize oral 50 mg. tablets of Sildenafil Citrate in an on demand open label, flexible dose fashion. Hormone patients will be offered on demand Sildenafil for approximately 15-21 months.
Hormone therapy patients will complete assessments at baseline (within 4 weeks of start of study treatment) each month (only IIEF and QOL) before start of radiotherapy, at start of radiotherapy and at months 3, 6, 9, 12 18 and 24 from start of radiotherapy. Testosterone assessments will take place at baseline, and months 12 and 24.</description>
