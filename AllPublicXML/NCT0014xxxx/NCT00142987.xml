  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent literature has demonstrated that the group of IBS sufferers who experience mixed bowel
      habits may be more similar to IBS-C patients than IBS-D patients. This study will evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of tegaserod 6 mg b.i.d. in women with IBS and mixed bowel habits,
      excluding those with predominant diarrhea.
