      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Neuroskin Forte in relieving the
      symptoms of dry skin in adults with psoriasis or eczema.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will apply study drug and placebo sprays 3 times a day to the assigned, randomized
      sides of the body. They are allowed to continue using prescription medications, but not
      moisturizers. Assessments will be performed every other week. Total duration of the study is
      10 weeks (8 weeks of treatment and a follow-up visit 2 weeks later).

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects assessed the level of pruritus (itching) on the left and right sides of their body at each visit, ticking the values on a 100-mm scale (0 mm = no itching; 100 mm = worst possible itching) for each side. Percent change from baseline was calculated.</description>

    <description>For subjects with psoriasis, a global assessment (scale of 0-5: 0 = clear except for residual discoloration; 1 = minimal; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = marked; 5 = severe) was performed and a score recorded for each side of the subject's body, at each visit.</description>
