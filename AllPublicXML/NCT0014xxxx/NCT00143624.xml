  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study the effect of rosiglitazone on the progression of atherosclerosis
      (hardening of blood vessels) through improvements of the sugar and fat metabolism (body
      buildup, breakdown and excretion of sugar and fat).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the first group will receive 8
      mg of the study drug and the second group will be given a placebo, though neither group will
      know which formulation they are receiving. The study will follow both groups for one year,
      during which it will measure changes in blood vessel composition and activity, sugar
      metabolism, concentration of blood fat, and body fat distribution. This single-site study
      aims to enroll 50 participants.
