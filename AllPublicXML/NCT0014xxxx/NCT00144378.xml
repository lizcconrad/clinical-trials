    <textblock>
      The median survival at progression after first-line chemotherapy for metastatic gastric
      cancer is about 2.5 months. There are no data which a possible benefit of second line
      therapy. for this reason a trial which investigates a possible benefit or chemotherapy
      compared to best supportive care as second line treatment is urgently necessary.

      Irinotecan shows response rates of 20% in the first line therapy with high rates od disease
      stabilization. There are few trials investigating irinotecan in the second line setting.
      Response rates of 20% are reported in tis setting. Irinotecan is supplied without costs from
      the company Pfizer.

      Metastatic gastric cancer, progressive disease after one palliative chemotherapy

      Arm A:
