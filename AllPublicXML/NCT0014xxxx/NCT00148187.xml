  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantitate pre-transplant medication compliance, dialysis
      compliance, and related psychological variables, and then examine their validity as
      predictors of post-transplant noncompliant behaviors and clinically relevant outcomes (acute
      rejection, graft loss, or death).

      Hypothesis: Noncompliance with pre-transplant medication or with the dialysis prescription,
      and specific psychological variables predict similarly noncompliant behaviors after
      transplantation.

      This pilot study is intended to provide preliminary data about the feasibility of recruiting
      a cohort of subjects on hemodialysis and following them prospectively through the transplant
      procedure. The study will document patient adherence to medications and treatment, both
      before and after surgery. These preliminary data will permit appropriate design and power
      calculations for a future study assessing our ability to predict post-transplant compliance,
      based on pre-transplant behaviors.
