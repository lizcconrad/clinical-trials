  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to explore the effect of combining an established
      chemotherapy regimen (FLOX), based on 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin
      (Eloxatin®), with the EGF receptor antibody cetuximab (Erbitux®) in first-line treatment of
      metastatic colorectal cancer. The trial will investigate two regimens of FLOX plus cetuximab,
      in which FLOX is given continuously or intermittently, compared to standard FLOX without
      cetuximab.
