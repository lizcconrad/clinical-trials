  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate efficacy and tolerability of lozenges containing
      20mg am broxol hydrochloride relative to placebo in relieving pain of sore throat in
      adolescent patients suf fering from acute viral pharyngitis. The primary endpoint is the
      time-weighted average of the pain intensity difference from pre-dose bas eline over the first
      3 hours after the first lozenge expressed as a ratio of the pre-dose baseline ( SPIDnorm).

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate efficacy and tolerability of lozenges containing
      20mg am broxol hydrochloride relative to placebo in relieving pain of sore throat in
      adolescent patients suf fering from acute viral pharyngitis. The pain intensity will be
      assessed by the patient on a 6-point rating scale before taking the first lozenge and 30, 60,
      120 and 180 minutes thereafter. The patient enters the rating in the patient's diary.

      Study Hypothesis:

      It will be tested whether a statistically significant difference exists in the S PIDnorm
      after the intake of the 1st lozenge between the group treated with ambro xol lozenges and the
      group treated with placebo lozenges.

      Comparison(s):

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Patients having a sore throat with acute viral pharyngitis.

          2. Female and male patients from 12 and less than 18 years of age.

          3. The throat pain intensity is rated at least &quot;moderate&quot; on the VRS(PI).

          4. Written Informed Consent is given by the patient's parent/legal guardian, an d the
             patient is able to give Assent.

          5. Compliance by the patient seems guaranteed, and the patient seems to be able to
             understand and complete the patient diary.

          6. Patient able to remain at the doctor's practice for the initial 3 hours follo wing the
             first intake of study medication, or known reliable patient, and able t o return for
             the study visits.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Female patients who have begun menstruating and are:

             infection (clinical findings inter alia assessment of exudate).

          3. First indication of symptoms of acute pharyngitis (e.g. sore throat) occurre d more
             than 3 days ago.

          4. Patients who suffered from acute viral or bacterial pharyngitis in the past 4 weeks.
