    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of the Active
      Living Every Day Physical Activity Program (ALED) for people with arthritis. This project is
      designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ALED program in changing arthritis-related
      health outcomes and to investigate the feasibility of conducting the ALED program in a public
      health setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence has shown that regular moderate-intensity physical activity improves symptoms and
      function in persons with arthritis. A 20-week behavior-based program was developed by the
      Cooper Institute, Brown University, and Human Kinetics to help people with sedentary
      lifestyles become and stay physically active. A randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness
      and efficacy of a similar program on which Active Living Every Day is based (ALED) on
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, cost-effectiveness, and cardiorespiratory fitness.
      However, the current research supporting ALED is limited for people with arthritis. The
      primary goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of the Active
      Living Every Day Physical Activity Program (ALED) for people with arthritis. The primary goal
      will be accomplished through a twenty week randomized controlled trial conducted with 400
      participants residing in the 17 Area Agencies on Aging housed in the Councils of Government
      in North Carolina, including both urban and rural counties. This project is designed to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the ALED program in changing arthritis-related health outcomes
      and to investigate the feasibility of conducting the ALED program in a public health setting.

      Objectives:

        1. To demonstrate that the ALED program can increase physical activity and fitness levels
           among people with arthritis.

        2. To demonstrate that the Active Living Every Day has arthritis-specific benefits.

        3. To evaluate the feasibility of disseminating the Active Living Every Day program through
           the NC public health network.
