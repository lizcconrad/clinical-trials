  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FUS
      treatment of breast fibroadenomas. Our hypothesis is that FUS lesion ablation of a
      fibroadenoma will have the following results: a. lead to a decrease in lesion cross-sectional
      area of &gt; 50% on palpation, and &gt;65% in lesion volume as measured by MRI (both calculations
      assume an elliptical shape of the lesion in all 3 dimensions). b. this decrease in size,
      along with the softening of the treated volume will result in satisfactory clinical results
      in greater than 50 % of the patients.

      Many patients are now diagnosed with breast fibroadenomas. These are generally detected
      during breast self-exams, or annual physicals as a smooth, rubbery, oval/elliptical lump in
      the breast. These patients then go on to receive mammograms, sonograms and usually a core
      biopsy for the differential diagnosis of benign disease (fibroadenoma) vs breast cancer.
      Although fibroadenomas are benign, they can be of great concern to the patient because of
      their ability to mask the presence of other lumps in the breast, they can be painful, cause a
      physical deformity of the breast or have other symptoms. The current treatment is surgical
      excision. Surgical removal is invasive and may be cosmetically undesirable to some patients.
      It would be advantageous to develop a non-invasive ablative method for treatment of this
      disease. Measures of the clinical success of patients who elect surgical removal of
      fibroadenomas are generally subjective, and evaluated primarily by the patient (lack of
      palpable lesion, pain free, and an acceptable cosmetic result). A non-randomized study is
      proposed to allow for a more practical approach in subject recruitment. Analysis on safety
      and efficacy will be performed through the use of MRI evaluation and physical exams.
