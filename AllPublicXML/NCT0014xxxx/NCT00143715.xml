      Excessive prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR) occurs frequently in
      patients taking warfarin; in fact, about one in six INR values is above the desired range.
      Excessive prolongation of the INR is clinically important because the risk of bleeding
      approximately doubles for each one point increase in the INR beyond the usual therapeutic
      range. Thus, treatment strategies which rapidly and reliably lower an excessively prolonged
      INR into the desired range have the potential to reduce bleeding. When taken by patients with
      INR values between 4.5 and 10, a small dose of oral vitamin K (1 mg to 2.5mg) reduces the INR
      into the desired INR range in about 75% of cases within 24 hours of its administration. If
      warfarin is simply withheld, and no vitamin K is given, about 25% of patients will have an
      INR in the desired range at 24 hours. However, vitamin K is rarely given to such patients. In
      a recent survey carried out by our group, less than 20% of such patients would have been
      given low dose oral vitamin K by a group of physicians who regularly supervise warfarin
      therapy.

      The most common treatment for excessive prolongation of the INR is to simply withhold
      warfarin and allow the INR to fall into the therapeutic range. Although this strategy is
      effective its safety has never been adequately examined. In fact, recent evidence suggests
      that patients with INR values of more than 6.0 who are treated with simple warfarin
      withdrawal have a risk of major bleeding of 4% in the two weeks after they develop their
      prolonged INR.

      When asked why they did not give oral vitamin K to a non-bleeding patient who has an
      excessively prolonged INR, physicians generally give one of three reasons: (1)They are not
      convinced that oral vitamin K reduces bleeding. (2) They are concerned that oral vitamin K
      may cause thrombosis. (3) In contrast with simply withholding warfarin, giving oral vitamin K
      requires a patient to visit the physician, and the physician must have a supply of vitamin K.

      The investigators hypothesize that the routine practice of not administering oral vitamin K
      to patients with excessively prolonged INR values is causing patients to have major,
      life-threatening and fatal bleeds. To convince physicians that oral vitamin K should be
      administered to all non-bleeding patients with INR values of more than 4.5, the investigators
      propose a study which the investigators anticipate will demonstrate that oral vitamin K
      reduces bleeding, does not cause thrombosis, and can be administered at home without direct
      physician supervision.

      To accomplish these goals, the investigators propose a multinational, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will randomize patients with INR values between
      4.5 and 10.0 to receive 1.25 mg of oral vitamin K or placebo and follow them for bleeding and
      thrombosis. Patients with INR values of more than 10.0 will receive a single 1.25 mg dose of
      oral vitamin K.

      Successful completion of this study will establish a treatment standard supported by clinical
      data which will, in turn, change the way that patients taking warfarin who present with an
      excessively prolonged INR are treated.

      What is the problem to be addressed ? Although warfarin is a highly effective anticoagulant,
      it causes bleeding. The risk of bleeding in an individual is increased by a number of
      factors, including age, gender and previous hemorrhage. However, the single strongest
      predictor of hemorrhage is excessive prolongation of the international normalized ratio
      (INR). We have shown that low-dose oral vitamin K reliably reduces an excessively prolonged
      INR; we hypothesize this treatment will also reduce the risk of hemorrhage without increasing
      the risk of thrombosis. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that low dose oral
      vitamin K improves the safety of oral anticoagulant therapy, by reducing the risk of bleeding
      without causing thrombosis, in patients presenting with INR values of more than 4.5.

      Background and rationale for the study (Efficacy and toxicity of warfarin): Warfarin reduces
      the risk of first or recurrent venous thrombosis by 80 to 90 percent, and reduces the risk of
      first or recurrent arterial thrombosis by 50 to 65 percent (1;2). In North America more than
      1 million patients receive warfarin on a daily basis and in Ontario more than 300,000
      prescriptions for warfarin are filled annually. The major toxicity of warfarin is bleeding,
      which may be fatal. Although bleeding may occur when the international normalized ratio (INR)
      is in the &quot;therapeutic range&quot; (2.0 to 3.0 for most indications), many patients who bleed have
      supratherapeutic INR values. Indeed, large studies suggest patients spend 10 to 20 percent of
      their time with excessively prolonged INR values and one anticoagulation clinic has reported
      that out of 7,279 patients managed over a 5 year interval, 1,995 had at least one INR greater
      than 6.0 (3). Furthermore, the risk of hemorrhage approximately doubles for each increase in
      the INR of 1.0 unit (4-7).

      Background and rationale for the study (Risks of an excessively prolonged INR) The risk of
      hemorrhage in patients with asymptomatic warfarin-associated coagulopathy has been
      highlighted by Hylek and colleagues (8). In this study, 114 patients who presented with INR
      values of more than 6.0 simply had their warfarin withheld until the INR had declined to the
      desired range. In the two-week follow-up period, 10 of the 114 (8.8%, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 3.6 to 14.0) patients experienced bleeding including 5 major and two fatal bleeds. Thus
      the risk of major hemorrhage and fatal hemorrhage was 4.4% (95% CI 0.6, 8.1), and 1.7% (95%
      CI 0, 4.2), respectively. Similarly, Oden and colleagues (4) demonstrated the mortality rate
      attributable to bleeding per 100 patient years of follow-up was 22 fold higher in patients
      with INR values between 6.0 and 6.9, compared with patients with an INR between 2.0 and 2.4.
      The observation that excessive elevation of the INR is associated with bleeding suggests that
      identifying an effective technique to lower the INR will reduce bleeding.

      Background and Rationale (Treatment of warfarin associated coagulopathy) Other than simply
      withholding warfarin and allowing the INR to fall to the desired range, two &quot;active&quot;
      approaches are used to lower the INR in excessively anticoagulated patients. Transfusion of
      coagulation factor concentrates replaces missing coagulation factors. Supplemental vitamin K
      antagonizes the effect of warfarin, thus increasing endogenous synthesis of these same
      factors.

      Transfusion with human derived or recombinant clotting factors can rapidly normalize the INR.
      However, this treatment is expensive, inconvenient, associated with infectious or other
      complications such as allergy or thrombosis, and has never been prospectively studied in
      non-bleeding patients (9). Thus, transfusion therapy should not be used to correct an
      excessively prolonged INR value in non-bleeding patients.

      What is this study designed to prove ?

      We anticipate that this study will prove that:

        1. Oral vitamin K reduces the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin who present with
           INR values between 4.5 and 10.0.

        2. That oral vitamin K does not increase the risk of thrombosis when given to such
           patients.

        3. That low dose oral vitamin K will reduce the INR to an acceptable range in a high
           proportion of patients presenting with an INR of more than 10.0

      Why is this trial needed now ? This trial is needed now because there is new evidence
      confirming the association between prolonged INR values and the risk of bleeding (4;8),
      because new evidence suggests that oral vitamin K effectively lowers the INR (12-15;17) and
      thus may reduce bleeding (13), and because the risk:benefit ratio of oral vitamin K remains
      unclear.

      Studies which have been previously published by our group suggests that oral vitamin K
      effectively reduces the INR value. However, despite their rigour, and their publication in
      high-impact journals, our studies have not yet influenced clinical practice. A recent US
      survey confirmed that most clinicians faced with an excessively anticoagulated, non-bleeding
      patient would simply withhold warfarin and not give oral vitamin K (18). The lack of use of
      vitamin K is attributable to at least four factors; first, no study has unequivocally shown
      that oral vitamin K reduces the risk of hemorrhage. Although our first randomized trial (13)
      did find less bleeding in patients who received vitamin K, the bleeding in the placebo group
      occurred more than one week after randomization, making it possible that this observation was
      attributable to the play of chance. Second, there is concern that, irrespective of its route
      of administration, vitamin K may place patients at risk of thrombosis by &quot;over-correcting&quot;
      the INR. Although our two randomized trials showed no evidence that low dose vitamin K causes
      either warfarin resistance or thrombosis, at least one other publication has suggested this
      might occur (19). Third, the &quot;passive&quot; strategy of merely withholding warfarin is simple,
      inexpensive and easily applied. Finally, access to a convenient form of vitamin K is a major
      barrier as there is no convenient and easily administered form of oral vitamin K in many
      jurisdictions.

      Study design and implementation

      Trial design: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre
      clinical trial with a concurrent cohort study (Appendix 1 - Study Flow Diagram). The
      randomized trial will enrol patients with INR values of 4.5 to 10.0. The cohort study will
      enrol patients with INR values of more than 10.0.

      Study interventions:

      RANDOMIZED TRIAL (INR 4.5 to 10.0): Eligible, consenting patients will temporarily
      discontinue warfarin and will be randomized to receive a single capsule containing either
      1.25 mg of oral vitamin K or no active drug.() COHORT STUDY (INR more than 10.0): All
      eligible consenting patients will receive 2.5 mg of vitamin K.

      Allocation to study groups:

      Three types of anticoagulant clinics exist. In the first type, patients present to the clinic
      for blood-drawing, and wait for their INR. Their dose of warfarin is then prescribed based on
      these results. Within this type of clinic, patients will be identified at the time that their
      INR prolongation is discovered. Consent for the study will be obtained, and the patient will
      be provided with the next numbered study kit, from which a single capsule containing either
      vitamin K or placebo will be administered. In clinics in which a point-of-care device is used
      for INR determinations the INR will be confirmed with a venous sample before the patient is
      enrolled. For the purposes of this study, such centres will be called &quot;group 1&quot; sites.

      The more common anticoagulant clinic is one within which patients have their INR determined
      by an outside laboratory, with the results called to a clinic physician, nurse or pharmacist.
      Within such a clinic, it is impractical to require patients to present to the hospital for
      assessment and randomization on the day that their INR is prolonged. For clinics using this
      model, we propose that when patients are found to have an INR of more than 4.5 they be
      assessed over the telephone for inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. Patients
      meeting inclusion criteria, with no exclusion criteria, will be asked to provide consent over
      the telephone for the study. Once consent is obtained, and study forms are completed using
      information obtained over the telephone, the study centre will arrange to have the next
      numbered study drug allocated to the patient. The study drug will then be shipped to the
      patient using taxi cabs or a dedicated courier service. Receipt and consumption of the drug
      will then be confirmed at the time of the mandatory in centre assessment the following day.

      For the purposes of this study, all centres using this form of allocation to study drug will
      be called &quot;group 2&quot; centres.

      In both group 1 and group 2 centres patients with INR values of more than 10.0 will be given
      two capsules each containing 1.25 mg of oral vitamin K. A supply of such capsules will be
      provided to all participating centres in a clearly marked container. This drug will be
      provided to the patient in the same fashion as drug is provided to patients in the cohort
      study.

      Timely return of INR values is a problem when INR values are obtained outside the hospital.
      In some cases, for example, the INR may not be available until late in the evening or the day
      following the blood draw. If more than 24 hours has elapsed since the blood draw and the time
      at which a patient would be eligible for randomization the patient will be deemed ineligible
      for the study. In such cases however, the INR can be repeated (for example at the hospital or
      clinic laboratory) and if the INR remains above 4.5, the patient can then be enrolled.

      Patients who self-administer study drug will be asked to bring their unused capsule to the
      clinic on the day following randomization. This will ensure that they took the correct
      capsule.

      The least frequently used mechanism for monitoring warfarin therapy is patient
      self-monitoring using a point of care testing (POCT) device. Patients monitored with POCT are
      responsible for determining their INR and adjusting their warfarin dose based on their INR
      result. Patients who self-monitor using point of care testing and who find themselves to have
      an INR of more than 4.5 will be asked to contact their clinic staff. Prior to being
      approached for consent to enter this study the patient's INR will be confirmed on a venous
      blood sample organized by their host anticoagulant clinic. Given that patients in this group
      will be randomized while at the study centre, for the purposes of this study such patients
      will be considered to be in group 1.

      Group 1 and group 2 defines arbitrary groups. Clinics may have a mixture of group 1 and group
      2 patients; such clinics will have some patients who have signed consents and who will be
      randomized &quot;at home&quot; (group 2 patient) and others who are randomized and receive study drug
      &quot;in centre&quot;. Irrespective of where patients are at the time of randomization they will be
      allocated the next available study drug supply at the time of randomization.

      Procedure for dealing with patients who are eligible for the study on more than one occasion:
      Patients can only be enrolled in either the randomized trial or the cohort study once.
      However, a patient previously enrolled in the cohort study who presented on a later occasion
      with an INR of 4.5 to 10 would be eligible for the randomized trial. Similarly, patients
      previously enrolled in the randomized trial are eligible for the cohort study. To ensure that
      the results of the randomized trial are not confounded by participation in the cohort study,
      a minimum of one month must pass between the time a patient is enrolled in the cohort study
      and their subsequent enrollment in the randomized clinical trial.

      Method of randomization: Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated
      randomization sequence. This sequence will guide drug packaging. Study drug supply will be
      packaged and dispensed to each study centre in lots of sequentially numbered appropriately
      labeled pill bottles. An additional, clearly labeled, supply of capsules containing 1.25 mg
      of oral vitamin K will be dispensed to each participating centre. Patients will be randomized
      by allocating the next, sequentially numbered pill bottle.

      What is the frequency of study follow-up ? Patients will be seen at each participating
      clinical centre by study staff on days 1 and 14 (+/- 2 days) after randomization. All
      patients will be contacted by telephone on days 3, 7, 28 and 90. Additional contact and INR
      sampling necessary to manage the patient's anticoagulant therapy will be made as required.

      What are the study outcome measures ? The primary outcome measure is &quot;all clinically overt
      bleeding&quot;. Secondary outcome measures are &quot;all adjudication-confirmed major hemorrhage&quot;, &quot;all
      adjudication-confirmed thrombotic events&quot;, &quot;changes in INR values&quot; and &quot;cost effectiveness&quot;

      Why include all bleeding, and how is this endpoint defined ? Previous studies of both
      antithrombotic treatment and the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy have used only
      major hemorrhage as the measure of bleeding. In those studies, &quot;major hemorrhage&quot; has been
      chosen as the primary measure because it is both detected and independently adjudicated more
      easily than &quot;all hemorrhage&quot;. In addition, in most such studies of antithrombotic therapy,
      patients with acute thrombosis (or those at high risk of acute thrombosis) are enrolled. In
      the setting of acute thrombosis it is likely that physicians and patients are willing to
      tolerate minor bleeding as one of the &quot;unavoidable&quot; complications of antithrombotic therapy.
      Neither patients nor physicians would be willing to stop an effective treatment for acute,
      life threatening thrombosis because of minor bleeding. In the setting of warfarin maintenance
      therapy, however, minor bleeding such as unanticipated bruising, epistaxis or excessive
      menstrual blood loss in the setting of an excessively prolonged INR value is disconcerting,
      disruptive, costly if patients seek medical attention and likely to reduce compliance. Since
      we believe that reducing all bleeding complications (major and minor) is necessary to
      maximize the utility of warfarin therapy, we have chosen to measure all bleeding as our
      primary outcome measure of efficacy. We feel this is appropriate since the study intervention
      is masked; thus although minor bleeding is subjective, patients should be unaware of their
      treatment allocation and thus the treatment they receive will not influence their reporting
      of clinical events.

      Secondary outcome measures:

      Major Hemorrhage: Since we anticipate that many clinicians will wish to know the impact of
      vitamin K on &quot;major bleeding&quot;, we will also compare the rates of all adjudication-confirmed
      major bleeds between groups. All bleeding events will be submitted to the central
      adjudication committee and major bleeding will be confirmed by standardized, masked central
      adjudication (see appendix 2).

      Thrombotic Events: At each clinic visit and telephone follow-up signs and symptoms of
      thrombotic events will be sought. If a thrombotic event is suspected, appropriate objective
      documentation will be obtained and will be forwarded to the Central Adjudication Committee.
      The committee will adjudicate these thrombotic events using validated, pre-specified criteria
      (see appendix 2).

      Cost-effectiveness: Details on the number and frequency of interventions, outcomes and their
      associated morbidity will be collected. This material will form the basis for a subsequent
      cost-effectiveness study. Given that vitamin K is very inexpensive (oral vitamin K costs less
      than 5$ Canadian per dose in most jurisdictions) and the expense of bleeding is high
      (previous cost effectiveness studies have estimated that an episode of major bleeding costs
      more than 5000 $ Canadian per event (20)) it is very likely that the use of oral vitamin K
      will be highly cost-effective.

      Plan for ascertaining outcome events: Signs or symptoms of all (major and minor) bleeding and
      thrombosis will be sought at each clinic visit or telephone call. If bleeding or thrombosis
      is reported, all available objective documentation such as hospital records, transfusion
      records or results of diagnostic or therapeutic investigations (such as endoscopy) will be
      obtained. Minor bleeding will frequently not have led to medical evaluation; in cases where
      minor bleeding is reported the specific setting, nature, duration and required actions will
      be sought for each event reported by the patient.

      Determination of the sample size (INR 4.5 to 10.0): The estimated rate of all bleeding in
      patients who present with excessive, warfarin-associated prolongation of the INR, treated
      with simple warfarin withdrawal, is 8% over the ensuing 30 days (8). We believe that
      clinicians would be willing to treat a minimum of 20 patients with oral vitamin K to prevent
      one episode of bleeding, thus the &quot;minimally clinically important difference&quot; that we wish to
      reliably detect is 5% (21;22). This reduction in the risk of bleeding (from 8% in those who
      receive placebo to 3% in those who receive vitamin K) represents about a 60% risk reduction.
      It is reasonable to expect that 1.25 mg of oral vitamin K will produce at least a 60%
      reduction in the risk of bleeding based on the following assumptions: (a) The INR in the
      placebo arm is likely to decline by about one INR point over the first 24 hours while the INR
      in the vitamin K group is likely to decline by about 3.9 INR points. These declines are based
      on the results achieved in our 3 published studies of oral vitamin K (10;12;13). (b) A 2.9
      point reduction in the INR should be associated with a 6 fold reduction in the risk of
      hemorrhage (based on the assumption that a 1 point increase in the INR doubles the risk of
      bleeding (4-7)). (c) The 60 percent risk reduction is a conservative interpretation of the
      effect of a 6 fold decrease in the risk of hemorrhage.

      To accomplish our goal of reliably detecting a 5% reduction in the risk of hemorrhage we will
      need to enrol 330 patients into each arm of the study to have 80% power with a two sided
      alpha of 0.05. This sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions:

      Figure 4: Sample size calculation

      2N = 4(Zα + Z)2 * (1-p)/(pc-pi)2 where Zα = 1.96, Z = 0.84

      pc is the proportion with success in the control group (no bleed) and is equal to 0.92 pi is
      the proportion with success in the intervention group (no bleed) and is equal to 0.97

      and p = (pi + pc)/2

      thus the total sample size is 652

      To accommodate for anticipated losses to follow up (which have been minimal in our previous
      studies) we will increase the sample size by 5% (to 690 patients)

      Sample size determination (cohort study): The sample size for the cohort study is entirely
      one of convenience; since there is no good quality data on the efficacy of oral vitamin K in
      patients with INR values of more than 10.0 we will simply enrol and follow such patients as
      they become available. Data derived from this cohort might then be used as the basis for
      future investigations.

      Study administration:

      Accounting for non-compliance: The sample size has not been adjusted to reflect
      non-compliance. It is unlikely that patients will be non-compliant with a single dose of
      study drug administered at the time of randomization. For example, in our previous studies
      none of the 134 patients receiving oral vitamin K have been non-compliant or lost to
      follow-up.

      Accounting for &quot;loss to follow-up&quot;: We have not previously had patients lost to follow-up in
      our vitamin K studies, and we anticipate the rate in this study will be negligible (i.e. less
      than 5%). The low rate of loss to follow-up is due, in large part, to the fact that (a)
      patients will have only 2 clinic visits over the course of the study (day 1 and 14) and (b)
      all other follow-up will be performed over the telephone, Further, patients receiving
      warfarin are aware of the need for monitoring of their warfarin and thus accept the need for
      periodic medical and laboratory re-assessments. This increases the likelihood that they will
      be willing and able to participate in study follow-up.

      Coordination of the study: The study will be coordinated by the Thromboembolism Research Unit
      at St Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. Data submission to the coordinating centre will
      occur over a secure, web-based database system, which will be supplemented by paper copies of
      the case report forms which will be maintained at each clinical centre. Details of the
      web-based data-entry system are currently being determined; a revised study manual with full
      data entry details will be included in the subsequent versions of this study manual.

      The study will be coordinated by a professional data coordinator, who is based at St Joseph's
      hospital. Data integrity will be ensured by manually reviewing the electronic database for 5%
      of submitted records, and comparing these with copies of the paper CRFs from the relevant
      centres.

      The randomization sequence for all patients will be generated at the coordinating centre; the
      coordinator will remain masked to treatment allocation at all times.

      Provision of study drug: There is no oral form of vitamin K currently marketed in Canada,
      thus our previous investigations have used the intravenous formulation administered by mouth.
      Demonstration that a tablet form is effective would further simplify (and encourage) the use
      of oral vitamin K. A 5 mg vitamin K tablet is available in both Canada and the United States
      (in Canada the drug is available only after Health Canada approval). For this study, a supply
      of the 5 mg vitamin K tablets will be obtained from Merck Frosst Incorporated. Study
      pharmacies will compound this drug to produce matching capsules containing either lactose or
      lactose and 1.25 mg of vitamin K. This pharmacy will also provide drug packaging and will be
      responsible for preparing study drug kits which consist of sequentially numbered drug
      supplies for each clinical centre (following a randomization list provided by the study
      coordinating centre) and a supply of labeled 1.25 mg capsules (for the cohort study). These
      supplies will then be distributed, by the coordinating centre to each participating clinical
      centre.

      Role of the participating investigators: Dr Mark Crowther is the principal applicant and will
      be primarily responsible for all aspects of the study. Drs Ageno and Garcia, in addition to
      fulfilling the roles of co-investigators, will coordinate recruitment and management of
      centres in Italy, and the United States, respectively. Drs Crowther, Ageno and Garcia will
      comprise the executive steering committee which will meet by teleconference at least monthly
      to discuss specific trial implementation and management issues. The steering committee will
      consist of the members of the executive steering committee, as well as the Canadian
      participating investigators (Drs Blostein, Anderson, Wells, Kahn, Ginsberg, Kovacs, Kearon
      and Selby) and Dr Witt from the United States. Telephone Steering Committee meetings will
      occur six monthly, or more frequently as determined by the Principal Investigator. The
      Steering Committee is responsible for the overall conduct of the study, and will act on the
      recommendations of the study's subcommittees.

      Participating centres represented by letters of support on this grant include; Duke
      University (Dr Ortel); University of Washington (Dr Wittkowsky); University of Massachusetts
      (Dr Becker); IRCCS Maggiore Hospital of Milano (Dr Moia); Centro Emostasi e Trombosi Reggio
      Emilia (Dr Silingardi); Instituti Ospitalieri di Cremona (Dr Testa and Alatri); Dr. Siragusa
      (Policlinico Palermo)

      Adjudication committee: An Adjudication Committee of three thromboembolism experts not
      otherwise involved in this study will be convened.All reported hemorrhagic and thrombotic
      events will be reviewed by this committee, which will use all available source documentation
      to adjudicate clinical events. This committee will be convened when complete data are
      available on the first 20 bleeds or clots, and subsequently with each multiple of 20 events.
      To ensure uniformity, all episodes of hemorrhage will be adjudicated according to
      pre-specified criteria. The committee will report the results of their adjudication to the
      Coordinating Centre for inclusion in the study database. Although adjudication of all events
      may seem excessive it is possible that adjudication could &quot;upgrade&quot; events deemed minor by
      the site investigator, highlighting the need for central review of all bleeding events.

      DSMB: An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be constituted. The committee
      will consist of 2 experts who are not otherwise involved in the study. Proposed members are
      Dr Martin O'Donnell (Thromboembolism expert, Henderson Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario) and Dr
      William Geerts (Thromboembolism expert, Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto, Ontario). The number of
      outcome events will be recorded for the cohort study and the randomized trial separately. The
      DSMB will be convened when a total of 20 (or multiples thereof) adjudication-confirmed major
      bleeds or thrombi have occurred in either of the randomized trial or the cohort study. While
      remaining masked to treatment allocation, the DSMB will review the source material describing
      the events. If the DSMB is concerned about the type or number of events, they will have the
      right to ask the steering committee to allow them to contact the study statistician and have
      an unblinded, unplanned, interim analysis for safety performed. Only experienced
      thromboembolism experts have been invited onto this committee, to ensure that such an interim
      analysis is not performed in response to less significant observations. If the interim
      analysis suggests that there is a significant safety concern (for example, if there is
      evidence of excess major bleeding or thrombotic events, as indicated by a P value of less
      than 0.05) the DSMB will have the right to recommend to the Steering Committee that the study
      be closed.

      Analysis plan:

      Primary analysis (Randomized trial): The primary analysis will be a simple comparison of the
      proportion of patients in the placebo and vitamin K arm with adjudication-confirmed bleeding.
      The proportion in each group will be compared using a Chi square or Fisher's exact test, as
      dictated by the number of events.

      Secondary analysis: The proportion of patients in each group with major hemorrhage,
      thrombosis and a composite of all adverse outcomes (thromboembolism, death and major
      hemorrhage) will be performed using a Chi square or Fisher's exact technique, as indicated. A
      regression analysis will be performed to determine if baseline variables including the
      receipt of drug or placebo, demographic characteristics, degree of prolongation of the
      international normalized ratio or other baseline variables predict adverse events. Finally,
      the mean INR values in the two groups will be compared using ANOVA.

      Primary analysis (cohort study): The change in the INR, and the number of bleeds and clots
      will be presented graphically.

      Frequency of analyses (Randomized trial): Three interim analyses are planned. The first will
      occur after 200 patients have been enrolled. In this analysis, the statistician will not be
      aware of treatment allocation; the overall rate of bleeding for the entire population will be
      computed. Assuming balanced allocation, we anticipate the event rate will be 5.7 percent. If
      the observed rate of hemorrhage is more than 2.5 percent above or below 5.7 percent, a
      revised sample size will be calculated. If the revised sample size suggests an unfeasibly
      large study (defined by the need for more than 500 patients per arm), the statistician will
      determine whether limiting enrollment to patients with INR values of more than 6.0 will
      enrich the event rate sufficiently to allow completion of the study with less than 500
      patients per arm. In these analyses, blinding to treatment allocation will be maintained and
      the sample size will be revised assuming a 60 percent reduction in the risk of bleeding in
      the vitamin K arm.

      Second and third interim analyses will be performed after 350 and 500 patients have been
      enrolled. If the sample size is adjusted at the first interim analysis, the second and third
      analyses will be performed after 60% and 75%, respectively, of the required sample size is
      enrolled. For these analyses, the study statistician will be unblinded to treatment
      allocation and the proportion of patients suffering adjudication confirmed major hemorrhage
      will be compared between the two groups. If there is a treatment advantage as measured by a
      two-tailed Chi-square or Fisher's exact test with a P value of less than 0.001 the
      statistician will recommend to the study Steering Committee that the study be stopped. Any
      other result will result in a recommendation to continue this study.

      Frequency of analyses (Cohort study): No interim analyses are planned. The Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB, see below) will be instructed to monitor the frequency of hemorrhage
      in this group. If the upper limit of the 95% CI about the risk of hemorrhage exceeds 5% after
      a minimum of 20 patients have completed the 90 day outcome ascertainment, the DSMB will
      notify the Steering Committee that the risk of hemorrhage in the cohort study is excessive.
      The steering committee will then decide whether this arm of the study should be discontinued
      or the intervention modified.

      Planned subgroup analyses The response to vitamin K or placebo is measured in two ways in
      this study. The first way is by observing the number of clinical events (thrombosis and
      hemorrhage) and the second is by observing changes in the INR values between the day of study
      drug and the next day. The number of clinical events in the study is likely to be relatively
      low, reducing the power of subgroup analyses to determine if baseline variables such as the
      degree of prolongation of the INR influence the response to oral vitamin K. However, since
      changes in the INR value will occur in all patients and since the INR is a continuous
      variable, a subgroup analysis which examines the influence of baseline variables (such as the
      degree of prolongation of the INR) on the response to vitamin K will have more power if
      performed with the change in the INR value as the dependant variable. This analysis will
      include: baseline demographic variables (such as gender, weight, presence of cancer, and
      age), the degree of prolongation of the INR, baseline maintenance warfarin dose and the
      indication for warfarin therapy. The ability of these variables to predict changes in the INR
      in both the vitamin K and placebo groups will be calculated. The ultimate goal of this line
      of investigations is to generate hypotheses about those factors (if any) that influence the
      response to vitamin K. These hypotheses could be tested in future studies within which the
      dose of vitamin K is modified based on the presence or absence of these risk factors.
