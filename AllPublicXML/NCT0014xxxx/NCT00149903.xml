  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of study is to compare the efficacy of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium compared
      to mycophenolate mofetil in Chinese patients (study conducted in China) as measured by the
      incidence of biopsy proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death within six months of
      treatment in de novo renal transplant patients.
