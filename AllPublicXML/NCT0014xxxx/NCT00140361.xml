  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an ongoing monitoring activity of efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which
      is the current national treatment of choice for uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania, and a
      combination of SP and artesunate among children &lt; 5 years in 3 sites in rural Tanzania.

      Protocol was amended in 2004 to (1) include lumefantrine+artemether, the newly identified
      first-line treatment for malaria to be introduced into Tanzania in 2006; (2) on a limited
      basis, include adult patients; (3) extend follow-up to 28 days; (4) investigate whether
      treated bednets would reduce confounding by reinfection
