  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AG-024322 may work in cancer by stopping cancer cells from multiplying. AG-024322 is and
      intravenous drug from a new class of drugs call cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK inhibitors).
      This research study is the first time that AG-024322 will be given to people.

  <detailed_description>

      The study was prematurely discontinued due to the inability of the compound to adequately
      differentiate from other treatment options in the clinical endpoint and necessary product
      profile on April 13, 2007. Safety profile was not the reason that led to the discontinuation
      of the program.
