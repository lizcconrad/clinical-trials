      Aim/Background: This study aims to investigate the necessity and efficacy of a hepatitis B
      virus (HBV) vaccine booster in children after liver transplantation. A universal mass
      vaccination program of HBV was launched for 20 years in Taiwan. The coverage rate is high and
      the effect is great. The carrier rate of the population under vaccine coverage decreased from
      10-15% to &lt; 1%. In Taiwan, most children who receive organ transplantation were vaccinated
      with HBV vaccine in infancy and well before the transplantation procedure. This vaccination
      background information on Taiwanese children is quite unique and not similar to the other
      countries in the world. The antibody generated by the vaccine usually wanes after a certain
      period even in normal subjects, let alone in subjects who receive organ transplantation and
      immunosuppressive agents after transplantation. At present, Taiwan is still an HBV
      hyperendemic area and the risk of exposure to HBV cannot be overlooked. Should children be
      given a booster dose of HBV vaccine after transplantation? And how about the immunogenicity
      of this booster dose in these immunocompromised hosts? If these children cannot obtain an
      adequate antibody titer, will the risk of HBV infection increase? This study is designed to
      answer these questions. As a pediatric hepatologist, the author's routine work is to take
      care of children who underwent liver transplantation. To take advantage of this, the
      investigators decided to study the efficacy and necessity of HBV booster vaccine in these
      patients. However, the results of this study should be able to be applied to any kind of
      solid organ transplanted patients.

      Method: The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) titer will be checked in patients who
      received liver transplantation &gt; 1 year ago. If the titer is &lt; 10 IU/L, a booster dose will
      be administered. The humoral (anti-HBs) and cellular immunity (by ELISPOT to assay T and B
      cell specific proliferation) and cytokine assay will be done in these patients before and
      after the booster dose. A three-year follow-up will be performed to monitor the HBV infection
      in these patients.

      Expected Results: The investigators expect for those who survive one year more after liver
      transplantation to yield a relatively good response to HBV booster under adequate
      immunosuppression.

      The anti-HBs titer will be checked in the patients who received liver transplantation for &gt; 1
      year. If the titer is &lt; 10 IU/L, a booster dose will be administered. The humoral (anti-HBs)
      and cellular immunity (by ELISPOT to assay T and B cell specific proliferation) and cytokine
      assay will be done in these patients before and after the booster dose. A three-year
      follow-up will be performed to monitor the HBV infection in these patients.
