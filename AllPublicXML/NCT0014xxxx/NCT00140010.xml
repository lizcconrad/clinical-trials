      ABSTRACT:

      Delayed ischemic deficits (DID) and strokes caused by low cerebral blood flow (CBF) are major
      sources of poor outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). DID are often
      accompanied by vasospasm and abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation, an important
      reflex involved in the defense against low CBF. Assessment of vasospasm and impaired
      autoregulation can be conveniently measured non-invasively by use of transcranial Doppler
      (TCD) and the transient hyperaemic response test (THRT). Vasospasm and abnormalities in the
      THRT can predict those patients who are at risk of developing DID. In this study, the
      investigators wish to explore the neuroprotective and angiogenic effects of systemic
      erythropoietin (EPO) therapy on vasospasm and autoregulation following SAH, and examine
      whether any improvements translate into reduced incidences of DID and poor outcome. Eighty
      patients with SAH will be recruited over one year to receive three doses in the first week of
      either intravenous epoetin beta 30000 IU or placebo (0.9% saline) 50 ml/30 min as part of a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The investigators propose daily TCD
      assessment for detecting vasospasm and abnormal autoregulation. Outcome measures will examine
      the influence of EPO therapy on the incidence, severity, and duration of vasospasm, abnormal
      autoregulation, and DID.

      PURPOSE:

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the
      potentially beneficial effects of systemic recombinant human erythropoietin therapy (Epoetin
      beta, NeoRecormonÂ®, Roche, 30000IU/50 ml/30 min, three times in the first week) on cerebral
      autoregulation and incidence of delayed ischemic deficits (DID) following aneurysmal
      subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).

      HYPOTHESIS Systemic recombinant human erythropoietin therapy can be used safely following SAH
      to ameliorate vasospasm, improve cerebral autoregulation, reduce DID, and facilitate
      neurological recovery.

      BACKGROUND:

        1. Delayed ischaemia deficits in subarachnoid haemorrhage

           Seven thousand patients suffer SAH each year within the UK with young adults (&lt;55 years)
           being equally affected. Cerebral vasospasm and related cerebral ischemia are the major
           causes of delayed morbidity and mortality in patients who survive the initial SAH
           episode. Previous studies have revealed that immediate low cerebral blood flow (CBF)
           accompanies SAH, particularly in those in coma. However, for better grade patients the
           low CBF is often delayed and associated with cerebral vasospasm [Knuckey 1985].
           Vasospasm often precedes the onset of DID which commonly occurs in the 2nd week after
           SAH [Knuckey 1985]. Autoregulation is the most accomplished reflex mechanism and
           reflects an intrinsic ability of the cerebral vessels to dilate in an attempt to
           maintain constant CBF in the face of poor cerebral perfusion. Following SAH, impairment
           of autoregulation affects prognosis [Lam 2000]. Indeed, daily assessment of
           autoregulation can help to identify patients at high risk of clinical deterioration
           [Smielewski 1997].

           Autoregulation can be conveniently measured non-invasively from the bedside using
           transcranial Doppler (TCD). Direct measures of middle cerebral artery flow velocities
           (FV) are predictive of DID; elevated mean FV (&gt;120cms/sec) and increased ratio of mFV
           between MCA and extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) (Lindegaard ratio &gt;3) being
           associated with cerebral vasospasm and higher incidence of adverse events [Lindegaard
           1988]. The rapid increase of FV with time is also predictive, as is the relationship
           between FV and spontaneous changes in blood pressure (correlation index Mx) [Czosnyka
           2000].

           A more sophisticated measure of abnormal cerebrovascular haemodynamics involves the
           transient hyperaemic response test (THRT) [Giller 1991]. This is used routinely in our
           department where we have demonstrated a relationship between an abnormal THRT and
           clinical outcome following SAH [Lam 2000]. The THRT assesses the FV response to a manual
           carotid compression (Figure 1) and can be repeated within a few minutes providing a
           reliable and readily accessible method for assessing autoregulation. When THRT is used
           for day-to-day assessments for the same patient, this test can provide a valuable
           monitor of sequential changes in autoregulation.

        2. Autoregulation after SAH

           Autoregulation is often impaired after SAH, even in patients presenting in good clinical
           grade [Voldby 1985]. An abnormal THRT response commonly develops either early during
           days 0 to 3 (primary), or late around days 7 to 14 (secondary) after the initial bleed.
           Primary abnormalities in THRT are far more common in poor grade patients, while
           secondary abnormalities occur more regularly in the initially good grade patients who
           later develop signs of DID with clinical deterioration [Ratsep 2002]. Routine and daily
           assessment of autoregulation with TCD helps to identify patients at higher risk for DID.
           This delay in the evolution of an abnormal autoregulation response in better grade
           patients presents an opportunity to introduce early therapeutic strategies designed to
           offset the potentially harmful effects. Indeed, routine use of plasma expansion is
           already adopted with this aim in mind [Origitano 1990].

        3. Therapeutic opportunity; why recombinant human erythropoietin?

      Recently attention has been focused on potential therapeutic roles for endogenous brain
      proteins possessing neuroprotective properties. This neuroprotective approach of using
      erythropoietin (EPO) is aimed at protecting potentially viable brain tissue from apoptosis
      [Ehrenreich 2002]. EPO, a 34-kDa hydrophobic sialoglycoprotein, is responsible for the
      survival, proliferation, and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitor cells. It is
      produced by foetal liver and adult kidney, which is accelerated during hypoxia [Lacombe
      1999]. Because there is no pre-formed EPO storage, therefore, the control of EPO gene
      transcription involves complex interactions with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a
      transcription factor which is activated during hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, and seizures [Lacombe
      1999].

      EPO receptor (EPO-R), like other members of the haematopoietic receptor family, does not
      possess an endogenous tyrosine kinase activity. However, its close association with Jak2
      tyrosine kinase can induce a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of proteins [Lacombe
      1999]. Hypoxia can induce an increased EPO-R expression, which in turn causes increased
      sensitivity to EPO [Chin 2000].

      Both EPO and EPO-R are ubiquitously distributed in neural tissues [Digicaylioglu 1995].
      Except larger vessels, EPO-R is abundantly distributed in astrocytes, neurons, and cerebral
      capillary endothelia [Marti 1996, Yamaji 1996, Bernaudin 1999, Brines 2000].
      Immunohistochemistry shows that these distributions of EPO-R are consistent with the
      anatomical location of blood-brain barrier (BBB) [Brines 2000]. Such a condensed distribution
      of EPO-R within and surrounding the cerebral capillaries implies that a small amount of EPO
      is sufficient to mediate physiological function in the central nervous system [Chin 2000].
      The increased production of EPO in response to hypoxia and anemia by astrocytes and neurons
      corresponds to that which occurs in kidney and liver [Masuda 1994]. Thus, during hypoxia, EPO
      acts directly on cerebral capillary endothelial cells as an angiogenic factor through a
      paracrine mechanism from the astrocytes and an endocrine mechanism from the kidney
      [Digicaylioglu 1995].

      EPO protects nervous tissue under any conditions characterised by a relative deficiency of
      ATP [Brine 2000]. This neuroprotective effect is achieved by several mechanisms.

        1. EPO can induce expression of several glycolytic enzymes, which re-directs energy
           metabolism toward favouring survival during oxygen deprivation [Digicaylioglu 1995].

        2. During cerebral ischemia, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate
           toxicity is the major cause of neuron death [Morishita 1997]. Glutamate toxicity is in
           part mediated by nitric oxide (NO). EPO up-regulates the expression of antioxidant
           enzymes on a transcriptional level in vascular smooth muscle cells [Kusano 1999], and
           can potentially protect neurons from NO-generating agents [Sakanaka 1998]. Furthermore,
           EPO can suppress the increase in Ca2+ concentration induced by glutamate and the nitric
           oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis [Morishita 1997].

      EPO has been shown to provide neurotrophic [Konishi 1993] and angiogenic effects [Yamaji
      1996], and it has the potential for neural regeneration [Siren 2001]. These effects are
      dose-dependent and unrelated to the nerve growth factor (NGF) [Konoshi Y 1993]. The
      distributions of EPO and EPO-R correspond to the sequence of histopathological changes of
      cerebral ischemia/infarction. In acute hypoxia (cardiac arrest), strong immunoreactivity of
      EPO can be found in vascular endothelium, while the EPOR is expressed strongly in neurons
      [Siren 2001]. After cerebral ischemia, EPO plays an important role in angiogenesis and glial
      reaction. EPO immunoreactivity appears in the endothelium, intravascular inflammatory cells
      and neurons of the penumbra. Also EPO-R is expressed in neurons, astrocytes and endothelial
      cells [Bernaudin 1999, Siren 2001]. Because the expression of EPO-R precedes the
      up-regulation of EPO synthesis [Bernaudin 1999], the sensitivity to EPO increases [Chin
      2000]. In contrast, these changes are not detectable in non-ischemic cortex [Bernaudin 1999],
      indicating an increased potential for EPO to act where neurons are at risk [Siren 2001]. By
      protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis, EPO can increase cerebral blood flow, improve
      microcirculation of the penumbra, and improve tissue oxygenation by angiogenesis, thus
      significantly reduce the infarct volume [Bernaudin 1999, Siren 2001]. This angiogenesis
      corresponds to the finding that under hypoxic conditions such as exposure to high altitudes,
      the brain increases the mean microvascular density [Lamanna JC 1992]. In old infarcts, EPO
      and EPO-R are strongly expressed in reactive astrocytes. Thus the EPO system may participate
      in the repair process [Siren 2001]. The persistent up-regulation of EPO production by
      astrocytes after stroke also provides rapidly available sources of EPO to make neurons more
      tolerate ischemia [Siren 2001]. These endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms are insufficient
      to cope with acute injuries, as severe ischemic insult can exhaust the EPO/EPO-R
      neuroprotective capacity of the brain or the latency of de novo synthesis is too long.
      Clinical application of EPO should be administered rapidly to provide additional
      neuroprotection [Brines 2000].

      Epoetin beta is a 165-aa glycoprotein manufactured by using recombinant DNA technology, which
      contains the identical amino acid sequence of isolated human EPO and possesses the same
      biological activity. It is similar to the endogenous EPO except for minor differences in the
      pattern of 4 carbohydrate chains. [Brine 2000] The recombinant human EPO has been widely used
      for treating anaemia associated with chronic renal insufficiency, HIV infection, cancer, and
      surgery, and has an excellent safety record in wide clinical practice.

      4. Why 90,000 IU Epoetin beta?

      The safety and efficacy of epoetin beta for treating acute stroke (within 8 hours) in humans
      have been confirmed in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which
      uses high dose intravenous epoetin beta (3,3000 IU/50 ml/30min/day, three days, with a
      cumulative dose 100,000IU) [Ehrenreich 2002]. No associated changes in blood pressure,
      haematocrit, haemoglobin, and red blood cell count are found in this trial [Ehrenreich 2002].
      Only the reticulocyte count increases 29.2 Â±10.0% on the 4th day after the last dose of EPO
      [Ehrenreich 2002]. This systemic administration of EPO also has led to a 60- to 100-fold
      increase in CSF levels and does not require a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
      [Ehrenreich 2002]. Patients who are treated with EPO have a lower and earlier surge of serum
      S100 (secreted by reactive astrocytes and functional disturbances of membrane integrity of
      brain cell membrane) and thereafter return to within the normal limits sooner than the
      placebo [Ehrenreich 2002]. This earlier return of serum S100 towards the normal level implies
      that the inflammatory processes and/or BBB integrity can be improved more rapidly by systemic
      EPO therapy [Ehrenreich 2002]. The beneficial effects on stroke patients continue throughout
      30 days, particularly for those with moderate to severe strokes [Ehrenreich 2002].

      By activation of endothelial EPO receptors, the circulating EPO may appose inflammatory
      pathways in cerebral arteries and attenuate vasospasm induced by SAH. In vivo studies have
      found that systemic administration of EPO (i.p. 1000units/kg) immediately after SAH can
      improve survival and motor functions [Buemi 2000]. The systemic delivery of EPO has the
      advantage that it is universally available to the capillary endothelium in the whole brain,
      in contrast to intraventricular injection, which is highly localized and not practical in
      clinical settings [Brines 2000]. Because the concentration of EPO in CSF is independent of
      the serum level and the extent of BBB disruption in patients suffering from aneurysmal SAH,
      the EPO in CSF is predominantly produced by the brain in order to match its need [Springborg
      2003]. Therefore, an early activation of endothelial EPO-R may be a potential therapeutic
      strategy, which in fact has been proved by a reduction of S100 protein in CSF (a marker of
      brain damage) and restoration of cerebral autoregulation (for at least 48 hours) after
      systemic administration of recombinant human EPO [Springborg 2002]. Therefore, 90,000 Iuof
      epoetin beta will be use to achieve the maximal effects on CBF and autoregulation in these
      SAH patients to be studied.

      QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED:

      We wish to address the following hypotheses for SAH patients:

        1. Systemic treatment with epoetin beta (90,000IU) is safe following SAH

        2. Systemic treatment with epoetin beta reduces the incidence of abnormal FV and cerebral
           autoregulation following SAH.

        3. Systemic treatment with epoetin beta reduces the incidence of acute neurological
           deterioration following SAH If primary endpoints are improved with epoetin beta therapy,
           the data will be used to formulate the power calculation for design of a Phase III
           clinical outcome study. However, we will assess clinical outcome at the end of the trial
           and at discharge to detect any indication of adverse effect after EPO therapy.

      Randomisation procedure:

      Following informed consent, patients with angiography-positive aneurismal SAH will be
      randomised to receive either intravenous epoetin beta 30,000IU or placebo (0.9% saline)
      50ml/30min, three times in the first week after SAH (total dose 90,000IU). The number in each
      group will be 40. For blinding, the Pharmacy Manufacture Unit (PMU) will prepare and number
      identical vials containing either saline (0.9% NaCl) or epoetin beta reconstituted in saline.
      The vials will be randomly assigned to patients upon enrollment with the contents of each
      vial known only by the PMU. Trial medication will be started as soon as possible within 72
      hours of the ictus. As approximately 70% of aneurysms will be treated with open clipping, and
      the remainder with endovascular coils, we do not consider the method of treatment to
      represent a contaminating factor, but it will be included in the final analysis. Location,
      size, and morphology of the culprit aneurysm are not believed to affect outcome in our
      institution.

      Following randomisation and start of trial therapy the clinical management of each patient
      will be as routine. Arterial blood pressure will be continuously monitored (Finapress, or via
      radial arterial line).

      Safety:

      The full blood cell count, reticulocyte count, blood viscosity, coagulation profile, serum
      biochemistry, serum iron levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP) at the time of admission will
      be checked as clinical routine. Although EPO has effects of erythropoiesis and
      thrombopoiesis, associated deterioration or adverse events have not been observed in
      short-term treatment [Ehrenreich 2002]. However, in the face of any abnormalities the trial
      drug will be stopped and the safety committee informed. A safety committee (chaired by Dr Ken
      Smith, Consultant nephrologist) will review the safety data at monthly intervals or, if
      concerns arise, on a patient-by-patient basis.

      Primary outcome measures: Vasospasm and abnormalities in AR:

      Trial patients will be examined daily with TCD (DWL, Germany) using a 2-MHz probe mounted on
      a purposed head frame for two weeks since SAH ictus. The systolic, diastolic, and mean FV
      will be recorded (trans-temporal) by a single user (MT). Vasospasm will be defined as mean FV
      &gt; 120 cm/sec and Lindegaard ratio &gt;3 [Lindegaard 1988]. The regression index (Mx) between
      mean FV and spontaneous changes in ABP will be calculated. Two carotid compressions lasting 5
      seconds will be performed. The criteria for an acceptable THRT includes a sudden decrease in
      middle cerebral artery FV at the onset of compression, a stable TCD signal during
      compression, and a minimum of 30% decrease in FV with no blood pressure instability
      [Smielewski 1997]. The THRT ratio (THRR) is calculated using the formula: THRR = FVs
      (hyperaemia) / FVs(baseline), where FVs denotes systolic FV (Figure 1). THRR is classified as
      normal (â¥l.10) or impaired (&lt;1.10), and will be repeated 2 minutes later. The average value
      of the two tests will be recorded. Quality issues concerning the THRT response have been
      extensively evaluated in this laboratory [Smielewski 1997].

      Secondary endpoint measures: Development of DID:

      The clinical progress of each patient will be monitored daily. The development of a focal
      neurological deficit and/or a drop in the Glasgow Coma Scale by 2 points or more following
      vasospasm will be the criteria adopted to define an episode of DID [Pickard 1989]. Other
      factors which can affect consciousness, including systemic infection and infection of central
      nervous system, will be recorded for final analysis. Clinical outcomes will be assessed at
      the end of the trial and at the time of discharge. Durations of hospitalisation and NCCU stay
      will be observed.

      Statistical Analysis:

      The analysis will be performed by using statistical software, STATA (Texas, USA). Data will
      be expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation. The multivariate analysis will be performed on the
      timings of vasospasm and abnormal AR, which will be computed as the number of days between
      the date of diagnosis of SAH and the date of the first detection of vasospasm and abnormal
      autoregulation in respect of variables likely to influence their occurrence: age, WFNS grade,
      Fisher's grade on CT scans, and treatment procedures, intraventricular haemorrhage and/or
      hydrocephalus by using the Cox Proportional Hazards regression. The measure of outcome will
      be the hazards ratio (HR), which expresses the probability of vasospasm or abnormal
      autoregulation for a specific category relative to the placebo group. Variables associated
      with EPO treatment (haematocrits, erythrocyte counts, reticulocyte counts, thrombocyte
      counts, serum iron levels, and viscosity) will be collected. The improvement in fit due to
      each variable will be tested for statistical significance at the 5% level with the likelihood
      ratio test. The test for departure from a linear trend (one degree of freedom) was used to
      assess the potential linear trend in certain categorical variables. Daily results from each
      patient will also be averaged to produce a patient-oriented database to satisfy the
      independence assumption for linear regression. The day-to-day variations in parameters will
      be calculated as the standard deviation divided by the average value from all examinations in
      each patient.

      Power analysis:

      Our previous observations indicate that vasospasm and abnormal THRT occur in 64% and 90% SAH
      of patients respectively. To demonstrate a 50% reduction in duration of vasospasm or abnormal
      autoregulation with a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% we will require
      examinations from 80 patients. This number of patients also has an 83% chance of
      demonstrating a 50% reduction in the incidence of clinical DID in the first 2 weeks following
      the ictus. The study is not powered to show a reduction in clinical endpoints although trends
      will be sought to identify any potential adverse effects.

      DETAILS OF ANY DIFFICULTIES THAT CAN BE FORESEEN

        1. Patient recruitment:

           The Neurosurgical Unit at Addenbrookes treats 80 aneurysmal SAH patients per annum.
           Previous studies in our unit have shown high ascertainment, and we were the largest
           contributor to the International Hypothermia for Aneurysm Surgery Trial (IHAST). We do
           not foresee difficulties with recruitment.

        2. Safety issues:

           The safety and efficacy of using high dose intravenous epoetin beta (100,000IU) for
           treating human acute stroke (within 8 hours) have been confirmed [Ehrenreich 2002]. The
           therapeutic margin of EPO is very wide. Even at very high serum levels no adverse
           effects have been observed [NeoRecormon information sheet, Roche].

        3. Assessment of AR using TCD:

      Quality control for THRT assessment has been vigorously addressed, failure to complete the
      test is rare [Ratsep 2002]. The incidence of significant carotid atherosclerotic disease
      precluding safe carotid compression is less than 1% [Lam 2000]. The test is well tolerated
      and we know of no patient who requested to withdraw from the investigation in previous
      studies due to discomfort etc.

      FUTURE RESEARCH

      Results from this phase II study will be used to design a phase III clinical outcome trial
      using the Spontaneous Intracranial Haemorrhage Group mechanism. Any potential benefits may
      extrapolate to other cerebrovascular conditions where low CBF states and loss of
      autoregulation occur (e.g. acute cerebral vasculitis).
