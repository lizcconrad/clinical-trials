  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morphea is very hard to treat. In a small number of adult patients, Imiquimod has proven to
      be beneficial in decreasing the thickness of the morphea plaques , while improving their
      appearance. There are no studies to date proving its safety and efficacy in children with
      this disease. We propose to conduct a pilot study to assess to potential efficacy and
      relative safety of Imiquimod in children with plaque morphea.

      Design: Prospective, open label, pilot study

      Settings: The Hospital for Sick Children, Specialized Morphea Clinic

      Study population:

        -  Children 6-18 years of age

        -  Plaque morphea measuring less than 10 cm2 in diameter ( for children with multiple
           lesions, only one will be treated)

      Intervention: Topical imiquimod applied 3-5 times a week for 6 months

      Outcome measures: Decrease in the thickness of the skin by clinical scores and
      ultrasonography

      Duration of the study: 12 months ( 2 baseline visits, 1 intervention visit, 5 follow-up
      visits)

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test

          -  Signed consent/assent form

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Children who received topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus, vitamin D derivatives

          -  Children with evidence of skin breakdown on the proposed area to be treated at the
             time of enrollment due to potential increased absorption of the medication through
             impaired skin barrier

             control methods for the duration of the study
