      This study evaluates a cancer vaccine in melanoma patients who have resected melanoma but are
      at high risk for recurrence (stages IIB-III). This is a single arm, open label, pilot/phase I
      study evaluating safety and immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 protein vaccination with Imiquimod as
      an adjuvant.

      Imiquimod is a FDA approved immune response modifier for the treatment of HPV associated
      genital warts (but used for a different indication here) and has been shown to attract and
      mature dendritic cells in areas of topical application. This will be utilized in this
      application to inject a protein vaccine into this site, to prime and boost anti-NY-ESO-1
      immune responses.

      9 patients will be treated to receive 4 vaccination cycles, 21 days apart. Each vaccination
      cycle consists of topical application of Imiquimod 250mg to healthy skin of extremities for
      the first five days of each cycle and intradermal injection of NY-ESO-1 protein 100mcg to the
      pretreated area on day 3.

      Immunization will be assessed by T-cell assays, NY-ESO-1 specific antibody titers, and
      evaluation of 3 small skin biopsies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, resected AJCC Stage IIB, IIC or III malignant melanoma

          -  Fully recovered from surgery

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy (including interferon), or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
             prior to first dosing of study agent.

          -  Prior treatment with NY-ESO-1 vaccines.

          -  Known HIV infection or autoimmune disease (RA, SLE). Patients with vitiligo or
             melanoma-associated hypopigmentation are not excluded.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to imiquimod or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using a medically acceptable means of
             contraception.

          -  Patients with known history of inflammatory skin disorders, as imiquimod might
             exacerbate these conditions.

          -  Patients who receive chronic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies.

          -  Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessments.
