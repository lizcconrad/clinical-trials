  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate efficacy and tolerability of lozenges containing
      20 mg a mbroxol hydrochloride (Mucoangin?) relative to lozenges containing placebo and
      lozenges containing 3 mg benzocaine in relieving pain of sore throat in patients suffering
      from acute viral pharyngitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled parallel group study in
      adult pat ients, suffering from acute viral pharyngitis and throat pain of at least moderate
      intensity.

      The whole study will last for up to 4 days, on each of test days patients will take one
      lozenge cont aining Ambroxol hydrochlorid 20 mg/ or placebo/ or benzocaine lozenge 3 mg up to
      6 lozenges per day.

      Using Patient Diaries the assessment of tolerability and efficacy by the patient will be
      obtained.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is the test of superiority of ambroxol 20 mg in
      comparison to placebo. If and only if the corresponding test of superiority to placebo is
      statistically significant, the hypothesis of non-inferiority of am broxol 20 mg in comparison
      to benzocaine 3 mg will be tested.

      Comparison(s):

      For the primary comparison the placebo lozenges will be used, for the secondary comparison
      the benzocaine 3 mg lozenges will be used.

          3. The throat pain intensity is rated at least moderate on the VRS (PI).

          4. Written Informed Consent is given by the patient.

          5. Compliance by the patient seems guaranteed, and patient seems to be able to understand
             and complete the patient diary.

          6. Patient able to remain at the doctor's practice for the initial 3 hours follo wing the

                  practicing an acceptable method throughout the study. Acceptable methods of birth
                  control include surgical sterilisation, intra uterine device, oral, implan table,
                  injectable contraceptives or double-barrier method.

          2. Patients with symptoms of primarily bacterial pharyngitis or bacterial secon dary
             infection (clinical findings inter alia assessment of exudate).

          3. First indication of symptoms of acute pharyngitis (e.g. sore throat) occurre d more
             than 3 days ago.

          4. Patients who suffered from acute viral or bacterial pharyngitis in the past 4 weeks.

          5. Patient who in the past week, or during the study will require treatment with the
             following: antibiotics steroids for oral, inhaling or topical application expectorants
             or antitussives. No physical therapy (e.g. throat compress, throa t rinsing) may be
             applied during the trial. Patients who have used analgesics or anti-inflammatory
             agents less than two half-lives of the applicable drug before study entry, or who will
