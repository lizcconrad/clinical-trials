    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how obesity and weight loss following bariatric
      surgery affect reproductive function. The study is particularly interested in how changes in
      hormones (those produced in the stomach and fat tissue) following weight loss affect
      reproductive function. Specifically, we, the researchers at Penn State University, propose to
      characterize reproductive abnormalities in morbidly obese men and women. We hypothesize that
      morbid obesity leads to reproductive abnormalities in men and women. We plan to examine the
      short-term effects of alteration in GI hormones after bariatric surgery on reproductive
      function. We hypothesize that bariatric surgery radically alters GI hormone expression,
      resulting in immediate changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in men and women.
      Lastly, we, the researchers, plan to examine the long-term effects of weight loss and changes
      in adipokines on reproductive function. We hypothesize that the changes in adipokine levels
      resulting from fat mass reduction lead to substantial long-term improvements in reproductive
      function and fertility. We also hypothesize that there are sexual dimorphisms in adipokine
      levels following weight loss, with women experiencing larger changes than men.

      Obesity may influence female reproduction through a variety of mechanisms including:
      suppressing ovulation; inhibiting ovarian follicular development; and altering endometrial
      development and implantation. In males, obesity may impair reproductive function by several
      mechanisms including: decreasing libido, causing erectile dysfunction, influencing semen
      composition, or sperm function. Therefore the long term goal of the current project is to
      understand the impact of severe obesity on reproductive function and how this is influenced
      by dramatic weight loss.
