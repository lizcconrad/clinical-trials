  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INTRINSIC RV is a two-armed randomized trial that will compare the effects of innovative
      dual-chamber pacing with AV Search Hysteresis to standard VVI among ICD patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to assess whether AVSH will provide benefits of a dual-chamber ICD
      without the deleterious effects of unnecessary RV pacing. This study will aim to demonstrate
      that DDDR-AVSH is equal to VVI with respect to mortality and HF hospitalizations.
