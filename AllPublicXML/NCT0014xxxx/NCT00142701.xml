      BACKGROUND:

      The overall goal of this study was to test a practical, theory-based intervention to achieve
      long-term behavior change for women with Type 2 diabetes at high risk for developing coronary
      heart disease (CHD). Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that diabetes is associated
      with increased risk for CHD that is greater in women than in men. CHD is a major cause of
      death and functional limitations in women, but the vast majority of CHD studies have
      primarily involved middle-aged men. There is convincing research evidence that healthy
      lifestyle behaviors, including low-fat diet, physical activity, stress management, smoking
      cessation, and social support, can reduce CHD risk

      The study was initiated in response to a Request for Applications released in October 1997 by
      the National Institutes of Health Office of the Director on &quot;Innovative Approaches to Disease
      Prevention Through Behavior Change.&quot;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study was a randomized trial to compare short-term (6-month) outcomes in women receiving
      usual care compared to a modified Ornish-type comprehensive lifestyle management (CLM)
      intervention. Participants (N = 279) were randomized to usual care (UC) or Mediterranean
      Lifestyle Program, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at the behavioral risk factors
      (eating patterns, physical activity, stress management, and social support) affecting risk
      for CHD in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. After 6 months, women in the CLM
      condition were randomized to one of two approaches for providing support either lay-led group
      support or personalized computer-based support - to evaluate these strategies in enhancing
      longer-term maintenance of effects. Outcomes included multiple CHD lifestyle behaviors (e.g.,
      dietary intake, exercise levels, stress management, smoking cessation), physiological risk
      factors associated with CHD (e.g., serum lipids, hypertension, weight, vascular reactivity),
      HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin, a measure of diabetes), and quality of life (e.g., depression,
      functioning).
