  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of three maintenance regimens (topical
      tazarotene, oral minocycline, or both) in sustaining improvement in acne.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many years antibiotic therapy has been the backbone of therapy for inflammatory acne.
      However, topical retinoids also offer efficacy against inflammatory acne and the combination
      of a topical retinoid and an antibiotic can result in faster and more complete clearing of
      inflammatory lesions than either drug alone.

      The reduced sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes to antibiotics is a growing problem.
      Resistance is a major issue not only because it can result in treatment failure but also
      because of concerns that it may potentially be transferred to other bacteria that anti-acne
      antibiotics are used used against. One of the most important factors predisposing to the
      development of resistant strains of propionibacterium acnes is the prolonged use of
      antibiotics. Therefore, in order to help minimize the development for such resistance, it is
      evident that maintenance strategies for acne should aim to minimize the long-term use of
      antibiotics.

      Topical retinoids are a rational choice for maintenance therapy due to their activity on
      microcomedones (the precursor for all acne lesions). Nevertheless, there is a paucity of data
      evaluating this use in a maintenance setting. The aim of this study was to determine whether
      patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne who have achieved a good level of
      clearance (eg&gt;/= 75%) can maintain the improvement in their acne using maintenance therapy.
      THe study compared the efficacy of three maintenance therapies (topical tazarotene, oral
      minocycline, and topical tazarotene plus oral minocycline) in sustaining the clinical
      improvement attained after initial topical tazarotene plus oral minocycline therapy.
