      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new test for osteoporosis can be useful in
      monitoring treatment. We are studying a new method for examining the quality of bone by an
      experimental method of computerized analysis of radiographic images (x-ray pictures) of the
      heel.

      The study proposed in this application is a part of a larger project entitled &quot;Clinical
      utility of radiographic texture analysis in diagnosing and treating osteoporosis&quot;. The
      overall goal of the larger project is to determine whether computerized texture analysis of
      digitized high-resolution images of trabecular bone (texture analysis) improves our ability
      to diagnose bone fragility and follow natural history and/or response to pharmacological
      therapy of osteoporosis. In the CRC study proposed here we plan to examine changes in the
      results of texture analysis during two years of pharmacological therapy for osteoporosis.

      Role of densitometry in osteoporosis:

      Measurement of bone mineral density is the principal diagnostic method used in clinical
      practice and in research studies, both to identify patients who have the disease and to
      follow their response to therapeutic agents. The technique used most widely is dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which has advantages of low cost and radiation exposure, and high
      precision and accuracy of 1-2% and 4-8%, respectively [1, 2]. Based on the association
      between the low BMD and increased risk of fracture [3], BMD-based treatment guidelines have
      been developed [4]. There is, however, a considerable overlap between BMD of patients who
      sustain fragility fractures and those who do not [5-9]. The problem arises because the
      fragility is determined not only by the quantity of the bone (measured as bone density), but
      also by its &quot;quality&quot; which is believed to be related to the preservation of the normal
      trabecular pattern [10]. Bone quality is not specifically assessed using current diagnostic
      methods. Information about bone quality, however, would be of substantial clinical and
      scientific value, as it would complement the BMD measurement when selecting patients for
      therapy and when studying bone loss or assessing effects of therapeutic agents.

      Texture analysis:

      A novel approach to noninvasive and practical assessment of bone structure is to analyze the
      texture of high resolution radiographs of trabecular bone [11]. Dr. Giger, Professor of
      Radiology and a co-investigator on this application, has developed a method for
      characterizing bone structure by computerized texture analysis of digitized high-resolution
      radiographs [12-16]. In this approach, the texture is analyzed in several ways, including
      Fourier based analysis, which yields root mean square (RMS) as a measure of magnitude of
      trabecular bone texture pattern, and the first moment of power spectrum (FMP) which
      characterizes the texture pattern's frequency [13, 15, 16]; and Minkowski dimension fractal
      analysis [17-20]. Radiographic texture analysis has been studied in vivo, on lumbar spine
      radiographs and found to predict presence of vertebral fractures elsewhere in the spine more
      reliably than did the BMD of the spine [13, 14]. In addition, in an in vitro study texture
      features as well as BMD were analyzed in femoral neck specimens obtained during surgical hip
      replacement. Mechanical loading (crush test) was then performed on cubes of trabecular bone
      machined from these specimens to determine their bone strength. It was found that the
      combination of BMD and texture analysis predicted bone strength better than BMD alone [12,
      15, 16].

      Biochemical markers of bone turnover:

      In studies of osteoporosis, the bone mass is assessed by measuring BMD while the metabolic
      activity of the bone is assessed by measuring the biochemical markers of bone turnover [21].
      These markers have limited utility in individual patients because they have high
      within-person variability (low precision), and because it is not clear which markers are
      useful in which clinical situation [21, 22]. In contrast, comparing biochemical markers
      between groups of patients in clinical studies has been found to be useful in two settings.
      Firstly, it has been found that high levels of biochemical markers of bone resorption predict
      fractures independent of BMD [23, 24]. Secondly, early changes in bone markers (at 3-6
      months) during anti-resorptive therapy predict later changes in BMD and fracture rates
      [25-28]. The mechanisms underlying these observations have not been elucidated to date. It is
      speculated that increased bone resorption, which is reflected in elevation of biochemical
      markers of bone turnover, increases fragility by weakening trabecular structure prior to or
      independent of measurable BMD changes. Similarly, decreased bone resorption during
      pharmacological therapy is likely to improve the trabecular structure before or independent
      of its effects on BMD. Since the aim of our research is to (indirectly) examine the
      trabecular structure by performing the radiographic texture analysis, we plan to determine
      whether the changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover during antiresorptive therapy
      will correlate with changes in the results of texture analysis.

      Rationale for the study:

      Anti-resorptive therapy reduces bone fragility and increases bone density. It is likely that
      the trabecular structure of the bone also changes during treatment. Peripheral densitometry
      has not been used so far to monitor response to therapy. If the combination of texture
      analysis and peripheral BMD change reproducibly during treatment it may be possible to employ
      this combination to monitor therapeutic response. In so doing, one could avoid the need to
      use the central densitometry and biochemical markers of bone turnover since the former is
      cumbersome while the latter suffers from low precision.

      Potential advantages of using a portable peripheral densitometer: The texture analyses
      described above were developed for high-resolution radiographs, which were digitized and
      subjected to computer analysis. The new DXA imaging systems such as GE/Lunar PIXI which will
      be used in our research, provide digital images with resolution sufficient for computerized
      texture analysis (200 micron pixels). Furthermore, PIXI can generate the image in a shorter
      time (seconds vs. minutes) and at a fraction of radiation dose of conventional radiographs.
      Finally, since this is a portable densitometer, the methodology developed in this proposal
      has the potential to be widely applicable to large segments of the population, including
      frail elderly who have limited mobility and high prevalence of osteoporosis.

      Future Directions:

      If we find in this preliminary study that texture features change during antiresorptive
      therapy, future studies will be designed to examine these changes more precisely. With the
      results of the present study we will know what magnitude of change in texture analysis to
      expect during therapy and will be able to accurately calculate the sample size to further
      study these changes. Most interestingly, however, we will be to compare texture analysis
      during therapies with different pharmacological agents. Specifically, comparing an anabolic
      agent such as PTH to antiresorptive therapies such as biphosphonates and estrogen may provide
      important information about the mechanism of action and timing of effects on the bone
      structure for different agents.

      Another direction for further research will be to test whether the combination of BMD and
      texture analysis both from a portable instrument could be used to monitor therapy,
      particularly in a primary care setting or in long-term care institutions. To test this, we
      will conduct studies which will compare the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of approach where
      decisions regarding treatment changes are based on BMD and texture analysis from a portable
      instrument and the conventional approach based on periodic monitoring by central densitometry
      with or without use of the biochemical markers of bone turnover.

      STUDY PROCEDURES

      The studies will be performed in the outpatient facility of the University of Chicago GCRC.
      Every 3 months for the first 6 months and every 6 months for the reminder of 2 years, the
      subjects will come in the morning in the fasting state, provide a urine sample (second
      morning void) and blood sample for measurement of biochemical markers of bone turnover.
      Height and weight will be recorded at each visit, and any change in health status, including
      fractures ascertained. We will also assess other factors known to influence bone turnover,
      such as diet and physical activity. Every 12 months, the subjects will fill out Block food
      frequency questionnaire from Berkley Nutrition Services [29]. In addition, every 6 months
      they will fill out a calcium intake questionnaire (included in Appendix), which will be
      analyzed by the CRC nutritionist and a short physical activity questionnaire, which was used
      in PEPI trial [30] for assessment of physical activity. Medication compliance will be
      assessed by questioning the patients and counting the number of calcium and alendronate
      tablets remaining from the previous visit.

      After these tests are completed, the subjects will go to the densitometry suite of the
      Endocrinology clinic where BMD will be measured and heel images obtained for texture
      analysis. The left heel will be scanned twice using the PIXI densitometer (GE/Lunar
      corporation) for measurement of BMD of the heel and texture analysis. (If there is a
      deformity of the left heel, right heel will be used for all examinations.) In addition, every
      6 months, BMD of the lumbar spine and proximal femur will be measured using the central
      densitometer Prodigy (GE/Lunar corporation). The same instrument will be used for lateral
      vertebral assessment (a method used for detecting vertebral deformities on images of the
      lateral spine from the densitometer), which will be performed every 12 months.
