  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad purpose of this project, proposed by investigators at the University of Alabama at
      Birmingham and the State of Alabama Department of Public Health, is to use a behaviorally
      focused education that has been proven effective to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of
      the contact investigation process. The behaviorally focused intervention will focus on
      enabling public health workers to understand and implement a recently published model of TB
      transmission.

      BACKGROUND:

      Investigation of contacts of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is an important
      epidemiological tool in TB control. Unfortunately, due to budgetary and resource constraints,
      many health departments struggle to fulfill their responsibility of TB control through
      contact investigation.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Primary outcome The primary outcome of this project is to examine the clinical effectiveness
      of the TB transmission model. This will be done by examining the sensitivity and specificity
      of the model when used in a field application.

      Key secondary outcomes Evaluation of the efficiency of contact investigation (two outcomes:
      1) weekly average time to tuberculin skin test placement for high risk contacts, 2) weekly
      average time to the close of the contact investigation.) Qualitative assessment of
      individuals who are incorrectly predicted by the model to have a negative tuberculin skin
      test
