  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if nebivolol is superior to placebo for the
      treatment of elevated blood pressure in Black patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a Phase II, 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study of nebivolol over a range of doses in Black patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension. Treatment was administered once daily (qd) for 12 weeks. The study
      consisted of 2 phases: (1) screening/washout/single-blind placebo run-in and (2)
      randomization/treatment. Patients had 7 scheduled clinic visits during the study (6 clinic
      visits for patients not on current antihypertensive medication).
