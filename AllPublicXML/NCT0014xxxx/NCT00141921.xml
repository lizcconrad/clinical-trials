    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>264 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse events is any AE that
is fatal
is life threatening
requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
other significant medical hazard. The severity assessment for adverse events and infections (except injection site reactions) was done using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0, where Grade 3 indicates a severe toxicity (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).
An infectious event is an event that was considered by the investigator to be an infectious episode. An injection site reaction is a reaction at the site of the subcutaneous injection, commonly characterized, but not limited to symptoms of erythema (redness, usually raised), pruritis (itching), swelling, or pain that is persistent for 4 hours or longer.</description>

    <measure>Exposure-adjusted Adverse Event Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>264 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The exposure adjusted event rate for a given event in a given time period is defined as the number of events reported in the given time period divided by total patient-years on investigational product during the period.
Exposure-adjusted event rate per 100 patient years = total number of events / patient years * 100.
Multiple occurrences of the same event for a participant were counted as multiple events.</description>

    <description>The severity assessment for adverse events and infections (not including injection site reaction) used the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0, where Grade 1= Mild - aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated; Grade 2= Moderate - discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity; Grade 3 = Severe - incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity; Grade 4= Life-threatening - refers to an event in which the patient was, in the view of the investigator, at risk of immediate death at the time of event; Grade 5 = Fatal.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-etanercept Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>264 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Binding antibodies to etanercept were detected using an anti-etanercept immunoassay. The positive samples in the immunoassay were further analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies using a bioassay.
Participants who developed anti-etanercept antibodies are those who were antibody positive post-baseline with a negative or no result at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 50 Response (PASI 50)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240 and 264</time_frame>
    <description>A PASI 50 response is a 50% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score.
The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

    <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) was used to assess the impact of psoriasis on subject health-related quality of life. The CDLQI has 10 items assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with skin disease each measured on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Very much). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. If participants were ≥ 13 years old, the text instrument was completed by the participants themselves. Participants ≥ 8 but &lt; 13 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument and participants ≤ 7 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument completed with help from the parents or caregivers.

requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
other significant medical hazard. The severity assessment for adverse events and infections (except injection site reactions) was done using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0, where Grade 3 indicates a severe toxicity (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).
An infectious event is an event that was considered by the investigator to be an infectious episode. An injection site reaction is a reaction at the site of the subcutaneous injection, commonly characterized, but not limited to symptoms of erythema (redness, usually raised), pruritis (itching), swelling, or pain that is persistent for 4 hours or longer.</description>

        <description>A PASI 50 response is a 50% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score.
The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Percent Improvement From Study 20030211 Baseline in Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) was used to assess the impact of psoriasis on subject health-related quality of life. The CDLQI has 10 items assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with skin disease each measured on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Very much). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. If participants were ≥ 13 years old, the text instrument was completed by the participants themselves. Participants ≥ 8 but &lt; 13 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument and participants ≤ 7 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument completed with help from the parents or caregivers.
Percent improvement from baseline = (Baseline Value – Post-baseline Value) / Baseline Value * 100.</description>

          <title>Percent Improvement From Study 20030211 Baseline in CDLQI Sleep Score</title>
          <description>The Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) was used to assess the impact of psoriasis on subject health-related quality of life. The CDLQI has 10 items assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with skin disease each measured on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (Very much). The CDLQI Sleep Score includes 1 question (How much has your sleep been affected by your skin problems over the last week?) and ranges from 0 to 3, with lower scores indicating better quality of life.
Percent improvement from baseline = (Baseline Value – Post-baseline Value) / Baseline Value * 100.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
