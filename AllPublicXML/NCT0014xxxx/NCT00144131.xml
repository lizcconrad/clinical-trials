    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy (non-inferiority) of darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®)
      extended dose schedule administration (EDS) versus darbepoetin alfa administered once per
      week (QW) in the treatment of anemia in subjects with non-myeloid malignancies receiving
      multi-cycle chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects with active non-myeloid malignancy(ies) including
        lymphocytic leukemias - Receiving chemotherapy and expected to receive at least 8
        additional weeks of cyclic cytotoxic chemotherapy anticipated to be on a QW, every other
        week (Q2W) or every three weeks (Q3W) schedule - Anemia due to cancer and/or chemotherapy
        (screening Hb less than 11.0 g/dL) - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
        status of 0 to 2 Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),
        chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) - Other underlying
        hematologic disorder, which could cause anemia, other than a non-myeloid malignancy -
        Active bleeding - Severe, unstable, active chronic inflammatory disease (e.g., ulcerative
        disease, peptic ulcer disease, rheumatoid arthritis) - Active, unstable systemic or chronic
        infection - Planned elective surgery during the study where significant blood loss is
        expected - Known iron deficiency (to be considered iron deficient a subject must have both
        of the following: a saturated transferrin less than 15% and ferritin less than 10 ng/mL at
        screening) - Unstable angina, or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia - Hypertension (diastolic
        blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg) - Inadequate renal and/or liver function (e.g.,
        creatinine greater than 2 X upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or transaminase greater than 5
        X ULN) - History of pure red blood cell aplasia - Known positive human immunodeficiency
        virus (HIV) test or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) status - Known positive
        antibody response to any erythropoietic agent - Subject has known sensitivity to any
        erythropoietic agents, the study drug, or its excipients to be administered during this
        study
