  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing and new pharmacotherapies along with prevention efforts are key to improving smoking
      cessation rates and reducing the premature morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco
      use. A number of individuals suffer from both nicotine dependence and depression. The purpose
      of this study is to determine the effectiveness of bupropion used in combination with the
      nicotine replacement patch and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in treating nicotine
      dependent individuals also diagnosed with depression.

    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation treatment is highly cost effective and pharmacotherapy is universally
      recommended for treatment of nicotine dependence. However, the majority of smokers are unable
      to quit even with treatment. Existing and new pharmacotherapies along with prevention efforts
      are key to improving smoking cessation rates and reducing the premature morbidity and
      mortality associated with tobacco use. The purpose of this study is to examine the
      effectiveness of bupropion as an addition to a standard smoking cessation treatment of CBT
      and nicotine replacement. In addition, this study will determine if bupropion improves an
      individual's odds of quitting smoking, and whether this is achieved through its impact on
      negative mood states associated with depression.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either bupropion
      or placebo. CBT sessions and individual meetings with a study physician will last for 13
      weeks. Treatment with either bupropion or placebo will begin at the first CBT meeting and
      will continue for 13 weeks. Treatment with the nicotine replacement patch will begin at the
      second CBT meeting and will continue for 10 weeks. Participants will have monthly follow-up
      visits throughout the year following Week 13. During the follow-up period, participants will
      continue to take either bupropion or placebo but will no longer undergo CBT or nicotine
      replacement. If participants are unable to quit smoking, or become more depressed during the
      follow-up phase, they will be offered treatment with Zoloft, and will continue to be
      monitored for the duration of the follow-up year. If participants have been unsuccessful in
      using Zoloft, they will be offered another antidepressant at the judgement of the clinician.
