      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the biological effect of Tarceva (OSI-774) from an
      inhibition of EGF tumor receptor tyrosine kinase activity's point of view, for patients who
      are carriers of head and neck epidermoid carcinoma.

      Patients will receive Tarceva in continuous between 18 and 28 days after pan-endoscopy exam
      until surgery
