  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this intervention is to find out whether intravaginal treatment with a gel
      containing an antibiotic (metronidazole), compared to a similar placebo gel (without
      antibiotic), can reduce the frequency of bacterial vaginosis, a common vaginal infection
      among African women who are HIV uninfected or HIV infected. The study will also determine the
      effect of these vaginal gels on genitourinary symptoms.

      This is a phase 3, randomized, double masked, two arms study conducted in Malawi, Southeast
      Africa. The study is conducted among nonpregnant HIV infected or uninfected women of
      reproductive age. Intermittent mass treatment approaches are followed where women are
      randomized to antibiotic intravaginal treatment or placebo at enrollment. Women receive
      assigned product every three months for one year.
