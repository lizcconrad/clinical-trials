  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the growing evidence showing that breast hypertrophy is associated with reduced
      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and that reduction mammoplasty has a significant
      positive impact on HRQL, there are unresolved issues that need to be addressed. These include
      our ability to measure quantitatively the change that occurs after reduction and the ongoing
      restriction or denials of third party payments based on body mass index (BMI). The primary
      purpose of this study is to assess and measure the HRQL experienced by breast reduction
      patients using four reliable and validated HRQL measures.

      Fifty-two consecutive patients with the diagnosis of breast hypertrophy were invited to
      participate in this prospective study. Participants completed the Health Utilities Index Mark
      2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) and the Breast Reduction Assessment Value and Outcomes (BRAVO)
      instruments (the Short Form 36, the Multidimensional Body-Self Rating Questionnaire
      Appearance Assessment, and the Breast Related Symptom Questionnaire) at one week and one day
      pre-surgery and one, six, and 12 months post-surgery.

      This study addresses the following questions of clinical and policy relevance: 1) Is the
      pre-surgery HRQL of these patients compromised and, if so, in which areas? 2) Do patientsâ€™
      HRQL improve after surgery and, if so, when and in which areas and by how much? 3) Is there a
      relationship between BMI and pre-/post-surgery changes in HRQL (i.e., is the pre/post effect
      similar for both obese and non-obese patients)? and 4) Is there a relationship between tissue
      re-section weight and pre-/post-surgery changes in HRQL (i.e., is the pre/post HRQL effect
      similar for patients having small and large amounts of tissue resected)?
