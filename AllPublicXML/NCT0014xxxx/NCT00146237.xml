  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About two-thirds of depressed patients respond to a standard course of serotonin specific
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI's) within 3-4 weeks. While some clinicians advise continued watchful
      waiting after this time or switch to a different reuptake-blocker based antidepressant,
      result of such conservative strategies are usually disappointing. For severe depression
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an option and for atypical depressions monoamine oxide
      inhibitors (MAO) inhibitors often give relief at this point. A unique strategy with both
      theoretical and practical implications is lithium augmentation (Fava et al, 1994). Addition
      of lithium to SSRI failures at 3-4 weeks is consistently and sometimes dramatically found to
      be helpful. This is considered true even by those authors who advocate use of lithium under
      usual circumstances only in bipolar patients.

      Lithium in recent years has been joined as a mood stabilizer by carbamazepine and valproate.
      Phenytoin, ignored for many years as a possible anticonvulsant mood stabilizer, has been
      recently reported in double-blind controlled trials to be anti-manic (Mishory et al, 2000)
      and also prophylactic in BP disorder (Mishory et al, 2003).

      Data on mood stabilizers other than lithium as augmentors in SSRI failures are sparse.
      Carbamazepine (Steinacher et al, 2002) and valproate (Barbee et al, 2002) have been used.
      Given our recent preliminary results of phenytoin's efficacy in unipolar depression (Nemets
      et al, 2005) and its analogy to lithium as a mood stabilizer, it seems important to study
      phenytoin as a possible augmentation of SSRI failures.

      We have published a negative study previously of inositol as an augmentation of SSRI
      failures, enrolling forty-two patients over two years (Nemets et al, 1999). Antidepressant
      failures are easier to recruit from referring physicians in our center than are untreated
      patients, whom clinicians are reluctant to refer for new drug studies given the adequacy of
      standard treatment in 2/3 of them. Thus we estimate that we could enroll 20 patients per year
      in such a study. Survey of the literature of Li augmentation suggests that 40 phenytoin vs.
      40 placebo should give adequate power to detect a significant phenytoin effect if the
      phenytoin effect is similar to that of lithium.

      We have published a negative study previously of inositol as an augmentation of SSRI
      failures, enrolling forty-two patients over two years (Nemets et al, 1999). Antidepressant
      failures are easier to recruit from referring physicians in our center than are untreated
      patients, whom clinicians are reluctant to refer for new drug studies given the adequacy of
      standard treatment in 2/3 of them. Thus we estimate that we could enroll 20 patients per year

      40 placebo should give adequate power to detect a significant phenytoin effect if the
      phenytoin effect is similar to that of lithium.

      The study has been approved by the Helsinki Committee and all patients must give written
      informed consent. Patients will be evaluated for study if they meet DSM-IV criteria for major
      depression without psychotic features. Patients can enter the study if they had at least 3
      weeks of treatment with SSRI at clinically adequate doses (150mg fluvoxamine, 20mg
      fluoxetine, or 20mg paroxetine) and still have a score of at least 18 on the Hamilton
      Depression Scale (HDS) (on 24 item scale) with at most mild improvement from onset of SSRI
      treatment. Patients with alcohol or drug abuse or patients with unstable medical illnesses
      are excluded. Design is parallel double-blind. Patients continue SSRI treatment of the same
      medication and dose they received before entry. They are randomly assigned to phenytoin or
      identical placebo capsules. Patients will be rated on the HDRS weekly for four weeks after
      addition of phenytoin or placebo. Patients who do not improve at least 1 unit on the GCI
      every two weeks will be dropped from the study for ethical reasons and referred to open
      treatment. HDRS ratings are done weekly by an experienced psychiatrist (BN) blind to the
      treatment medication.

      Blood levels of phenytoin will be reported by the lab to the treating psychiatrist after
      &quot;dummy&quot; levels are assigned by the control psychiatrist to patients on placebo.

      All patients will be evaluated physically and EKG, liver and kidney functions, and blood cell
      count performed before entering the study.

      Special attention will be given to instruction of patients in dental hygiene and patients
      showing signs of gingival hyperplasia will be dropped. Studies in epilepsy show that this
      side effect is surprisingly uncommon, despite wide publicity. No cases were seen in our
      previous short-term study or prophylactic study (Mishory et al, 2000; Mishory et al, 2003).
      Nonlinear pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and the consequent danger of toxicity will be
      handled by careful blood levels monitoring. Patients with significant side effects or
      toxicity will be dropped from the study. Patients with indications of hypersensitivity
      reactions (morbilliform rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatic
      necrosis, neutropenia and leukopenia, red-cell aplasia, agranulocytosis, aplastic- or megalo-
      anemia, or thrombocytopenia) will be dropped from the study.

      Importance: Almost one third of patients fail to respond to standard antidepressants. Proof
      of efficacy of phenytoin augmentation in such cases would: 1) be a useful addition to our
      clinical armamentarium 2) strengthen the theoretical profile of phenytoin as an antimanic,
      antidepressant and mood stabilizing compound parallel to lithium and several other
      anticonvulsants 3) raise useful and heuristic ideas for mechanistic studies of phenytoin's
      effects on mood.
