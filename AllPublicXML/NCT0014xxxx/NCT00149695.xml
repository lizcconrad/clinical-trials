      The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects of replacing
      habitual consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks with milk over 16 weeks.

      The prevalence of obesity has risen dramatically among children in the U.S. and throughout
      the world since the 1960s. Many factors are thought to have contributed to the epidemic of
      pediatric obesity. One factor that has received increasing attention is consumption of
      sugar-sweetened beverages. Feeding studies suggest physiological mechanisms by which sugar in
      liquid form may be less satiating than other foods. An observational study found total energy
      consumption to be greater among children who consume sugar-sweetened beverages compared to
      non-consumes. Short-term interventional studies report increasing energy intake and body
      weight in subjects given sugar-sweetened beverages compared to non-caloric beverages. Our
      preliminary data found that the risk for becoming obese increased by about 60% in middle
      school children for every additional serving per day of sugar-sweetened beverage consumed.
      The purpose of the present study is to conduct a 16-week clinical trial involving 96 children
      ages 8 to 10 years in Chile, a developing nation characterized as undergoing a &quot;nutrition
      transition.&quot; The subjects, selected for current sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, will
      be randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention group will be
      encouraged to substitute milk products for soft-drinks; to facilitate this dietary change, a
      variety of milk products will be delivered to subjects' homes on a weekly basis. Clinical
      endpoints include changes in dietary quality, body weight, adiposity by DEXA-scan and
      measures of calcium homeostasis.
