  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, also known as Pneumococcus, is a common cause of pneumonia in
      transplant patients. There has been a vaccine available for this infection called Pneumovax.
      Recently, a new vaccine for this infection called Prevnar has been developed which may be
      more effective. Vaccinating the bone marrow donor before transplant may boost the recipient's
      immune response to the vaccine after transplant. This study is done to compare how
      vaccinating the donor with one of the vaccines will affect the recipient's immune system
      response to the vaccine.

      This is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the immunogenicity of the new
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a cohort of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (allo-HSCT) recipients. This will be done by using an approach of pre-transplant donor
      immunization with post-transplant recipient immunization. Response will be compared with the
      standard 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. It is hypothesized that the conjugate vaccine will
      provide an enhanced response in this group of immunosuppressed individuals who respond poorly
      to standard polysaccharide vaccines.

      Specific objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the antibody response to both vaccines via a measurement of total antibody
           response and by the opsonophagocytic assay. This assay has the advantage of assessing if
           patient antibody responses represent truly functional antibodies that display opsonic
           activity against pneumococcus and is likely better correlated with protective efficacy.

        -  To determine any acute adverse reactions of the conjugate vaccine in this population.
           Results of this trial will help lay the foundation for the development of a rationale
           and optimal pneumococcal vaccination strategy that would prevent significant morbidity
           in this patient population.

      We hypothesize that pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, due to its T-cell dependent response will
      have greater immunogenicity and protective effect in an allo-HSCT population by using a donor
      immunization strategy.
