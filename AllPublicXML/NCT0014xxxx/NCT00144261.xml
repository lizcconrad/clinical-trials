  <brief_summary>

      1. In order to obtain further insight as to how NVP affects HDL metabolism, the in vivo
           kinetics of the HDL apolipoprotein, Apo A-1, before and 6 weeks after initiation of NVP
           containing treatment were evaluated. In addition, the activity of the key enzymes
           related to HDL metabolism were assessed.

           [ Designated as safety issue: No ]

        2. In order to determine the relevance of the HDL increase in decreasing cardiovascular
           risk in HIV-positive subjects we evaluated endothelial function (FMD) as a surrogate
           marker for cardiovascular disease in patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be included when they meet the following criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

          2. Ability and willingness to provide signed and dated written informed consent prior to
             admission to the study in accordance with GCP and local legislation.

          3. Patients on stable therapy with Trizivir only (or its equivalent component drugs), for
             at least 6 months prior to screening.

          4. Patients with plasma HIV-1-RNA &lt;=50 copies/mL documented on at least two occasions
             within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          5. Documentation of plasma HIV-1 RNA of &lt;=50 copies/mL for &gt;=6 months while on Trizivir
             without other antiretroviral agent. Documentation will include dates and results of
             all viral load testing from the previous six months.

          6. Ability and willingness to complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will not be included when they meet one or more of the following criteria:

          1. Previous exposure to NNRTI drugs.

          2. Documented diabetes mellitus.

          3. Documented hypertension (systolic &gt;155 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;95 mmHg).

          4. Fasting hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;5.6 mmol/L or 500 mg/dl).

          5. Use of lipid-lowering medication during the 90 days prior to study enrollment.

          6. Chronic active hepatitis B and/or C infection by history.

          7. Anemia (Hb &lt;7.0 mmol/l or 11 g/dl hematocrit &lt;32%).

          8. Active opportunistic infection or neoplasm within 3 months prior to screening visit
             with the exception of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma without evidence of progressive
             disease.

          9. Any history of cardiovascular disease (infarction, heart failure, peripheral vascular
             disease, cerebrovascular disease).

         10. Hepatic, renal or thyroid abnormalities, as determined significant by the Principal
             Investigator.

         11. Pregnancy or lactation.

         12. Active anticoagulation therapy (coumarin derivates, heparin).

         13. History of HIV-2 infection.

         14. Female patients with CD4 counts &gt;250 cells/mm3.

         15. Male patients with CD4 counts &gt;400 cells/mm3. Others which can not be listed here.
