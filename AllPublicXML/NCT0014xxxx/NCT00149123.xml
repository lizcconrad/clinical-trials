  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major burns trigger the release of circulating mediators, as cytokines and endotoxin that
      induces a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The cardiovascular effects are similar to
      those seen in septic shock. After the initial hypovolemic phase, patients with extensive
      burns often present a shock with increased cardiac output and reduced systemic vascular
      resistances. As described in septic shock, we test the hypothesis that low-dose
      hydrocortisone could decrease the duration of the shock period.
