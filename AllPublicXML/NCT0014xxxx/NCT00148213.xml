  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human thyroglobulin (Tg) is the most sensitive biochemical marker for recurrence of
      differentiated cancer (DTC), especially after the complete removal of thyroid tissue through
      surgery and radioiodine therapy (RIT).

      Unfortunately, current assays for measuring Tg in blood samples are not sensitive enough to
      reliably measure Tg while patients are under thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Instead
      patients have to withdraw thyroid hormone for several weeks or receive costly injections of
      recombinant thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in order to raise Tg production by thyroid
      remnant and/or thyroid cancer cells so that it can be measured by current Tg assays. Other
      patients have antibodies against Tg that interfere in current immunoassays.

      The purpose of the study was to characterize a new highly sensitive assay for measuring Tg in
      the serum in thyroid cancer patients both on thyroid hormone therapy and off therapy in
      comparison to the normal routine assay already in use at Münster University Hospital.

      Sera of 100 consecutive DTC patients after total thyroidectomy were to be collected at the
      Department of Nuclear Medicine both under TSH-suppression therapy and under endogenous TSH
      stimulation (TSH &gt; 25 mU/l). All patients were staged by clinical examination, cervical
      ultrasound (7.5 MHz), I-131 whole-body scintigraphy and – where applicable – F18-FDG-PET.
      Written informed consent was obtained from all pts. Sera were taken in separation tubes
      without anticoagulants and stored at -20°C until analysis. Sera were allowed to come to room
      temperature prior to analysis.

      Tg, TgR and TgAb concentrations were determined by fully automated two-site chemiluminescence
      immunoassays (CLIA; Nichols Advantage®; Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Clemente,
      California). All 3 assays are based on the identical highly purified hTg material for
      calibration (Tg), recovery (TgR) and antigen (TgAb; biotinylated and acridinium ester
      labeled) for optimum comparability of test results.

      In addition, Tg and TgR was measured by a fully automated two-site TRACE immunoassay (BRAHMS
      Kryptor®, Brahms AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany) and TSH with a 3rd-generation CLIA assay (TSH-3,
      Advia Centaur, Bayer Corporation).
