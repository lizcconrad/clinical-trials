  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor needlestick procedures often cause significant pain and distress in pediatric patients
      yet interventions to reduce pain are used infrequently. ALGRX 3268 is a novel, single-use,
      prefilled, needle-free product that immediately delivers powdered lidocaine into the
      epidermis and provides local analgesia in 2-3 minutes. The purpose of this phase III,
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to investigate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of ALGRX 3268 versus placebo in pediatric patients aged 3
      to 18 years undergoing venipuncture or peripheral venous canulation procedures. The trial
      will enroll approximate 504 evaluable subjects at centers located in the US.

    <textblock>
      Management of pain due to minor procedures such as venipuncture or peripheral venous
      canulation still represents an unmet medical need, especially in pediatric setting. Current
      therapeutic products have a relatively delayed onset of analgesia of at least 10 minutes;
      moreover the most used products require application with at least 30-60 minutes prior to
      procedure. Development of ALGRX 3268 is aimed at addressing this unmet need in management of
      pain associated with needlestick procedures.

      ALGRX 3268 (Previously known as PowderJect(R) Dermal Lidocaine) is used for local anesthesia
      to provide within 1-3 minutes painless needle or cathether insertion for blod drawing. ALGRX
      3268 is a single-use disposable system, incorporating a drug cassette and glass cylinder into
      a single hand held device, with a button to actuate the system.

      The purpose of this phase III, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ALGRX
      3268 versus placebo in pediatric patients 3 to 18 years of age, who undergo venipuncture or
      peripheral venous canulation procedures. The trial will enroll approximate 504 evaluable
      subjects at centers located in the US.

      Three age groups are enrolled: 3-7 years, 8-12 years, 13-18 years. Within each age group
      subjects are randomized to receive ALGRX 3268 0.5 mg/20 bar or pressure matched placebo. One
      to 3 minutes after administration of study treatment at the back of the hand or antecubital
      fosa, venipuncture is performed with a needle/Vacutainer, needle/syringe or &quot;butterfly&quot;, at
      the discretion of the investigator.

      Subjects 3-18 years are asked to assess pain on venipuncture using Wong-Baker FACES pain
      rating scale, anchored at 0 for &quot;no hurt&quot; and 5 for &quot;hurts worst&quot;. Assessment of pain will be
      analyzed in each age group 3-7, 8-12, 13-18 and using Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale.

      Children in the middle (8-12) and older (13-18) age groups will also rate pain at the ACF and
      BOH using a 100 mm VAS anchored at 0 for &quot;no pain&quot; and at 100 for &quot;extreme pain&quot;.
      Parent/legal guardian will evaluate child's level of pain on a 100 mm VAS anchored at 0, for
      &quot;no pain&quot;, and at 100 for &quot;extreme pain&quot;.

      Safety ratings of skin are completed at 15 and 30 minutes following the procedure. AEs/SAEs
      will be monitored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient children of either gender [M/F: 1:1] undergoing venipuncture or peripheral
             venous cannulation at the antecubital fossa or back of hand. Children must have
             sufficient cognitive skills to identify faces depicting extremes of pain on the
             Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, (ages 3-12) and/or the extremes of pain on a 100
             VAS (ages 8-18).

          -  Ages 3-7, 8-12, 13-18 years inclusive. Informed consent forms must have been approved
             by the appropriate IRB. Signed informed consent must have been granted by the
             parent/legal guardian and assent to participate should have been sought (either
             verbally or in writting) from each child.

          -  In females of childbearing potential who in the judgement of the investigator or
             designee were sexually active, a negative preganancy test must have been documented
             prior to enrollment. A negative urine preganancy test was required in all teenage
             girls over the age of 14 years. Surgically sterile females do not require a pregnancy
             test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous history of allergic reactions to any local anesthetic. Any medical condition
             or instability that in the judgement of the investigator might have adversely impacted
             the conduct of the study and the collection of data.

          -  Subjects in whom the investigator determined that venipuncture could not be
             accomplished cleanly.

          -  Active local infection or other skin pathology on the dorsum of the hand. Subjects
             with tattos, surgical scars, ports, implantable devices or a skin condition that may
             have interfered with placement of study treatment or skin site assessments.

          -  Female subjects who were pregnant or lactating; females with a positive serum or urine
             pregnancy test; females of childbearing potential who were not using adequate
             contraception.

          -  Prior participation in an ALGRX 3268 study.

          -  Venipuncture at the proposed site within the prior 2 weeks (longer if bruising was
             apparent).
