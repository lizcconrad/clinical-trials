    <textblock>
      Performance of self-care recommendations is key to the successful treatment of diabetes.
      However, many patients have difficulty adhering to diabetes self-care recommendations. Recent
      results from our own studies and others have identified specific barriers to diabetes
      self-care. To evaluate the efficacy of a diabetes educator-led group intervention, the
      Breaking Down Barriers Program, that addresses barriers and therefore leads to improved
      adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations, we will randomize 222 (111 type 1 and 111
      type 2) diabetes patients to one of three conditions: 1) the Breaking Down Barriers Program,
      2) a cholesterol attention control condition, or 3) a 'usual care' control condition. We
      hypothesize that those assigned to the Breaking Down Barriers group will improve self-care
      behaviors and glycemic control more than those in the two control groups. We will follow
      study subjects for one year to determine whether their self-care behaviors and glycemic
      control improved and if the improvement was maintained over time.
