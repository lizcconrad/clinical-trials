    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if levetiracetam is effective in treating alcohol
      dependence in patients with anxiety symptoms. The researchers hypothesize that individuals
      are unable to reduce or discontinue alcohol use because of significant anxiety, mood, and
      sleep disturbance symptoms that accompany reduction in alcohol use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence is frequently associated with anxiety disorders. Treatment studies of
      individuals suffering from both alcohol dependence and anxiety have been limited.
      Anti-seizure medications have been used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal for three
      decades. More recently, anti-seizure medications have been shown to reduce drinking and
      promote abstinence, and reduce drinking in abstinent alcoholics. Levetiracetam is a newer
      anti-seizure medication, with a structure different than that of other anti-seizure
      medications, that is safe and generally well tolerated. The Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has approved levetiracetam for use with other anti-seizure medications in the treatment
      of epilepsy in adults. The metabolism of levetiracetam is less complicated than older
      anti-seizure medications, which makes it easier to use and better tolerated, and it is not
      likely to interact with other medicines. Levetiracetam has been shown to prevent anxiety
      during sedative withdrawal, which is similar to alcohol withdrawal, in a laboratory study
      using mice. Levetiracetam also had anti-anxiety effects in laboratory study using mice. Given
      that other anti-seizure medications have been shown to be helpful in treating alcohol
      dependence, that levetiracetam is not likely to have interactions with other medications, and
      that in animals levetiracetam appeared to be helpful for treating a condition similar to
      alcohol dependence and anxiety, we believe it should be studied for the treatment of alcohol
      dependent patients with anxiety disorders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between the ages of 18-65 who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence and a
             comorbid anxiety disorder, including: panic disorder, social phobia, generalized
             anxiety disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder, no
             otherwise specified (NOS).

          -  Individuals capable of giving informed consent and capable of complying with study
             procedures.

          -  Individuals must have clinically significant anxiety.

          -  Individuals must have current average alcohol use over past 28 days with &gt; 4 drinking
             days per week and &gt;4 standard drinks/drinking day for women and &gt; 5 standard
             drinks/drinking day for men.

          -  Women of child-bearing age will be included provided that they are not pregnant, based
             on the results of a blood pregnancy test done at the time of screening and agree to
             use a method of contraception with proven efficacy and not to become pregnant during
             the study. To confirm this, blood pregnancy tests will be repeated monthly. Women will
             be provided a full explanation of the potential dangers of pregnancy while on the
             study. If a woman becomes pregnant the study medication will be discontinued.
