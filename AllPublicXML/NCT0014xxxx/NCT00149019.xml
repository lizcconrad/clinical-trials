      Patients with resistant metastatic solid tumors failing all conventional modalities who are
      eligible for immunotherapy by bispecific antibodies.

      First step: NST Second step: Patients with tumor cells expressing positive Her-2Neu and/or
      EpCAM with residual or recurrent disease following NST will be candidates for donor
      lymphocytes immunotherapy using bispecific antibodies.

      Patients with no matched donor available, expressing positive Her-2Neu and/or EpCAM tumor
      cells, will be eligible for donor mismatched lymphocytes using in-vitro rIL-2 activated
      allogeneic lymphocytes targeted to the tumor by bispecific antibodies, Her-2Neu and/or EpCAM.
