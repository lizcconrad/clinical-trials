  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical and serologic outcomes after the
      discontinuation of liatermin therapy as assessed by development of new clinical conditions
      beyond those expected in patients with advancing Parkinson's disease. In addition, the
      development or resolution of anti-r-metHuGDNF binding and neutralizing antibodies will be
      monitored.
