  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with elevated cholesterol, but not
      taking any other lipid medication, could lower their cholesterol with administration of
      lapaquistat acetate, once daily (QD).

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-475 (lapaquistat acetate) compared to
      placebo in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia. Subjects who have signed the informed
      consent will undergo necessary evaluations to determine eligibility for a dietary run-in
      phase. Subjects who meet randomization criteria will enter treatment with one of the
      following randomized treatments: lapaquistat acetate or placebo.
