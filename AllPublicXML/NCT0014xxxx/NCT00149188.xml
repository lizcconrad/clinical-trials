      The purpose of this study is to allow patients with acromegaly, or their partners, to learn
      how to successfully inject Somatuline Autogel at home. Ability to perform unsupervised
      injections whilst maintaining adequate disease control will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have a clinical diagnosis of acromegaly

          -  The patient must have been tested and shown to have a GH level less than or equal to
             10 micrograms/L within 28 days prior to the baseline visit

          -  The patient must be currently treated with Somatuline Autogel and have been stable on
             their current dose for at least 6 months immediately prior to screening

          -  The patient must be able to store study medication in a refrigerator in their own home

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has had pituitary surgery (adenomectomy) within 6 months prior to
             screening

          -  The patient has received pituitary radiotherapy within one year prior to screening

          -  The patient is likely to require pituitary surgery (adenomectomy) or to receive
             radiotherapy during the study period

          -  The patient is currently receiving a GH antagonist or a somatostatin analogue other
             than Somatuline Autogel
