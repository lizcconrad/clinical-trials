  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether children who take vitamins along with the
      standard medicine for tuberculosis (TB) recover better and quicker than children who take
      only the standard medicine for TB. Four hundred children ages 6 weeks-5 years, who have been
      diagnosed with tuberculosis, will be enrolled. They will be followed for 2 months after
      treatment for TB. Study procedures may include blood draws, Tuberculin Skin Tests, body
      measurements, gastric aspirates (removal of stomach fluid), physical exams, and
      questionnaires. This study will occur in Tanzania.

      Tuberculosis (TB) remains the single most common infectious disease cause of mortality
      worldwide with evidence that support nutritional status may be associated with poor outcomes
      in TB patients. Data from observational and limited intervention studies support the
      hypothesis that nutritional supplements/micronutrients may be beneficial as well as potential
      treatments in TB. The effect of micronutrient status will be examined in the context of a
      double blinded placebo controlled randomized trial; 400 tuberculosis patients (age 6 weeks to
      5 years) will be randomized to receive either multi-micronutrients or placebo from the start
      of their anti-TB therapy, through 2 months of their anti-TB therapy. The primary objective is
      to evaluate the efficacy of a multivitamin supplement containing vitamins B, C and E on
      weight gain in childhood tuberculosis at 2 months after start of anti-tuberculosis therapy.
      Secondary objectives are to: evaluate the efficacy of a multivitamin supplement containing
      vitamins B, C, and E on clearance of chest x-ray in childhood tuberculosis at 2 months after
      start of anti-tuberculosis therapy; compare the treatment arms with respect to the following
      immunological parameters: ex-vivo lymphocyte proliferation; cytokines production including
      IL-2, IL-12, TNF - alpha, INF-gamma; and CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte counts at 2 months after
      start of anti-tuberculosis therapy; assess the validity of Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) for the
      diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis in a population with high BCG coverage and HIV
      prevalence; assess the validity and feasibility of using &quot;microscopic observation broth drug
      susceptibility (MODS) assay&quot; of sputum and gastric aspirates in the diagnosis of childhood
      tuberculosis; correlate the above-mentioned immunological markers (IL-2, IL-12, INF-gamma and
      TNF-alpha) with weight gain and chest x-ray at 2 months after start of anti-tuberculosis
      therapy; and compare the immunological response to a supplement containing vitamins B, C and
      E in childhood tuberculosis patients with and without HIV infection. The endpoints of
      interest include immunological parameters like CD4 T lymphocyte count and clinical outcomes
      such as, weight gain and resolution of chest x-ray after 2 months anti-TB therapy.
      Researchers will also examine the utility of these immune response parameters as surrogate
      markers for treatment efficacy in TB, irrespective of nutritional and other risk factors.
