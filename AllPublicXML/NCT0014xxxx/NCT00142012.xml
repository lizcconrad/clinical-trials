  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this initiative is to reduce the prevalence and occurrence of obesity
      and increase the remission of obesity in children and adolescents through implementation of a
      Comprehensive School Nutrition Policy designed to promote changes in the school environment
      that will reinforce studentsâ€™ development of healthy eating and physical activity patterns
      inside and outside of school.

      The proposed research aims to evaluate the effects of a school-based nutrition policy
      initiative on prevalence, incidence and remission of overweight (BMI &gt; 95th percentile). It
      is a partnership between the Food Trust, the School District of Philadelphia and the
      University of Pennsylvania. Participants are approximately 1500 students from ten schools in
      grades four through eight. Half of the schools were randomized to a comprehensive School
      Nutrition Policy Initiative (SNPI) based on CDC's Guidelines to Promote Lifelong Healthy
      Eating. The SNPI is a community-based intervention administered by the Comprehensive School
      Nutrition Policy Task Force that is comprised of 40 individuals representing the public and
      private sectors. The goal of the SNPI is to change the school environment to: support healthy
      eating, increase physical activity, and decrease the prevalence of childhood overweight and
      diet-related diseases. The remaining study participants are in five control schools, matched
      for ethnicity, SES, and type of food service. Most students are African American and qualify
      for free and reduced meals at school (household income &lt; 185% of the poverty level adjusted
      for household size). Assessments of weight, height, intake, activity, inactivity and eating
      disorder symptomatology are being conducted at baseline and 1 and 2 years.
