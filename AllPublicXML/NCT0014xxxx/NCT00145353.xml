      The main purpose of the study is to investigate the reason for the reduced number of
      hypoglycaemic attacks in type 1 diabetic patients when, for a period of time, using Insulin
      Aspart at meals together with NPH insulin mornings and evenings, and when, in another period
      of time, using human fast-working insulin at meals and NPH insulin mornings and evenings, and
      when the patients in both periods simultaneously take extra insulin at meals if high blood
      glucose values are found before meals.
