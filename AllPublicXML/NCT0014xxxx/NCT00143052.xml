      The purpose of this study is to investigate how the bones of hirsute women are different from
      bones of healthy women. The change in hormone content in the blood will also be investigated.
      The study can be used to evaluate whether it will be relevant to bone scan all newly referred
      hirsute women.

      Hirsute women are often over-weight and often have an increased amount of the male sex
      hormone in their blood. Their blood tests often show changes reminding of the ones seen in
      diabetic patients.

      All hirsute women referred to the department will undergo an investigation revealing the
      reason for the increased hair growth. The investigation includes clinical investigation
      (height, weight and degree of hair growth), blood tests (for hormone status and bone status
      analysis) and bone scanning of the abdomen (body composition).

      The trial includes a group of 50 strongly hairy women and a control group of 50 healthy women
      with normal hair growth. They are matched by body weight, since weight has great importance
      for the bone mineral content and thereby for osteoporosis in the long run.
