    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathic pain syndrome, including diabetic peripheral
             neuropathy (DPN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), or post-traumatic neuropathic pain
             (including post-surgical), confirmed by a qualified pain specialist.

          -  Subjects must have completed at least 4 daily pain diaries during the 7 days prior to
             Visit 2 and have an average pain score of ≥4 over the 7 days prior to Visit 2
             (randomization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neurologic disorders unrelated to DPN, PHN, or post-traumatic neuropathic pain
             (including post-surgical), that may confuse or confound the assessment of neuropathic
             pain.

          -  Presence of any severe pain associated with conditions other than DPN, PHN, or
             post-traumatic neuropathic pain (including post-surgical) that may confound the
             assessment or self evaluation of the pain due to DPN, PHN, or post-traumatic
             neuropathic pain (including post-surgical).

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min (estimated from serum creatinine, body weight, age,
             and sex using the Cockcroft and Gault equation in Appendix E). Maximum dose for
             subjects with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mL/min is 300 mg/day

        <description>DAAC is a score used to assess treatment effects averaged over the entire length of the study.

        <population>The ITT population consisted of subjects who received ≥1 dose of study medication and had contributed to the analysis of any efficacy parameter. Subjects without any post-baseline daily pain scores would have no DAAC; missing DAACs were not imputed.</population>

        <title>Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Sleep Disturbance</title>
        <description>MOS Sleep Scale is a subject-rated questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess the key constructs of sleep; assesses sleep for the 4 weeks prior to evaluation. The MOS Sleep Disturbance sub-scale scores range from 0 to 100, lower scores indicate less disturbance.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population consisted of subjects who received ≥1 dose of study medication and had contributed to the analysis of any efficacy parameter. MOS was measured at baseline and Week 8. For subjects not completing the study, their final data were considered Week 8 data; those without final data were excluded from analysis.</population>

        <description>DAAC is a score used to assess treatment effects averaged over the entire length of the study.
