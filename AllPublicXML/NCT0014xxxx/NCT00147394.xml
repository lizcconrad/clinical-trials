      The purpose of this research is to study the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in a group of
      pediatric patients with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). The study will determine how
      much risperidone and its breakdown product, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, is in the blood following
      the patient's usual daily dose. The study is designed to look at how fast children absorb,
      breakdown, and eliminate risperidone.

      Pervasive Developmental Disorders is a category of disorders that includes autism and related
      conditions. While these disorders are rare, they represent a significant public health
      problem because they are extremely debilitating and lack efficacious therapies. Neuroleptic
      use in PDD is high and the population appears to be at increased risk of serious sequelae
      including tardive dyskinesia. Newer atypical neuroleptics including risperidone are now used
      in 87% of cases but dosing, safety and efficacy is undetermined in the vulnerable population.

      This study consists of a total of 3 visits, the initial screening visit where consent,
      medical history, demographics and vitals will be recorded. Two additional visits with blood
      sampling will occur. The second visit will be no greater than 30 days from the screening
      visit and the 3rd visit will be one month from Visit 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients between ages of 5 and less than 17 years.

          -  Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for PDD-NOS about to initiate clinical treatment or
             currently clinically treated with risperidone.

          -  Patients with autistic disorder or PDD-NOS currently on risperidone as a participant
             in one of the multi-site RUPP protocols.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children taking psychotropic or other medication that will interact with target CYP
             450 isoenzyme activity will not be eligible for the pharmacokinetic study (i.e. CYP2D6
             or CYP3A4; to be decided by the PI)

          -  Patients with known renal or hepatic dysfunction (e.g. serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 normal
