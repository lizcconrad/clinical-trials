  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hernia repair is one of the most common operations. Whilst there are few complications, pain
      may last for several weeks and extend the period of convalescence. ALGRX 4975 is an
      ultra-pure form of capsaicin, which is a pain medicine that has the potential for long-term
      pain relief following a single administration. This study will determine whether ALGRX 4975
      can provide pain relief following hernia repair.

    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia correction in adults is one of the most common operations with an annual rate
      of approximately 2,800 per 1 million people in the United States. Whilst there is little
      intra and postoperative morbidity, pain may persist for one to several weeks postoperatively
      and may extend the period of convalescence. ALGRX 4975 is an ultra-pure form of capsaicin,
      which is a pain medicine that has the potential for long-term pain relief following a single
      administration. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single dose of ALGRX
      4975, administered by instillation, is able to reduce the postoperative pain following
      inguinal hernia correction and to evaluate the potential for long term pain relief.
