    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam for
      treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in inpatients (vs. placebo). The primary come-out
      parameter is the reduction of the total needed amount of diazepam for add-on treatment of
      acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The secondary come-out parameter are - safety criteria
      (AE) - reduction of alcohol withdrawal score over the days.
