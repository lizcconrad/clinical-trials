  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal insulin regimen for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes
      remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a split evening injection
      regimen (insulin injections before breakfast, supper and bedtime) leads to better glucose
      control and quality of life than twice daily insulin in children and adolescents with new
      onset diabetes.

      The optimal insulin regimen for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes
      remains unknown. No published studies have examined the effectiveness of a split evening
      (three times daily) injection regimen in this group of patients. Indeed, because the first
      few years of diabetes management are the easiest (due to a “honeymoon” period characterised
      by residual insulin secretion), the potential for any benefit from more intensive management
      (i.e., three daily injections) may be small during this period. In addition, the intensity of
      the initial insulin regimen may be an important determinant of quality of life, family
      functioning, and subsequent compliance with diabetes regimens. A randomized controlled trial
      has been designed to test the hypothesis that a split evening injection regimen leads to
      better glycemic control and quality of life than twice daily insulin in children and
      adolescents with new onset diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  New onset type 1 diabetes

          -  Less than 48 hours since first insulin injection

          -  Child and/or parent able to read and write English

          -  Family intends to continue treatment at our institution for the next two years

          -  Informed consent from adolescents greater than 16 years of age, or if less than 16
             years, informed consent from the parent/guardian with assent from the child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic medical conditions other than treated hypothyroidism or mild asthma

          -  Concerns of the diabetes team regarding future treatment adherence making twice daily
             insulin preferable to the split evening injection regimen (e.g., cognitive impairment,
             severe family dysfunction).
