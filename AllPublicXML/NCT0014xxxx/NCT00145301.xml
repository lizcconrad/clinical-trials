  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare the retention on treatment (based on the rate of patients staying on
      treatment for 1 year) of patients suffering from primary osteoarthritis using two different
      doses of lumiracoxib (100 mg od or 100 mg bid) or using celecoxib (200 mg od)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To show that either regimen of lumiracoxib (100mg od or 100mg bid) is not inferior to celecoxib 200mg od with respect to retention rate at 1 year in pts suffering from primary OA in hip, knee, hand or spine.</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary osteoarthritis in the hip, knee, hand, or spine

          -  Requiring NSAID therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary OA with history and/ or any evidence of the following diseases: rheumatoid
             arthritis, uncontrolled gout, inflammatory joint disease, ochronosis, acromegaly,
             hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, primary osteochondromatosis, heritable disorders
             (e.g. hypermobility), collagen gene mutations, primary fibromyalgia (secondary
             fibromyalgia is allowed if in the opinion of the investigator it will not interfere
             with the patient's OA pain assessment), and systemic lupus erythematosus

          -  History and/ or any evidence of the following diseases in the target joint: septic
             arthritis, gout, recurrent episodes of pseudogout, Paget's disease of the bone, and
             articular fracture. If the patient has history of these conditions, then patient
             should only be excluded if the target joint is affected.

          -  History of severe adverse reactions of any kind under lumiracoxib or celecoxib
             treatment.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
