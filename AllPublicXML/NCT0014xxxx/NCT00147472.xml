  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the ability of positron emission tomography (PET)
      to detect residual cancer in neck lymph nodes of patients following curative treatment with
      radiation therapy for squamous cell cancer arising in the head and neck.

      Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergo treatment of curative intent; patients who
      are node positive (N2 N3 stages) undergo standard management which includes post-radiation
      planned neck dissection but two thirds of patients end up not having evidence of residual
      disease in neck dissection specimens; these patients could have avoided surgery. However,
      currently used standard tests, like computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) cannot reliably predict who is post-radiation disease free.

      PET-Fluorodeoxyglucose scanning is an imaging test based on the increased uptake of
      radiolabelled glucose by tumour cells. PET might detect neck tumours better than other
      imaging tests. This is a cohort study in which patients with N2 N3 squamous cell carcinoma of
      the head and neck undergo a PET and a CT scan at baseline and then post-radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy. Then, they undergo neck dissection surgery. The PET and CT results are compared
      with the presence or absence of tumours in the neck nodes. If PET is sufficiently accurate in
      predicting the presence or absence of tumours in the neck nodes, then a neck dissection could
      be avoided.

          1. Histological evidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head &amp; neck (T1-T4 arising in
             either the oral cavity, larynx &amp; pharynx, except Nasopharyngeal carcinoma);OR patients
             with histological evidence of squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the neck and an
             unknown primary site after conventional workup without any of the following: i).
