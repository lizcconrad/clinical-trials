  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson’s disease is one of the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases, and for which the
      mechanisms remains unknown. Since the implication of susceptibility factors is highly
      suspect, we have recently shown that one monogenic form due to alterations in the Parkin gene
      was responsible for an important proportion of early onset familial and isolated cases.
      Nevertheless, it not has been determined yet the relationship between idiopathic Parkinson’s
      disease and secondary Parkinson’s disease with a Parkin gene mutation at the clinical,
      neuropsychological, metabolic and physiopathological levels. For establishing
      phenotype-genotype correlations, we propose to compare the phenotype of patients carrying a
      Parkin mutation (parkin « + », n=25) to those of early onset parkinsonians without a Parkin
      mutation (Parkin ” - ”, n = 25), and for some aspects (neuropsychological, behavioural and
      psychiatric evaluations) to the healthy brothers and sisters of Parkin cases “+”(n = 25). The
      evaluation will carry on the clinical aspects (quantification of the parkinsonian syndrome
      and reactivity to levodopa, neuropsychological, behavioural and psychiatric evaluations),
      molecular (types of abnormalities in the Parkin gene) and metabolic (PET – tomography by
      positron emission) of the disease.

      Parkinson’s disease caused by Parkin gene mutations is associated with an important and
      homogeneous loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, which is
      different from those observed during the idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. The corresponding
      dopaminergic deficit should be associated with an excellent reactivity to levodopa, to a
      cognitive deficit and to behavioural and/or psychiatric attitudes, in relation with the
      massive alteration of dopaminergic efferences.

      This multidisciplinary approach on Parkin cases will be performed in the centers for of
      clinical investigations of Grenoble and Paris, with the help of the French Parkinson’s
      Disease Study Group, and two centers for TEP (Lyon and Orsay). This project will allow to a
      better definition of diagnostic criteria of Parkin « + » cases, which will help for the
      molecular diagnosis in early onset cases, and will study precisely the clinical, psychiatric
      and metabolic consequences of a massive and homogeneous dopaminergic denervation, which seems
      to be different of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Age at onset before 45 Presence of at least two of the three cardinal signs:
        bradykinesia, rigidity with dental wheel, postural tremor Frank response to L-Dopa (&gt; 30 %)
        Absence of personal history of meningitis-encephalopathy, neuroleptic treatment, absence of
        pyramidal, cerebellar or oculomotor signs, absence of dysautonomia or dementia that
        occurred less than 2 years before the onset of the disease Exclusion of Wilson's disease by
        usual biological tests Normal cerebral MRI

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Incapacity of the patient to understand and participate in the protocol

        Patients who present a contraindication to the realization of cerebral MRI (pacemaker,
        cardiac valve, ustensile of neurosurgery or vascular surgery, intraocular tissue) could not
        be included in the group of patients with PET.

        Women in age to procreate could not participate to the study with PET, only if she uses an
        effective contraception (oestroprogestives or a coil). Furthermore, the dates of PET
        examinations should be at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. At the first doubt, a
        dosage of b-HCG will be performed.
