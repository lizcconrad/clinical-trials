    <textblock>
      To determine whether a regimen of single dose nevirapine combined with either 4 or 7 days of
      Combivir速, compared to a regimen of single dose nevirapine, for the prevention of mother to
      child transmission can reduce the rate of development of drug resistant mutations of HIV-1,
      in HIV-1 infected pregnant women, who have not received antiretroviral therapy previously.

      An open-label, randomised, multicentre study to determine whether a regimen of single dose
      nevirapine combined with either 4 or 7 days of Combivir, compared to a regimen of single dose
      nevirapine, for the prevention of mother to child transmission can reduce the rate of
      development of drug resistant mutations of HIV-1, in HIV-1 infected pregnant women, who have
      not received antiretroviral therapy previously.

      An interim analysis of the first 61 patients showed that a clinical and statistical
      difference exists between the occurrence of HIV-1 NNRTI resistant mutations in the single
      dose nevirapine only arm (50%) and the two other combination arms (9%). These findings
      partially answered the objectives outlined in the initial objectives. Consequently enrolment
      onto the single dose nevirapine arm was terminated. The objective of the trial was modified
      to compare whether either the 4 or the 7 day combination of ZDV+3TC and nevirapine would
      result in any significant reduction in the incidence of nevirapine resistance.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Evaluations of HIV-1 resistance patterns in trials of pMTCT have demonstrated nevirapine
      resistant HIV-1 isolates in approximately 15-20% of mothers 4-6 weeks after receiving either
      a single or two dose 200mg nevirapine regimen. Although the ability to detect these genotypic
      mutations decreases to 0% by about 18 months, it is not clear whether this resistance is
      clinically significant.(HIVNET 012).

      Empirically then it would seem useful to develop a strategy to diminish the emergence of this
      early resistance, therefore this study is proposed to evaluate whether the effect of 4 or 7
      days of 3TC+ ZDV added to a single dose nevirapine regimen for the prevention of MTCT will
      prevent the emergence of resistance to nevirapine.
