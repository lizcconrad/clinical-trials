    <textblock>
      Recent studies of conventional chemotherapy for infants with high-risk hematologic
      malignancies show that the long-term disease-free survival is low. Although blood and marrow
      stem cell transplantation using an HLA identical sibling has improved the outcome for these
      children, less than 25% have this donor source available. Another option is haploidentical
      transplantation using a partially matched family member donor (i.e. parental donor).

      Although haploidentical transplantation has proven curative for some patients, this procedure
      has been hindered by significant complications, primarily regimen-related toxicity including
      infection and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Building on prior institutional trials, this
      study will provide patients a haploidentical graft depleted of T lymphocytes using the
      investigational device, CliniMACS selection system. One week after the transplant procedure,
      patients will also receive an infusion of additional donor derived white blood cells called
      Natural Killer (NK) cells in an effort to decrease risks for rejection of the graft, disease
      relapse, and regimen related toxicity. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate 1
      year survival in infants with high risk hematologic malignancies who receive this study
      treatment.

      Secondary objectives for this study include the following:

        -  To estimate the incidence of three transplant-related adverse outcomes (i.e.,
           regimen-related mortality, engraftment failure, and fatal acute GVHD) in the first 100
           days after transplantation.

        -  To estimate the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease.

        -  To evaluate those factors that affect one-year survival.

        -  To assess the kinetics of lymphohematopoietic reconstitution.

        -  To assess the frequency and clinical relevance of minimal residual disease (MRD) before
           and after transplantation.

        -  To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for long-term neurocognitive deficit and
           organ dysfunction.

Study participants received a non-TBI based preparative regimen consisting of Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, and muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) followed by an infusion of a T-lymphocyte depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell graft. Seven days posttransplant, participants received an infusion of additional donor derived cells called natural killer (NK) cells.

        <title>Factors Affecting One-year Survival: Match N/6 HLA Loci</title>
        <description>HLA typing determined the degree of match by looking at 6 different HLA loci. The results indicate the number of the 6 loci that matched for each participant. Due to small sample size (n=14) and total number of events (n=7), the analysis to check the various factors that affect the one-year survival was not performed (using logistic and cox model).</description>

            <description>Fourteen study participants were evaluable for the outcome measures. Study participants received a non-TBI based preparative regimen consisting of Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, and muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) followed by an infusion of a T-lymphocyte depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell graft. Seven days posttransplant, participants received an infusion of additional donor derived cells called natural killer (NK) cells.
Stem cells were obtained from donors using the Miltenyi Biotec CliniMACS stem cell selection device.</description>

          <title>Study Participants</title>
          <description>Study participants received a non-TBI based preparative regimen consisting of Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, and muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) followed by an infusion of a T-lymphocyte depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell graft. Seven days post-transplant, participants received an infusion of additional donor derived cells called natural killer (NK) cells.
Stem cells were obtained from donors using the Miltenyi Biotec CliniMACS stem cell selection device.</description>
