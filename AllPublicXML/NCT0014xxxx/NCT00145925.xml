      The purpose of this study is to provide information on the risks and benefits of routine
      blood pressure lowering (regardless of blood pressure level), and intensive lowering of blood
      glucose levels, in patients with Type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events. The
      major outcomes of the study will be cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke or dying as a
      result of cardiovascular disease), as well as new or worsening diabetic eye and kidney
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risks of macrovascular and microvascular
      disease, both of which are reduced by control of raised blood pressure in hypertensive
      individuals. Intensive glycaemic control has also been shown to reduce microvascular disease,
      but the effects on macrovascular disease remain uncertain. This study will examine the
      hypotheses that blood pressure lowering (with an ACE inhibitor-diuretic combination) and
      intensive glycaemic control (with a sulphonylurea-based regimen) in high-risk individuals
      with type 2 diabetes (including hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects) reduces the
      incidence of both macrovascular and microvascular disease.

      The study is a 2 x 2 factorial randomised controlled trial that includes 11,140 adults with
      type 2 diabetes at elevated risk of vascular disease. Following 6 weeks on open label
      perindopril-indapamide combination, eligible individuals were randomised to continued
      perindopril-indapamide or matching placebo, and to an intensive gliclazide MR-based glucose
      control regimen (aiming for HbA1c of 6.5% or lower) or usual guidelines-based therapy.
      Primary outcomes are, first, the composite of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction or cardiovascular death and, second, the composite of new or worsening nephropathy
      or diabetic eye disease. These primary outcomes will be analysed jointly and separately. The
      average duration of treatment and follow-up is 5.5 to 6 years. The study is being conducted
      in 214 centres in Australasia, Asia, Europe and North America.

      ADVANCE is designed to provide reliable evidence about the balance of benefits and risks
      conferred by blood pressure lowering therapy and intensive glucose control therapy in
      high-risk diabetic patients, irrespective of initial blood pressure or glucose levels.
