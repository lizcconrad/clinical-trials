    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a less-intensive preparative therapy
      followed by an allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation will provide an effective
      treatment for your disease and whether it will be associated with fewer side effects.

      Combinations of high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy (preparative regimen) followed
      with allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor is a current
      treatment approach. Chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation are given in higher doses to
      increase their effectiveness. High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy generally affect
      cells that are dividing. They are used to treat cancer because cancer cells divide more often
      than most other cells. High-dose treatment severely damages the patient's bone marrow so that
      the patient no longer is able to produce needed blood cells. Peripheral stem cell
      transplantation allows stem cells that were damaged by treatment to be replaced with healthy
      stem cells that can produce the blood cells the patient needs. Patients experience a number
      of complications after transplantation. Some are temporary and relatively minor; yet others
      can be life threatening. Many doctors consider high-dose chemotherapy, by itself or with
      radiation, and bone marrow or stem cell transplantation as the best available treatment
      option for diseases under specific circumstances. However, this study will explore whether a
      less-intensive preparative therapy before the peripheral stem cell transplantation will prove
      to be safer, have less side effects, and be an effective treatment for certain diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must be a candidate for unrelated donor stem cell transplantation and the donor
        and recipient must be 5/6 or 6/6 matched. In addition, patients must have one of the
        following histologically confirmed diagnosis :

          1. Patients with previously treated AML (M0 - M7 by FAB classification)

               -  who are in not in complete remission (CR).

               -  who are in second or later CR.

               -  who have 5-30% persistent blasts in bone marrow following induction or salvage
                  chemotherapy.

               -  who have high-risk feature in first complete remission e.g. presence of
                  Philadelphia chromosome or non-core-binding factor type of chromosomal
                  abnormalities.

          2. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and IPS int-1, int-2 or high-risk scores who
             are transfusion-dependent.

          3. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who are in accelerated, blastic, or or chronic
             phase

          4. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia

               -  who are in first complete remission and have high risk disease [Ph' or t (4; 11)
                  , WBC&gt; 30,000, &gt; 4 weeks to achieve CR].

               -  who are in second or greater CR.

               -  who did not achieve a CR following induction or salvage therapy.

          5. Patients with Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who are not curable with
             conventional chemotherapy and do not have any tumor larger than 5 centimeters in
             diameter.

          6. Patients with myeloma or plasma cell neoplasms who are :

               -  stage III at presentation.

               -  stage I-II at presentation but were not responding or progressed after first line
                  therapy.

          7. Patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia who
             progressed after first-line therapy.

          8. Patients with MDS or myeloproliferative disorders who had history of life-threatening
             complications related to thrombosis, hemorrhagic diathesis or intractable
             hypercatabolic state (fever cachexia).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cardiac disease of symptomatic nature; &lt; 25% ejection fraction.

          2. Severe renal disease; creatinine &gt; 2.O mg/dl or creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/min.
             (Corrected for age)

          3. Severe pulmonary disease &lt; 60% normal (FEV1 &amp; FVC).

          4. Severe hepatic disease; bilirubin &gt;2.0, and/or transaminase &gt; 3 x normal corrected for
             age.

          5. Karnofsky performance status of &lt; 60%.

          6. Patients with evidence of HIV infection by western blot.

          7. Any conditions, in the opinion of the transplant team such as substance abuse, or
             severe personality disorder that would keep the patients from complying with the needs
             of the protocol and would markedly increase the morbidity and mortality from the
             procedure.
