    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention will be categorized as SAE.</description>
