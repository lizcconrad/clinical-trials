  <brief_summary>

      Hypotheses:

        1. The prevalence of endocrinopathies, and growth hormone (GH) deficiency in particular,
           among young children diagnosed with optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is higher than is
           commonly thought.

        2. Early treatment of children with ONH and GH-deficiency can prevent adverse outcomes.

      Aims:

        1. Determine the prevalence and types of endocrinopathies in children diagnosed with ONH.

        2. Correlate endocrine outcome with radiographic, ocular, and developmental findings in
           children with ONH.

        3. Examine the effect of GH treatment on growth and obesity in children with ONH,
           GH-deficiency, and either subnormal or normal growth compared to children with ONH that
           are not GH-deficient.

        4. Compare growth outcomes between children with isolated GH-deficiency and those with
           multiple hormone deficiencies.

      Subjects for this study will be recruited from active and newly enrolled subjects in our
      larger ONH study. The study duration is three years and we anticipate 38 subjects will
      enroll. Subjects will be recruited for this study if they present with either growth
      deceleration or at least one subnormal result for IGF-1 or IGFBP-3.

      Baseline information collected includes: height, weight, head circumference, examinations by
      an endocrinologist and ophthalmologist, endocrine laboratory testing, fundus photography,
      electrophysiology testing, head MRI, and a developmental assessment. A glucagon stimulation
      test will be performed and subjects who are deemed GH-deficient and who have delayed growth
      will be assigned to GH treatment, in line with standard clinical practice. Those with normal
      growth but determined to be GH-deficient by a glucagon stimulation test will be randomized to
      treatment with GH vs control (no intervention; observation only).

      Subjects assigned or randomized to treatment with GH will be provided with GH for the
      duration of their participation in the study. Enrolled subjects will return every four months
      to monitor progress. Subjects will undergo a physical examination at each visit, including
      height, weight, head circumference, and body fat. In addition, subjects assigned or
      randomized to growth hormone will have laboratory testing of thyroid, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3
      hormones, and fasting lipid levels.

    <description>Primary outcome measures included change in stature, weight, BMI, and weight-for-stature z-scores over the course of the study. Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated as z = (x - µ) σ, where µ is the mean of the population, and σ is the standard deviation of the population. A positive z-score indicates a datum above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates a datum below the mean. All z-scores were obtained using Epi Info ™ 3.5.4. (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA).</description>

    <description>Treatment group assignment was based on subject's stature SDS relative to the mid-parental target height (MPTH) at baseline and subsequent classification as growth deceleration or normal growth. Subjects with growth deceleration were assigned to the GH treatment group in accordance with standard of care. Subjects with normal growth were randomized to treatment or to control (no intervention). The intervention was Nutropin AQ. The starting dose was calculated as 0.3 mg/kg/wk and subsequently modified based on observed length/height velocity and serum IGF-I levels.</description>

          <description>Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated as z = (x – µ) σ, where µ is the mean of the population, and σ is the standard deviation of the population. A positive z-score indicates a datum above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates a datum below the mean. All z-scores were obtained using Epi Info ™ 3.5.4.

            <description>Treatment group assignment was based on subject’s stature SDS relative to the mid-parental target height (MPTH) at baseline and subsequent classification as growth deceleration or normal growth. Subjects with growth deceleration were assigned to the GH replacement treatment group in accordance with standard of care. Subjects with normal growth were randomized to treatment or to control (no intervention). The starting daily dose for GH replacement was calculated as 0.3 mg/kg/wk and subsequently modified based on observed length/height velocity and serum IGF-I levels.</description>

            <description>Treatment group assignment was based on subject’s stature SDS relative to the mid-parental target height (MPTH) at baseline and subsequent classification as growth deceleration or normal growth. Subjects with normal growth were randomized to treatment or to control. The control group received no intervention; however control subjects were switched (crossed over) to the GH replacement group if, during the course of the study, they met criteria for growth deceleration.
A total of 7 subjects were randomized to the control group, 3 of whom were crossed over to treatment due to growth deceleration. Outcome measures for these 3 who crossed over were analyzed separately, under Treatment Group 3.</description>
