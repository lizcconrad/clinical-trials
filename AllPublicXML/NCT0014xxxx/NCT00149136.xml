  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALL patients aged 55 years or older were treated with steroids during one week and Ph+ve
      cases were then offered a specific therapy including an induction treatment with steroids,
      cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin and vincristine, followed, irrespective of response to
      induction chemotherapy, by imatinib, 600 mg daily, combined with intermittent steroids during
      2 months. Patients in complete response (CR) were then given 10 blocks of alternating
      chemotherapy, including 2 additional two-month blocks of imatinib, for a total treatment
      duration of 2 years. Therapy of occult central nervous system leukemia included 5 intrathecal
      injections of methotrexate and cranial irradiation.

      Duration of therapy : 2 years.
