  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding an educational intervention, in the
      form of a decision board, which outlines the risks and benefits of treatment options for
      DCIS, at the time of the first surgical consultation will improve decision making for women
      with DCIS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The decision board explains the risks and benefits of mastectomy, excision and
           radiation, excision, radiation, and tamoxifen, excision alone, and excision without
           radiation and tamoxifen for women with DCIS.

        -  Patients will receive a decision board to take home for review. Two fifteen-minute
           telephone interviews will be conducted, one approximately one week after enrollment and
           one 2 months after enrollment.

        -  In the phone interviews, patients will asked to complete a brief survey. This survey
           will ask abou DCIS in general, the patient's treatment decisions, their feelings, as
           well as their experience with the decision board.

        -  This study will take about 2 months.
