      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only effective treatment to patients resistant to
      conventional chemotherapy. Donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) serve as a routine treatment of
      choice for patients relapsing following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The present
      proposal is presented for introducing the use of immune rather than naive donor lymphocytes
      for patients with resistant relapse and resistant to DLI. DLI primed in-vitro against tumor
      cells of host origin or against host alloantigens presented by parental alloantigens in one
      way mixed lymphocytes culture can induce much more than potent graft-vs-leukemia and
      graft-vs-tumor effects, while down-regulating graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hematologic malignancy or metastatic solid tumor relapsing following
             allogeneic bone marrow or blood stem cell transplantation (alloBMT) or
             non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation resistant to DLI with no GVHD when taken
             off anti-GVHD prophylaxis.

          -  Patients with documented chimerism to confirm induction of host-vs-graft
             transplantation tolerance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not consenting to participate in the study, or minors without approved
             parental consent.

          -  Patients with other diseases or complications that may limit their life span other
             than their basic disease.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Non-compliant patients or patients with poor performance status with life expectancy,
             e.g. 6 weeks.
