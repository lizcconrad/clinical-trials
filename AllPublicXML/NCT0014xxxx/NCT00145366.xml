  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trials in this protocol deals with the effect of pretreatment with rhTSH on radioiodine
      treatment of thyroid size and function, in patients with nontoxic and toxic nodular goiter.
      It is an introduction of a novel principle, based on prospective, randomized double blind
      investigations. Attached to this, we investigate the acute effects of rhTSH on thyroid size
      (measured by ultrasonography), both in healthy individuals and in patients with nontoxic
      nodular goiter. Thus, the investigations are divided into 4 categories listed below:

        1. Prospective randomized double blind study of pretreatment with 0.3 mg recombinant human
           TSH for the effect of radioiodine in nontoxic multinodular goiter.

        2. Prospective randomized double blind study of the pretreatment with 0.3 mg recombinant
           human TSH for the effect of radioiodine on thyroid size and function in patients with a
           very large (&gt;100 ml) nontoxic or toxic goiter.

        3. Does administration of 0.9 mg recombinant human TSH affect thyroid function and volume
           in healthy individuals? A randomized double-blind cross-over trial.

        4. Does administration of 0.3 mg recombinant human TSH affect thyroid function and volume
           in healthy individuals and in patients with multinodular non-toxic goiter? A randomized
           double-blind cross-over trial.

           As a final note we investigate, in a pilot-study;

        5. The influence of rhTSH on thyroid radioiodine uptake in patients with hyperthyroidism
           treated with continuous block-replacement therapy.
