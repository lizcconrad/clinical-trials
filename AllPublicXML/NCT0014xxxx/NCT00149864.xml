    <textblock>
      Aim of study is to collect long term safety data on enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium 720
      mg bid in combination with cyclosporine with/without steroids in regard to adverse events,
      serious adverse events, and patient and graft survival. After successful completion of the
      study CERL080A302, patients who previously were receiving enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium
      or MMF were given opportunity to remain on enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium or convert MMF
      to enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium.
