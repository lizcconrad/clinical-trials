  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteopenia and osteoporosis are increasingly reported in HIV-infected patients, and appear to
      be more frequent than in general population. However, pathogenesis remains unclear, and
      published studies still give non concordant results.

      We therefore started a prospective study, to assess the potential role of ARV in the
      occurrence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. BMD evolution over a 2-years period of follow-up,
      will be compared between patients starting ARV therapy, and subjects without HAART (no
      indication of treatment). A correlation between BMD and several factors will be looked at
      (see below).

      This study with individual direct benefice, is conducted in 3 outpatients clinics
      (Strasbourg, Colmar, Mulhouse) in collaboration with the rheumatologic teams. 60 patients are
      planned to be included over a 3-years inclusion period
