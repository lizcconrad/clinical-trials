      improves lung function in patients with mild COPD according to Swedish guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an initial screening at the screening visit(Visit 1), patients enter a 2 week
      run-in period. Patients are allowed to take salbutamol (Ventoline, Diskus, 0.2 mg) prn as
      rescue medication and have to record their daily use of it on the Patient's Diary. Patients
      who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the check at Visit 2 will be
      randomised thereafter into the randomised treatment period of the study during which they
      will receive either tiotropium(Spiriva) or placebo in blinded fashion.

      On Day 0 (Visit 2), the first administration of blinded study medication (tiotropium(Spiriva)
      or matching placebo) will be performed at the study site, after a pre-dose pulmonary function
      test (PFT) has been carried out. First administration of blinded study medication will be
      monitored by the investigator. Post dose PFTs will be performed at 30 min, 1 and 2 hours.

      On Days 1 to 83 except Day 14, the blinded study medication will be self-administered by the
      patients at home. The patients will inhale one capsule (tiotropium)(Spiriva) or matching
      placebo) using the HandiHaler device once daily in the morning. The morning dose of the
      blinded study medication should be taken at approximately the same time each morning between
      7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.

      At visit 3 and 4 PFTs will be performed predose and post dose at 30 minutes, 1 and 2 hours

      Study Hypothesis:

      The rationale of the study is to show that treatment with tiotropium (Spiriva) 18 ?g
      inhalation capsule via HandiHaler once daily improves FEV1 when compared with placebo in
      patients with mild COPD according to Swedish guidelines, i.e., a post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;
      60% of predicted normal and FEV1 &lt; 70% of FVC.

      Comparison(s):

      One group will be treated with inhalation powder capsules of tiotropium (Spiriva), 18
      micrograms once daily. The other group will be treated with matching placebo. Randomisation
      is 1:1

             infarction.

          4. Patients with any unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia, including patients
             with a newly diagnosed, clinically relevant arrhythmia on the electrocardiogram (ECG)
             performed at Visit 1 as well as patients with cardiac arrhythmia requiring an
             intervention (i.e., hospitalisation, cardioversion, pacemaker placement, and automatic
             implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) placement) or a change in drug therapy during
             the last year prior to Visit 1.

          5. Patients who regularly use oxygen therapy.

          6. Patients with known active tuberculosis.

             cell carcinoma are allowed.

          8. Patients with a history of life threatening pulmonary obstruction or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis.

          9. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection.

         10. Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or who have completed
             a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the 6 weeks prior to the screening visit (Visit
             1).

         11. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other
             components of the inhalation capsule delivery system.

         12. Patients with known symptomatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction. Patients
             being treated for prostatic hyperplasia and report minimal symptoms may be included
             and should continue their medications.

         13. Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma.
