    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two different approaches to helping individuals who have
      recently starting eating a healthful diet maintain those healthy changes. This study will
      deliver a health program using an automated telephone system. The programs will be designed
      to help individuals maintain a healthy diet change for a lifetime.

      RCT is completed. However, the eligibility was 18 y/o or greater and living in Greater Boston
      area. The participants used an evidenced based dietary intervention for 3 months and then
      were randomized to 1 of 3 arms. Those in the experimental arm received a 6 mo intervention
      based on social cognitive theory or goal systems theory. The intervention was designed to
      help the participants maintain previously achieved changes in the their diet, e.g., fruits
      and vegetables. The outcome measures are fruit and vegetable consumption as measured by
      servings on multiple dietary measures as well as a 24 hr dietary recall.
