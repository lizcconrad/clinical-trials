  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meniere's disease affects a person's sense of balance. An attack can last 20 minutes to 2
      hours or longer. Symptoms include rotational vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus and a sensation
      of fullness in the affected ear and may be associated with nausea and vomiting. One
      hypothesis is that Meniere's disease is caused by the excessive accumulation of fluid in the
      balance tubes within the inner ear. Sildenafil may alleviate the symptoms due to its
      vasodilatory activity. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of
      sildenafil (Viagra) compared with placebo on symptoms during one acute attack.
