      This study will assess the effectiveness of the &quot;Keeping Families Strong&quot; program (KFS) in
      avoiding or delaying the onset of psychiatric disorders among children with depressed
      mothers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children of depressed mothers are at high risk for developing serious psychiatric disorders.
      While genetics can account for about 34% of cases of childhood psychiatric disorders,
      children of depressed parents are at an even greater risk of developing mental disorders. The
      &quot;Keeping Families Strong&quot; program, or KFS, was built from evidence-based prevention programs.
      Its goal is to provide educational, cognitive, and behavioral interventions. These
      interventions are meant to enhance understanding about depression and its effects on
      families, improve communication within families, enhance social support, increase positive
      and consistent parenting, and improve child coping. This will likely improve the children's
      mental health, as well as positively affect the short- and long-term outcomes of parents
      recovering from a depressive episode. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the KFS
      program in avoiding or delaying the onset of psychiatric disorders among children with
      depressed mothers.

      This 10-week, open-label program will involve 12 meetings, lasting 2 hours each. The parents
      and the children will attend separate meetings each week on the same nights. Children are
      prone to take on their parents' responsibilities to prevent them from becoming depressed. In
      order to avoid this, the children's meetings will focus on clarifying role responsibilities.
      There will be two additional follow-up meetings in the 3 months following completion of the
      program. All caregivers are encouraged to participate, including depressed fathers.
