  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the physiological effects of two isoenergetic, nutrient-controlled
      diets that differ in glycemic index. The diets will be studied in obese adults in a 10-day
      crossover feeding trial.

      This study will compare the physiological effects of two isoenergetic, nutrient-controlled
      diets that differ in glycemic index. The diets will be studied in obese male adults in a
      10-day crossover feeding trial. Hypothesis: Obese subjects will show improvements in clinical
      endpoints associated with risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) after consuming
      a controlled low (compared to high) glycemic index diet for 10 days. 1º endpoint: insulin
      sensitivity as measured by the modified Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test
      (FSIVGTT). 2º endpoints: CVD risk factors; postprandial studies of oxidative stress; thermic
      effect of food.
