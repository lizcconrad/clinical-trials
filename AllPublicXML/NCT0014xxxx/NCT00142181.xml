  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effects (good or bad) of Campath-1H
      antibody in the treatment of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients will receive 3 test doses of Campath-1H (3mg, 10mg, 30mg). If the patient
           tolerates these three test doses, then they will receive a total of 6 weeks of
           Campath-1H therapy three times a week.

        -  After the patient receives the first 6 weeks of therapy at the 30mg therapeutic dose
           they will be re-assessed by blood testing. If it is determined that their disease has
           progressed in the period of time while the patient was on Campath-1H, the patient will
           be removed from the study.

        -  If it is determined that the patient has achieved a complete remission after 6 weeks of
           Campath-1H treatment a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to confirm complete
           remission and the patient will not receive any additional treatment but will be followed
           for a period of 2 years.

        -  If the disease has remained stable or partial response has been achieved the patient
           will enter the second phase of therapy in which they will receive an additional 6 weeks
           of Campath-1H therapy. The patient will then be reassessed as described above.

        -  No additional therapy (as part of this study) will be performed after a 12 week course
           of Campath-1H.

        -  While the patient is on Campath-1H blood test will be performed at 3-6 month intervals
           over a period extending for 2 years following the last treatment. Bone marrow biopsies
           and/or aspirations will be conducted as necessary.
