  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of tolterodine ER plus
      tamsulosin versus placebo on patient perception of overall treatment benefit in men who have
      frequency and urgency, with or without urinary urge incontinence (UUI), with or without
      bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).
