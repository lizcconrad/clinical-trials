  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after surgery for lung cancer (thoracotomy) may persist for years and require long-term
      analgesic use. Prior studies have shown that acupuncture reduces pain and medication use in
      the early post-operative period after abdominal surgery, suggesting that acupuncture may have
      a role in preventing chronic post-thoracotomy pain. This study is being done in order to
      determine the effects of acupuncture on pain in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

      Rationale:

      Acupuncture is the insertion of very fine needles into the skin to treat symptoms. In recent
      years, researchers have come to understand how acupuncture might work in terms of nerve
      stimulation and the release of chemical messages in the body. Researchers have found evidence
      that acupuncture is useful in treating a variety of conditions, including headache, nausea,
      and pain after surgery.

      Pain is a common problem after surgery for lung cancer. Many patients experience pain in the
      first few days after surgery, despite medication. In some patients, this pain can last for
      many months or years afterwards.

      Purpose:

      A pilot study of acupuncture in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery was conducted
      previously and found that this study was feasible to implement and well-received by patients.
      We now wish to conduct a larger study in order to determine the effects of acupuncture on
      pain in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

        -  To determine whether acupuncture versus placebo acupuncture after thoracotomy reduces
           pain or analgesic use

        -  To determine whether acupuncture affects the immediate post-operative period and/or 30,
           60,90 days and approximately 12 months later.

    <description>At the time of pre-op preparation, 18 semi-permanent intradermal acupuncture studs will be placed at acupuncture points in the back, two will be placed in the legs and two in the ear. All studs will be replaced when the epidural is removed or, for patients without epidurals, shortly before discharge. The new leg and auricular studs will then be removed at eleven days; the new back studs will be removed at the three week post-discharge consult.</description>

    <description>The treatment is the same as for the true acupuncture group, with the following exceptions. The studs in the back will be dummy studs have no needle and that have been used in previous research at MSKCC. The back studs will be placed halfway between the upper and lower border of spinous processes T2 to T10, approximately 0.5 cun (~1.25cm) from the spine. The leg studs will be placed at 2 cun (~5cm) posterior to GB34 on the posterior of the lower leg. No studs will be placed in the ear; rather studs will be placed on the anterior arm, 3 cun (~ 5cm) proximal and 3 cun (~ 5cm) medial to the midpoint of the antecubital crease.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing unilateral thoracotomy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
             (MSKCC)

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following procedures: hemiclamshell, clamshell, extrapleural approach,
             chest wall involvement, esophagectomy. These more extensive procedures have a higher
             risk of complications.

          -  Acupuncture treatment in the previous six weeks, to discount any persisting effect of
             acupuncture

          -  Platelets &lt; 20,000 or International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 2.5 or absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 0.5; though it would be unusual for any patient to be
             operated on with such values, it seems wise as a precautionary measure to avoid risk
             of bleeding from acupuncture.

          -  Known cardiac conditions constituting a high or moderate risk of endocarditis as
             defined by the American Heart Association criteria

          -  Patients unable to remove studs without assistance, who have no home assistance, and
             who are unable or unwilling to return to the hospital in the event that they decide to
             remove studs before the post-discharge visit.
