      1. To determine and compare the efficacy of Tacrolimus/Rapa versus Tacrolimus/MMF-based
           immunosuppression (in conjunction with initial short-term steroids and polyclonal
           antibody administration) in Type 1-diabetic patients undergoing simultaneous
           pancreas/kidney allograft transplantation.

        2. To evaluate the safety of Tacrolimus/Rapa versus Tacrolimus/MMF in terms of drug-related
           complications and overimmunosuppression-associated complications, particularly under
           monitoring of the pharmacokinetic profile of all drugs administered.

      This will be a controlled, randomised study, to be performed in 15-20 pancreas
      transplantation centers throughout Europe. Patients will be randomised into one of two
      treatment groups. Group 1 will receive Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil (= best group in
      EuroSPK001 trial). Group 2 will receive Tacrolimus and Sirolimus. Both groups will receive in
      association short-term corticosteroids and polyclonal antibody preparation. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio before transplantation. The
      study will last 3 years, with a first interim analysis of the data at 6 months and a complete
      analysis at 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients, of 18 to 55 years of age, with end-stage, C-peptide-negative,
             Type 1-diabetic nephropathy.

          2. Female patients of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test and must agree
             to maintain effective birth control practice throughout the study period (3 years).

          3. Patient must have signed the Patient Informed Consent Form.

          4. Patient must receive a primary simultaneous pancreas/kidney (SPK) cadaveric
             transplant, with either intestinal or bladder and either portal or systemic venous
             drainages.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          2. Patient is allergic or intolerant to Mycophenolate Mofetil, Sirolimus, Tacrolimus or
             other macrolides, or any compounds structurally related to these compounds.

          3. Patient has a positive T-cell crossmatch on the most recent serum specimen.

          4. Patient is known for active liver disease or has significant liver disease, defined by
             ASAT and ALAT serum levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal.

          5. Patient has malignancy or history of malignancy, with the exception of adequately
             treated localised squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma, without recurrence.

          6. Patient has been included in another clinical trial protocol for any investigational
             drug within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.

          7. Patient has any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder or condition, which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may invalidate communication.

          8. Patient receives a SPK transplant from a living donor, or receives segmental
             pancreatic transplant, or a previous kidney transplant alone.

          9. Pancreatic duct occlusion technique .
