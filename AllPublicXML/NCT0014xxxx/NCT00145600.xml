    <textblock>
      With the success of current chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, the goal of this protocol is
      to maintain the currently successful cure rate and reduce treatment related side effects and
      long term toxicity. The main purpose of this study is to estimate the event free survival of
      patients treated with risk-adapted therapy compared to historical controls.

      This study will evaluate the following objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of 4 cycles of VAMP chemotherapy alone in patients with
           favorable risk Hodgkin's disease who achieve a complete response after 2 cycles of VAMP
           chemotherapy.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of 4 cycles VAMP chemotherapy plus low dose RT in patients with
           favorable risk Hodgkin's disease who achieve a partial response after 2 cycles of VAMP
           chemotherapy.

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of 2 alternating cycles of VAMP/COP chemotherapy (total 4
           cycles of chemotherapy) plus low-dose, involved-field RT in children with intermediate
           risk Hodgkin's disease.

        4. To evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy plus low-dose,
           involved-field RT in children with unfavorable risk Hodgkin's disease.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate patient quality of life during and after treatment from the patient and
           parent perspective.

        2. To compare patient and parental ratings of treatment-related symptoms and patient
           physical, psychological, social and cognitive functioning before the first treatment (T1
           - baseline); after Cycle 2 or after 8 weeks of Stanford V (T2 - Evaluate Response);
           after cycle 4 or after 12 weeks of Stanford V and before or on the first day of
           radiation (as applicable) (T3); at the conclusion of radiation or within a few days
           following the end of radiation (as applicable) (T4); and at 3 to 6 months after
           completion of therapy follow-up evaluation (T5).

        <title>Correlation of Agreement Between Patient Physical QoL and Parent Proxy Physical QoL at Multiple Time Points.</title>
        <description>Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy physical quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 4. Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

        <population>Each participating institution made the decision to complete or not complete the QoL secondary aim. Of 296 eligible participants, 178 participated in the QoL assessment. For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy.</population>

        <description>Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy social quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 4. Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy.</population>

        <description>Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy school quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 4. Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales.

          <description>Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy school quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 4. Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
          <population>Each participating institution made the decision to complete or not complete the QoL secondary aim. Of 296 eligible participants, 178 participated in the QoL assessment. For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy.</population>

        <title>Correlation of Agreement Between Patient Peds QL4 (Composite) QoL and Parent Proxy Peds QL4 (Composite) QoL at Multiple Time Points.</title>
        <description>Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy Peds QL4 (composite) quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 4. Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>At Diagnosis (T1), completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy (T2), completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (T3), and 3-6 months after the completion of therapy (T5).</time_frame>
        <population>Each participating institution made the decision to complete or not complete the QoL secondary aim. Of 296 eligible participants, 178 participated in the QoL assessment. For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy.</population>

        <title>Correlation of Agreement Between Patient Nausea QoL and Parent Proxy Nausea QoL at Multiple Time Points.</title>
        <description>Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy nausea quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 3. Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>At completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy (T2), completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (T3), and 3-6 months after the completion of therapy (T5)</time_frame>
        <population>Of 296 eligible, 178 participated in QoL assessment. For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy. Peds QL3 is not completed at T1 for newly diagnosed patients, because it measures symptoms over the prior month.</population>

Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>At completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy (T2), completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (T3), and 3-6 months after the completion of therapy (T5)</time_frame>
        <population>Of 296 eligible, 178 participated in QoL assessment. For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy. Peds QL3 is not completed at T1 for newly diagnosed patients, because it measures symptoms over the prior month.</population>

          <description>Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy cognitive problems (child + teen) quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 3. Assessment was performed across all risk groups. The QL scoring is a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
          <population>Of 296 eligible, 178 participated in QoL assessment. For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy. Peds QL3 is not completed at T1 for newly diagnosed patients, because it measures symptoms over the prior month.</population>

Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score is the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
          <population>Of 296 eligible, 178 participated in QoL assessment. For each time point, a matching participant and parent were required to evaluate each QoL question. We had some missing data and those over 18 years did not have parent proxy. Peds QL3 is not completed at T1 for newly diagnosed patients, because it measures symptoms over the prior month.</population>

        <description>Event-free survival (EFS) is based on the time from protocol enrollment to the occurrence of first event (relapse or progressive disease, subsequent malignancy, or death from any cause). Patients not experiencing an event are censored at their last follow-up date. Event-free Survival Probability will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method with a 95% confidence interval.</description>
