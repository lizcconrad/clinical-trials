  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to establish the reduction of labor pain by applying TENS at acupuncture points
      during the first stage of labour, to assess their efficacy, and to ascertain their
      acceptability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial involving healthy parturient
      at term pregnancy using TENS on 4 acupuncture points (Li 4 and Sp 6) (n=50) and the placebo
      group (n=50). Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the effect on pain before the
      application, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after TENS. The objective parameter of outcome was the
      score of VAS decreased in each groups. A post-partum questionnaire was given 24 hours later
      to evaluate the satisfaction and the use of this pain relieving method for the next delivery.
