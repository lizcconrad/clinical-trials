  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the efficacy of Epoetin alfa DT is
      equivalent to that of Epoetin alfa RB for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD
      receiving hemodialysis

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of CKD and receiving hemodialysis for greater than or equal
        to 3 months before randomization - Mean HB level between 10 and 13 g/dL (inclusive) (mean
        of 2 values drawn at least 3 days apart during the screening period) - Currently receiving
        a stable dose of Epoetin alfa RB (i.e., EPOGEN® or PROCRIT®) for at least 6 weeks prior to
        randomization. Stable is defined as: less than or equal to 25% change in dose over 6 weeks,
        same frequency and route of administration with no more than 1 missed or withheld dose
        during each of the two three-week periods before randomization Exclusion Criteria: -
        Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a pre-dialysis systolic BP greater than 180 and/or
        diastolic BP of greater than 110 during the screening period - Known history of severe
        hyperparathyroidism (PTH Greater than 1500 pg/ml within 3 months prior to enrollment) -
        Currently receiving immunosuppressive therapy
