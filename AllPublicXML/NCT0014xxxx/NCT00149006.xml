  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol is designed to investigate the potential application of allogeneic
      cell-mediated immunotherapy in metastatic solid tumors similarly to the well established
      graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects in patients with hematologic malignancies.

      Patients with metastatic solid tumors resistant to conventional modalities will be eligible
      to participate in a treatment program based on the administration of non-myeloablative
      immunotherapy (i.e. fludarabine, Cytoxan) followed by interferon injections; subsequently the
      patients will be treated with mismatched alloreactive donor lymphocytes activated in vitro
      and in vivo with rIL-2. The aim of this study is based on the recognition of foreign tumor
      cell surface alloantigens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Consenting patients (age &lt; 70) will be eligible for participation in the study involving
        selective anti-tumor immunotherapy provided the following criteria are met:

          -  Evidence of cancer not expected to be cured with conventional modalities

          -  Pediatric patients: Chemotherapy-resistant neuroblastoma stage 4 and sarcomas. Adult
             patients: Metastatic breast cancer, malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer and selected
             cases of ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, small-cell and non-small cell lung
             cancer with non-bulky metastatic disease, and metastatic prostate cancer.

          -  Patients with measurable disease evaluable for response with anticipated life
             expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 2 weeks off of anti-cancer or potentially immunosuppressive
             treatment.

          -  Adequate ambulatory performance status (Karnofsky &gt; 80%; ECOG 0-1) to enable
             outpatient treatment.

          -  Compliant and cooperative patients anticipated to be evaluable for response according
             to the investigator's assessment.

          -  HLA-compatible (fully matched or single locus mismatched) donor available for
             allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with bulky disease or patients with brain metastases resistant to
             chemo-radiotherapy.

          -  Patients with a significant history or current evidence of potentially severe
             cardiovascular or lung disease, or other disease or clinical condition that may not
             permit accomplishing the planned treatment or drawing conclusions.

          -  Hepatic and/or renal failure.

          -  Evidence of serious active infection requiring antibiotic therapy.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Contraindication for donation due to donor disease: HIV-1; hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) positivity.
