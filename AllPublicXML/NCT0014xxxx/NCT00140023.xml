      The study will assess the clinical efficacy at Day 14-21 (Test of Cure), 14-21 days after
      starting the study drug; those subjects from whom a baseline pathogen is identified will also
      be assessed for bacteriologic response. All subjects who receive 1 dose of study medication
      will be assessed for safety.
