    <textblock>
      This extension study is designed to assess the long term safety and efficacy of zoledronic
      acid in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who have participated in the CZOL446H2301
      (NCT00049829): HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial. This extension study began after the 3-year
      core study ended. Baseline is the same as Year 3.

      <recruitment_details>This was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind 3-year extension study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who had completed participation in the CZOL446H2301 (NCT00049829) core study. The extension study started 17 May 2005 (First patient enrolled) and ended 24 Nov 2009 (Last patient completed).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients who were receiving zoledronic acid in the core study were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo in the extension study.
Patients who were receiving placebo in the core study were assigned to zoledronic acid in the extension study in order to retain the core study blind.</pre_assignment_details>
