      To study the efficacy and safety of the administration of Tacrolimus in combination with
      Sirolimus for the prevention of acute rejection in patients after renal transplantation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basic randomized clinical trial (multicentre) in primary KTX to assess the safety and
      efficacy of a tac/rapa vs a tac/MMF regimen. Tac trough levels in accordance with current
      standards in both arms. Steroids to be used to individual centre protocol. Rapa trough levels
      will be adjusted to 5-10 ng/ml. Up to now only few data (primate and clinical) on tac/rap
      combinations available.
