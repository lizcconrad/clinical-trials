  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the safety, side effects, and response to a
      combination of an established high-dose chemotherapy regimen, stem cell support and Rituximab
      (which is a form of immunotherapy).

      Combination chemotherapy is the standard treatment as initial therapy for aggressive NHL.
      Standard chemotherapy cures less than 40% of patients. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      support (or transplant) is showing some positive results in patients with NHL that fail
      standard chemotherapy. The cure rate of this treatment is only about 50%.

      Another treatment option called immunotherapy is being tested in lymphoma patients to see if
      adding immunotherapy to NHL treatments improves results. Rituximab, a form of immunotherapy,
      is an antibody (a type of protein) that attacks the CD20 protein found on lymphoma cell,
      which may result in the death of the lymphoma cell.

      The study design is as follows: Patients with poor prognosis NHL receive rituximab as part of
      the peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization process and as part of the preparative
      regimen in combination with high-dose chemotherapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) are collected and stored. After
      recovery from high-dose cyclophosphamide, patients are admitted to the hospital for
      transplant. The preparative regimen consists of rituximab, followed by high-dose
      chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented, aggressive and/or intermediate grade and high-grade B cell
             NHL, CD20 positive.

          -  Histologic subtypes include follicular large cell, diffuse small cleaved cell, diffuse
             mixed small and large cell, diffuse large cell, anaplastic large cell, and mantle cell
             lymphomas.

          -  NHL must have high-intermediate or high International Prognostic Index (standard IPI)
             score at diagnosis. Mantle cell NHL is eligible regardless of IPI score.

          -  Complete or partial response to first-line therapy.

          -  Treated CNS or meningeal disease, using radiation therapy and/or intrathecal
             chemotherapy, is allowed. Patients with meningeal disease must have cytologically
             negative CSF at time of study entry.

          -  Cumulative total doxorubicin: &lt;500 mg/m2

          -  Performance score 0-2

          -  Patients with a prior malignancy are eligible if they were treated with curative
             intent and have no evidence of active disease.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing.

          -  Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:
