  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MEK is a critical member of the MAPK pathway involved in growth and survival of cancer cells.
      PD-325901 is a new drug designed to block this pathway and kill cancer cells. The purpose of
      this study is to study the effectiveness of PD-325901 in patients with colon cancer, breast
      cancer, and melanoma. PD-325901 will be given by mouth as a pill twice a day, CT scans will
      be done and biopsies will be taken of a tumor before and once during treatment to measure the
      effects of the drug. Blood samples will be taken to measure the amount of drug in the blood.

      The study prematurely discontinued on March 15, 2007 due to a safety concern, specifically
      ocular and neurological toxicity presented at 10 mg twice-a-day and higher doses.
