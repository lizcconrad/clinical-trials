      This study aims to assess the short term efficacy of a combination of rituximab and low-dose
      radiotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab and low-dose total-nodal irradiation both have shown promising activity in patients
      with NHL. Moreover, the radiolabelled antibody Zevalin has been approved for the treatment of
      relapsed NHL. The patients in this study have a poor prognosis. The treatment strategy aims
      to control the disease and to ameliorate disease related symptoms with minimal toxicity.
      Both, rituximab and low-dose radiotherapy are associated with minor toxicity if applied
      alone.

      The primary objective of the study is therefore to assess the short term efficacy of a
      combination of rituximab and low-dose radiotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
