      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of nebivolol on blood pressure and heart
      rate in African American patients with hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the established benefits of beta-blockers, their use is limited by their side effect
      profile and by a perception of reduced efficacy in certain populations such as African
      Americans (Amudha, 2003). This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo and active-controlled,
      multi-center, parallel group, forced titration study. Patients will be stratified across all
      treatment arms by age, gender, and diabetes status (history of diabetes mellitus vs no
      history of diabetes mellitus). The study consists of 3 periods: screening run-in,
      double-blind, randomized, forced titration and double-blind, washout period (only for
      patients who complete the double-blind, forced titration period and who are not participating
      in the long-term follow-up study). After a 14-28 day, single-blind, placebo controlled,
      run-in period, which includes washout (if applicable), eligible patients will be randomized
      to one of 3 treatment regimens for approximately 12 weeks.

      This study will test the safety and efficacy of Nebivolol in the treatment of African
      American patients with hypertension.
