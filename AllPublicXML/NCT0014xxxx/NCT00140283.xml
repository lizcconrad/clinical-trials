  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great variability in the different primary care teams referral rate. And
      variability means inappropriateness somewhere in the process of care. The most important
      determinants of the variability are the attitude and knowledge of the professional, the
      existence and availability of evidence, the resources available and the professionals
      practice style. To improve the knowledge of the professionals could be a way to decrease the
      variability. Because of this, we have the aim to determinate the effectiveness of an
      educational intervention to improve the primary care teams from the city of Barcelona
      referral rate.

      The aim of our study is to determinate if an active educational intervention (interactive
      sessions discussing clinical cases plus the minimal intervention) reduces the professionals
      referral rate compared with the minimal intervention group (written adapted clinical practice
      guidelines and feedback about their referral rate compared with other primary care teams). It
      is a cluster-randomized controlled trial stratified by the percentage of reform and the
      referral rate. The subjects were primary care physicians of the 51 teams of Barcelona city
      attending 1.160.748 inhabitants.
