  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess the efficacy of a new drug (a receptor agonist that modulates the glutamatergic
      activity) in the treatment of schizophrenia.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if a mGlu2/3 agonist dosed for 28 days is
      superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia as measured by the
      Positive and Negative Symptom Scales (PANSS) total score.
