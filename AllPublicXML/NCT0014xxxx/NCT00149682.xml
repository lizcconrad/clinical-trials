  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a web-based obesity risk assessment and counseling
      tool and examine its feasibility and effectiveness in improving the rate and quality of
      physician counseling about obesity, dietary change, and physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high prevalence of obesity and its associated health risks, physicians do not
      address weight and behaviors that contribute to obesity because of lack of knowledge,
      training, and access to resources. To address these physician barriers to counseling, the
      investigator has developed a web-based tool that collects and integrates relevant patient
      clinical and behavioral information online and generates patient-specific recommendations and
      links to resources in the form of electronic patient and physician reports. In doing so, the
      tool provides physicians with a time saving device that identifies at risk patients who are
      motivated to make behavioral changes; at the same time, the tool provides tailored resources
      and recommendations that help physicians deliver more effective counseling.

      The pilot study described in this application randomizes overweight primary care patients to
      a control group and the web-based intervention. The aims of the study are to examine the
      feasibility of incorporating the web-based tool into primary care practice and to collect
      preliminary data on its potential effectiveness on improving the rate and quality of
      physician-patient discussions about weight and on improving several clinical and behavioral
      outcomes.
