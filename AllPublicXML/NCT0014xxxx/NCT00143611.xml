      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of Resatorvid for reducing 28-day
      all-cause mortality in subjects with severe sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis, defined as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction, remains a serious
      medical problem worldwide. In the United States alone, approximately 750,000 cases of severe
      sepsis occur each year, with the mortality rate ranging between 30% and 50% for severe sepsis
      patients with concomitant organ dysfunction. As the population ages, these numbers are
      expected to increase. The pathophysiology of severe sepsis is thought to involve the
      activation of a variety of inflammatory and procoagulant host responses to infection, which
      if unchecked, can lead to diffuse endovascular injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and
      ultimately death.

      The host response to infection with microorganism and microorganism-derived molecules is
      characterized by the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins 1, 6 and 8 (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8), by
      inflammatory cells, and by other markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein.
      Inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, release these cytokines by signals transmitted from
      the surface of these cells after binding of pathogen-associated molecules to cell surface
      pattern recognition receptors known as toll-like receptors.

      TAK-242 (resatorvid) is a small molecule suppressor of pathogen-induced release of
      inflammatory cytokines and acts by inhibiting TLR-4 mediated signaling. Because of its
      inhibitory effect on suppressing cytokine levels, resatorvid is being developed as a
      treatment for severe sepsis.

      The study was ended after the DSMB determined there was insufficient cytokine suppression in
      the 150-subject analysis within Stage 1 of the study.
