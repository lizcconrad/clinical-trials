      Primary Aim

      To determine whether;

        -  Donepezil is significantly better than placebo in the management of agitation in
           Alzheimer's Disease that has not responded to, or is inappropriate for a standardised
           brief psychosocial treatment

      Secondary Aims

      To determine whether;

        -  Donepezil has a significant positive or negative impact upon quality of life compared
           with placebo

        -  whether there is a significant difference between Donepezil and placebo with respect to
           cognitive performance

        -  the cost effectiveness of the pharmacological treatment for agitation
