  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center open label, randomized phase-3 study with stratification according to
      diagnosis and baseline serum-EPO level. The correction of mild or moderate anemia and the
      effect on iron kinetics by the rHuEPO treatment with or without intravenous iron
      supplementation in anemic patients with LPD not receiving antineoplastic therapy will be
      studied. The study will be performed according to the ICH-GCP guidelines. In order to be
      eligible, the patient must consent in writing that he/she agrees to participate in the study.
      The patient recruitment period is estimated to be no longer than 18 months.

      In this multi-center, randomized, open label phase-3 study, the correction of mild or
      moderate anemia and the effect on iron kinetics by rHuEPO treatment, with or without
      intravenous iron treatment, in patients with LPD not receiving antineoplastic therapy will be
      studied.

      LENGTH OF STUDY 16 weeks

      NUMBER OF CENTERS 15

      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 66

      STRATIFICATION 1. According to diagnosis; CLL and indolent NHL vs. MM. 2. According to level
      of S-epo &gt; 100 IU/L vs £ 100 IU/L at baseline.

      TREATMENT The patients will be randomized to receive 30 000 IU Neorecormon â (epoetin beta)
      s.c. once / week for 16 consecutive weeks +/- 100mg/week of Venofer â (iron sucrose) from
      week 0 to 6, followed by one 100mg dose every 2 week from weeks 8 until 14.

      If the increase in Hb concentration is less than 10g/L from baseline (week 0) until week 4
      weeks, the dose of epoetin beta will be increased to 60 000 IU weekly from week 5.

      If the Hb concentration exceeds 140 g/L, the epoetin beta therapy will be suspended. The
      treatment will be resumed once the Hb concentration falls below 130 g/L. This resumed dose
      will be 75% of the previous dose (e.g. if the previous dose was 30 000 IU before suspension,
      the continued dose should be 22 500 IU. If the dose was 60 000 IU before suspension, the dose
      should be 45 000 IU).

      If the level of S-ferritin reaches &gt;1000 ug/L iron sucrose should be suspended until the
      S-ferritin level falls below 500 ug/L.
