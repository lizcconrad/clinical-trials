  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Merrimack is conducting a research study to see if an experimental drug, called MM-093, is
      safe and effective in the treatment of psoriasis. MM-093 is a genetically engineered version
      of a naturally occurring protein called alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Adults normally have very
      small amounts of AFP in their bloodstream. However, during pregnancy, AFP levels in both the
      mother and the fetus are much higher than normal. It has been observed that some women with
      psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis have fewer symptoms
      during pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester. At this time, the levels of AFP in
      the blood of the mother and fetus are the highest. This observation led Merrimack to begin
      examining MM-093 as a potential treatment for psoriasis. This study is designed to further
      test the safety and effectiveness of MM-093 in patients with psoriasis.

        before screening), or properly used barrier contraception. Additionally, the use of condoms
        is suggested as an adjunct to the methods previously addressed to protect against sexually
        transmitted diseases and to provide additional protection against accidental pregnancy.
