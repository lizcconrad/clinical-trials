  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and rising PSA, after primary tumor
      treatment, will be treated with the P501-AS15 vaccine as out-patients. The maximum dose will
      be 16 vaccinations, given over a period of approximately one year. Thereafter, the patients'
      long-term safety and PSA status will be followed over a period of approximately 11 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II study will be conducted according to a multicenter, open-label, single-group
      design at approximately ten centers in Europe. At least 21 HSPC patients with rising PSA
      after primary tumor treatment will be enrolled in this study. All patients will be treated as
      out-patients and will receive the same treatment. The maximum dose will be 16 vaccinations.
      Follow-up: The patients' long-term safety and PSA status will be followed over a period of 48
      weeks. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act,
      Sep 2007.
