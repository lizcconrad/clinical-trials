      A randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive approach to
      preventing falls among adults 65 years and older at high risk for falls. This intervention
      includes a comprehensive health assessment in each participant's home combined with tailored
      risk reduction strategies such as individualized strength and balance exercises. The study is
      also conducting a community-based program to engage and educate physicians about fall
      prevention.

      The goal of the study is to demonstrate a 40% decrease in fall rates. Other expected outcomes
      include decreased hospital and nursing home stays, improved physical function, and a
      decreased fear of falling.
