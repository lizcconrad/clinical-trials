  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to determine the effect of weight loss and physical
      training on quality of life, physical function, metabolism, bone strength, body fat and
      muscle mass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity causes serious medical complications and impairs quality of life. Moreover, in
      elderly persons, obesity can lead to frailty because of decreased strength, joint function,
      balance and mobility associated with aging. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of weight loss and physical training on physical function, body
      composition, metabolism and quality of life in frail, obese elderly men and women. Subjects
      are randomized to either control or 10% weight loss plus physical training.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major chronic disease or any condition that would interfere with exercise or dietary
