  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label study. It has two stages. Stage 1 is a dose escalation phase of
      the study to determine and evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated treatments with a
      genetically engineered herpes simplex virus NV1020 administered locoregionally to the liver.

      Stage 2 is to evaluate the dose found in Stage 1 to be &quot;optimally tolerated&quot;. Stage 2 is to
      assess the efficacy of the optimally tolerated dose of NV1020 by itself and in combination
      with second-line chemotherapy.

      Assignment to Stage 1 or Stage 2 of the study is determined by when the patient enters the
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effects of repeated treatments with NV1020, prior to
      second-line chemotherapy, and to determine an appropriate dose level of NV1020 in a multiple
      dose regimen for later Phase II studies.

      Sequential, open-label cohort dose escalation of NV1020 (stage 1) followed by an expansion of
      one selected dose cohort (stage 2).

      Study results will be reviewed periodically by an independent DSMB who will approve each
      cohort dose escalation.

      During the dose escalation stage, 3 cohorts of patients (3 in each) will be treated with 4
      fixed doses of NV1020, with the dose level increasing for successive cohorts. A patient will
      be observed for a minimum of 7 days after the first NV1020 infusion before the next patient
      in the same cohort is given NV1020. The first patient in the next higher dose cohort will
      receive NV1020 no earlier than 14 days after the last patient in the prior cohort has
      finished NV1020 infusions. One additional cohort (half log higher increment) may be approved
      by the DSMB, if considered necessary to define MTD. Dose-limiting toxicity will be determined
      using NCI CTC criteria and a suitable dose level for later evaluation will be selected.

      In the second stage of the study, the dose cohort considered to show the best therapeutic
      index will be expanded by the addition of 18 further patients. For all patients in this
      study, investigational treatment with NV1020 will be followed by a minimum of two cycles of
      second-line therapy using anti-neoplastic drugs approved by the FDA for colorectal cancer and
      selected by the investigator.

      All patients will be followed up periodically until death. Permission for autopsy will be
      sought.
