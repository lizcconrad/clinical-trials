      This Western Pennsylvania-based study will (1) improve cardiovascular risk stratification to
      identify high-risk populations, (2) identify disparities in cardiovascular risk based on
      race, socioeconomic status, and geographic location, (3) evaluate mechanisms for population
      differences in cardiovascular risk, and (4) implement a multidisciplinary community-based
      intervention program to decrease cardiovascular risk in high-risk populations. These goals,
      which are designed to eliminate ethnic and racial health disparities, are closely tied to the
      National Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health and the nation's
      health promotion and disease prevention agenda established in Healthy People 2010.

      This is a prospective cohort study of 2,000 residents of the state of Pennsylvania with
      approximately equal representation of white and African American subjects. All participants
      will undergo assessments of traditional and nontraditional risk factors to identify and
      determine the mechanisms of population disparities in cardiovascular risk. 800 participants
      who are at intermediate or high risk of cardiovascular disease will be randomly assigned to
      either (1) usual care/&quot;advice only&quot;; or (2) a multidisciplinary behavioral modification
      program to determine the most effective approach to reduce or eliminate racial, socioeconomic
      and geographic disparities in cardiovascular risk. All participants will undergo long-term
      follow-up for cardiovascular events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Well-established disparities exist in the prevalence and outcome of cardiovascular disease
      related to race and socioeconomic status (SES). Our previous work confirms these disparities
      and suggests that they may be related to population differences in the prevalence of
      nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. We propose that these disparities can be
      significantly reduced or eliminated by (1) a community-based intervention program that
      incorporates a multidisciplinary education program led by a behavioral interventionalist, a
      nutritionist and an exercise physiologist, and (2) a novel approach to cardiovascular risk
      stratification that considers population differences in traditional and nontraditional risk
      factors and subclinical atherosclerosis.

      To successfully implement this program, particularly in traditionally underserved
      communities, we have formalized a partnership between the University of Pittsburgh School of
      Medicine and Graduate School of Public Health, the Pittsburgh Mind-Body Center, and the
      Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Urban League of Pittsburgh, and Jewish Healthcare
      Foundation. This partnership is positioned to study the following specific aims:

        1. To determine whether a community-based intervention program that incorporates a
           multidisciplinary education program led by a behavioral interventionalist, a
           nutritionist, and an exercise physiologist can reduce racial and socioeconomic
           disparities in cardiovascular risk in intermediate and high risk populations.

        2. To ascertain whether a comprehensive assessment of nontraditional risk factors and
           subclinical atherosclerosis can provide incremental value above and beyond traditional
           risk assessment in identifying individuals at high cardiovascular risk.
