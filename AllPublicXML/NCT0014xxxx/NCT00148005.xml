      Investigation of the prevalence etiology and therapy of micturition disorders of children
      with a mental and/or motoric disability

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overview of the problem by a questionnaire, diary of micturition and drinking behaviour,
      filled out by the parents or by the staff of the institution.

      Investigation of the etiology by clinical and functional examination (uroflowmetry, bladder
      scan, video-urodynamic examination).

      Frequency:

        -  Uroflowmetry: two periods of two weeks, with 6 weeks break between both periods. During
           the follow-up period every 3 months during 12 months

        -  Bladder scan: once during the periods of the uroflowmetry

        -  Video-urodynamic examination: once in selected participants, after consent of the
           parents

        -  Adaptation of the drinking behaviour: start after two weeks of observation, after
           uroflowmetry and bladder scan. Continuous proces.

        -  Therapeutic measures (medication, miction clock): start after 10 weeks of observation or
           after video-urodynamic examination.

      Development of a therapeutic plan: adaptation of the micturition and drinking behaviour,
      anticholinergic therapy.
