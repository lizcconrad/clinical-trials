    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits occur across the spectrum of adolescent psychopathology and are one of the
      most significant predictors of clinical and functional outcomes. While cognition remains a
      highly understudied and undertreated domain in psychiatry, emerging evidence suggests that
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and cognitive training may possess
      significant cognition enhancing effects. We have previously shown that cognitive dysfunction,
      particularly executive functioning (EF) deficits, is strongly associated with
      treatment-related outcomes in children with psychiatric disorders. The primary objective of
      this project is to conduct a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled pilot study
      investigating the added effectiveness of rTMS at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) to a novel EF training program in an effort to transiently enhance EF in adolescents
      with psychopathology and working memory deficits. EF task performance will be measured with
      cognitive measures of working memory, inhibition, and flexibility. EF-related neural
      oscillations will be measured with resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG), specifically
      examining fronto-parietal gamma power and theta-gamma coupling. The primary hypothesis is
      that the addition of rTMS to EF training will result in increased EF task performance and
      increased resting-state fronto-parietal gamma power and theta-gamma coupling, with rTMS
      administered prior to EF training producing a stronger effect than rTMS administered after EF
      training. There remains a dearth of available treatments for EF deficits, particularly in
      adolescents. With an expert mentorship team in adolescent psychopathology and
      neuromodulation, this study will test a highly novel and promising combination of brain
      stimulation and skill training to efficiently improve EF (including underlying brain
      activity) in adolescents with EF deficits.
