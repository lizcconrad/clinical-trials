  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the
      impact of a multi-level culturally-sensitive decision support intervention on colorectal
      cancer screening adherence among 400 Chinese and Korean American primary care patients.

      This study culturally adapts existing evidence-based decision support navigation intervention
      and tests its efficacy among 200 Chinese and Korean American men and 200 Chinese and Korean
      American women aged 50 to 75 eligible for colorectal cancer screening. Participants are
      recruited from primary care physician clinics. The study is designed to compare colorectal
      cancer screening outcomes between the decision support navigation intervention and the
      advanced control. Those randomized to the advanced control group only receives an
      informational booklet, a stool blood test kit and a reminder by mail. Those randomized to the
      decision support navigation intervention group receives everything the advanced control group
      receives as well as decision support and navigation contacts. Investigators in the study
      develop an individualized screening plan using a theory-based online Decision Counseling
      Program, share the plan with the participants' primary care physicians, and have primary care
      physicians to encourage the colorectal cancer screening to participants. Using outcomes data
      collected by survey and medical record review, this study: (1) determines overall colorectal
      cancer screening adherence in the culturally adapted decision support navigation intervention
      vs. the advanced control; (2) measures change in colorectal cancer screening decision stage
      in the culturally adapted decision support navigation intervention vs. the advanced control;
      and (3) assesses colorectal cancer screening test-specific (stool blood test vs. colonoscopy)
      adherence in the culturally adapted decision support navigation intervention vs. the advanced
      control. Additionally, investigators in the study evaluate intervention reach, effectiveness,
      adoption, implementation, and maintenance using interview data.

    <description>Participants in this group receive culturally and linguistically adapted decision counseling from the patient navigator. Patient navigators develop an individualized colorectal cancer screening plan using a theory-based online Decision Counseling Program. After the Program is completed, the navigators develop individualized colorectal cancer screening plan and share the information with participants' primary care physicians. Then, primary care physicians encourage the colorectal cancer screening to participants.</description>
