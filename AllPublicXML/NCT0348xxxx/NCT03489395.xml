  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isolated reports have indicated that complete Left Atrial or Left Atrial Appendage thrombus
      resolution may be achieved also with use of oral Factor Xa inhibitors, which have
      demonstrated the same efficacy but a better safety profile compared to warfarin.

      The aim of this open-label pilot study is to investigate the percentage of Left Atrial /Left
      Atrial Appendage thrombus resolution with edoxaban therapy in patients with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation. The subordinated aim is the design a larger and longer study to compare
      edoxaban and warfarin in the same patient population.

      With the exception of few case reports, there are no data in the same patient population
      referred to antithrombotic treatments other than vitamin K antagonists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-controlled, open-label, 4 weeks pilot study.

      As the main goal of this exploratory study is the estimation of the magnitude of the Left
      Atrial /Left Atrial Appendage thrombus resolution with edoxaban, no control group with
      vitamin K antagonists has been considered, providing that, for the purpose of this study, the
      magnitude of the response of warfarin is satisfactory defined.
