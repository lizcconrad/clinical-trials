  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common joint diseases causing pain, muscle weakness
      and disability in older population. Quadriceps muscle weakness is one of the recognized risk
      factors for the development and the progression of the disease. Increasing the muscle
      strength could actually bring many benefits to the knee OA patients. The purposes of this
      study are 1) to investigate the effects of combining the EMG biofeedback technique into a
      stationary cycling exercise on the activities of vastus medialis (VM) in people with medial
      compartment knee OA; 2) To investigate the efficiency of a 6-week cycling exercise program on
      improving of quadriceps muscle strength and endurance, physical functions and pain in these
      patients and compare between the conditions of with or without EMG biofeedback; 3) To
      determine the relationships between the muscle activities and the kinematics of the knee
      joint during this cycling exercise program; and therefore to find the mechanism of the
      improvement on muscle activities in the intervention of cycling combining EMG biofeedback. In
      this study, we will enroll the knee OA patients from our hospital, and they will be randomly
      assigned either to the control group, who will cycle without biofeedback, or the biofeedback
      group, who will cycle with a real-time visual EMG biofeedback, during the six-week training
      program. The exercise program consisted of a 5-minute warm-up with low-resistance cycling,
      30-minute moderate-resistance cycling exercise, and 5-minute cool down session. . The knee
      adduction angle, quadriceps strength and endurance, KOOS Chinese version, VAS scale will also
      be measured at baseline and after six weeks of intervention. Mixed-model repeated measure
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine if there are any differences in the
      kinematic, myoelectric, muscle strength and endurance. It is hoped that the results of this
      study could provide information regarding the proper and efficient training strategy for the
      OA knee patients, and deliver the concepts of proper exercise technique to enhance health in
      the community.

The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is patient-administered that commonly used to evaluate the extent of knee pain and functional impairments in patients with different knee conditions, including knee OA. There are five subscales in this questionnaire.The score range is 0-100 and calculated for each subscale with lower score indicating extreme problems.</description>
