  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease with the growth of endometrial tissue
      outside the endometrium. In all its properties, this tissue is similar to the mucous membrane
      of the uterus.

      Types of endometriosis:

      Endometriosis is divided into genital and extragenital. Genital endometriosis is internal and
      external. When the inner is affected by the uterus, with the external - the ovaries, tubes,
      vagina and external genital organs are affected. Extragenital endometriosis can affect
      various organs of the abdominal cavity.

      Drug treatment does not show high effectiveness. Surgery / laparoscopic is currently
      considered the gold standard treatment for this problem, including infertility treatment.

      The purpose of our studies is to achieve substantial results with respect to tolerability,
      safety and clinical efficacy of vaginal suppository ELTA for treatment of the endometriosis.

      Methods:

      Phase I clinical trial to be conducted at Cancer Center to hold under the aegis
      UniversitätsSpital Zürich from May 2018 to September 2018.

      Ninety-four patients with the form of genital endometriosis will take part in the studies.
      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Cancer Institute no C99884.01FH339

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The composition of the endometrium includes epithelial cell layers lining the uterine cavity,
      and deeper stroma, including the secretory glands. Each layer is characterized by the
      presence of a large number of blood vessels, through which a sufficient amount of blood is
      delivered. A large number of these vessels and arteries go to the surface layers due to
      myometrium and form a capillary network in the stroma.

      In the vaginal suppositories, the investigators applied minimally therapeutic doses of
      inhibitors of neoangiogenesis, as well as other components that caused the pathological
      growth of the endometrium.

      Anti-angiogenic therapy - inhibition of proliferative processes in the vascular wall of
      capillaries and small vessels in the endometrium, is the determining factor of the
      therapeutic effect of endometriosis when treated with vaginal suppositories.

      The composition of the suppository:

        -  Axitinib, Afatinib, Linifanib (ABT-869) in a minimally sufficient therapeutic doses

        -  Auxiliary substances that ensure a uniform release of active components from
           suppositories, taking into account the dependence of this process on the chemical nature
           of the basis, surfactant, dissolution medium.

      (the composition and amount of excipients are maximally optimal for bioavailability of drugs
      from suppositories, taking into account the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and synergy of
      active drugs) This therapy has a slight teratogenic effect, which should be taken into
      account when planning pregnancy.

    <description>Local tolerability of the vaginal suppositories ELTA will be defined as a cumulative sum score of the solicited local /vaginal (consisting of subjectively experienced symptoms rated by the patient: burning, itching, bleeding, pain, dryness and objectively documented findings rated by the physician: redness, petechial bleeding, dryness, swelling) for each patient after every weeks of application (scored from 0 [none/normal] to 5 [severe]) Weekly visit of patients every seventh day from the beginning of treatment.
