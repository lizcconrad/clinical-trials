        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects aged ≥18 years and ≤65 years.

          -  Female subjects must be either sterile or, if with child-bearing potential, must have
             a pregnancy test negative and commit to the use of a highly effective method of birth
             control (see Appendix 15.6) for the duration of the study, and until at least 1 month
             after the last dose of study medication. Male subjects must be willing to use male
             contraception (condom) to avoid pregnancies of their female partner of childbearing
             potential throughout the entire duration of the study, and for 3 months after the last
             dose of study medication.

          -  Suffering from NDO due to SCI at upper motor neuron level (below C6) and emptying the
             bladder performing clear intermittent self-catheterization (CISC).

          -  Subjects classified in group A, B, or C, of the ASIA (American Spinal Injury
             Association) impairment scale.

          -  Stable therapy for NDO in the last thirty days (Subjects should maintain the therapy
             stable for the duration of the study).

          -  At least 1 incontinence episode/day despite current treatment, according to what is
             reported in the Bladder Diary filled in by the subject.

          -  Subjects with diastolic blood pressure values between 60 and 99 mmHg (both inclusive),
             and systolic blood pressure values between 90 and 159 mmHg (both inclusive). Blood
             pressure measurement must be performed in subjects with an empty bladder.

          -  Subjects with stable concomitant medication treatment at baseline.

          -  Written informed consent must be given by subjects before any study related
             investigational procedures is performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breastfeeding women.

          -  Treatment with injection of botulinum toxin, unless in the opinion of the Investigator
             the bladder activity has returned to pre-treatment level.

          -  Use of prohibited concomitant medications, such as drugs that could affect immunoassay
             testing (systemic corticosteroids: prednisone, budesonide, prednisolone; calcineurin
             inhibitors: cyclosporine, tacrolimus; mTOR inhibitors: sirolimus, everolimus; IMDH
             inhibitors: azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate; biologics: abatacept,
             adalimumab, anakinra , certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab,
             natalizumab, rituximab, secukinumab, tocilizumab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab; monoclonal
             antibodies: basiliximab, daclizumab, muromonab) or initiation of therapy with drugs
             affecting lower urinary tract symptoms (such as alpha-blockers, tadalafil 5 mg oad).
             If already present at Screening visit, therapy with drugs affecting lower urinary
             tract symptoms must be maintained stable through the study period (Note: occasional
             treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction should be avoided between
             Screening visit and Day 8 and between Day 25 and 28).

          -  History of cerebro- or cardio-vascular diseases (TIA, stroke, hypertensive
             encephalopathy, angina pectoris, MI, cardiac by-pass, CHF NYHA classes III and IV).

          -  Uncontrolled type 1 or type 2 diabetes (Hb A1c &gt;8 %).

          -  Moderate to severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min by the
             Cockcroft-Gault equation).

          -  Moderate to severe liver impairment (any liver function test: AST, ALT, GGT, Bilirubin
             &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal).

          -  Hemodynamically significant valve disease, including aortic stenosis or clinically
             significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia, heart rate &gt;100 beats/min.

          -  Clinically important abnormal laboratory findings during the run-in period, including:
             Haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL; Serum Potassium &gt;5.5 mmol/L; Serum Sodium &lt;132 mmol/L.

          -  Symptomatic active urinary tract infection (i.e. cloudy and/or malodorous urine,
             chills, fever, increased muscle spasticity or increased autonomic dysreflexia,
             letargy, hypotension, malaise).

          -  Evidence of any neoplastic disease.

          -  History of allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to drugs.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to the screening
             assessment.

          -  Any other diseases or conditions, that according to the Investigator's opinion, make
             the subject unable to comply with protocol requirements, or unable to complete the
             study or increases the risk to the subject or which prevents optimal participation in
             achieving the objectives of the study.
