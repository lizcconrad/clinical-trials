  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing an adverse event (AE) during 4 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of follow-up. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Discontinuations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>24-hour Coughs per Hour</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at week 4 in 24-hour coughs per hour (i.e., average hourly cough frequency based on sound recordings) will be assessed. Cough frequency will be evaluated using a digital recording device which records sounds from the lungs and trachea through a chest contact sensor, as well as ambient sounds through a lapel microphone. 24-hour coughs per hour = (Total number of cough events during the monitoring period (24-hour interval))/24 (where the denominator may be different if the recording period is actually &lt;24 hours but ≥20 hours).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Awake Coughs per Hour</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at week 4 in awake coughs per hour will be assessed, which is the average hourly cough frequency (based on sound recordings) during the 24-hour monitoring period while the participant is awake. Awake Coughs per Hour = Total number of cough events during the monitoring period (24-hour interval) the participant is awake/Total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period the participant is awake.</description>
