      Malnutrition is defined as a state in which a deficiency (or excess) of energy, protein, and
      other nutrition causes measurable adverse effects on the body and on growth (in children),
      and may impact clinical outcome. Recent studies in developed countries have estimated the
      prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized children as 12% to 24%. Causes of malnutrition:
      There are many types of malnutrition, and they have different causes. Some causes include:
      Poor diet, Starvation due to food not being available , Eating disorders, Problems with
      digesting food or absorbing nutrients from food , Certain medical conditions that make a
      person unable to eat Malnourished children were classified according to the type of
      malnutrition into: Acute malnutrition (wasting) , Chronic malnutrition (stunting) ,
      Micronutrient malnutrition. Malnourished children experience more complications, such as
      infections after surgery, than well-nourished children, also leading to increased length of
      stay. In infants, early malnutrition is associated with delayed physical as well as
      intellectual development.
