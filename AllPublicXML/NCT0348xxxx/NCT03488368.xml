  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most prevalent form of primary glomerulonephritis in the
      Western world. Although most IgAN patients take a benign longterm course, about 20-30%
      progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) over 20 years. The majority of current treatment
      recommendations is based on weak evidence.

      In the randomized, controlled Supportive Versus Immunosuppressive Therapy for the Treatment
      Of Progressive IgAN (STOP-IgAN) trial, the investigators analyzed whether additional
      immunosuppression on top of standardized supportive care provides renal benefits in patients
      with progressive IgAN. Patients with persisting proteinuria &gt;0.75 g/d (n=162) despite
      optimized supportive treatment including control of blood pressure and proteinuria, were
      randomized to either continue on supportive care or to receive additional immunosuppression
      during the 3-year trial phase. It was observed that immunosuppressive therapy in addition to
      optimized supportive care led to more full clinical remissions, but eventually did not better
      preserve renal function, did not better save patients from ESRD development and evoked more
      adverse effects such as infections, weight gain and diabetes.

      Aim of this planned study is to analyze renal outcome measures and adverse effects in the
      longterm observation of all randomized STOP-IgAN participants to ascertain quality and
      strength of the original trial results. By its observational nature, this quality control
      study includes the 162 IgAN patients (with the exception of drop-out patients) that had been
      previously randomized into the original STOP-IgAN trial.

      Information on serum creatinine, proteinuria, ESRD, death, relevant adverse events such as
      major cardiovascular events, osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, bone fractures, diabetes,
      malignancies and interim treatment will be collected as available from existing routine
      records until March 31, 2018.

      Primary endpoint is the time to the first occurring event of the binary composite of
      all-cause death, ESRD or decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by at least
      40% as compared to enrollment into the original trial. Secondary outcome measures comprise
      the individual components of the primary endpoint, absolute eGFR at the end of observation,
      proteinuria and adverse events. Information on specific treatments with
      renin-angiotensin-system (RAS)-blocking agents and/or interim immunosuppression will also be
      collected. All data will be recorded in a pseudonymous fashion in a central electronic data
      base located at the PI's site.

      Aim: Observational quality control study to analyze renal outcome measures and adverse events
      in the longterm observation of all randomized STOP-IgAN participants to ascertain quality and
      strength of the original trial results.

      Eligible subjects/sample size: By its observational nature, this study includes the 162 IgAN
      patients (with the exception of drop-out patients) that had been previously randomized into
      the original STOP-IgAN trial. Since this study is performed as quality control study of
      previously randomized patients, a new written informed consent is not necessary.

      Endpoints: Primary endpoint is the time to the first occurring event of the binary composite
      of all-cause death, ESRD or decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by at
      least 40% as compared to enrollment into the original trial (time-to-event analysis).
      Secondary outcome measures comprise the individual components of the primary endpoint,
      absolute eGFR at the end of observation, proteinuria and adverse events. Information on
      specific treatments with renin-angiotensin-system (RAS)-blocking agents and/or interim
      immunosuppression will also be collected.

      Data collection: Available information on serum creatinine, proteinuria, ESRD, death,
      relevant adverse events such as major cardiovascular events, osteoporosis, osteonecrosis,
      bone fractures, diabetes, malignancies and interim treatment will be collected
      retrospectively as available from existing nephrology routine records until March 31, 2018.
      The involved nephrology departments (all in Germany) will be contacted by phone and asked to
      provide these informations from the randomized STOP-IgAN patients. All data will be recorded
      in a pseudonymous fashion in a central electronic data base located at the PI's site. To
      assure high-standard data quality, source data entry will be performed in a double-entry
      mode, i.e. each data point will be entered independently by two individuals.

For GFR-loss, we consider eGFR values baseline (enrolment into original STOP-IgAN trial) and the last two available values by March 31, 2018. For GFR-loss, eGFR will be calculated using the creatinine-based, formula of Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-Epi). Data will be considered at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months after randomization and the last two available values by March 31, 2018.</description>
