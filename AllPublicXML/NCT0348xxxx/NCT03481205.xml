  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of performing remote limb
      ischemic conditioning (RLIC) using the Doctormate device, a special blood pressure device
      used to perform RLIC, on patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion
      being transported to a thrombectomy capable center by the helicopter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 15 subjects presenting to a community hospital with signs and symptoms of
      ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, transported to a comprehensive stroke center
      by aircew will receive RLIC using the Doctormate device.

      The RLIC treatment will consist of 3-5 cycles ( depending on transportation time) of 5
      minutes inflations of both blood pressure cuffs simultaneously. Blood pressure will be 200 mm
      HG with 5 minutes of reperfusion between each inflation.

      Subjects will be evaluated upon arrival to the comprehensive stroke center and evaluated for
      side effects.

      The study will be conducted at one site ( University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics)
