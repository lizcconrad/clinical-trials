  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vecchione et al showed that suppression of RANBP2 results in mitotic defects only in
      BRAF-like colon cancer (CC) cells, which leads to cell death. Mechanistically, RANBP2
      silencing reduces microtubule outgrowth from the kinetochores, thereby inducing spindle
      perturbations, providing an explanation for the observed mitotic defects. Vinorelbine mimics
      RANPB2 silencing in BRAF-like and BRAFV600E CC cell lines.

      These preclinical data represent a strong rationale to also explore the anti-tumor activity
      of vinorelbine in patients with advanced BRAF-like (both BRAFm and BRAF wild type) CC. Tumors
      having this gene signature are referred to as &quot;BRAF-like&quot; and have a similar poor prognosis
      irrespective of the presence of BRAF(V600E) mutation. Since vinorelbine is standard of care
      in advanced breast and NSCLC, there is ample experience with the dose and schedule as well as
      with the safety profile and supportive measures required to prevent side-effects.
