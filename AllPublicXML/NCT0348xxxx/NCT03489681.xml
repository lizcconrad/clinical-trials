  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sciatica is a common pain disorder in the neurological clinic that typically present as low
      back or gluteal pain and may radiate to one leg with motor or sensory complaint. Sciatica has
      drawn more attention worldwide as a public health issue for its pain disability, high
      prevalence and significant medical and economic burden. A meta-analysis of sciatica treatment
      revealed discectomy, epidural injections, non-opioid analgesics, and acupuncture might
      relieve pain. However, the central effect of acupuncture-induced analgesia and its functional
      connectivities in various brain region remain unclear. Besides, the number of acupoints
      selection and its correlation in functional connectivity also need to be discussed. This
      clinical trial would collect the sciatica subjects assign by intent to treat, divided to
      acupuncture and non-acupuncture herbal control group. The treatment of acupuncture assigns
      randomized as high dose and low dose acupuncture group. The acupuncture will perform two
      times a week for four weeks. The primary outcomes are visual analog scale for pain and
      sciatica bothersomeness index; the secondary outcomes are Roland's disability questionnaire
      for sciatica, WHOQOL, and traditional Chinese medical constitutional scale. The functional
      magnetic resonance imaging scan would apply at the baseline and after four weeks' treatment.
      This study aims to explore the model of DMN in sciatica patients; it's central effect in
      different stimulation modality and to investigate the mechanism of the long-lasting,
      sustained impact in different acupuncture dosage.
