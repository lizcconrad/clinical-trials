  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study aims to examine the effect of classical aerobic exercise or tai-chi on
      1-year survival rate of lung cancer patients compared to usual care, as a primary outcome of
      this study. To understand the hypothesized outcomes of improved survival of lung cancer
      patients through physical exercise or tai-chi practice intervention, we will examine the
      changes in some subjective psychosocial outcomes and objective biomarkers that may be
      associated with the survival of cancer patients, as the secondary outcome of this study.
      Those biomarkers will be in following aspects: 1.) circadian rhythm, 2.) cardio-respiratory
      fitness, and 3.) immune functions. Secondary outcome measures include: quality of life,
      psychological distress, quality of sleep, fatigue, level of physical activity, circadian
      rhythms, cardio-respiratory fitness, physical functioning tests and immune function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the commonest cancers around the world. The current prognosis for lung
      cancer is poor, with a 1-year survival rate of only 42%. Thus, lung cancer imposes a
      substantial health burden on patients and society both locally and world widely. On top of
      the classical clinical therapies, additional approaches that could result in survival benefit
      are needed.

      Previous studies, including our own, have shown that physical exercise, such as aerobic
      walking, improves lung cancer patient's physical fitness particularly cardiovascular fitness,
      circadian rhythm and immune function. Another popular mode of exercise in Chinese population
      is tai-chi. With emphasis on breathing and concentration, tai-chi exhibits extra benefits for
      stress-relieving and psychological well-being. Those benefits of exercise have long been
      implicated for better survival of cancer patients. The promising benefits of aerobic exercise
      or tai-chi, as non-pharmacological interventions, urge for need of rigorous evidence on the
      effectiveness of these interventions in improving survival outcomes. However, to date, there
      has been no report from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the effect of aerobic
      exercise or tai-chi on survival of lung cancer patients.

      This proposed research is designed to conduct a three-arm RCT comparing aerobic exercise,
      tai-chi to usual care in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Recruited participants will be
      randomised into three groups: 1) a 12-week aerobic exercise group, 2) a 12-week tai-chi
      program group, and 3) a self-management control group. Aerobic exercise and tai-chi program
      will be conducted by certificated coaches. Life-long adherence to the practice in
      intervention groups is encouraged.

      Through this project we aim to evaluate if 1) aerobic exercise or 2) tai-chi intervention
      increases survival (measured by 1-year survival rate) in lung cancer patients compared to
      control, as the primary outcome of this study. We shall also examine if tai-chi practice can
      provide similar survival benefits compared with ordinary exercise. Using biomarkers including
      circadian rhythm, cardio-respiratory fitness, and immune function further provides objective
      measures for bio-physiological effectiveness of the interventions. The associations of those
      biological measures and psycho-social status with survival outcomes will be further explored.

      Findings of this study will provide crucial information on the evidence-based practice by
      physical exercise or tai-chi to improve survival of lung cancer patients. This study will
      also have far-reaching significance in providing important scientific evidence to
      policymakers to integrate physical activity into routine clinical management as an add-on
      treatment for lung cancer patients in Hong Kong.

    <measure>Levels of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year</time_frame>
    <description>To measure compliance to exercise all participants will be measured for their level of physical activity in daily living. Physical activity will be quantified with a non-invasive small-size wrist-worn piezoelectric accelerometer (Actigraph; Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York). Actigraphy has been shown to provide valid assessments of physical activity. The user-defined time interval for the count of wrist accelerations is 1 min. Patients will be asked to wear the actigraph for at least 3 consecutive 24-hour spans. Each patient will keep a diary for times of rising and retiring.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circadian rhythms</measure>
    <time_frame>Actigraph: Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year; Biomarkers: baseline and one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Actigraph monitor will be used for measuring participants' rest-activity rhythm. Actigraphy is valid and practical for measuring the rest-activity rhythm in patients with cancer. Participants will be asked to wear the motion detector for 3 full days during a consecutive period (at same time as measuring physical activity levels).
We will also measure circadian rhythms using biomarkers that have been linked to survival of cancer patients, melatonin rhythms and cortisol rhythms will be measured using saliva samples collected before and after intervention. The melatonin and cortisol levels will be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The saliva will be collected using Salivettes at following time points: 1 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour and 16 hour after habitual wake time (referred as circadian time).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardio-respiratory fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year</time_frame>
    <description>Cardio-respiratory fitness shall be evaluated using the 6-minute walking test (6MWT). The 6MWT has been widely used to assess cardio-respiratory fitness in lung cancer patients [28-30]. The 6MWT requires participants to walk on an even and flat surface between two cones set 30m apart, with the object being the participant walking as far as possible within the 6 minutes period (if participant cannot continue for the 6 minutes, the test will end). The walking test is measured in units of meters walked at the end of the 6 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year</time_frame>
    <description>A battery of physical functioning tests will be used to evaluate participants' agility (timed up and go test), strength (sit to stand test) and balance (single leg standing test). Physical fitness will also be assessed using the Get Active Questionnaire (GAQ). The GAQ assesses if participants are safe to participate in the interventions and ensures if participants can perform the exercises within the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one year</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, 10 ml of peripheral blood will be collected before and after intervention in intervention groups, as well as in control group at the same time points, for some immune functional studies. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated for measurements of immune functions. Immune functions will be analyzed by cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells, and spontaneous or phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated T-lymphocyte proliferation</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year</time_frame>
    <description>Health related QoL is an important outcome for lung cancer patients and plays an important impact on prognosis. The Chinese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the corresponding lung cancer-specific module (QLQ-LC13) shall be used as measurements of QoL</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate psychological distress the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) will be used. The HADS comprises seven items each for anxiety and depression. Each item of the anxiety subscale and the depression subscale was scored on a 4-point scale. This scale is a reliable tool, and is widely used to assess patients with cancer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year</time_frame>
    <description>To assess quality of sleep, the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) shall be used. This instrument has been used worldwide to assess patients' perceived sleep quality in both clinical and research. The results have supported the psychometric properties of the PSQI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months and one year</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured by the Chinese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI was developed to measure fatigue in cancer patients. It consists of 9 items with each item scored on a 0-10 scale. The BFI measures patients' fatigue when symptoms are at their worst, least, usual and currently during the normal waking hours, with 0 indicating no fatigue, and 10 being fatigue as bad as one can imagine. Other items include fatigues interaction with patients' general activity, mood, waking ability, normal work (includes both work outside the home and housework), relations with other people, ability to think clearly, and enjoyment of life. The interference is measured with 0 being does not interfere, and 10 being completely interferes.</description>

    <description>Exercise class will run twice a week for 12 weeks. Participants will be encouraged to maintain their exercise beyond the intervention. An exercise trainer will lead the classes. The main activity of the classes includes aerobic exercises of walking on treadmill, or out-doors depending on group preference and weather, at a set pace individually tailored for moderate intensity of exercise, determined by baseline physical functioning assessment and modified based on Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE), or cycling on a stationary bike, using a set resistance to the physical functioning assessment and RPE. A set of four strengthening exercises are included in one of the exercise classes each week. These exercises are chosen to increase strength in the leg, arm, abdomen and improve trunk stability. Weights for the strengthening exercise will be set to give participants a moderate level of intensity of exercise.</description>

    <description>The classes will run twice a week for 12 weeks with each session lasting approximately 60 minutes. Classes will be taught by an experienced tai-chi master, who will explain the theory behind tai-chi and the principles of the techniques. The supervised session includes a warm up, self-massage and a guided run through of the movements, breathing techniques, and relaxation in tai-chi. The tai-chi master will guide participants to practice the tai-chi they learn in the classes at home each day. Upon completion of the 12 weeks course, participants will be encouraged to continue their tai-chi practice, given guidance on local services and programmes they may join if they wish to.</description>
