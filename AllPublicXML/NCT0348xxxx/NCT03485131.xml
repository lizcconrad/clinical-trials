  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4 week therapeutic pilot study with a 4 week follow-up period involving inpatients
      with treatment resistant DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosis. Each
      eligible subject will receive either 20 minutes of active tDCS (transcranial direct-current
      stimulation) or sham stimulation twice a day on 5 consecutive weekdays for 4 weeks with a 4
      week follow-up period.

      The aim in this study is to conduct a pilot study on the efficacy of tDCS by assessing its
      efficacy in treatment refractory auditory verbal hallucinations in inpatients with chronic
      schizophrenia. Based on and expanding the findings by Brunelin et al. the hypothesis is that
      tDCS treatment with the cathode on the left temporal-parietal junction and the anode on the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can reduce the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations
      in patients with treatment refractory schizophrenia. The impact of tDCS on other
      schizophrenia symptoms in secondary exploratory outcome analyses together with the
      examination of the durability of an ameliorating effect will also be investigated.
