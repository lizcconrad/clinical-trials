      A prospective cohort study will be performed to explore the effect of postoperative referred
      pain in the left shoulder on short-term outcomes for laparoscopic gastrectomy .The evaluation
      parameters are overall postoperative morbidity rates,perioperative clinical efficacy and
      3-year survival and recurrence rates.
