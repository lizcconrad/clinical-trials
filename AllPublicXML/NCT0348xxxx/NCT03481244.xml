  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disseminated Adv infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in HSCT
      pediatric patients. The most common source of Adv infection after pediatric HSCT is the host
      digestive tract where latent Adv are reactivated after engraftment. We have shown in a
      monocentric study that Adv viral load in stools is a predictive factor of blood infection in
      children with digestive Adv infections. We assume that an early treatment, with antiviral
      drugs, such as cidofovir and brincidofovir, may avoid severe Adv infections and diseases and
      thus that molecular surveillance in stool is a critical factor for the control of Adv
      reactivations.

      The study has two main objectives: (i) confirming the impact of Adv viral load in stools on
      the occurrence of blood infection based on a multicentric prospective cohort study design;
      and (ii) determining the prognostic and predictive factors for efficacy and toxicity of
      antiviral drugs, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir.

Digestive infection: positive Adv PCR in stool

Systemic infection/viremia: positive Adv PCR in peripheral blood.
Probable disease: Adv infection plus corresponding symptoms and signs without histological confirmation.
Proven disease: Adv infection plus corresponding symptoms related to the infection and histological confirmation of Adv in the appropriate location.</description>
