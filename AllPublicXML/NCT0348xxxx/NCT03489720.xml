    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the prevalence and characterize predictors of physician burnout
      in the anesthesia residency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The study also seeks to
      evaluate the effect of an exercise intervention on burnout and personal resiliency (i.e.,
      less individual stress given the same workload).

    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional evaluation of burnout, perceived stress, average sleep propensity, and
      social support and coping mechanisms will be assessed from four years of Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center (VUMC) Anesthesia residents. Burnout will be assessed using the
      Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS).

      Participating interns, Anesthesia Residency Class 1 (CA-1), and Anesthesia Residency Class 2
      (CA-2) classes will be randomized to 8 weeks of an exercise intervention (15 min of activity
      at 70% of max heart rate or higher, 5 days a week) to meet the activity recommendations of
      the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion or 8 weeks of continuing their baseline
      activity level prior to the study.

MBI-HSS is a survey to measure burnout in professionals in human services. MBI-HSS includes 22 items to evaluate emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal fulfillment (PF), with scores ranging from 0 to 6 on the Likert scale. We consider a high degree of burnout in the case of EE ≥ 27 points, DP ≥ 10, and PF &lt;33. Moderate burnout will be considered in the case of 26&lt;EE&lt;19 points, 6&lt;DP&lt;9 points, and 34&lt;PF&lt;39 points. Low levels will be considered for EE≤18 points, DP≤5 points, and PF≥40 points.</description>
