  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to document clinicians variation in practice in comparison to
      standard guidelines by the Medical Center's approved Evidence-based Practice (EBP)
      guidelines, policies, and procedures for CVCs, PICCs and HD catheters by way of a structured
      retrospective review of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system.

    <textblock>
      This will be a single site retrospective (non-experimental) study utilizing the electronic
      medical record, both descriptive and correlational methods.

      There will be two outcomes:

        1. The outcomes associated with the management of Central Venous Catheter(CVC),
           Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC), and Hemodialysis (HD) Catheter in
           adherence with hospital approved Evidence-based Practice guidelines for Central Venous
           Catheter(CVC), Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC), and Hemodialysis (HD)
           Catheter.

        2. The mechanical/technical, thrombotic, and other adverse outcomes (Heparin induced
           coagulopathy) associated with central venous catheters due to variation in insertion and
           management practices of Central Venous Catheter(CVC), Peripherally Inserted Central
           Catheter (PICC), and Hemodialysis (HD) Catheter.
