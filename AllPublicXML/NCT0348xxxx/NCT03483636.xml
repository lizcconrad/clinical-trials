  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effects on cognitive performance (Power of
      Attention domain) and postural stability of lemborexant in combination with alcohol versus
      lemborexant alone and versus alcohol alone in healthy participants. This study will also
      assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of lemborexant when administered
      alone or in combination with alcohol in healthy participants.

    <measure>Change from baseline in body sway, as assessed by an ataxiameter measuring directional trunk movements, for lemborexant plus alcohol compared to lemborexant alone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Up to approximately 12 weeks postdose in each single-dose treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Body sway will be detected through a cable around the participant's waist by the ataxia meter. Body sway will be measured in units of 1/3° of the angle of arc. For ease in reporting, these will be called arbitrary units, with a higher number indicating more body sway (less postural stability).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Power of Attention, per the Performance Assessment Battery (PAB), for lemborexant plus alcohol compared to lemborexant alone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Up to approximately 12 weeks postdose in each single-dose treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The PAB is comprised of 9 tasks: Simple Reaction Time; Choice Reaction Time; Digit Vigilance; Immediate Word Recall; Delayed Word Recall; Numerical Working Memory; Spatial Working Memory; Word Recognition; Picture Recognition. Four composite domain factor scores will be calculated by combining outcome variables from the various tests. The 4 domains are Power of Attention, Continuity of Attention, Quality of Memory, and Speed of Memory Retrieval. The Power of Attention score is a composite score from the speed scores of 3 tests of attention (Simple Reaction Time, Choice Reaction Time, Digit Vigilance) and reflects the ability to focus attention and process information. A higher score indicates better performance.</description>
