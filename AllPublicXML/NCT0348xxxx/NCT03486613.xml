    <textblock>
      A randomised, within-participants cross-over design trial including 60 patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. The participants will
      be randomised to data registration of patient reported outcome measures (PROM) through the
      DANBIO app on a smartphone first and thereafter via the touch screen solution at the
      rheumatology outpatient clinic or vice versa. Outcomes are the following PROM: HAQ, VAS pain,
      VAS fatigue, VAS global Health, BASDAI, BASFI, PASS, Anchoring question, DAS28crp and ASDAS.

      The study is a randomised, within-participants cross-over design trial including 60 patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (20), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (20) and axial
      spondyloarthritis (SpA) (20) from the Rheumatology outpatient clinic at Aalborg University
      Hospital. The participants will be randomised in ratio 1:1 to:

        -  Group AT (App → Touch) (30 participants) the participant reports data through the DANBIO
           app on a smartphone first and after a &quot;washout period&quot; of one day via the touch screen
           solution at the rheumatology outpatient clinic.

        -  Group TA (Touch → App) (30 participants): the participant reports data through the touch
           screen solution at the rheumatology outpatient clinic and after a &quot;washout period&quot; of
           one day via the DANBIO app on a smartphone.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether electronic reporting of PROM through the DANBIO
      smartphone app is comparable to the traditional touch screen solution in the rheumatology
      outpatient clinic among patients with inflammatory arthritis in standard clinical care. The
      primary outcome is HAQ. Secondary outcomes are: VAS pain, VAS fatigue, VAS global Health,
      BASDAI, BASFI, PASS, Anchoring question, DAS28crp and ASDAS. DAS28crp are estimated using a
      fixed level for C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 6, swollen joint count of 0.5 and tender
      joint count of 1. ASDAS are estimated using a fixed level for CRP of 6. These data are based
      on DANBIO registrations of patients with RA, PsA or SpA from the rheumatology outpatient
      clinic at Aalborg University Hospital. DAS28crp and ASDAS are estimated from the PROM data to
      give the clinician an overview of PROM correlating to e.g. remission or high disease
      activity.

The DAS28crp score is based on 28 joint count for tenderness (TJC28) and swelling (SJC28), Patient Global Visual Analogue Scale (GH) and CRP level (CRP). The DAS28crp equation is: DAS28crp = 0.56square root(TJC28) + 0.28square root(SJC28) + 0.36ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014(GH) + 0.96.

    <description>Composite score used as a measurement of disease activity in patients with axial arthritis. The ASDAS score is based on some of the questions from the BASDAI questionnaire and C-reative protein (CRP). The ASDAS equation is: ASDAS = 0.12*Back Pain + 0.06*Morning Stiffness + 0.11*Patient Global + 0.07*Peripheral Pain/Swelling + 0.58*Ln(CRP+1). The scale ranges from 0.6 to infinite where a score under 1.3 is remission, a score between 1.3-2.0 is moderate disease activity, a score of 2.1-3.5 is high disease activity and a score of higher than 3.5 is very high disease activity.</description>
