  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Minimally invasive techniques have gained popularity to decompress lumbar spinal
      stenosis in the elderly. However, high quality evidence based on randomised controlled trials
      are not available.

      Objective: To investigate whether small size interarcuair decompression is more effective
      than conventional laminectomy in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication caused by
      lumbar spinal stenosis. Study design: Double-blinded multi-centre randomised controlled trial
      Study population: In total 236 patients are to be included. The inclusion criteria are:
      subjects &gt; 40 years of age with at least 12 weeks of complaints of intermittent neurogenic
      claudication based on MRI confirmed of LSS, with sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language.

      Intervention: Small size interarcuair decompression versus conventional laminectomy.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is the Modified Roland Morris Questionnaire.
      Secondary outcomes are leg pain, back pain and a 6 minute walk test amongst others.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation: based on available
      literature , it is believed that the risks associated with small size interarcuair
      decompression are no greater than that associated with a laminectomy, although these will be
      examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent neurogenic claudication (INC) caused by a lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS) is
      the most frequent reason for spinal surgery in the elderly. Multiple, less invasive surgical
      techniques are applied without sufficient evidence for benefits for patients or society.

      The classic symptoms of INC are leg pain, which can be exacerbated with prolonged walking and
      standing and/or lumbar extension, and is associated with back pain. Severe stenosis is common
      in the elderly spine with 30.4% of the population having severe stenosis. However, only 17.5%
      have complaints of INC.

      Conservative treatment, such as physical therapy or pain medication, may give some relief of
      symptoms. However, surgical treatment is considered to be the gold standard for patients with
      INC caused by LSS. The first technique ever described to widen the lumbar spinal canal is the
      wide bony decompression (laminectomy), which is still a widely used technique. However, since
      INC is often accompanied by back pain, and this to post-operative back pain, it is
      hypothesized that a wide decompression is a ground for potential instability. Hence, less
      invasive techniques, such as interarcuair decompression, were developed and implemented.

      Recent studies claim that a limited bony decompression is the new 'golden standard' therapy
      for patients with INC. Limited bony decompression is believed to give less muscle damage and
      thus a faster postoperative recovery. Furthermore, wide bony decompression (such as a
      laminectomy) is believed to result in lumbar instability and iatrogenic scoliosis. Performing
      a procedure with potential more complications in a - generally - elderly population could at
      least be described as doubtful. The assumption is often made that after a wide decompression
      recurrence of the complaints must be scarce. However, a (cost-) effectiveness study, which
      evaluates the effectiveness of small bony decompression compared to a 'classical' extensive
      bony decompression, has not been performed yet. The opinions on this matter are diverse. A
      laminectomy involves the removal of more bone and structures at the back of the spine which
      may result in longer hospitalization and loss of productivity, but it could also lead to
      spinal instability on the long term. However, the risk of an insufficient decompression may
      be higher, potentially leading to more reoperations.

      By the means of this double-blinded, multi-center randomized controlled trial the
      investigators will determine the (cost-) effectiveness of a limited bony decompression
      compared to a wide bony decompression in patients with INC.

    <description>A median lumbar incision is made over the spinous processes, the laminae of the affected level(s) are exposed subperiosteally, and the supraspinous ligament will be incised. The spinous process is removed. The supra and interspinous ligament of the affected level is removed by drill or Kerrison punches. The lamen is removed of the affect level, leaving the facet joint intact. The lateral recess will be opened bilaterally and medial facetectomy will be performed in order to maintain stability of the segments. When a single level stenosis is present (e.g. L4-L5) both laminae L4 and L5 will be removed. The wound will be closed in layers with or without a suction drain. Patients will be operated with loupe magnification or microscope depending surgeon's preference.</description>
