      Psoriasis is a chronic, immune mediated (type 2 and type 17) chronic skin disease. The
      production of the immune proteins that leads to continuous inflammatory mediated process. The
      result of chronic inflammation is they hyper keratotic layer of skin which gets attacks of
      atopic dermatitis leading to symptoms of itching, pruritis and in situ bleeding.

      ACE CSD, with the multiple factors that mediates the immune response and control the protein
      receptors, in addition to the multiple regeneration peptides that are specifically extracted
      from healthy skin of newly born sheep; in addition to multiple Chinese herbs that contains
      different anabolic factors was tested to be able to regenerate the damaged skin and locally
      modulate the immunity reactions so the skin can regenerate fully to replace the damaged skin
      with normal healthy skin.
