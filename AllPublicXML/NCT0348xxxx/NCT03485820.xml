  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a program designed to help individuals transition home from inpatient
      rehabilitation following an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Half of the participants will
      receive a stroke education program while the other half will receive an environmental
      modifications program.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A gap in care exists at the point of transition from inpatient rehabilitation (IR) to home,
      when survivors encounter new environmental barriers due to the cognitive and sensorimotor
      sequelae of stroke. Resolving these barriers and improving independence in the community have
      potential to significantly improve stroke survivors' long-term morbidity. The proposed study
      investigates the efficacy and safety of a novel enhanced rehabilitation-transition program to
      reduce environmental barriers and improve daily activity performance and community
      participation.

    <measure>Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The RNLI is a disability-related quality-of life-instrument that will be used to measure participants' satisfaction with their home and community participation and has been validated on a population of community-dwelling individuals with chronic conditions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS is a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure that quantifies the impact of stroke on a client's life, via questionnaire. 59 items are measured across 8 domains, including: strength, hand function, mobility, ADLs/IADLs, emotion, memory, communication, and participation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In-Home Occupational Performance Evaluation (I-HOPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The I-HOPE will be used to measure current activity patterns of participants, identify activities that are difficult but important to them, and identify the environmental barriers that influence those activities (person-environment fit).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>COMPASS is a complex intervention that combines 2 evidence-based treatment strategies at a new point of care (transition from inpatient rehabilitation). The objective of home visits by an OT provider is to remediate barriers in the home and community that influence daily activities and community participation. The treatment will include a set of 1 predischarge and four 75-minute postdischarge visits. The intervention is followed by 2 booster sessions.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Education program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>An OT practitioner will deliver the program in accordance with &quot;Evidence-Based Educational Guidelines for Stroke Survivors after Discharge Home.&quot; Topic order is determined by participants. Four 75-minute sessions will be provided. Topics may include stroke symptoms, risk factors and preventing stroke recurrence, nutrition, managing emotions, sleep, pain. Written materials from the National Stroke Association and the American Stroke Association are provided.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>COMPASS</intervention_name>
    <description>The data from the baseline assessment will be used to develop an environmental modification intervention plan. Environmental modifications will be installed before discharge if possible. Problem areas addressed are participant specific (tailored), but the process to identify and address the target area is systematic. All participants will receive identical intervention components. The standardized components include assessment, identification of problematic activities (and environmental barriers), identification of three solutions (for each problem), implementation of solution set selected by the participant, training, and active practice of daily activities in one's own home and community.</description>
