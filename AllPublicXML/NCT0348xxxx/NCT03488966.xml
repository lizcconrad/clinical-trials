  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Mindfulness Based Eating Awareness
      Training (MB-EAT) for patients who have had bariatric surgery on their weight and mental and
      physical health compared to patients who do not do this group. All participants will complete
      questionnaires evaluating eating and mental health before and after the group and 6 and 12
      months later. They will have blood pressure readings at these times and complete a
      questionnaire about their digestive health. Our hypothesis is that participants will maintain
      their weight loss after bariatric surgery and have improvements in the other outcomes.

    <textblock>
      MB-EAT may be helpful for reducing emotional eating, overeating and grazing, eating patterns
      that can lead to weight gain after bariatric surgery. Participants will receive MB-EAT 6
      months or more following bariatric surgery. They will be randomly assigned to receive MB-EAT
      right away or 8 weeks later. Individuals in the group starting in 8 weeks will serve as a
      waitlist control group.The primary outcome measures will be changes in self-reported eating
      problems, depression, anxiety, and mindfulness. There will be a follow-up at 6 months and 12
      months to establish stability of symptoms post-intervention. Participants will receive one
      introductory information session about the MB-EAT program, as well as 8 MB-EAT scheduled
      consecutively over eight weeks. Each session is approximately two hours in length. During
      MB-EAT, participants will practice mindfulness to help improve their decision making
      abilities about when and how much to eat. Through MB-EAT, participants will learn to address
      mindless or out-of-control eating, which can lead to weight gain. Homework will include daily
      meditations and mindful eating exercises.
