  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Hong Kong, less than 5% of stimulants abusers were reported to misuse these substances via
      injection. Also, it is well known that patients with co-morbid substance abuse/dependence and
      psychosis or schizophrenia-related disorders are prone to earlier treatment discontinuation
      and high oral medication non-adherence, resulting in poorer overall outcomes. With the recent
      availabilities of the 4-weekly long-acting injectable form of aripiprazole, and the 4-weekly
      and the 3-monthly long-acting injectable form of paliperidone palmitate, on the background of
      the surging phenomenon of stimulant misuses in Hong Kong, it is a timely opportunity to
      conduct an early pharmacotherapy intervention study to offer an evidence-based strategy
      aiming to stop individuals with substance use disorders with psychosis to develop into a more
      chronic disabling dependence or co-morbid state.
