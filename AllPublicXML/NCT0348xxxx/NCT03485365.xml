  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK3858279 to humans. The purpose of this study to
      evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, target engagement and potential for efficacy of single
      intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses of GSK3858279 in healthy volunteers and subjects
      with osteoarthritis of the knee. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of escalating doses of GSK3858279 in following single IV and single SC
      dosing in healthy volunteers in Part A. Single IV doses and a single SC dose will be
      investigated in separate cohorts of subjects in Part A. Part B will investigate the safety,
      tolerability, PK and target engagement in blood and potential for efficacy on pain of
      subjects with OA of the knee after a single IV dose. Subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio
      to receive GSK3858279 and placebo in sequential manner in Part A. In Part B, subjects will be
      randomized in parallel groups to receive either GSK3858279 or placebo. Approximately 48
      healthy subjects will be enrolled amongst 6 cohorts in Part A and up to a maximum of 50
      subjects will be enrolled in Part B of the study. The total study duration will be
      approximately 140 days for Part A and Part B.
