  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (or gluten intolerance) is recognized as one of the most common chronic
      diseases: prevalence of 1 in 100 to 1/300 people in Europe and the United States. To date,
      the treatment consists of a total elimination of any source of gluten from the diet. This
      eviction generates many daily constraints that would explain that more than 50% of patients
      do not follow this diet correctly. Hidden sources of gluten in a number of foods also carry
      the burden of this difficulty in effective exclusion. The objective of the ProtAlSafe study
      is to develop an innovative nutritional approach in the form of a dietary supplement to
      improve quality of life of patients. The product is not intended to replace a strict
      gluten-free diet but to propose a nutritional approach in the form of a dietary supplement to
      improve quality of life of patients. The expected benefits for people consuming the test
      product are an overall improvement in quality of life and an improvement in biological
      markers (intestinal permeability, chronic inflammation, etc.) associated with celiac disease.
