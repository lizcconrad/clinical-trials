    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the bioequivalency between the test formulations of
      extended-release tablet of cilostazol (PMR) administered once-daily and the reference
      formulation of immediate-release tablet of cilostazol (Cilostazol) administered twice-daily
      in normal healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions.
