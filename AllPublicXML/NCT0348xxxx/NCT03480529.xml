  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the immunological system. This
      study investigates reports of immunological toxicities, including the International
      classification of disease ICD-10 codes M05, M32, I78 for treatments in the World Health
      Organization (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database (VigiBase).

    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the immunological system and are
      responsible of a wide range of rare immunological side effects. Those are poorly described,
      due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of several of these
      adverse events. This study investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by rare
      immunological side effects (of which systemic lupus, immune arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
      capillary leak syndrome) imputed to drugs. A causality assessment according to the WHO-UMC
      (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center) is systematically applied.
