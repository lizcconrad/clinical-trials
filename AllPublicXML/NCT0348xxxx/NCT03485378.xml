  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase II study of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in patients
      with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and co-existent Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), to
      determine oncologic and toxicity outcomes. Patients will be divided into 3 separate cohorts
      based on the ILD-GAP index.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with ILD and concurrent early-stage lung cancer who are not candidates for
      surgery, data showing high rates of toxicity have led to a difficult clinical dilemma, since
      there are few alternate treatment options. The option of delivering no treatment whatsoever,
      which avoids any risk of treatment-related toxicity, is associated with a high risk of death
      due to the lung cancer itself.

      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a newer radiotherapy approach which uses modern
      radiotherapy planning and targeting technologies to precisely deliver larger, ablative doses
      of radiotherapy. SABR has been associated with high rates of local control. A major advantage
      of SABR is that in general, the toxicity profile is very favorable, even in patients with
      substantial co-morbid conditions.

      It is possible that currently-used doses and fractionations of SABR, when given with strict
      planning criteria to minimize the risk of lung toxicity, have only a modest risk of
      treatment-related toxicity and represent the best possible approach.

      This study will examine SABR versus a historical control of untreated stage I non-small cell
      lung cancer with Overall survival (OS) as the endpoint. OS was selected as it objectively
      reflects the potential benefits of treatment (i.e. extended survival), the harms of treatment
      (grade 5 toxicity), and the natural history of the ILD disease process itself.

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L ) is a standardized questionnaire used to measure quality of life. The questionnaire consists of 5 scales measuring 37 items in total. Categories of the 5 scales are: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns related to symptoms, cognitive function, and regret of smoking. The score for each item in the scale ranges from 0 to 4, where 0 is not at all and 4 is very much. The scores from each scale are added up, and can be combined to provide a total score.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life measured by the EuroQOL Group EQ-5D-5L questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized questionnaire used to measure quality of life and health. The first section includes 5 categories: mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g. work, family), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each category contains 5 statements ranging from no problems to extreme problems, where no problems is assigned a code of 1 and extreme problems is assigned a code of 5. Participants are asked to select the statement that best describes their health that day. No score is generated, rather a 5 digit code is generated based on the response provided, which can then be combined into a data set and interpreted in a variety of ways. The second section includes a 20 cm analogue scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is the best health ever imagined and 0 is the worst health imagined. The participant will mark a score on the scale representing the state of their health on that day.</description>
