        The study population included patients undergoing flap surgery for decubitus repair between
        March 2011 and July 2015. In October 2013, the investigator converted to the use of
        TissuGlu速 Surgical Adhesive in conjunction with surgical drains as their standard of care
        for flap surgery for decubitus repair. The analysis was performed retrospectively on two
        consecutive cohort groups.
