      Phase 2 single-arm, multi-cohort study to determine the efficacy and safety of JCAR017
      (autologous T cells expressing anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor) in adult subjects with
      aggressive B-NHL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) NOS [de novo or transformed
      follicular lymphoma (tFL)], double/triple-hit lymphoma [DHL/THL], follicular lymphoma Grade
      3B [FL3B], primary central nervous system lymphoma [PCNSL] and Richter's transformation).

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of JCAR017 in adult subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL. The study will enroll
      subjects in Europe and Japan with DLBCL NOS (de novo or tFL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma with
      MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLBCL histology (DHL/THL), FL3B, PCNSL and
      Richter's transformation. Subjects with secondary central nervous system (CNS) involvement
      are allowed.

      Once enrolled subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable JCAR017 cell product generation.
      Upon successful JCAR017 cell product generation, subjects will receive LD followed by
      infusion of JCAR017. JCAR017 will be administered at a dose of 1 x 10^8 JCAR017-positive
      transfected viable T cells by intravenous infusion.

      Subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years after their JCAR017 infusion for safety,
      disease status, survival and health-related quality of life. Delayed adverse events following
      exposure to gene modified T cells will be assessed and long-term persistence of these
      modified T cells will continue to be monitored under a separate long-term follow-up protocol
      for up to 15 years after JCAR017 infusion as per competent authority guidelines.

                  screening and one negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to the
                  first dose of LD chemotherapy). Subjects must agree to have another pregnancy
                  test performed 90 days post JCAR017 infusion. This applies even if the subject

               -  Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able
                  to comply with, effective contraception without interruption. Contraception
                  methods must include 1 highly effective and 1 additional effective (barrier)
                  method of contraception from screening until at least 12 months following JCAR017
                  infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive
                  tests, whichever occurs last.

               -  Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least
                  90 days after JCAR017 infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by

                  or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study and until
                  at least 12 months following JCAR017 infusion even if he has undergone a
                  successful vasectomy and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two
                  consecutive tests, whichever occurs last.

                       usual lifestyle of the subject. In contrast, periodic abstinence (eg,
                       calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal
                       are not acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Experimental agents within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis unless no response or
                  progressive disease (PD) is documented on the experimental therapy and at least 3
                  half-lives have elapsed prior to leukapheresis.

               -  Immunosuppressive therapies within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis and JCAR017
                  infusion (eg, calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate or other chemotherapeutics,
                  mycophenolate, rapamycin, thalidomide, immunosuppressive antibodies such as
                  antitumor necrosis factor [TNF], anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-6R).

               -  Radiation within 6 weeks prior to leukapheresis. Subjects must have progressive
                  disease in irradiated lesions or have additional non-irradiated, PET-positive
                  lesions to be eligible. Radiation to a single lesion, if additional
                  non-irradiated, measurable PET positive lesions are present, is allowed up to 2
                  weeks prior to leukapheresis.
