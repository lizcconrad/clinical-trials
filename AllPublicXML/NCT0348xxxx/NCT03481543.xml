      The study aim to evaluate effectiveness of two bronchodilator nebulization strategies in
      patients with acute decompensated type 2 respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decompensated type 2 respiratory failure during acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) is treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and nebulized
      bronchodilators. Nebulization during NIV can be applied by two methods: in-line nebulization
      through NIV mask and off-NIV nebulization during which NIV mask is taken off for a short time
      and reapplied when nebulization is finished.

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare in-line nebulization
      through NIV versus off- NIV nebulization. After starting NIV in eligible COPD patients with
      type 2 respiratory failure, the baseline end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) will be
      measured. Patient is randomized to receive either in-line or off-NIV nebulization. EELI will
      be measured again following completion of the nebulization, 15min after NIV is restarted
      (off-NIV group) or continued (in-line group). Ultrasound measurement of the thickness of the
      diaphragm will be recorded at baseline, 15min after NIV is restarted (off-NIV group) or
      continued (in-line group) and 48 hours after stopping the NIV. The main outcome measure,
      difference in mean end expiratory lung volume at 15min after NIV is restarted (off-NIV group)
      or continued (in-line group) between the two nebulization methods will be compared using
      independent sample T test. Thickness of the diaphragm and changes in the arterial blood gases
      (in terms of pH and carbon-di-oxide) will be compared between in-line nebulization and
      off-NIV nebulization.
