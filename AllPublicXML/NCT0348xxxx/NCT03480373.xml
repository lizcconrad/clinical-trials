      Aim 1: To compare the overall toxicant exposure in pregnant women who use electronic
      cigarettes (e-cigs, vapor, e-liquid, e-juice, vape, vaping devices) compared to women who
      smoke conventional cigarettes.

      Aim 2. To compare toxicant exposure and birth outcomes among infants born to pregnant women
      who use e-cigs compared to women who smoke conventional cigarettes.

      Aim 3. To explore potential mechanisms by which e-cigs could influence birth weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to examining characteristics of pregnant e-cig users as well as patterns of their
      product use, this study is innovative in several ways. First, it is the first known study to
      examine toxicant exposure to cigarettes and e-cigs in a sample of pregnant smokers who are
      using these products. Although studies have reported on toxic exposures with e-cigs, this is
      the first study to apply toxic exposure tests to pregnant women.

      Second this is the first study to examine the impact of electronic cigarette use on birth
      outcomes in pregnant smokers. Although e-cigarettes are similar to tobacco cigarettes in that
      they deliver nicotine, they are distinguished from tobacco cigarettes in that they do not
      contain many toxic substances such as carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds.
      Consequently, similar to nicotine replacement therapies they have the potential to improve
      birth outcomes. However, it possible that there may be unanticipated negative effects on
      birth outcomes, and this study could provide a signal for potential other adverse effects
      (i.e., miscarriages etc.). Third, this study is the first to examine whether e-cigs alter
      carcinogen exposure to the fetus, which has been implicated in causing low birth weight and
      in long-term cancer risk for infants born to smokers. Finally, this is the first study to
      explore formaldehyde in urine as a measurement of conventional smoking and electronic
      cigarette use.

    <description>The overall toxicant exposure will be measured at each trimester and adjusted for potential confounding covariates. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the pregnant women who use electronic cigarettes compared to women who smoke conventional cigarettes at each trimester.</description>

          1. cigarette smokers who exclusively smoke conventional cigarettes daily, or who use
             e-cigs daily, or who use either product daily and the other product at least weekly.
