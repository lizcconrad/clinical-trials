  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is still a big problem in hospitals since 2-38% of clinical patients is
      malnourished, because of the underlying disease as well as its treatment. An adequate
      nutritional status before surgery is essential in order to improve recovery after surgery.
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that providing meals from FoodforCare at Home before
      surgery will contribute to functional and clinical outcomes of patients when compared to
      usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 1.4 million patients in the Netherlands are operated. Adequate
      nutritional intake, mainly protein intake, before surgery is important to improve
      preoperative muscle strength and functional capacity. However, up to 40% of patients admitted
      to the hospital suffer from malnutrition and this further deepened during hospitalization,
      which is an independent risk factor for peri-operative morbidity and severe complications,
      ranging from increased muscle loss, to higher infection rates, delayed wound healing and
      subsequently a prolonged hospital stay. An adequate food service is one strategy to improve
      protein intake and thereby the nutritional status. Extension of the study period to the
      out-of-hospital setting is recommended to explore the effects of long-term exposure to this
      concept on clinical outcomes. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that providing meals
      from FoodforCare at Home before surgery will contribute to functional and clinical outcomes
      of patients when compared to usual care.

    <description>The intervention group will receive meals from FoodforCare at Home. The FoodforCare at Home concept consists of five to six small protein and energy enriched meals that will be delivered twice a week. After an individual intake, the composition of the dishes will be tailored to the needs of the patient in terms of composition, diet, taste, flavor and portion size. Besides the meals, patients in the intervention group will also receive an information leaflet about the importance of protein during treatment and how to reach their protein requirements.</description>
