  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      California counties are in the process of implementing a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services Medicaid 1115 Substance Use Disorder (SUD) demonstration. The demonstration requires
      that patients be assigned to addiction treatment settings and levels of care systematically,
      using comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments and guided by the American Society of
      Addiction Medicine (ASAM) patient placement criteria.

      RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, and University of California Los Angeles
      (UCLA) Integrated Substance Abuse Programs have been awarded a contract from the Patient
      Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to study the effects of the ASAM implementation
      in California. The California 1115 SUD demonstration provides a unique opportunity to learn
      about the benefits and challenges resulting from system-wide implementation of ASAM criteria.

      The study will involve surveying patients in counties that are using the ASAM criteria and in
      counties that have not yet adopted the ASAM criteria. Medicaid patients receiving addiction
      treatment will be offered the opportunity participate in the study and to be surveyed about
      their experiences in treatment. The study will also analyze data from the California Outcomes
      Management System (CalOMS) and conduct interviews with providers, patients, and policymakers
      in the state. The results of the study will help inform California's efforts to continually
      improve its addiction treatment systems to better meet the needs of it communities. This
      study will also produce important and useful information to patients seeking treatment for
      addiction, and their providers, SUD system administrators, and payers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in treatment for at least 14 days is a validated outcome measure and has been shown to be predictive of reduced substance use, 2-year mortality, criminal justice involvement, and detox episodes. Retention in treatment can be measured with the CalOMS data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance Use Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Abstinence and reduction in substance use is necessary for patients to achieve recovery and improved psychosocial functioning. We will measure this patient reported outcome (PRO) using the patient survey and CalOMS data. Through the patient survey, we will ask about use of any alcohol in the past 30 days, use of any drugs in the last 30 days, and the number of heavy drinking days in the last 30 days. These data will be collected from patients 3 months from treatment-episode initiation. Substance use is also collected from all patients treated in public SUD clinics in California at the beginning and end of each treatment episode and is recorded into the CalOMS data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment setting used at treatment initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Use of the ASAM criteria is anticipated to improve treatment outcomes (i.e., treatment retention and substance use) by increasing the use of more appropriate treatment settings for each patient, such as shifting the number of patients using residential, intensive outpatient, and opioid treatment programs. The treatment setting of each patient is tracked in the CalOMS data. Specifically, use of the following types of care is captured: (1) outpatient treatment, (2) intensive outpatient treatment, (3) outpatient detoxification, (4) residential detoxification (non-hospital), (5) residential detoxification (hospital), (6) residential treatment (30 days or less), and (7) residential treatment (30 days or more). Using the CalOMS data, we will test whether the distribution of the treatment setting used at treatment initiation changes after ASAM implementation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment option communication</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>It is expected that ASAM implementation will improve communication from providers to patients about treatment options. We will assess this outcome through the patient survey.</description>
