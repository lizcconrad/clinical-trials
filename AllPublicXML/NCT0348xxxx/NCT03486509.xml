    <textblock>
      As a 2nd generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR receptors, afatinib is currently
      recommended as the standard first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer, and
      clinical studies are also being actively conducted in other types of carcinomas characterized
      by EGFR gene mutation and overexpression.

      The overall results from previous studies of gefitinib and erlotinib as EGFR TKIs , as well
      as from preceding studies of afatinib - a 2nd generation EGFR TKI - suggest the possibility
      of an effective therapy in esophageal cancer or squmaous lung cancer. In this phase II trial,
      afatinib shall be administered to patients with squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus or lung
      squamous cell carcinoma to evaluate its effects and toxicity. Also, biomarkers to predict
      responses to afatinib shall be explored through further studies.

      As a 2nd generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR receptors, In a phase III study
      LUX-lung 8 in patients with squamous lung cancer, afatinib monotherapy showed longer
      progression-free disease survival than erlotinib therapy. afatinib is currently recommended
      as the standard first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer, and clinical
      studies are also being actively conducted in other types of carcinomas characterized by EGFR
      gene mutation and overexpression. Thirty (30) solid cancer patients were included in a phase
      I trial of afatinib, and of them, a patient with esophageal cancer had partial response.
      Taken together, based upon the results from clinical trials of afatinib conducted so far, 7
      out of 15 esophageal cancer patients achieved clinical responses of 3 months or longer.

      Hence, the overall results from previous studies of gefitinib and erlotinib as EGFR TKIs and
      our study of dacomitinib, as well as from preceding studies of afatinib - a 2nd generation
      EGFR TKI - suggest the possibility of an effective therapy in esophageal cancer or squmaous
      lung cancer. In this phase II trial, afatinib shall be administered to patients with squamous
      cell carcinoma of esophagus or lung squamous cell carcinoma to evaluate its effects and
      toxicity. Also, biomarkers to predict responses to afatinib shall be explored through further
      studies.
