      To evaluate the antitumor activity and safety/tolerability of the combination (mFOLFOX +
      Pembrolizumab) in patients with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal
      Junction (GEJ) and stomach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of perioperative mFOLFOX plus Pembrolizumab
      combination regimen in participants with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the GEJ and
      stomach.

        -  The study is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm phase II study.

        -  The enrolled participants will receive neoadjuvant combination of mFOLFOX every 2 weeks
           for 4 doses (on Days 1, 15, 29, 43) and Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for 3 doses (on Days
           1, 22, 43).

        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed on an ongoing basis using CTCAE v4.0, and
           the Thall, Simon, and Estey's design to monitor the efficacy and toxicity continuously
           together.

        -  Repeat PET-CT will be obtained approximately 2-3 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant
           combination therapy.

        -  If no evidence of metastatic disease on PET-CT, participants will undergo potentially
           curative surgical resection 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant combination
           therapy. This will be followed by adjuvant combination therapy (to be started 6-8 weeks
           after surgery) consisting of mFOLFOX every 2 weeks for additional 4 doses (total 4
           months of therapy) plus Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for additional 12 doses (total 1
           year of therapy). If there is evidence of metastatic disease on PET-CT, participant will
           come off the study (i.e., will not undergo surgical resection and adjuvant therapy).

        -  Participants will continue to receive treatment until either one of the following
           occurs: completion of adjuvant therapy, development of radiographically confirmed
           progression, participant withdraws consent, intercurrent illness that prevents further
           administration of treatment, or sponsor-investigator decides to withdraw the
           participant.

        -  Efficacy outcomes during the adjuvant chemotherapy phase will be determined by
           radiologic measurements by CT using RECIST v1.1. Assessment of response will be
           performed every 3 months for the first year and as per the standard institutional
           guidelines thereafter.

         23. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         24. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
