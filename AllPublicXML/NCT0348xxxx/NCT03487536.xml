      Background. Several nutritional factors have been evaluated as prognostic factors for
      survival in ALS patients at earlier stages of the disease [body mass index (BMI), body
      composition expressed as fat free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), phase angle (PhA), low-density
      lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) ratio, cholesterol levels], while only two
      studies have evaluated some of these parameters after PEG placement.

      Aim. BMI and cholesterol levels were evaluated as prognostic factors for survival after
      percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement Moreover, the relationship between body
      composition and BMI in a subgroup of ALS patients was evaluated.

      Methods. Nutritional and neurological parameters were assessed at the time of PEG placement
      (T0) in 47 consecutive patients. Body composition and PhA were measured in only 22 patients
      within 2 months from T0. Survival was calculated as the time from the PEG placement to
      tracheostomy or death.

        This study included 47 consecutive patients referring to the Neurological ALS Tertiary
        Centre, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neurosciences and Sense Organs, who underwent
        PEG tube placement from 2006 to 2015 and were referred to the artificial nutrition team of
        the Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, of the same
        University Hospital. All patients fulfilled revised El Escorial criteria for probable or
        definite classical ALS.
