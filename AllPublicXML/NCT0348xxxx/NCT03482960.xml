    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the capabilities of two novel imaging techniques:
      conventional 'thermally' polarized perfluorinated gases (perfluoropropane, or PFP) mixed with
      oxygen, and hyperpolarized xenon (129Xe) mixed with N2 to detect changes in lung ventilation
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although considerable work has been done
      internationally with hyperpolarized xenon MRI, the low availability and high cost of this
      technique is limiting. Perfluorinated gas MRI is an alternative that may in fact be a
      suitable, simpler alternative. PFP is commercially availability in large quantities, which
      allows multiple breath studies and thus provides the ability to analyze gas wash-in and
      wash-out kinetics. These endpoints may improve the investigators ability to detect
      ventilation abnormalities beyond the traditional &quot;ventilation defect percentage&quot; parameter
      obtained with 129Xe MRI. The commercial availability of PFP and lack of need for onsite
      hyperpolarization may also facilitate the transfer of this technology to other centers for
      the conduct of multicenter studies. The investigators hypothesize that 19F MRI will not be
      inferior to hyperpolarized xenon MRI in detection of ventilation defect percentages (VDP).

    <description>Participants will self-administer hyperpolarized xenon gas via inhalation prior to the investigators acquiring MRI images. MRI imaging will be taken during approximately 15-second breath-holds. After the MRI is complete, participant performs spirometry maneuvers in a room outside the magnet. Once a minimum of 15 minutes has elapsed since leaving the MRI scanner, the participant will return to the MRI scanner, where the second phase of the study will occur. PFP gas will be administered using a full-face mask during the MRI. Images are acquired during 12-second breath-hold after every 3rd breath.</description>
