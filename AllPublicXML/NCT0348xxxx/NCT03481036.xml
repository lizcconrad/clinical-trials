    <textblock>
      The Mukh-Mantri Punjab Hepatitis C Relief Fund (MMPHCRF) is a public health initiative for
      prevention and control of hepatitis C in the Punjab state, India. We assessed the efficacy of
      decentralised public health services and safety of 12- or 24-weeks of sofosbuvir (SOF) +
      ledipasvir (LDV) or SOF + daclatasvir (DCV) with or without ribavirin (RBV) in the treatment
      of pediatric chronic hepatitis C.

      Consecutive chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infected children [age: ≥12 to &lt;18 years; both
      treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment-experienced, (TE)] are being enrolled. Genotyping is not
      recommended for non-cirrhotic or TN patients and were treated with SOF+DCV for 12-weeks,
      while genotyping is recommended for patients with cirrhosis and TE patients. Patients with
      liver cirrhosis or TE and genotype (GT)-3 is being treated with SOF+DCV for 24 weeks, while
      non-GT-3 patients are being treated with SOF+LDV for 24-weeks. ] Patients &lt; 35 kg are being
      given half doses of medications and patients ≥35 kg are being given adult dosages of SOF (400
      mg), LDV (90 mg) and DCV (60 mg) per day.
