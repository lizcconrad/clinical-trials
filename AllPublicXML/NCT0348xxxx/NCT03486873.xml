  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in participants from previous Merck pembrolizumab-based parent studies who rollover
      into this extension study.

      This study will consist of three phases: 1) First Course Phase, 2) Survival Follow-up Phase
      or 3) Second Course Phase. Each participant will roll-over to this extension study in one of
      the following three phases, depending on the study phase they were in at the completion of
      the parent study. Participants who were in the First Course Phase of study treatment in their
      parent study will enter the First Course Phase of this study and complete up to 35 cycles of
      study treatment with pembrolizumab or a pembrolizumab-based combination. Participants who
      were in the Follow-up Phase in the parent study (post-treatment or Survival Follow-up Phase)
      will enter the Survival Follow-up Phase of this study. Participants who were in the Second
      Course Phase in their parent study will enter Second Course Phase of this study and complete
      up to 17 cycles of study treatment with pembrolizumab or a pembrolizumab-based combination.

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from randomization or start of study treatment for non-randomized participants (on the parent study) to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) Per Evaluation Criteria Used in the Parent Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response on the parent study until earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first based upon investigator assessment. The DOR will be presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Duration of Complete Response (DOCR) Per Evaluation Criteria Used in the Parent Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOCR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the date of complete response (CR) on the parent study until earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first based upon investigator assessment. The DOCR will be presented.</description>

    <measure>Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 42 months (Up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death, Is life-threatening, Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The number of participants who experience a SAE in this study will be presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 40 months (Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>AEOSI for this study include selected preferred terms from Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 20.1 for the following higher-level terms: Pneumonitis, Colitis, Hepatitis, Nephritis, Adrenal Insufficiency, Hypophysitis, Hyperthyroidism, Hypothyroidism, Thyroiditis, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Severe Skin Reactions Including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN): or If grade 3 or higher, Uveitis, Pancreatitis, Myositis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Myocarditis, Encephalitis, Sarcoidosis, Infusion Reactions and Myasthenic Syndrome. The number of participants who experience an AEOSI in this study will be presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Events of Clinical Interest (ECI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 40 months (Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>ECIs for this study include: 1) An overdose of Sponsor's product, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results or 2) An elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) lab value that is ≥3X the upper limit of normal (ULN) and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is ≥2X ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is &lt;2X ULN, as determined by way of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing. The number of participants who experience an ECI in this study will be presented.</description>
