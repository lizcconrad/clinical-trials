  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase I/II trial where allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are
      injected intracfect into the lumbar facet joints. Forty (40) subjects are scheduled to
      undergo injection after meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluate at
      baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 40 subjects that will be randomized into the trial into one of 4 groups. In the
      pilot phase 5 subjects will be enrolled into Group 1, and another 5 subjects will be enrolled
      into Group 2. Subjects in group 1 will receive placebo but will be eligible for a cross over
      phase where they will receive a injection of the study investigational product.

      In the pilot phase, the first three (3) subjects in each treatment group will not be treated
      less than 10 days apart.

      Following the pilot study, thirty (30) subjects will be scheduled to undergo CT guided facet
      injection of the lumbar facet joints using a posterior approach after meeting all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline evaluation.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to either Group A or Group B.Group A will consist of
      15 subjects that will receive 20 million Allogeneic hMSCs. Group B will receive placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to participate in this study, a subject must:

          1. Provide written informed consent.

          2. Subjects age &gt;18 and &lt;75 years at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form.

          3. Facetogenic back pain diagnosed using the following diagnostic criteria:

               -  The facet joint may be affected by systemic disease, as rheumatoid arthritis and
                  ankylosing spondylitis, or be site of micro traumatic fractures, osteoarthritis,
                  meniscoid entrapment, synovial impingement, joint subluxation, synovial
                  inflammation, loss of cartilage, and mechanical injury.

               -  Pain onset at dorsal extension and release at flexion is often considered
                  suggestive for facet pain, even if non-specific, such as maximal tenderness upon
                  deep palpation of posterior elements

               -  History of temporary improvement with a medial branch block anesthetic injection
                  of the targeted joints

               -  Axial lumbar pain without radicular symptoms

               -  Pain on hyperextension, rotation, and lateral bending with physical exam

          4. Chronic facetogenic pain (â‰¥ 6 months) in patients that have failed conservative
             management. (This includes but is not limited to a trial of oral medications, 6 weeks
             of physical therapy, intra-articular injection of the facet joints, and/or facet joint
             medial branch neurotomy.)

          5. Diagnosis of lumbar facet joint pain confirmed by analgesic injections.

          6. Have spinal level L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 bilaterally for bilateral pain and same side
             only for unilateral pain.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        In order to participate in this study, a subject must not:

          1. Previous surgical intervention for back pain

          2. Previous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injection(s) in to facet joints

          3. Use of anticoagulation or NSAIDs within 5 days of the injection

          4. MRI finding of severe high grade lumbar stenosis

          5. Leg pain exceeding back pain

          6. Pain worse with flexion maneuvers

          7. Fracture of lumbar vertebrae

          8. Be a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not
             practicing effective contraceptive methods. Female subjects must undergo a blood or
             urine pregnancy test at screening and within 36 hours prior to injection.

          9. Inability to perform any of the assessments required for endpoint analysis.

         10. Clinically abnormal screening laboratory values.

         11. Serious comorbid illness or any other condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the subject or preclude
             successful completion of the study.

         12. Hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

         13. Be an organ transplant recipient.

         14. Have a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., subjects with prior
             malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curatively-treated basal cell
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or cervical carcinoma, if
             recurrence occurs.

         15. Have a non-pulmonary condition that limits lifespan to &lt; 1 year.

         16. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months.

         17. Be serum positive for HIV, hepatitis BsAg or Viremic hepatitis C.

         18. Be currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an
             investigational therapeutic or device trial.
