      The purpose of this study is to determine whether administration of a pecto-intercostal
      fascial plane block (PIFB) with bupivacaine is a more effective therapy for postoperative
      analgesia after cardiac surgery as compared to patients who receive a sham block of normal
      saline.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether administration of a pecto-intercostal
      fascial plane block (PIFB) with bupivacaine is a more effective therapy for postoperative
      analgesia after cardiac surgery as compared to patients who receive a sham block of normal
      saline.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine whether or not a PIFB with bupivacaine can reduce postoperative
      pain after cardiac surgery. This will be assessed through:

      (Aim 1A) opioid consumption in the first 48 hours postoperatively (Aim 1B) patient
      self-reported pain scores during their hospital stay

      Specific Aim 2: To estimate the effect size in order to obtain information that can be used
      to power future research on the use of regional modalities of analgesia for cardiac
      surgeries.
