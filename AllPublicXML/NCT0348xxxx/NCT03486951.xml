  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective and observational study is to describe the conditions of
      orthognathic procedures performed in Toulouse Teaching Hospital over a one-year period, the
      outpatient-to-inpatient shifts rate and the whole outpatient rate among the whole
      orthognathic procedures done. The investigator also wants to identify factors associated with
      an outpatient-to-inpatient shift, and factors associated with the duration of
      hospitalization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Toulouse Teaching Hospital, the annual number of orthognathic surgery outpatient stays was
      multiplied by 6 since 2010, indicating a new trend of theses procedures. Outpatient stays
      presents several advantages for the patient and for the health system: decrease of the
      psychological stress, higher satisfaction, minimization of the personal and domestic activity
      interruption, less exposure to nosocomial infections, decrease of global costs, increase of
      the population rate which can be treated. However, very few data report the experience of
      outpatient orthognathic surgery in France and the factors associated with its success or
      failure.

      The choice of ambulatory versus complete hospitalization is decided during preoperative
      consultation by the surgeon in agreement with the patient. The classic surgical and
      anesthetic protocol of orthognathic surgery is applied whatever the type of hospitalization.
      The data are collected from the patient medical record (electronic patient record,
      orthognathic follow-up form, anesthetic sheet) and from a patient quality of life
      questionnaire. There is no modification of the usual follow-up, patients are seen at D-8
      which is the end-study visit.

        Are not excluded from the study the minor patients, for reasons of collection bias: the
        population benefiting from an orthognathic surgery is carried out mainly on an adolescent
        population at the end of growth, to exclude these patients would therefore be a major bias
        to conducting the study and analyzing the results.
