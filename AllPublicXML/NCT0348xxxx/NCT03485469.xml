  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic problem of obesity is weight control, a major difficulty, involving a
      significant change in eating behavior. A number of studies show that there are many factors
      of resistance to weight loss whether they are physiological, genetic, environmental pressure
      related, or psychological and behavioral. For some patients, the surgical approach seems the
      best alternative. Indeed, bariatric surgery is an effective therapeutic weapon in patients
      with morbid obesity. However, it has been shown that approximately 25% of patients are
      failing at two years of this surgery (Reinhold's index). Some of the failed subjects may
      benefit from surgical revision. As for the others, no intervention is currently proposed to
      them. Studies have shown that the psychological profile of patients who are candidates for
      bariatric surgery is predominantly immature, impulsive, very anxious with a tendency to
      depression. The stress level of these patients would be important, and they would have low
      self-esteem. This study hypothesize that, in these patients, the establishment of
      hypnotherapeutic management associated with the usual dietary monitoring could modify eating
      habits thus promoting weight loss and an improvement in self-esteem , stress and anxiety
      compared to dietary monitoring alone.

      There are still no studies assessing the impact of hypnotherapeutic management and
      self-hypnosis on the weight curve, self-esteem, stress, anxiety, or the quality of life of
      patients Obese in failure of bariatric surgery.

      Interventional, prospective, multi-center, controlled, randomized, open-label study with 2
      parallel arms, evaluating the efficacy of hypnotherapeutic management in patients with
      bariatric surgery failure, compared to dietary monitoring alone.

      Criteria for inclusion:

      Adult patient (18 to 65 years old limits included) in bariatric surgery failure

      Main exclusion criteria:

      Psychological pathology dissociative type. Sensory (hearing, visual) or cognitive deficits.
      Difficulties of understanding the French language. Refusal to practice hypnosis Number of
      topics required: Based on Irving Kirsch meta-analysis: 70 subjects in total.

      Procedure:

      Patients will be randomized into two groups:

      The control group will benefit from 1 dietary consultation in the service and 9 dietary
      consultations by phone at 15 days intervals.

      The experimental group will also benefit from 1 dietary consultation in the service, 9
      dietary consultations by phone to which will be associated 7 hypnosis sessions and 3
      self-hypnosis learning sessions. Each session is scheduled 15 days apart for each of the two
      groups for 5 months. An 11th and a 12th consultation will be scheduled respectively 15 days
      and 3 months after the 10th in order to monitor the evolution of the judgment criteria
      (corresponding to visits M5 and M12).

      Main evaluation criterion: variation in weight in Kg between J0 and M5

      Secondary evaluation criteria:

        -  Variation of the weight (in kg) between J0 and M12,

        -  Variation of the percentage of loss of excess weight between J0, M5 and M12,

        -  Variation of BMI and waist circumference (in centimeters) between J0, M5 and M12,

        -  Variation of the scores obtained at the Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale (1965) scale
           between J0, M5 and M12,

        -  Variation of the scores obtained in the O. Ziegler et al (2005) self-questionnaire EQVOD
           between J0, M5 and M12,

        -  Variation of the scores obtained in the Katz (1970) self-questionnaire between J0, M5
           and M12,

        -  Variation of the scores obtained at the scale of the emotional repercussion HAD (1983)
           between J0, M5 and M12,

        -  Variation of the scores obtained at the scale of eating behaviors TFEQ-R21 (2009)
           between J0, M5 and M12,

        -  Patient satisfaction will be assessed using 5 scales from Lickert to M5 and M12.

      Number of visits: 13 visits are planned: 1 visit of inclusion, a visit ensuring the first
      dietary follow-up, 9 hypnosis sessions (for the experimental group), two visits dedicated to
      the collection of the judgment criteria. Each patient is followed for 12 months.

      The estimated duration of recruitment is 18 months.
