          4. Voluntary written consent, given before performance of any clinical
             investigation-related procedure not part of standard medical care, and with the
             understanding that consent may be withdrawn at any time without prejudice to future
             medical care.

          5. Female subjects must also meet any one of the following criteria:

                  should be practicing an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of
                  the clinical investigation as judged by the Investigator, such as condoms, foams,
                  jellies, diaphragm, intrauterine device or abstinence.

          6. Subjects willing to undergo pre-and post-clinical investigation blood and urine
             investigations.

          7. Good Functional Status as determined by the physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 18 years

          2. Symptom duration &gt; 14 days for the DVT episode in the index leg (i.e., non-acute DVT)

          3. IVC Atresia

          4. Previously stented in treatment vein

          5. Patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome

          6. In the index leg: established PTS (Villalta ≥ 5)

          7. Bilateral disease

          8. Limb-threatening circulatory compromise

          9. Pulmonary Embolism

         10. Hemodynamically compromised (i.e., hypotension).

         11. Patients with severe dyspnea or acute systemic illness.

         12. Allergy, hypersensitivity, or thrombocytopenia from heparin, rt-PA, or iodinated
             contrast, except for mild-moderate contrast allergies for which steroid pre-medication
             can be used.

         13. Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 mg/dl, INR &gt; 1.6 before warfarin was started, or platelets &lt;
             100,000/ml.

         14. Impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 ml/min),

             Exception: patients with non-melanoma primary skin cancers are eligible to participate
             in the study.

         19. Severe hypertension on repeated readings (systolic &gt; 180 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 105
             mmHg).

         20. Pregnant (positive pregnancy test, women of childbearing potential must be tested).

             opinion of the Investigator, may confound the results of the trial or pose additional
             risk to the subject following use of the Vetex Thrombectomy Device.

         28. Cardiac disorder, defined as: congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association
