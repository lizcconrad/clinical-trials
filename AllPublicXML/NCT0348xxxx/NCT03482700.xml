      This study will look at the impact of care delivery by a specialist respiratory doctor
      compared to general practitioners for patients with COPD in East Birmingham. The primary
      outcome will be to compare the rates of provision of guideline-based care in intervention and
      control practices.

      This study will look at the impact of care delivery by a specialist respiratory doctor
      compared to general practitioners for patients with COPD in East Birmingham. It will be run
      from the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which will provide the specialist input and
      oversight, and up to 40 practices across the Eastern Birmingham Health Organisation with
      approximately 2200 patients with COPD confirmed by their current medical practitioner. Each
      practice will be randomised to either the intervention or control group. The intervention
      group will have their usual annual COPD review performed by a specialist respiratory doctor
      at baseline and 12 months. The patients will receive care using our local COPD guidance which
      has been accepted by all local commissioning groups and secondary care organisations.
      Treatment will be at the discretion of the clinician and is not specified in the trial
      protocol. The investigators anticipate that the treatment recommendations in the intervention
      arm may include referral to pulmonary rehabilitation and reduction in the use of inhaled
      corticosteroids, which are prescribed at high rates in our locality. The control group will
      be seen by the usual staff at their practice. These patients will not be seen by the trial
      team and their data will be extracted remotely using electronic systems.

      The primary outcome will be to compare the rates of provision of guideline-based care in
      intervention and control practices. Secondary outcomes will include: referral to secondary
      care, unscheduled healthcare consultations (ED attendance, hospital admissions), COPD
      exacerbations, healthcare costs, medications prescribed, biochemical markers of disease,
      radiological investigations, lung function tests measured when clinically indicated, and
      death within 12 month follow-up period.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Practices will be eligible for inclusion if they give consent to data collection and
             are part of the EBHO.

          -  Patients from the practices will be eligible if they are coded to have COPD within the
             GP record. In addition patients who are not coded to have COPD in the GP record, but
             who have a hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of COPD within the enrolment
             period for practices (first 3 months) will be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • Patients will only be excluded if they are proven not to have COPD at specialist
        assessment, or during the follow up period, as determined by changes in medical coding
        within the GP record. If patients are assessed by the specialist and the diagnosis is not
        felt to be robust, enrolment will be suspended until this matter can be clarified by use of
        post bronchodilator spirometry and/or other required parts of their clinical care.
