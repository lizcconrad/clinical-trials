  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lichtenstein technique, inserting a mesh over the inguinal cord in the neurological plane, is
      considered the standard of inguinal hernia repair, but it has 4% recurrence and 12% chronic
      postoperative pain. Rives technique inserts the mesh in the preperitoneal space behind the
      neurological plane and the muscular plane, thus better fulfilling the principle of
      hydrostatics.

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The patients are clinically reviewed in the office within 7 days of discharge (pain is evaluated at rest and with movement (standing up, sitting down, and walking), using a VAS (visual analogue scale). Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in post- surgical patients, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

    <description>The patients are reviewed clinically by the service's surgeons again after a year. If pain is found, this is evaluated as being with movement, spontaneous, episodic, or constant in nature, and measured with a VAS.
