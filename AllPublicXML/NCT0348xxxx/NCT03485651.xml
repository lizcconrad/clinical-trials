    <measure>Compare cfDNA from benign ovarian masses and confirmed ovarian cancers</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 months or 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Examine cfDNA between benign ovarian masses and confirmed ovarian cancer cases (based on tumor pathology report). The purpose of this outcome is to determine whether cfDNA could be used to develop a non-invasive ovarian cancer assay to distinguish between malignant and benign masses.</description>
