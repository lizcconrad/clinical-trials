  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6 month study investigating the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in treating
      signs and symptoms and improving physical function in Chinese patients with active psoriatic
      arthritis and had inadequate response to a conventional synthetic disease modifying
      anti-rheumatic drug. This is a China alone study.

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>PsARC is comprised of 4 clinical improvement criteria: 1 unit (0-5 Likert scale) improvement on the Physician Global Assessment (PGA); 20% (0-100 scale) improvement on the participant assessments; and 30% reduction in the number of tender joints; and 30% reduction in the number of swollen joints. To achieve a clinical response, the participant must improve in 2 of the 4 PsARC criteria, 1 of which has to be the number of tender or swollen joints and none of the 4 scores could worsen.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 1, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The SF 36 v.2 (Acute) is a 36 item generic health status measure. It measures 8 general health domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. These domains can also be summarized as physical and mental component summary scores.</description>

    <measure>Euro Quality of Life (EQ-5D)- Health State Profile Utility Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol EQ 5D Health State Profile is a copyrighted, patient completed instrument designed to assess impact on health related quality of life in five domains: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Additionally, scores from the five domains may be used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score. The validity and reliability of the EuroQol EQ 5D has been established in a number of disease states, including PsA and rheumatoid arthritis.</description>

    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ DI assesses the degree of difficulty a subject has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty,&quot; 1 as &quot;some difficulty,&quot; 2 as &quot;much difficulty,&quot; and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;. Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status.</description>
