      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy (irinotecan,
      oxaliplatin and fluorouracil) in the patients with locally advanced colon cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the patients with locally advanced colon cancer, adjuvant FOLFOX and XELOX chemotherapy
      have become standard treatment. However, 30% - 40% patients suffered from local recurrence or
      distant metastasis after this standard treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could shrink
      tumors, eliminate micrometastasis, reduce surgical trauma and accelerate recovery. Hence, we
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFOXIRI as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in treating
      patients with locally advanced colon cancer.

      In this prospective study, 30 patients with locally advanced colon cancer will be treated
      with 4 cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. PET-CT
      scanning will be performed before and after the neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy to assess
      SUVmax changes. The ctDNA in peripheral blood before and after each cycle of neoadjuvant
      FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy will be detected. In the course of treatment, safety evaluation will
      be carried out according to adverse reaction classification (CTCAE) 4. 0.
