      exposure-based CBT for asthma-related fear delivered over the Internet (Internet-CBT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases around the world, with a high prevalence of
      anxiety disorders. In a prior study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03158194) a protocol for
      exposure-based CBT was developed for asthma-related anxiety. The aim of the current study is
      to evaluate acceptability and feasibility of our protocol for asthma-related fear when
      delivered over the Internet (Internet-CBT). The plan is to include 30 participants that will
      all receive the intervention in this uncontrolled feasibility study.
