  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate execution of our directed behaviors in the immediate environment allows the vast
      majority of our daily activities. Through the movements of our eyes and different parts of
      our body, we perceive, explore and act on our environment and can exchange and communicate
      with others. The mechanisms of sensorimotor adaptation of saccades (saccadic adaptation)
      contribute on the one hand to maintain the accuracy of saccades in the short, medium and long
      term, by opposing the deleterious effects of various physiological changes (development,
      aging), pathological or environmental (optical corrections).

      The aim of this study is to identify neuronal structures and networks involved in saccadic
      adaptation through the study of brain metabolic activation (BOLD) during the development of
      the adaptation of reactive saccades. The study will be organized in a single session with 3
      runs. Each run include 4 blocks: 3 include the double-step target paradigm RND, U+, U-) and
      one without target jump (STA). The 'U+'/ 'U-'blocks include saccadic trials with
      forward/backward displacement of the target during a targeting saccade, the 'RND' block
      include saccadic trials with random target jump (forward or backward) and the 'STA' block are
      trials without displacement of the target. Each subject will make 12 repetitions of the 4
      blocks.
