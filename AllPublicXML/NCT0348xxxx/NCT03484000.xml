  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Chemotherapy treatment (CT) can have burdensome side effects such as fatigue,
      nausea-vomiting, and sleep problems that can significantly affect patients' quality of life.
      Fatigue is the most common, lasting and bothersome of these, which prevents people from
      working and carrying out daily activities. Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is an
      evidence-based group training program which has shown to help treat negative physical and
      psychosocial symptoms in cancer patients. The investigators propose to evaluate a
      pilot-tested online-MBCR program for patients undergoing CT who may be low on energy, time or
      have compromised immunity.

      Objectives: To evaluate the impact of participation in online MBCR during CT on fatigue
      (primary outcome), sleep, pain, nausea/vomiting, mood disturbance, stress symptoms and
      quality of life (secondary outcomes) as well as cognitive function and return to work
      (exploratory outcomes) over the course of treatment.

      Methods: The study design is a randomized wait-list controlled trial, conducted during CT for
      patients with breast or colorectal cancer. Participants will take the 12-week online MBCR
      program at home within 2 weeks of randomization (immediate group) or after CT completion
      (waitlist group). Outcomes will be assessed online at, 1) Baseline, 2) Post-MBCR, 3) Post-CT
      (primary outcome) and 4) 12 months post-baseline.

      Anticipated Findings: MBCR is a promising adjuvant program that could help patients prevent,
      delay or diminish aversive symptoms and side-effects associated with CT, particularly
      fatigue. If helpful, online-MBCR could be made easily available at cancer centers worldwide
      and significantly lessen the burden of cancer treatments.

    <description>Fatigue will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F 68) is the most commonly-used cancer-related fatigue scale. Using a 5-point Likert scale (from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;), the 13-items reflect participants' specific fatigue concerns in the past 7 days. The total score has well-established norms both in the literature and from our prior work and shows responsiveness to intervention</description>
