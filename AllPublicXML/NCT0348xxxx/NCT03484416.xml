      The present study investigated the effect of routine calcium and vitamin D supplementation
      and tried to find the predictors for postoperative hypocalcemia in patients with thyroid
      cancer. Demographic data, including age, sex, pathologic features, and postoperative
      laboratory test results were analyzed, as was the development of symptomatic hypocalcemia,
      defined as an ionized calcium concentration below 4.6 mg/dL (normal range, 4.6-5.4 mg/dL)
      associated with hypocalcemic symptoms. Hypocalcemia was considered permanent in patients who
      required calcium supplementation for longer than 6 months after thyroidectomy.

      Serum concentrations of PTH and ionized calcium were measured 1 and 14 days postoperatively.
      Patients in the routine calcium group received oral supplements of 1,500 mg/day elemental
      calcium and 1,000 IU/day cholecalciferol for 2 weeks, beginning on the first postoperative
      day (POD) to the 14th POD, whereas patients in the control group received no supplementation.
      If symptomatic hypocalcemia developed, patients in both groups received 2.0 g of intravenous
      calcium, followed by oral supplementation with 3,000-4,000 mg/day elemental calcium and
      1,000-2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol up to the 14th POD. If hypocalcemic symptoms were
      persistent or worsening 2 hours after calcium administration, patients were administered
      another intravenous calcium supplementation.
