      Aim: To assess whether there are different training effects on glucose concentration and
      cardiorespiratory parameters of different high-intensity training protocols in patients with
      type 2 diabetes.

      Type 2 diabetes is a highly prevalent disease associated with cardiovascular disease leading
      to high levels of mortality, morbidity and health expenditure, characterized by impaired
      glucose control during activities and reduced aerobic exercise capacity .

      Exercise training is the most effective way to improve compliance, reduce blood glucose
      concentration and increase insulin sensitivity. Training increases muscle capacity, oxidative
      capacity and glucose transport, peripheral insulin sensitivity is improved.

      Exercise training with high-intensity interval (resting and exercise period) High Intensity
      Interval Training (HIIT) is a form of exercise training that has recently been widely used in
      the management of type 2 diabetes, including short duration high intensity exercise periods
      and lower severity or passive rest periods. There are different HIIT exercise training
      programs according to physiological responses in the literature. However, long-term and
      short-term HIIT training training programs were not compared in terms of their effect on
      glucose concentration and cardiorespiratory fitness. The aim of this study was to compare the
      effects of different HIIT exercise training programs so that exercise programs for patients
      with type 2 diabetes could be planned more effectively.

      This study will be participated patients with Type 2 diabetes. Patients' laboratory values,
      pulmonary function test, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical activity
      level, quality of life will be evaluated.

      Pulmonary function test will be assesed with spirometer, respiratory muscle strength will be
      evaluated with mouth pressure. Exercise capacity will be evaluated using six minute walking
      test, incremental shuttle walk test, cycle ergometer. Muscle oxigeneration will be asssed
      with wearable lactate threshold predicting device. Physical activity level will be evaluated
      trial accelerometer.

      Then, patients will be randomly divided two high intensity interval exercise training groups.

      First group: short duration high intensity exercise training (Exercise load phase : 30sn %100
      Patients performance, rest phase: 120sn %25 patients performance) Second group: Long duration
      high intensity interval exercise training (Exercise load phase : 4 dk %100 Patients
      performance, rest phase: 120sn %25 patients performance) All patients will participate three
      times a week during eight weeks. The muscle oxigeneration, blood glucose consantration, blood
      pressure, heart rate will be recorded before and after each exercise session. After 8 week,
      all test will be done again.
