  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to prospectively evaluate the relationship between serial measurement of
      several biomarkers, such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), bone
      morphogenic protein 1 (BMP1), and carboxyterminal propeptide of type-I procollagen (PICP),
      and echocardiographic features of diastolic dysfunction in three groups, including patients
      with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with reduced
      ejection fraction (HFrEF), and patients without a history of heart failure (HF). The
      relationship between these novel biomarkers and one year major cardiovascular adverse events
      will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All ambulatory patients, 18 years and older, with a history of HF, meeting all of the
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible. Age and sex matched
      patients with no history of HF will also be considered eligible. Blood samples will be
      collected at baseline as well as at 1 year follow up. At both time points, a total blood
      volume of up to 50 mL will be collected using EDTA and serum tubes, while patients are
      seated. Samples will be spun at 1800 rpm and plasma aliquoted. Samples will be frozen
      immediately at -80 C.

      The investigators will compare baseline biomarker concentrations across the three groups of
      patients (i.e. HFpEF, HFrEF, and no history of HF) as well as across all study subjects.
      Baseline measures will be compared against one-year follow up data for all variables
      delineated and one-year major cardiovascular adverse events, with a composite endpoint of
      cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization.

      Additionally, the investigators will examine genetic variants and their associations with HF
      subtypes. To achieve this, the investigators will relate single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) associated with left ventricular remodeling pathways to HF subtypes.

      In a subgroup of patients for whom baseline echocardiographic data is available in the
      medical record, the investigators will compare echocardiographic measures of diastolic
      dysfunction (including LAVI, transmitral E/A ratio, and E/E' ratio) across the three groups.
      When available, DICOM images of transthoracic echocardiograms will be collected in order to
      collect precise measures of dysfunction.

      Blood samples will be collected at baseline as well as at 1 year follow up. At both time
      points, a total blood volume of up to 50 mL will be collected using EDTA and serum tubes,
      while patients are seated. Samples will be spun at 1800 rpm and plasma aliquoted. Samples
      will be frozen immediately at -80 C. A minimum of 500 uL of plasma will be needed for IGFBP7
      analysis, as well as for other standard prognostic biomarkers, including NT-proBNP, ST2, and
      hsTn. For patients who opt to participate in the genetic portion of this study, buffy coat
      aliquoting and processing will be executed using the same blood samples. Additional blood
      will not be collected for the purposes of genetic analysis.
