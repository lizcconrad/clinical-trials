  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel tool for self-care enhancement for heart failure (HF) patients has been developed. In
      this randomized controlled trial, patients will be randomized 1:1 to either receive the
      home-based tool (OPTILOGG) or standard care. The intervention will go on for 8 months, and
      outcomes are self-care, quality of life, cardiovascular events (including emergency visits,
      admissions and number of in-hospital days).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited using continuous sampling, and will be approached either in
      connection with being discharged after a heart failure (HF) related event or upon visiting an
      out-patient HF clinic if the patient has been admitted for HF at least once the last year.

      After written consent has been given, demographical data will be noted, and the patient will
      complete two forms: 1 - the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale 9-item
      questionnaire (EHFScB-9) and 2 - the quality of life assessment tool &quot;EuroQol five dimension
      scale&quot; (EQ5D). Expected time for this is 20 minutes. The baseline demographical data will
      include age, gender, ejection-fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA)-class, blood
      pressure, heart rate, HF aetiology, and other routine tests for HF visits as outlined in the
      European guidelines for HF treatment.

      After the patient has filled out the two forms, the patient will be randomized to the control
      group (CG) meaning standard care, or the intervention group (IG). Patients allocated to the
      IG will be equipped with the home based self-care enhancement tool OPTILOGG. OPTILOGG assists
      the patient with symptom monitoring and flexible diuretics regimen, as well as education
      about living with HF. It consists of a specialized tablet computer wirelessly connected to a
      weight scale. OPTILOGG is CE-marked. The intervention will be deployed for eight months.
      After the eight months, the patients will be called to a follow-up visit. During the visit
      all data that was collected at baseline/recruitment will be collected again. All
      cardiovascular events for each patient will be retrieved, for the eight months during which
      the intervention was deployed, but also for the following 12 months. These events include
      hospital admissions, ER-visits and number of in-hospital days.

      Based off of previous findings in the literature, target for enrollment was set at 70 + 70
      patients, to achieve statistical significance with 80% power.

    <time_frame>Eight months</time_frame>
    <description>Registered using the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale (EHFScB), a validated instrument for measuring heart failure (HF) self-care behaviour. The questionnaire is made up of 9 items, where the respondent can choose between 5 different answers to each of the 9 statements. Each item thus generates a score between 1 and 5. The total score for the instrument is between 9 and 45, with 9 constituting the best, or most desireable self-care behaviour and 45 the worst.
Data will be analyzed on a group level using Mann-Whitney-U test for independent samples.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the validated instrument EuroQol 5 dimension scale (EQ5D). The respondent classifies his/her health in 5 dimensions, so in essence five questions pertaining to mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each answer has three levels, &quot;none&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;extreme&quot;. These answers are weighted and then a special look-up tabel is used to get a normalized score between 0 and 1, where 0 is death and 1 is perfect health. A difference in 0.10 is considered relevant.</description>

    <description>OPTILOGG is a CE marked class 1m medical device. It consists of a tablet computer and a wirelessly connected weight scale. The system will have some patient specific information regarding the flexible (loop-) diuretics scheme.
The patient will be asked to step on the weight scale daily, and will be shown to some brief information on how to live better with HF, as well as the recommended dose of diuretics that specific day. Every five days the patient will answer three questions about his/her symptoms, namely shortness of breath, fatigue and peripheral edema. The system also contains information that the patient can study at his/her leisure. If the system detects a deterioration in HF status, the patient is encouraged to contact his/her health care provider via telephone.</description>
