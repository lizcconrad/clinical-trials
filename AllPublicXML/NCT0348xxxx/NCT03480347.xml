  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most existing medical research has focused on patients with well-established COPD and poor
      lung function. Whilst this is important because such patients have lots of symptoms and
      problems, in some respects a better way of reducing health problems in the future would be to
      develop a strategy which focuses on patients with milder disease, and identifies which ones
      will go on to develop more severe problems and why these problems occur. The research in this
      application is designed to investigate these issues.

      The main objective of the Partnership is to study the very early stages of the development of
      COPD. The investigators will do this by recruiting a novel cohort of smokers (age 30-45), in
      whom the investigators will follow the trajectories of lung function decline to identify
      prospectively those at risk of excess decline. This programme forms a unique UK consortium of
      8 academic centres with excellent high quality publication records and broad experience in
      mechanistic, translational, clinical and epidemiological studies in COPD with key
      capabilities including primary care.

      -  Blood samples will be collected to determine full Blood count,. Blood serum, plasma and
           a blood pellet (DNA) will be stored for further analysis of markers of inflammation and
           infection.

        -  Sputum samples (either spontaneous or induced) will be collected and stored and used for
           microbiome studies, inflammatory markers, and pathogen detection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for enrolment in the study must meet all the following criteria:

          -  Informed Consent: Subjects must give their signed and dated written informed consent
             to participate

          -  Gender: Male or female subjects

          -  Age: 30-45 years of age at screening

          -  Smokers of at least 10 pack years

          -  Have either normal lung function or mild lung function abnormalities

          -  Subject groups will have one of the following:

               -  A. Subjects (smokers) with mild airflow limitation defined as an FEV1/FVC ratio
                  &lt;lower limit of normal and FEV1 &gt; 80% of predicted normal and no symptoms. This
                  group will make up at least 30% of the total cohort.
