  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide problem. In preventing
      risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle through improved health literacy, chances are seen to
      delay or even avoid type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of the DIMINI-project is to prevent
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and to strengthen the health literacy of people at increased risk of
      developing it. For this purpose, people at increased risk are first identified by using the
      standardized screening tool Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) adapted for Germany.
      Identified risk persons then receive a needs-based, modular lifestyle intervention including
      nutrition tips and physical exercises either paper- or app-based.

  <detailed_description>

      DIMINI, a randomised controlled trial, will assess whether the implementation of a lifestyle
      intervention for people at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus will result
      in an improvement in body weight (primary outcome) and participants health literacy
      (secondary outcome) or not. A three-month intervention in the intervention group is followed
      by a one-year follow-up. The control group receives standard care as provided by the German
      statutory health insurance for three months and a one-year follow-up as well.

Minimum score: 0 = no disturbance
Maximum score: 16 = extreme disturbance Scale 3) experienced feelings of hunger
Minimum score: 0 = no disturbing sensations of hunger
Maximum score: 14 = very strong disturbing sensations of hunger For each item it is determined individually, which response option is considered to get a value of 1 or a value of 0 (e.g. Scale 1 Item 12: &quot;true&quot; = 1, &quot;not true&quot; = 0, Item 18 &quot;true&quot; = 0, &quot;not true&quot; = 1)</description>
