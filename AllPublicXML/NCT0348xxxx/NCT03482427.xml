      In this pilot study, the investigators will assess the clinical utility and feasibility of
      the Healthy Heart Score in the primary clinical care setting for the primordial prevention of
      cardiovascular disease. The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial to test
      the lifestyle intervention based on the Healthy Heart Score compared to usual care. The aim
      is to include 100 participants (50 in each group). Each participant will complete 2 visits
      (initial and a follow up visit after 12 weeks).

      Created by the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health, the Healthy Heart Score is a
      previously validated online risk calculator that determines the 20-year Cardiovascular
      Disease ) risk based on 9 modifiable lifestyle factors including; smoking habits, body mass
      index, physical activity, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetables intake, cereal fiber,
      nuts, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meat, and processed meats consumption.

    <description>After completion of the Healthy Hear Score assessment, participants will receive a lifestyle intervention based on the Healthy Heart Score results for 12-weeks by trained dietetic interns on-site. Participants will receive a check-in email or phone 6 weeks after the initial visit. A Registered Dietitian is also available to speak with patients. The intervention will consist on educational materials based on each component of the Healthy Heart Score and other lifestyle behaviors</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will follow their usual care protocol after taking the Healthy Heart Score assessment. Researchers will provide the Healthy Heart Score survey results, but will not discuss or interpret the results with them. Participants can discuss any concern they have with their usual physician if they choose. After the follow-up visit and upon completion of the study, all participants in the control group may also receive the educational handouts and will be granted access to the Healthy Heart Score application if they wish.</description>
