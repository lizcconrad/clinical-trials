  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical hemostats are agents that stop bleeding by contributing blood to clot. Oxidized
      cellulose, a sort of mechanical hemostatic material, predominantly forms a block to stop the
      blood flow and provides a surface to clot more rapidly.It was marketed for the first time in
      1945 and widely used for its convenience, biocompatibility, and bactericide from that time.
      It is currently available in many commercial products, while manufactured using either a
      regenerated or nonregenerated process. The physicochemical property and hemostatic efficacy
      of oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORCG) and oxidized nonregenerated cellulose (ONRCG) has
      been well documented using in vitro test and animal models, and ONRCG was seemingly superior
      to ORCG in terms of hemostasis. However, no clinical study has been performed to verify.
      Therefore, the objective of this prospective randomized study is to assess the hemostatic
      efficacy of ORCG (Surgicel®, Ethicon) vs ONRCG (Traumastem®, Bioster) for hemostasis of local
      bleeding in patients undergoing hepatic resection.

      Representative liver resected surface (prominent bleeding site) was applied the ply of gauze
      with several seconds of even finger gentle press under aseptic conditions, then it was
      untouched and observed for 10 min. Vascular occlusion of the liver was allowed if necessary,
      but was open for evaluation of hemostatic efficacy. Hemostatic time began to calculate when
      gauze was applied. Time to hemostasis was recorded in seconds and the maximum time to
      hemostasis was 600 seconds. Hemostasis success was achieved based on there was no visible
      bleeding or minimal ooze from the resection wound.
