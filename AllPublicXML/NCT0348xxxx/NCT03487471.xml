  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue elasticity is being increasingly used as diagnostic parameter, since at the
      macroscopic level benign breast lesions tend to be stiffer than normal breast tissue but
      softer than breast cancers. Ultrasound elastography allows to probe the elasticity of breast
      lesions in clinics. Real time elastography (RTE) and shear wave elastography (SWE) are the
      two most widely used elastography modalities.

      Assessment of breast lesions by either RTE or SWE improve the diagnostic performance of
      standard B-mode ultrasound (US) and have the potential to assist the decision about whether
      to perform a breast biopsy or not.

      Tissue elasticity is being increasingly used as diagnostic parameter, since at the
      macroscopic level benign breast lesions tend to be stiffer than normal breast tissue but
      softer than breast cancers. Ultrasound elastography allows to probe the elasticity of breast
      lesions in clinics. Real time elastography (RTE) and shear wave elastography (SWE) are the
      two most widely used elastography modalities.

      Assessment of breast lesions by either RTE or SWE improve the diagnostic performance of
      standard B-mode ultrasound (US) and have the potential to assist the decision about whether
      to perform a breast biopsy or not. However, employing RTE and SWE using the same equipment to
      directly compare elasticity measurements of a breast lesion has not been done. Investigators
      propose to prospectively investigate inter-observer agreement of each modality.

      The study will investigate and compare the accuracy and reproducibility of SWE and RTE in the
      characterization of breast lesions. Furthermore, we plan to establish learning curves for RTE
      and SWE.

      In this project, investigators will compare RTE and SWE concerning their potential to
      discriminate benign breast lesions from breast cancer. Investigators aim is to identify which
      modality will allow clinicians the best possible patient care.
