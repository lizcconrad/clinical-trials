  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labour induction is a frequent obstetric intervention (~20%). Prostaglandins (PGs) are
      effective agents, but gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance has limited use to non-oral routes.
      The traditional oxytocin &quot;drip&quot; requires intravenous (IV) use and discourages mobility.
      Misoprostol, a PG analogue, is marketed for oral treatment of GI disorders, but initiates
      uterine contraction, an undesirable GI side effect. Recently, there has been a research
      &quot;boom&quot; on vaginal misoprostol use in pregnancy to induce term labour drawing on this &quot;side
      effect:&quot;. The principal investigator has led one of three groups worldwide which has
      published on oral misoprostol to study effectiveness, GI tolerance, and safety for
      mother/baby in term labour induction. Cost per patient has been less then one percent that of
      other PGs, even less than IV oxytocin.

    <textblock>
      Labour induction is a frequent obstetric intervention (20-30%). Prostaglandins (PGs) are
      effective agents, but gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance has limited use to intracervical and
      vaginal administration of PGE2 gels. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E2 (PGE1) analogue, is
      marketed for oral treatment of upper GI disorders. The past five years has seen mushrooming
      literature on its use to initiate uterine contractions for pregnancy termination in the first
      and second trimesters, and labour induction in the third. Vaginal administration has been
      used almost exclusively, has been cost effective (less than one percent the cost of PGE2) and
      without demonstrated harm to mother or newborn. The investigators have published a randomized
      control trial (RCT) on vaginal use, and have also published a 275 subject RCT of oral
      misoprostol versus a traditional induction regime of (physician chosen combinations of
      intracervical or vaginal dinoprostone, intravenous (IV) oxytocin and artificial membrane
      rupture). Oral misoprostol was effective, well tolerated and without harm to mother or
      newborn. The investigators have in press a double blind RCT or oral versus vaginal
      misoprostol in 206 subjects. Oral misoprostol was effective, though time to vaginal birth was
      226 min longer, due to more time before labour was initiated. Oral misoprostol was associated
      with less uterine hyperstimulation (P&lt;0.04). The investigators have also completed an RCT of
      oral misoprostol versus IV oxytocin with term pre-labour membrane rupture. Again,
      effectiveness was shown. There is no larger published collective experience with oral
      misoprostol labour induction. Before embarking on a costly RCT to evaluate more substantive
      outcomes (Caesareans or neonatal asphyxia) with sample size greater than 10,000, funding has
      been received for this three-group RCT of labour induction at term: oral misoprostol, vaginal
      misoprostol, and our centre's established approach.

      PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION When induction of labour at term is indicated, is there more than a
      four-hour difference in time to vaginal birth between vaginal misoprostol (25µg initial dose,
      followed by 25-50µg every six hours as needed), oral misoprostol (50µg every four hours as
      needed) and the Izaak Walton Killam (IWK) Health Centre established protocol? Secondary
      outcomes address harm to the newborn (including cord blood acid base analysis, and defined
      birth asphyxia criteria) and mother (Caesareans, peripartum interventions, maternal GI
      intolerance and excessive uterine activity).

      RESEARCH PLAN Eligible subjects will be at gestations greater than 37 completed weeks, with a
      cephalic presenting live single fetus, who have an indication for induction, and no
      contraindication to induction, vaginal birth, or PG use. Random allocation will be blocked
      and stratified (on membrane status). Sample size calculations were based on: ∆=240 minutes,
      α(2 tailed) = 0.05, β=0.05, with a σ=588 minutes from the investigators' prior publications.
      Adjustments for anticipated Caesareans (&lt;20%) were made. Sample size is 510. Recruitment
      within a year is supported by the group's prior research [more than 1000 inductions per year
      at IWK Grace ( the centre's name officially changed in November, 2000, to IWK Health
      Centre)].

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three approaches to initiation of labour induction. Study group allocation will be stratified based on membrane status (ruptured/intact). Sequentially numbered opaque envelopes contain group assignment prepared using computer generated random number tables, in blocks of 4 and 6. Group 1 will receive misoprostol 50µgs, repeated at 4hr intervals until one of the following occurs: progressive labour, contraction frequency of 3 per 10 minutes, non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, or delivery. Group 2 will receive misoprostol 25µg initial dose and then 25-50µg placed in the vagina at 6hr intervals to the same effect. Group 3 will have induction of labour managed by the usual method here at the IWK (intravaginal or intracervical prostaglandin gel and IV oxytocin drip). All care decisions will be made by the attending physician. The patient will be reassessed before each administration of misoprostol.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>ANOVA analysis of participants' total score on the Labour Agentry Scale(LAS). The LAS will be given to consenting participants as a written questionnaire prior to maternal discharge. A mother will be asked to try to remember how she felt during her recent birth experience. If a response is not received by eight weeks following maternal discharge a single reminder telephone contact will made. The LAS is a seven point Likert scale. It measures a mother's sense of control during labor. Score range is from one to seven on each of 18 items. The minimum score is 18 and maximum score is 126. A higher score indicates a greater sense of control. (Hodnett ED, Simmons-Tropea DA. The Labour Agentry Scale: Psychometric properties of an instrument measuring control during childbirth.
