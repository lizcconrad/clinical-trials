  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic disorder of pigmentation characterized by the development of white
      macules on the skin due to loss of epidermal melanocytes. It affects approximately 0.5%-2% of
      general population world-wide, without predilection for sex or race.Vitiligo can be
      classified into segmental or non-segmental. Non-segmental or generalized vitiligo is the most
      common clinical presentation and often involves the face and acral regions.

      Multiple monotherapy modalities are established to treat vitiligo but the response is
      variable, unsatisfactory, and requiring a prolonged course. This problem is exaggerated by
      the multifactorial and polygenic nature of the pathomechanism of the disease. These facts
      pave the way to combination therapy that showed better and safe repigmentation response than
      monotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution is a synthetic prostaglandin F2 alpha analog that is
      approved for the treatment of glaucoma and eyelashes hypotrichosis (Lee et al, 2017).
      Cutaneous hyperpigmentation of the treated sites has been reported as a side effect with this
      agent. Phototherapy (narrow band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)) of wavelength 308 nm, is considered
      as a successful method of treatment of vitiligo. The cytotoxic T-cells accountable for the
      destruction of melanocytes and disappearance of melanin are eliminated by phototherapy
      through apoptosis (diffuse repigmentation) and UVB does stimulate melanocytic proliferation
      and their migration to the epidermis from nearby follicular units (follicular repigmentation)
      and perilesional active melanocytes (marginal repigmentation).

      In recent years, fractional carbon dioxide laser has been introduced as an add-on treatment
      for vitiligo. It represents a new modality for skin resurfacing based on the theory of
      fractional photothermolysis. The beneficial effect of fractional carbon dioxide laser on
      vitiligo is the release of cytokines and growth factors that act as mitogens for
      melanogenesis. It also alters the skin barrier, which results in increased penetration of
      topical drugs and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, so it can be used in combination therapy.
