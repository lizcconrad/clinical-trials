  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of an intervention based on the Implicit Theories of
      Personality (ITP) in Spanish adolescents. Half of participants received the ITP intervention,
      while the other half received an educational intervention.

    <textblock>
      Depression and bullying are two problems arising in childhood and adolescence, which cause
      severe suffering. Although there are good intervention programs for children and adolescents
      at risk, the results for universal interventions have generally been poor. The current
      project will test the efficacy of an Intervention based on the Implicit Theories of
      Personality (ITP). This procedure has recently been developed at US by David S. Yeager and
      colleagues, with extraordinary results in the reduction of depression, stress, and
      aggression. The project includes the following aims: (1) the evaluation of the efficacy of
      the ITP in Spanish adolescents; (2) the identification of the mechanisms mediating the
      effects of ITP in depression and bullying (these mediators include changes in cognitive
      vulnerabilities and hormones -cortisol, testosterone and DHEA in saliva); (3) the
      identification of moderators of the effects of the ITP, such as age, early family
      experiences, temperament and gender; and (4) the inclusion of a transactional perspective in
      order to determine whether the ITP changes the reciprocal longitudinal paths between risk
      factors, environmental stressors, cognitive vulnerabilities, and depressive symptoms and
      aggressive behavior; The study involves the evaluation of the intervention in a sample of
      around 1000 adolescents (12-18 years), randomly allocated to experimental and control
      condition. It is a field experiment conducted in high schools and involves multiple measures
      over time (self-reports and parent reports; as well as levels of cortisol, testosterone and
      DHEA in saliva in random subset -60%- of the participants). In summary, the project aims to
      respond to the challenge of health and wellness in the population through a randomized
      controlled trial with multiple sources of measure and from a biopsychosocial perspective. The
      ITP intervention has the potential to become a universal intervention to help reduce the
      rates of depression and bullying.

    <description>Self-reported questionnaire that assesses cognitive vulnerability, including negative inferences about the causes of negative events, their consequences, and their implications for the self. The questionnaire presents 12 hypothetical negative scenarios (6 of an interpersonal nature and 6 related to achievement or performance) that are relevant in adolescence. Adolescents are requested to imagine each scenario and rate in a Likert type 7 point scale the extent to which they believe that the cause of the event is internal, stable, and global (attribution of causes), the likelihood that future negative consequences of the event will occur (inferences about consequences), and the extent to which they believe that what happened shows that they failed as individuals (inferences about the self). The response scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), with higher values indicating that the adolescent displays a hopeless cognitive style.</description>

    <intervention_name>Incremental theory of personality</intervention_name>
    <description>The experimental intervention (originally developed by David S. Yeager and colleagues) teaches that individuals have the potential to change. It has three main parts. First, participants are asked to read scientific studies that provide evidence that behaviors are controlled by &quot;thoughts and feelings in brains,&quot; and that pathways in the brain have the potential to be changed under the right circumstances. Second, participants read several testimonials purportedly written by upperclassmen to bring credibility to the ITP. Finally, participants are asked to write their own version of such a narrative. This self-persuasive writing exercise has been shown to facilitate the internalization of the intervention message, building on a long line of research on cognitive dissonance.</description>

    <description>The educational intervention involved scientific information about the human brain. It was designed to be parallel to the experimental intervention and, hence, it has also three main parts. First, participants are asked to read scientific information about the different areas of the brain and their specialties. Second, participants read several testimonials written by upperclassmen about their transition to high school and how their brains help them to adapt to the new space and all the physical differences of the building and the classes. Finally, participants are asked to write a letter to another student explaining the main things he or she has learned about the brain and thinks are important for adapting to the new physical environment in high school.</description>
