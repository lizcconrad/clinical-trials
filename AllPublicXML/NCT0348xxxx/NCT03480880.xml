    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in two parts:

        1. This first part was designed to determine thiopentone dose requirement for induction of
           anaesthesia with and without the use of Bispectral Index monitoring - Participant and
           Care Provider in appropriate study arm blinded.

        2. As a secondary outcome, Bispectral index monitoring was used to observe changes in
           neuronal function in intraoperative period as well as haemodynamic changes
           intraoperatively - Participant and Care Provider blinded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery for traumatic brain injury is an anaesthetic challenge fraught with complications
      such as brain bulge, excessive bleeding, hypotension etc. As yet there are no anaesthetic
      regimen guidelines to follow for induction of anaesthesia in neurotrauma surgeries. Although
      the functional effect of anaesthetic agents on neuronal tissue is known quite well, there is
      lack of studies documenting the effect of these anaesthetic agents on head injured patients.
      It is also not known whether the requirement of anaesthetic agent in the same as a non head
      injured patient. This study was designed to assess the requirement of anaesthetic thiopentone
      in head injured patients and compare the anaesthetic usage with and without Bispectral index
      (BIS) monitoring. We also observed the real time change in neuronal function using Bispectral
      Index monitoring after craniotomy, i.e. effectively decompression and release of intracranial
      pressure intraoperatively.
