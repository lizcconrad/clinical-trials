    <textblock>
      This is an open labelled study. It was designed to evaluate the safety of multiple-dosing of
      TK006 in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases. This trial is the extension of
      a core study: Phase 1 Trial of a Fully Human Monoclonal Antibody of Receptor Activator for
      Nuclear Factor-κ B Ligand (RNAKL, TK006) Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics in
      Patients With Breast Cancer-related Bone Metastases (NCT 03239756).

      This trial is the extension of a core study: Phase 1 Trial of a Fully Human Monoclonal
      Antibody of Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor-κ B Ligand (RNAKL, TK006) Safety,
      Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics in Patients With Breast Cancer-related Bone Metastases
      (NCT 03239756). It's an open labelled study, aimed at evaluating the safety of repeated
      administration of TK006 in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases. The qualified
      subjects would be those completed the entire observation in either 60 mg, 120 mg or 180 mg
      single dose arm at the core study. Also, these patients should be well-tolerated with TK006
      at the core study and are deemed to further benefit from this extension phase estimated by
      the researcher and sponsor. The subjects would receive 120 mg TK006 every 4-week over a
      period of 84 days.

      Only safety profile and immunogenicity assessment would be assessed in this extension stage,
      and no further study on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics would be done.

             dose arm at the core phase (NCT 03239756). Also, these patients should be
             well-tolerated with TK006 and would further benefit from continued treatment estimated
             by the researcher and sponsor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women in pregnancy or nursing.

          2. Central nervous system metastasis that is symptomatic or require treatment.

          3. Patients with grade III or IV adverse events considered related to TK006 at the core
             phase (NCT 03239756).

          4. Patients with important organs dysfunction and not suitable for further treatment with
             TK006 judged by the researcher.

          5. Imaging confirmed progression in bone metastasis compared with core phase (NCT
             03239756).

             which are in active or require invasive operations, unhealed wound of oral surgery, or
             planned invasive dental operations during this trial.

          7. Patients who have been selected for the study of other test devices or test medicine.

          8. Other situations which are not suitable for participation judged by the researcher.
