  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of using new app-based technology to
      increase the level of physical activity, compared to conventional postoperative information
      given to patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The hypothesis is that the intervention, i.e.
      using the new technology, will have a greater positive effect on levels of physical activity
      and outcomes of weight loss than conventional postoperative information.

    <description>App-technology to increase physical activity Participants in the intervention group (App-technology) will use a newly developed smartphone application (&quot;app&quot;) in which the participants are able to register their daily physical activity in bouts of 10 min and their intake if supplementary vitamins. They will also be able to set personal goals every week for the level (minutes) of physical activity and get feedback every week in whether they fulfilled the goal or not. They will also get feedback on the intake of supplementary vitamin intake.</description>
