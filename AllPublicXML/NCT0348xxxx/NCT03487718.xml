  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 14 weeks longitudinal study will be conducted from March 2018 to June 2020, with a 40
      participants. No subjects will receive placebo medication at any point in the research
      procedures.

      The proposed sample population will be recruited from the patient population of the
      University of Kentucky College of Dentistry clinics and the patient must have an
      unsalvageable tooth that is planned for extraction and delayed implant placement and will be
      assigned into a control group and a test group by chance. Twenty extraction socket sites of
      the test group will be filled with autogenous L-PRF Plug (Intralock) and d-PTFE membrane
      (Cytoplast) will be laid on the top to seal the extraction socket. In the control group,
      d-PTFE membrane (Cytoplast) will be laid on the top of twenty extraction sockets to allow
      natural blood clot formation in the extraction socket.

      The primary aim is to assess the quality of the newly formed bone at 14 weeks the time of
      implant placement by comparing the percentage of new vital bone in the histomorphometric
      analysis. The second aim is to assess the primary stability of the implant using the
      resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and insertional torque (IT) of the implant. The third aim
      is to assess the horizontal and vertical changes of the residual bony ridge using Cone Bean
      Computerized Tomography (CBCT) analysis at baseline immediately after tooth extraction at 12
      weeks of healing. The fourth aim is to assess the soft tissue healing with a series of
      intraoral occlusal photographs.

      Null hypothesis: The use of L-PRF plug, in combination with non-resorbable, open barrier
      membrane technique to fill the extraction sockets will have no effect on the quality of the
      newly formed bone nor on the dimensional changes of the ridge, compared to non-resorbable,
      open barrier membrane technique with natural blood clot.
