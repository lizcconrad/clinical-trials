  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We produced a prototype video game called Hygie on the 5 most common reasons of consultation
      in general practice using 9 articles from independent journals based on evidence (reviews by
      Prescrire and Minerva). We then carried out a randomized trial comparing the learning
      provided by a week of access to the game versus source articles, in a population of clinical
      supervisors (CS) from 13 French departments of general practice.

    <textblock>
      Continuing medical education is important but burdensome work for general practitioners.
      Current training tools have limitations and may lack the ability to engage some
      practitioners. Serious games are new pedagogical tools that use video games as engaging
      education tools. They have significant advantages in terms of efficiency and dissemination.

      The aim of this work was to create a new serious game and to evaluate it in terms of
      efficiency and satisfaction, comparing it with a traditional method of continuing education:
      article reading.
