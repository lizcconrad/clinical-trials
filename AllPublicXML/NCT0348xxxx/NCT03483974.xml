  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Information With the advance in cancer biology, we realize that malignant neoplasm
      is related with different biological patterns in metabolome and microbiota. Because of the
      progress in optical spectrometry, it has become possible to evaluate whole visible and
      innon-visiable absorptive spectrum in human specimens, which may enable detection of minor
      changes in compound related with altered metabolome and microbiota. We hope to utilize
      hyperspectral imagingthis spectrum technology to reveal the possible clues of neoplasm for
      early stage detection

      Material and Methods This research intended to enroll one hundred patients into the study.
      This includes patients with positive stool or urine analysis admitted for workup of
      colorectal cancer. We will scan the stool and urine with hyperspectral imaging sensoroptical
      spectrometer, which utilize multichannel charge-coupled device and InGaAs array to analyze
      the full spectrum of light patterns. The image pattern will be stored and used to linked
      final diagnosis. Absorption, scattering, and reflection spectra are expected for analysis.
      Follow up analysis after cancer staging will be used for lowering background noise in all
      spectra.

      Expected Results We expect that there will be specific spectral pattern in stool of
      colorectal cancer patients, which may be related with cancer staging and different from those
      in patients without malignancy. Difference in spectra will lead to discovery of new biomarker
      for colorectal cancer and related diseases. The optic spectra pattern of stool and urine may
      assist early diagnosis and staging of different malignancies
