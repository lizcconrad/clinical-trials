    <textblock>
      The Time-based Register and Analysis of COPD Endpoints (TRACE) study is prospective cohort
      study aiming at evaluating COPD patients using simple basic tools normally used in the clinic
      at hand of any physician. The objective of the study is to accomplish specific aims. 1)
      describing the disease variation over time. 2) defining different disease behaviours; and 3)
      evaluating the impact of different therapeutic approaches on this behaviour in the different
      patient types. TRACE is a single center non-interventional prospective observational cohort
      study of COPD patients. Upon identification of cases, patients are followed-up in yearly
      visits sine die until death or lost to follow-up. Starting in 2012, during the yearly visits
      clinical, functional, radiological and analytical information is recorded via a standardized
      questionnaire. Variables recorded were: socio-demographics, tobacco history, comorbidities,
      clinical presentation during the previous year, exacerbations and hospitalization in the
      previous year, current pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, and complementary
      tests, including at least chest radiology, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, and
      analytical results. Endpoints include a variety of clinically relevant variables including
      disease phenotypic expression, diagnostic measures and therapeutic responses.

        The studied population will be composed solely of COPD patients. Adult patients with a
        diagnosis of COPD according to current standards (7), i.e. a tobacco history &gt; 10
        pack-years and a post-bronchodilator spirometry with an expiratory volume in the first
        second (FEV1) / forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt; 0.7, routinely followed-up in our
        outpatient clinic were selected for inclusion.
