  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nosocomial Central Nervous System infections are difficult to treat and an early appropriate
      therapy can improve prognosis. The two main reasons for treatments failure are the difficulty
      to reach high concentrations of antibiotics (ATB) in CNS because of brain barriers (BB), and
      the emergence of Multi-Drug-Resistant (MDR) pathogens that require high ATB concentrations
      for being killed. Therefore a better knowledge of ATB CNS distribution and PK-PD
      characteristics is essential for efficiency of treatments and to avoid resistance
      progression. Because of BB and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) turnover, unbound (active)
      concentrations of ATB in CSF are frequently much lower than corresponding plasma
      concentrations, which therefore may not be used to predict efficacy. However except for
      patients with EVD, CSF access is difficult. Overall the litterature about ATB distribution
      within CSF exist but PK-PD publications are rarer. Especially for Broad Spectrum ATB which
      are recommended in case of invasive infection in ICU patients due to MDR pathogens such as
      Acinetobacter baumanii, extended spectrum ß-Lactamase producing (ESBL) pathogens or
      Multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus.

      Furthermore, measuring ATB concentrations within the CSF at certain time-points is necessary
      but not sufficient to predict antimicrobial efficacy. First PK modelling is required to
      describe the full CSF concentrations versus time profiles. Then targets must be obtained from
      literature or determined for the relevant PD index, which may be, depending of the
      antibiotic, Time over Minimal Inhibitrice Concentration (T&gt;MIC), Area Under the Curve over
      MIC (AUC/MIC) or peak concentration over MIC (Cmax/MIC). Eventually Monte-Carlo simulations
      can be conducted to predict the probability of target attainment according to various dosing
      regimens to find the optimal one.

      The goal of this multicenter population PK-PD study is to characterize CSF distribution and
      challenge recommended dosing regimens of 7 ATB indicated in CNS infections (vancomycin,
      daptomycin, ceftazidime, meropenem, colistin, aztreonam, linezolid).
