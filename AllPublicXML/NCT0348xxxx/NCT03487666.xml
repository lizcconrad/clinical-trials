                       than 2.0 and if reported average HER2 copy number &lt; 6 signals/cells

          2. Residual disease of 1.0 cm at least of the primary tumor and/or node positive disease
             (at least ypN1)

          3. Patients must have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy; patients must NOT have received
             capecitabine as part of their neoadjuvant therapy regimen. Acceptable preoperative
             regimens include an anthracycline or a taxane, or both. Participants who received
             preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Participants may not have
             received adjuvant chemotherapy after s urgery prior to randomization. .
             Carboplatin-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also allowed). Patients who cannot
             complete all planned neoadjuvant treatment cycles for any reason are considered high
             risk and therefore are eligible for the study if they have residual disease.

          4. Recovery of all toxicities from previous therapies to at least grade 1, except
             alopecia and ≤ grade 2 neuropathy which are allowed.

             unresected or metastatic disease at the time of study entry

               -  Negative margins for both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are
                  desirable, however patients with positive margins may enroll if the treatment
                  team believes no further surgery is possible and patient has received

             anti-PDL1, anti-CTLA4 or similar drugs.

             have completed curative therapy for HCV are eligible. Patients with known HIV
             infection are eligible if they meet each of the following 3 criteria: CD4 counts ≥ 350
             mm3; serum HIV viral load of &lt; 25,000 IU/ml and treated on a stable antiretroviral
             regimen.

          7. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or evidence of active
             pneumonia

          8. Uncontrolled disease

         12. Pregnancy, lactation, or planning to be pregnant

        Patients with microsatellite unstable tumors will not be excluded as immunotherapy as
        adjuvant therapy is not standard for these patients but we will prospective collect this
        data.
