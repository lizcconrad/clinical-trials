    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to determine whether infants disorders of regulation of states are
      associated with perinatal anxiety, and further to explore the efficacy of the behavioral
      intervention in enhancing positive interactions between mothers and their infants and thus
      ameliorating infants' disorders of regulation of states.

      The subjects were recruited from the hospitalized pregnant women waiting for delivery from
      the department of gynecology and obstetrics of the first affiliated hospital of Xi'an
      Jiaotong university. A total of 200 perinatal anxiety women were divided to two
      group(behavioral intervention group and control group) according to mental health assessment.
      Inclusion criteria were applied: 1. mother aged 18-40 years; 2. First-time mother, full-term
      and singleton pregnancy; 3.the Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAMA) score ≥14; 4.birth with no
      intrapartum complications; and 5. Apgar score &gt; 8 at the first, fifth, and tenth minutes
      after birth. Exclusion criteria were as follows: any mental illness besides anxiety, maternal
      medical illness, hypertension, advanced liver disease, renal failure, cancer, valvular heart
      disease, heart failure, stroke,atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, and other
      severe diseases.Preterm infants (&lt; 37 weeks gestation) and multiple births were excluded from
      the current analysis. All the subjects completed the infants behavior and regulation of
      states assessment by the NBAS and were followed to 8 weeks postpartum. Mother-newborn pairs
      were randomly divided into NBO intervention group and control group. NBO intervention was
      performed once a week until 2 months. 2 ml peripheral blood was collected in the pregnant
      woman before delivery and in the newborns within 3 days postpartum.The serum fraction was
      removed after centrifugation and stored at -20°C. Levels of serum cortisol in mothers and
      newborns were determined using Chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) and a radio immunoassay. All
      sample analyses were performed by the first affiliated hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong university
      chemistry laboratory. Laboratory personnel were blinded to mother and infant outcomes.

    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAMA) was used to assess mothers anxiety state and whose score ≥14 were included. Meanwhile, Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) was used to assess infants neurobehavioral development and regulation of states from birth to 2 months. Regulation of states in the NBAS including four parts: cuddliness、consolability 、self-quieting and hand-to-mouth. Every part scores from 1 to 9, and the 1 represents worst and 9 for best. Higher scores of NBAS is associated with better regulation of states. Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) would be used to improve mother-infant dyad interaction and ameliorates infants disorders of regulation of states. Mother-newborn pairs were randomly divided into NBO intervention group and control group. NBO intervention was performed once a week until 2 months. Mother-newborn pairs serum would be collected to measure cortisol.</description>
