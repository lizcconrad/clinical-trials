  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the response rate according to the
      International Working Group Response criteria for the combination of FF-10501-01 and
      azacitidine in patients previously untreated with hypomethylating agents, with Int2/High risk
      MDS according to the IPSS, and Intermediate/High/Very-High risk MDS according to the IPSS-R,
      or who are otherwise candidates for treatment with azacitidine.

      This is an open-label, Simon 2-stage clinical study of the combination of FF-10501-01 and
      azacitidine in previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS, or in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are otherwise candidates for treatment with azacitidine in
      the judgment of the Investigator. The Phase 2 portion of the trial will be preceded by a
      Phase 1 &quot;run-in&quot; to evaluate the safety of the combination of FF-10501-01 plus azacitidine.

             receptor agonists) or immunosuppressive treatments within 7 days of first dose of
             study medication

          4. Administration of any investigational agent within 5 half-lives of the agent; if the
             half-life is not known, use of such an agent within 2 weeks of the first dose of study
             medication

          5. Active infection with HIV or hepatitis B or C; patients with a history of such
             disorders should undergo serological testing to evaluate the activity of the infection
