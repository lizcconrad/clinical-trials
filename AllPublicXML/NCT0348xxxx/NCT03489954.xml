  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this research are to investigate relationship of deep cervical flexor muscle
      endurance with neck position sense and body balance in non-specific chronic neck pain, and to
      compare the results with healthy individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation will be included 2 groups which include 30 individuals with non-specific
      chronic neck pain and 30 healthy individuals. In evaluation of participants, endurance of
      deep cervical flexor muscles will be measured using Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit with
      cranio-cervical flexion test. Pressure rise which increases from 20 mmHg to 30 mmHg with 2
      mmHg increments will be performed in 5 stages. There are 10 seconds contractions at every
      stage and these contractions will be made 10 times. Endurance will be calculated by the
      cumulative performance index with the information obtained from this test. Neck position
      sense of 6-direction (flexion, extension, right-left lateral flexion and right-left rotation)
      will be measured by CROM device (cervical range of motion device). Joint position error will
      be calculated by taking the average of the absolute angular difference by 3 trial for each
      direction. Body balace will be measured by Balance Master System. Modified clinical test of
      sensory interaction balance (mCTSIB), limits of stability (LOS), rhythmic weight shift (RWS),
      unilateral stance (US), walk across (WA) and step/quick turn (SQT) will be performed.
