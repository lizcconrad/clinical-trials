      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial in a single center to explore the
      effectiveness and safety of percutaneous disc decompression with coblation nucleoplasty
      (PDCN) for the treatment of cervicogenic dizziness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vertigo ranks among the most common complaints in medicine and have a considerable personal
      impact, affecting 15-35% of the general population at some point in their lives. The
      combination of neck disorders with vertigo or dizziness was formally coined &quot;cervical
      vertigo&quot; by Ryan and Cope in 1955. The precise incidence of cervical vertigo is controversial
      but it is estimated that 20-58% of patients who sustain closed-head injuries or whiplash
      experience late onset symptoms of dizziness, vertigo and disequilibrium. The treatment option
      of cervical vertigo is versatile and challenging. Surgical intervention is recommended when
      the patient is a good candidate. Plasma-mediated ablation using the Coblation Spine-Wand
      device has been used for several years to perform spine disc decompression. However, there is
      no short and long-term report of percutaneous disc decompression with coblation nucleoplasty
      (PDCN) for treatment of cervical vertigo, and complications observed with this procedure have
      not been reported yet. In the retrospective observational study (unpublished data), the
      investigators found that PDCN was effective for reducing cervicogenic dizziness, a disabling
      and persistent problem, in the long term. A mean effective rate of 94.6% (70 of the 74
      patients) one week after surgery and 90.6% (67 of the 74 patients) at the last follow-up (1
      year to 8 years and 3 months). Good to excellent results were attained in 85.1% (63 of the 74
      patients) of these patients one week after PDCN and achieved in 75.7% (56 of the 74 patients)
      at the last follow-up (p&lt;0.0001). Recently, a randomized trial had proven that manual therapy
      had long-term beneficial effects in the treatment of chronic cervicogenic dizziness. This
      study aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial to investigate both of its short term and
      long term effectiveness and safety in prospective fashion comparing with manual therapy.
      Participants will be randomized and allocated to either PDCN group or manual therapy group
      with 1:1 ratio. All the patients had recurring symptom of dizziness over three months and
      conservative treatment applied for at least three weeks and failed.

    <description>PDCN was performed using the COBLATION Perc-DC SpineWand surgical device (ArthroCare System 2000, ArthroCare corporation, Heredia, Costa Rica, USA) under local anesthesia. The introducer cannula was then pierced into the target intervertebral disc through an anterior lateral approach. The tip of the cannula stylet was aimed for the center of the nucleus in both the coronal and sagittal planes. The stylet was withdrawn from the introducer cannula and replaced with the Perc-DC SpineWand. The wand was advanced until its tip extended approximately 5 mm beyond the tip of the cannula. A short initial coagulation was performed upon wand insertion to ensure correct placement, if stimulation or movement was detected, the wand was repositioned. As the wand was drawn back out through the disc, ablation energy was set to level three and three ablation cycles of 5-12soconds each were performed, rotating the wand tip 180 degree each time to form three consecutive pockets within the disc.</description>
