  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to look at how educational videos might affect patient
      satisfaction and anxiety before Mohs surgery day. Patients will be randomized to either: 1) a
      group that receives educational videos before the visit in addition to standard-of-care
      written and verbal instructions OR 2) a group that receives only standard-of-care written and
      verbal instructions.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if pre-operative videos describing the
      patient's forthcoming day in the Mohs clinic decrease pre-operative patient anxiety and
      increase postoperative patient satisfaction, when added to standard of care written and
      verbal instruction.

      Design/Study Type This study will be a randomized control trial in which patients will be
      randomized to either the intervention (pre-operative Mohs Surgery video viewing) or control
      (standard of care) group in order to understand the impact of the video on patient anxiety
      and satisfaction. Patients will be randomized using an Accelerated Biased Coin Design in the
      statistical program R.

    <description>For subject satisfaction score, the mean Likert scale rating for the control and intervention groups will be compared. The scale being used is a six item instrument with individual scores ranging from 1-5 (total score 6-30). Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>

    <description>For subject anxiety score, the mean Likert scale rating for the control and intervention groups will be compared. The scale being used is a seven item instrument with individual scores ranging from 1-5 with positive worded items scored in reverse (total score 7-35).

    <description>Videos will be created by the study team to ensure that the content coincides with what is delivered in the standard-of-care verbal and written instructions. The videos will be split into two modules: 1) preparing for Mohs Surgery 2) Mohs Surgery Walk through. The intervention, in the form of a video walk through, will be provided to the patient via email prior to their surgical procedure once they schedule an appointment with the Mohs clinic for their surgery day.</description>
