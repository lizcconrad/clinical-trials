  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet has a considerable influence on microbiota composition and the intake of either
      prebiotics (microbiota-specific food or probiotics (live microbiota species) has been shown
      to induce positive effects in both anxiety and depression. At present there are few studies
      exploring stress-related conditions such as emotional/comfort eating behaviours, particularly
      in individuals who have experienced early life stress and/or find stress difficult to deal
      with in regards to gut microbiome composition and subsequent behavioural outcomes. Early life
      stress has been linked to the development of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa in
      adolescence and adulthood and since the gut microbiota has been proposed as having a causal
      role in the aetiology and/or maintenance of disordered eating, an empirical question is
      whether the microbiota may mediate the relation between stress and disordered eating. This is
      an investigation into the effects of chronic daily consumption of a prebiotic on
      stress-related eating and mood.

      Following an initial screening session based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, participants
      will be randomly allocated into either the treatment or placebo group and provided with three
      weeks worth of Vivinal-GOS or maltodextrin in powder form (sachets). There will be four
      clinical visits as detailed below:

        1. Training on how to complete food diaries and collect saliva samples for cortisol
           awakening response measurements

        2. Cognitive (Affective GoNoGo and Emotion Recognition Task) and biologic measurements
           (blood,faecal). This also includes a stress inducing task (Fake Speech Task).Provided
           with supplement and invited to next session in three weeks' time.

        3. Cognitive (Affective GoNoGo and Emotion Recognition Task) and biologic measurements
           (blood,faecal). This also includes a stress inducing task (Fake Speech Task).

        4. (one week after last visit) collection of final faecal sample

    <description>A comparison of the microbiota between individuals who are or are not prone to stress/emotional eating behaviours potentially due to early life stress, and whether treatment with a prebiotic (GOS) alters this.
Metagenomic studies will be conducted to evidence base outcomes linked to changes in microbial population
1HNMR profiling will be used to identify biochemical/ bioactive mechanisms for regulatory needs</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To gain further understanding of the mechanisms of the GBA by examining blood and/or faecal levels of SCFAs and TRP, in relation to behavioural outcomes and microbiota populations.
SCFAs in serum will be measured via blood samples (ratio of acetate, propionate and butyrate) Levels of serum propionate in relation to satiety- plasma concentrations of PYY and GLP-1</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To observe whether participants engage stress related eating behaviours (over-eating, eating high energy foods) and if prebiotics negate these behaviours.
This will be measured via a exposure to a stressful situation (fake speech task) and subsequent food consumption (a meal will provided).</description>
