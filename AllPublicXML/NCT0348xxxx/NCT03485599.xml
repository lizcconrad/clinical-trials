      to Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

      contaminated blood transfusions, infected needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy,
      delivery, or from milk during breastfeeding.

      In 1986 Egypt's first AIDS case was discovered , since then the number of infected cases
      cases are increasing.According to United Nations 2016 statistics, there are about 11,000
      infected people living with Human immunodeficiency virus in Egypt.

      According to the National Aids Program, the primary mode of transmission is heterosexual
      intercourse, followed by homosexual intercourse , renal dialysis , and blood transfusion
      Others include street children, prisoners, and refugees, female sex workers, men have sex
      with men, and injecting drug users.

      Human immunodeficiency virus related stigma and discrimination is a great barrier to

      Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome people in Luxor Governorate in Upper Egypt.
