  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the daily supplementation of a nitrate-rich, two-ounce fruit and
      vegetable energy supplement (Isagenix International LLC) by healthy young adults with a would
      increase circulating nitrates and improve cardiovascular parameters compared to a
      nitrate-deficient placebo (prune juice).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial cells of the peripheral vasculature are key sources of vasoactive factors
      regulating healthy blood pressure. One of the primary vasodilatory factors released from
      these cells is nitric oxide (NO). Production of NO is stimulated both through
      enzymatic-dependent mechanisms via NO synthase, as well as from dietary intake of
      nitrate-containing foods or supplements that increase NO bioavailability. This study examined
      whether the daily consumption of a nitrate-rich, two-ounce fruit and vegetable energy
      supplement (Isagenix International LLC) would increase circulating nitrates and improve
      cardiovascular parameters compared to a nitrate-deficient placebo (prune juice). Healthy male
      adults aged 18-40y (n=45) were recruited to participate in this longitudinal double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Subjects maintained their typical diet and
      physical activity patterns during the study. Anthropometric and cardiovascular (blood
      pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)) parameters, along with plasma nitrates and
      nitrites were measured at baseline and after one and two weeks of supplementation. Subjects
      also completed questionnaires on sleep quality and mood. It is hypothesized that the
      nitrate-rich FVS supplement will provide a good source of dietary nitrates and effectively
      reduced blood pressure in normotensive, healthy young males.

    <description>The supplement contained ≈ 260-280 mg or 4 mmoles nitrate per two-ounce serving along with ≈ 51 mg total polyphenols. The FVS contains 7880 mg of a proprietary blend of beet root extract (Beta vulgaris), celery stem and leaf extract (Apium graveolens), red spinach leaf extract (Amaranthus dubius), stevia leaf extract (Stevia rebaudiana), and a fruit and vegetable extract blend (green tea leaf, red grape, white grape, bilberry, carrot, grapefruit, papaya, pineapple, strawberry, apple, apricot, cherry, orange, broccoli, green cabbage leaf, onion, garlic, black current, asparagus, tomato, olive and cucumber). Virtually all of the nitrates in FVS derive from the beet, celery, and red spinach extracts.</description>

    <description>The placebo supplement was prune juice (Sunsweet brand 100% prune juice) (PRU). Prune juice was selected based on its very similar caloric and sugar content, its high antioxidant and phenolic profile, but low nitrate content. The prune juice contained &lt;0.6 mg nitrates and 133 mg total polyphenols per two-ounce serving.</description>
