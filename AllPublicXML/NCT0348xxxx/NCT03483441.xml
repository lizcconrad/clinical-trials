  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the use of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) to treat
      the multiple basal cell carcinoma (BCC) skin cancers in children and adults with Basal Cell
      Nevus Syndrome (or who have at least 3 BCC tumors present). In addition, the investigators
      will test a hypothesis (based upon our extensive preclinical studies in mice) that induction
      of a transient spike in serum Vitamin D levels through administration of dietary Vitamin D
      (cholecalciferol; D3) can significantly increase PDT efficacy and improve the clearance of
      cutaneous BCC tumors.

      Patients with a rare genetic syndrome, called Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome or Gorlin-Goltz
      Syndrome (caused by a mutation in the PTCH1 gene) will be recruited to participate in this
      study. Potential patients will be referred by their local physicians or by the BCCNS Life
      Support Network to contact a study coordinator about enrollment.

      The study will examine a combination regimen of Vitamin D3/PDT and compare its efficacy in
      treating BCC tumors to PDT alone. The hypothesis is that oral D3 supplements, administered
      over a relatively short time, can boost the effectiveness of PDT for cutaneous (BCC) in this
      patient population. Participants will receive three PDT treatments, at two-month intervals,
      over a 6 month period.

      Tumor clinical clearance rates after neoadjuvant Vitamin D3/PDT, versus PDT alone, will be
      compared within the same patient. Measurement endpoints will include tumor dimensions by
      clinical examination, tumor measurements in photographs, PpIX fluorescence, serum 25OH-D3
      levels, and characterization of VDR gene alleles. In addition, assessments of the
      tolerability (pain scale measurements) and patient satisfaction with the technique will be
      measured.

    <description>For each patient, the investigators will analyze the difference in tumor clearance between treatments, one with neoadjuvant D3+PDT, the other with PDT alone, and the other with or without D3 in order to establish a D3 replete state. The order of the first two treatments is randomized in case the assumption of a linear tumor clearance rate is incorrect. The statistical significance of the difference in tumor clearance after D3+PDT versus the difference in tumor clearance after PDT alone will be tested using ANOVA.</description>
