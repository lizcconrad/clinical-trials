  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is looking at a drug called BT1718 in adult patients with advanced solid
      tumours. The main aim of the study is to find the maximum dose of BT1718 that can be given
      safely to patients; learn more about the potential side effects of BT1718 and how they can be
      treated and also what happens to BT1718 inside the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BT1718 is a type of drug called a 'bicycle drug conjugate' which is designed to target and
      inhibit the function of the protein 'membrane type 1 metalloproteinase' (MT1-MMP). MT1-MMP is
      involved in breaking down the proteins that usually surround a cell; however in cancer cells
      it can allow a cancer to grow and spread. MT1-MMP is usually found at a low level in normal
      cells, but can reach higher levels in cancer cells.

      BT1718 has been designed to recognise and attach itself to the MT1-MMP protein. Once attached
      a segment of BT1718 is taken into the cancer cell which causes it to die (DM1 toxin).

      This is a first in human clinical study which has two phases. A 'dose escalation' phase where
      groups of patients will receive increasing doses of BT1718 to find a safe dose that best
      targets the cancer cells. In this phase it is expected that approximately 40-50 patients with
      advanced solid tumours will be entered in the study.

      An 'expansion phase' where larger groups of patients will receive the selected dose of BT1718
      to allow us to find out more about how the drug is working. In this phase it is proposed that
      approximately 60-70 patients with either Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), Non-Small Cell
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or Sarcoma will be entered in the study, as these tumour types are
      commonly known to overexpress MT1-MMP.

    <description>Dose escalation will consist of Stage 1 and 2. Stage 1 patients will receive BT1718 intravenously twice a week (D: 1,4,8,11,15,18) for 3 out of 4 weeks. Starting dose will be 0.6mg/m2. Single patient cohorts will be explored, but it will change to 3 to 6 patients cohorts. Stage 2 patients will receive BT1718 intravenously once a week (D: 1,8,15) for 3 out of 4 weeks. Starting dose will be less than the total weekly dose from Stage 1. This stage will have 3 to 6 patient cohorts until the recommended dose is established. Expansion phase has four sub-parts: Part A, B, C, D. Part A will commence at the twice weekly recommended dose established in Stage 1. It is expected that this phase will run in parallel to the 'Dose escalation phase', Stage 2. Part B will commence at the once weekly recommended dose established in Stage 2. C&amp;D will commence once the data from A and B are reviewed.</description>

          6. Female patients who are able to become pregnant (or are already pregnant or
             lactating). However, those patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             before enrolment and agree to use two forms of contraception (one effective form plus
             a barrier method) [oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception and condom;
             intra-uterine device and condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom] or agree
             to sexual abstinence8, effective from the first administration of BT1718, throughout
             the trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible.

          7. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence9 effective from the first administration of
             BT1718, throughout the trial and for six months afterwards. Men with partners of
             child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner uses an
             effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal
             contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual
             abstinence). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier
             method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of
             the foetus or neonate.

          8. Surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

          9. At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including active

             (New York Heart Association [NYHA]) Appendix 3, prior history of cardiac ischaemia or
             prior history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia.

         12. Previous known allergy to one of the constituents or excipients of BT1718.

         13. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I/IIa study of BT1718. Participation in an
             observational trial or interventional clinical trial which does not involve
             administration of an IMP and which would not place an unacceptable burden on the
             patient in the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Advisor would be acceptable.

         14. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
