  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure peak skin interface pressures and the total area of
      the body exposed to skin interface pressure above 30 mm Hg at different areas of the body in
      the supine position on two different support surfaces applied to a standard North Atlantic
      Treaty Organization (NATO) litter (NSN: 6530-01-380-7309) and a Raven 90C Litter
      (NSN6530-01-432-5114). The support surfaces are the Warrior Evacuation Litter Pad (WELP) and
      the Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation Stretcher System (FIS). These pressure measurements
      along with laser doppler flow and transcutaneous oxygenation readings will allow us to
      determine differences between support surfaces.

      The purpose of this study is to measure peak skin interface pressures and the total area of
      the body exposed to skin interface pressure above 30 mm Hg at different areas of the body in
      the supine position on two different support surfaces applied to a standard North Atlantic
      Treaty Organization (NATO) litter (NSN: 6530-01-380-7309) and a Raven 90C Litter
      (NSN6530-01-432-5114). The Raven 90C is the official litter for the U.S. Navy. It is approved
      for flight on USAF aircraft. It can be easily folded for storage and transport to remote
      settings. The support surfaces are the Warrior Evacuation Litter Pad (WELP) and the Dolphin
      Fluid Immersion Simulation Stretcher System (FIS). In theory, mattresses that reduce and/or
      minimize pressure on the capillary bed's perfusion can help reduce pressure related injury
      such as pressure or decubitus ulcer development. Skin interface pressure measurements using a
      pressure mapping system along with laser doppler flow and transcutaneous oxygenation readings
      will allow us to determine these differences between support surfaces. A better understanding
      of skin interface pressure associated with the litter support surfaces is vital for military
      nurses to develop and implement preventative interventions to reduce pressure ulcer
      development in our patients. In addition, this study will provide information to help
      determine the usefulness and feasibility of incorporating the fluid immersion system (FIS) as
      a litter support surface.

      This research protocol has one major aim:

      To determine the difference in the pressure redistribution qualities between the WELP and the
      Dolphin FIS

      There are also two secondary aims:

        1. To determine the difference in the pressure redistribution qualities of the WELP when
           used as the mattress on the NATO litter and Raven litter.

        2. To determine the difference in the pressure redistribution qualities of the Dolphin FIS
           when used as the mattress on the NATO litter and Raven litter.

    <measure>Pressure Redistribution: Peak Pressure Index</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 80 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure redistribution qualities will be measured in mmHg using XSensor X3 pressure mapping technology. To minimize the risk of a faulty sensor or false reading over one sensor, the average of eight cells around the region will be recorded and referred to as the Peak Pressure Index (PPI). Peak interface pressure is the highest average pressure (mm Hg) measured over vulnerable bony prominences (occiput, sacrum, and bilateral scapula, buttocks, and heels). PPI will be measured in mm Hg.</description>

    <measure>Tissue Perfusion: Transcutaneous Oxygenation</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 80 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue perfusion (microcirculation) will be measured over the both scapula using transcutaneous partial pressures of oxygen (tcpO2). Blood perfusion is the most important parameter when studying the microvascular circulation. TcpO2 will be measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It is a non-invasive measurement of the skin's surface partial pressure of oxygen. TcpO2 will be captured in the scapula region. It has been used as the index of tissue viability</description>

    <description>Interface pressure will be measured using the XSensor X3 Pressure Mapping System. Transducers and probes will be placed near both scapula. Measures will be obtained in upright (baseline) and supine positions on 4 randomly assigned litter mattress combinations. Constant TCPO2 and Doppler measures, as well as peak pressures and total body surface area exposed to skin will be measured for the occiput, sacrum, both scapula, buttocks and heel areas. It will take about 20 minutes for each combination. The session is complete after all measures have been obtain for all litter/mattress combinations.</description>
