  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single arm post-marketing clinical study of patients
      undergoing percutaneous ultrasound guided medial and lateral tenotomy using the TenJet
      HydroSurgery System to treat elbow tendinosis. Patients will be followed for a maximum of 12
      months post-procedure.
