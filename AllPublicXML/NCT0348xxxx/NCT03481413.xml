  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data collection from arrhythmia patients undergoing catheter-based electrophysiological (EP)
      intervention in order to develop a patient specific optimized therapy (PSOT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, open label, single arm study. Consented subjects
      who are scheduled to undergo ablation due to arrhythmia will be enrolled in the study. Data
      will be collected from all subjects during the ablation procedure and post procedure for a
      period of 36 months.

      KODEX - EPD™ system will be used in all procedures during treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.

      Anonymized data will be stored in an EPD database and will be used to train and test
      predictors for personalized optimized therapy.
