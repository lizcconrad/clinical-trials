  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB-family blocker with approved clinical activity in
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. It has received regulatory approval
      for use as a treatment for patients with lung adenocarcinoma whose tumors harbour activating
      EGFR mutations within exons 18-21 of the EGFR receptor, or patients with lung squamous cell
      carcinoma whose disease progress after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. However, diarrhea
      is the most commonly reported adverse events associated with afatinib treatment (&gt; 90%).
      Although these events are generally mild to moderate in severity, diarrhea adversely affects
      the tolerability of cancer treatment, and in severe cases diarrhea has the potential to
      affect the efficacy of treatment due to poor compliance, or treatment interruption, or dosage
      reduction. Currently, no prophylactic measure was demonstrated efficaciously. Bacillus cereus
      is an aerobic spore-forming bacterium that is commonly found in soil. The efficacy of
      Bacillus cereus in the management of afatinib treatment-associated diarrhoea has not been
      extensively evaluated in clinical studies. This is a single-arm, single-institutional, phase
      II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Bacillus cereus (Changfukang®) in the
      prevention of afatinib-associated diarrhea in NSCLC patients.
