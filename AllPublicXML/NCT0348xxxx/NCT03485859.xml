  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been no studies exploring the efficacy of incision support using an elastic
      abdominal binder after laparoscopy to date. The investigators performed therefore a
      randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of post-laparoscopic abdominal binder use
      on enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in patients with gynecologic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An abdominal elastic binder (girdles, trusses, abdominal belts, longuette, etc.) is a wide
      belt that surrounds the abdomen and supports the incision . Abdominal binder is routinely
      used after open surgery and Cesarean section, because it has been reported, according to a
      recent systematic review, to facilitate enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) such as pain
      relief, reduced risk of seroma formation, improved respiratory function, and assisted
      physical function using additional support to the lower abdominal musculature.

      However, the routine use of abdominal binder after laparoscopy has been challenged due to a
      potential risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and deep venous thrombosis due to
      increased intra-abdominal pressure. Also, abdominal binders after laparoscopy have been
      criticized for being uncomfortable and hot to wear and for impinging the breast line in
      females. Therefore, some laparoscopists prefer the use of abdominal binder in patients
      undergoing laparoscopy, while other laparoscopists did not. However, there have been no
      studies exploring the efficacy of incision support using an elastic abdominal binder after
      laparoscopy to date. The investigators performed therefore a randomized controlled trial to
      determine the effect of post-laparoscopic abdominal binder use on ERAS in patients with
      gynecologic disease.

    <measure>postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>at 48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated postoperative pain intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS) at 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. The scale was presented as a 10-cm line with verbal descriptors ranging from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>limitation of walking ability</measure>
    <time_frame>at 48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to place a mark on a 10-cm line corresponding to the percentage of full-walking ability, with 0 cm representing no activity limitation and 10 cm being the maximal activity limitation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incentive spirometry performance</measure>
    <time_frame>at 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Volumetric incentive spirometry (Hyupsung Medical Co., Ltd, Yangju, Republic of Korea) was performed in all subjects at 24 hours after surgery, because inspiratory spirometry can be used as a simple mean to follow lung volume, especially vital capacity and inspiratory reserve volume, in postoperative period in spontaneous breathing patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the degree of comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>at 48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of comfort regarding the abdominal binder was evaluated using 5-point Likert scale, as follows: 1 = uncomfortable, 2 = slightly uncomfortable, 3 = satisfactory, 4 = comfortable, and 5 = very comfortable.</description>

    <description>In subjects allocated to the abdominal binder group, the abdomen binder with a standard height of 22 cm (Sejung Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea) was applied before leaving the operating room. The binder was placed on the abdomen across the laparoscopic incision, with the upper border not higher than the lower margin of the rib cage, ensuring minimal restriction of lateral costal expansion and diaphragmatic excursion. Subjects were carefully instructed to use the abdominal binder during at least the first 2 consecutive days and night, and to reposition the abdominal binder correctly when needed.</description>
