      The purpose of this study is to determine whether IFX-1 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic devastating skin disorder affecting areas rich in
      apocrine glands. HS is diagnosed by its clinical features and its chronicity. It is
      recognized by the presence of recurrent, painful, deep-seated, rounded nodules usually ending
      in abscesses and sinus tracts with suppuration and hypertrophic scarring. As complement C5a
      is involved in the underlying acute inflammatory responses, this study is set up based on the
      hypothesis that IFX-1 might be able to block C5a induced pro-inflammatory effects such as
      neutrophil activation and cytokine generation, potentially contributing to the local skin
      inflammation and tissue damage.
