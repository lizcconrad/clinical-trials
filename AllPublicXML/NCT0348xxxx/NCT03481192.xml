  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify in patients admitted for Voluntary drug poisoning (IMV) by psychoactive
      substances, T1 predictors of T2 recall of psychiatric interview and care project.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The methodology will compare the episodic memory results of patients admitted for IMV who
      have exclusively ingested amnesic substances to a subject control group that has made IMV
      with non-amnesic substances such as paracetamol. The purpose of this comparison is to ensure
      that memory problems are not related to the context of the suicidal crisis.

      The second step will be able to relate the memory score of the predictor variables. To
      achieve this, it will perform a multivariate linear regression in each group in order to
      confirm the results of the pilot study and to be able to regress in the control group which
      was not possible in the pilot study because of the lack of effective.

      Finally, this study will try to establish, using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
      curves, thresholds for cognitive scores and begin to develop a tool for clinical practice.

    <description>This score is based on the episodic scale. The episodic score is a reflection of the patient's memory of the emergency psychiatric assessment. In this study, this score will be used as a variable independent of the multivariate linear regression, the objective of the study being to identify the variables significantly related to this score.
The total episodicity score is calculated by adding the episodic scores of several events. A continuous score is obtained and between 0 and 38.</description>

    <description>Visit 1:The first evaluation (E1) of cognitive functions will take place directly following the psychiatric interview (T1), in order to better reflect the cognitive abilities at the time of the proposal of the care project.
This will include the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), the five words of DUBOIS, the TMT-A and B, the WAIS code test, and the BADDELEY door test. An intercurrent type ringing event of the phone will take place during this evaluation.
Visit 2: At 24h-48h of the psychiatric evaluation (T2), a second evaluation (E2) will take place.
An episodic memory score will be determined by asking the patient to recall,as precisely as possible the evaluation E1. At first the reminder will be free,the data can be completed, if necessary, with an indication, a recognition.</description>
