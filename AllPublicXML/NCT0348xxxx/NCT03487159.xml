    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the ability of Magnetic Resonance Elastography non invasive technology
      to identify the liver fibrosis stage in patients with chronic liver diseases compared to
      Shear Wave Elastography and/or Liver Biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver have led to improvements in
      diagnosis of chronic liver diseases. Detection and staging of liver fibrosis has become
      important; however, until about the last decade, it depended on an invasive liver biopsy.
      Liver biopsy is limited by high cost, low patient acceptance, interobserver variability
      during microscopic evaluation, sampling error, poor reproducibility, and, importantly, an
      invasive nature with a complication rate of 3% and a mortality rate of 0.03%. With the
      emergence of elastography techniques, the need for liver biopsy has rapidly diminished for
      diagnosis of clinically significant liver fibrosis. Magnetic Resonance Elastography has
      gained increasing popularity in recent years, in large part due to its higher technical
      success and ability to overcome some of the weaknesses of ultrasound-based methods for
      assessing liver fibrosis.

    <description>Liver Fibrosis score measured by Metavir scale .The Metavir score grades the degree of fibrosis on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4. The activity, which is the amount of inflammation (specifically, the intensity of necro-inflammatory lesions), is graded on a 4-point scale from A0 to A3.
Fibrosis score:
F0 = no fibrosis F1 = portal fibrosis without septa F2 = portal fibrosis with few septa F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis F4 = cirrhosis
Activity score:
A0 = no activity A1 = mild activity A2 = moderate activity A3 = severe activity Liver biopsy will be perfomed only according to physician recommendation.</description>
