          -  The subjects who have not recovered to baseline or CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 from related
             toxicity to all prior therapies will be excluded. Patients with Non-serious adverse

             completed any prior treatment for CNS metastases &gt; 28 days prior to study entry
             including radiotherapy or surgery. Steroids for the treatment of brain metastasis are
             not permitted, and patients must be stable off steroid treatment for 4 weeks prior to

             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
