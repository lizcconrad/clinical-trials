  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to improve efficacy of nivolumab in patients with relapsed or
      refractory HL who recently progressed on anti-PD1 therapy. Nivolumab is highly effective and
      well tolerated in rrHL, nevertheless CR-rates are low and a considerable proportion of
      patients suffers from progressive disease. Localized RT induces an immunogenic effect which
      might work synergistically and facilitate augmented systemic (i.e. abscopal) responses in
      combination with nivolumab.
