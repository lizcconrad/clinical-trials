  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans who have prematurely dropped out of exposure therapy for PTSD will be contacted and
      offered the opportunity to return to treatment, this time with the assistance of an in vivo
      exposure therapy 'workout buddy'. This peer will meet them at the in vivo exposure therapy
      location and offer support an encouragement while the patient remains in that location. As
      the PTSD treatment standards in Charleston and other VA sites across the country increasingly
      include telemedicine delivered care, both in person and telemedicine based exposure therapy
      recipients will be included. There will be no randomization; all participants will receive
      the peer support 'workout buddy' for exposure therapy assignments.

      Veterans (participants and peers) with PTSD will be recruited from the Charleston VA Medical
      Center catchment area. Participants will have been assigned to exposure therapy for PTSD and
      either started treatment, or dropped out before treatment; peers will have successfully
      completed exposure therapy for PTSD. Those eligible to participate will also include Veterans
      who are identified as &quot;at-risk&quot; of dropping out, Veterans who are uncomfortable completing in
      vivo exposure activities, and those who may have PTSD symptoms, but at the sub-threshold
      level. Participants will receive 8-12 weekly sessions of exposure therapy treatment with
      assistance of a PE Peer. Half of subjects will be randomized to the PE+Workout Buddy
      condition, where they will complete treatment with the assistance of a Veteran who will meet
      them at least once per week for in vivo exposure therapy assignments, for 3-4 weeks at the
      beginning of treatment. Half of subjects will be randomized to the PE+General Support
      condition, where they will complete treatment with the assistance of a Veteran who will call
      them via telephone once per week to encourage session attendance and ask about treatment
      progress, life stresses, etc. General support peers will also meeting Veterans 2-4 times per
      month to check in about treatment progress. All participants and peers will be consented.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3- &amp; 6-month follow-up.

    <measure>Clinical Administrated PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD (Posttraumatic stress disorder) Scale (CAPS) is a 30-item structured interview that corresponds to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Version (DSM-V) criteria for PTSD. The CAPS can be used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD or to assesses symptoms over the past week. CAPS-5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM-5 cluster: Criterion B (items 1-5); Criterion C (items 6-7); Criterion D (items 8-14); and, Criterion E (items 15-20). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. Scores range from 0 to 80.</description>

    <description>Practice guidelines have identified that trauma-focused psychotherapies have most evidence for treatment PTSD. Prolonged Exposure (PE) is one type of trauma-focused psychotherapy. PE teaches you to gradually approach trauma-related memories, feelings, and situations that you have been avoiding since your trauma. By confronting these challenges, you can decrease your PTSD symptoms. Treatment will last anywhere from 8-12 weeks for 75-90 minutes, once per week.</description>
