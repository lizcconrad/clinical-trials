  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the sustainability of pain and functional outcomes along with return
      to opioid use in a population of patients that successfully completed a comprehensive
      interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. In addition, this study will compare outcomes
      sustainability and return to opioid use between pain program graduates who receive post
      discharge self-management resources consisting of a DVD with videos of recommended
      flexibility practice (standard of care) or access to an online telerehabilitation platform
      that provides patients with access to the flexibility practice videos on a variety of
      telecommunication devices (e.g., computer, smart phone, tablet).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this paper is to compare the use of an online telerehabilitation
      platform versus a standard prerecorded DVD in supporting the sustainability of outcomes
      achieved during a comprehensive multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation program.

      Primary Hypotheses Graduates from a comprehensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation
      program will…

        1. …demonstrate greater adherence to post-discharge home exercise recommendations when
           given access to an online telerehabilitation platform compared to DVDs offered as
           current standard of care.

        2. …achieve greater sustainability of programs outcomes including pain intensity, level of
           function, and reduction of opioid use.

      Primary Research Questions

        1. Does access to an online telerehabilitation platform impact adherence to post-discharge
           home exercise recommendations in graduates from a comprehensive interdisciplinary pain
           rehabilitation program?

        2. Does access to an online telerehabilitation platform impact outcomes sustainability and
           opioid use in graduates from a comprehensive interdisciplinary pain management program?

      Additional items that will be evaluated by this study include the participants' experience
      and satisfaction with use of the online telerehabilitation platform.

      Secondary Hypotheses

        1. Participants using the online telerehabilitation platform will report a more enjoyable
           experience and overall greater satisfaction with post-discharge self-management compared
           to participants receiving standard of care.

        2. Utilization of the online telerehabilitation platform will be associated with
           perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of internet technology.

      Secondary Research Questions

        1. Does use of an online telerehabilitation platform impact patient satisfaction with
           post-discharge self-management compared to current standard of care?

        2. Does internet technology acceptance impact utilization of post-discharge self-management
           resources provided through an online telerehabilitation platform?

    <intervention_model_description>A stratified random sampling approach will be used for this study whereby graduates from the BPRP will first be identified as having weaned off opioid medications (weaners) or did not wean off opioid medication (non-weaners). Once stratified into these two groups, participants will then be randomly assigned to either the standard care group (control group) or the telerehabilitation group (intervention group) based on sequential enrollment into each study group. Participants will continue with there post-discharge exercise and self-management program for one year, completing follow up assessment using the online platform at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post discharge.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>PROMIS Measure - Physical Function - Short Form 8b</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Physical Function instruments measure self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes the functioning of one's upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back), as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running errands. A single Physical Function capability score is obtained from a short form. Each Physical Function instrument is appropriate for the adult general population and adults with chronic health conditions.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Measure - Pain Interference - Short Form 4a</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Pain Interference item banks assess self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. Pain Interference also incorporates items probing sleep and enjoyment in life, though the item bank only contains one sleep item. The pain interference short forms are universal rather than disease-specific. All assess pain interference over the past seven days.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Measure - Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms - Short Form 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy is defined as confidence in one's ability to successfully perform specific tasks or behaviors. Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions assesses confidence in one's ability to successfully perform specific tasks or behaviors related to one's health in a variety of situations. Several domains of Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions relate to specific aspects of managing chronic conditions.
Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions - Manage Symptoms: Confidence to manage/control their symptoms, to manage their symptoms in different settings and to keep symptoms from interfering with work, sleep, relationships or recreational activities.
The Self-Efficacy item banks are universal rather than disease-specific. The respondent should be an adult (age18+) and have at least one chronic health condition. The PROMIS Adult Self-Efficacy items banks have been modified from the NIH Toolbox Self-Efficacy item bank.</description>
