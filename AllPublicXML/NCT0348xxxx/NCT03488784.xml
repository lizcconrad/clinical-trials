      This is an observational study, no drug (marketed or investigational) will be provided as
      part of the study, and the study procedures will have no impact on the medical care delivered
      to patients participating in this study. The overall study data collection period is planned
      to last up to 5 years with assessments occurring at baseline, and every 6 months thereafter
      for a total period of 3 years.

      Medical records for enrolled patients will be abstracted at baseline and annually to obtain
      clinical information, and data will be recorded for the study. Eligible patients will be
      asked to provide informed consent and to complete semi-annual patient surveys and functional
      assessments. The patient surveys will include selected PRO instrument(s) along with
      additional questions to characterize the patient's perception of disease.

      Neuromuscular disease can be characterized by progressive muscle degeneration, impaired
      pulmonary status, and decreased cardiac function.(1-8) Additionally, these neuromuscular
      disorders can be rare, and therefore difficult to establish the natural progression of each
      disease.The natural history of each neuromuscular disorder provides valuable information
      about the specific progression of the disease, which can guide in understanding which
      outcomes to measure in order to show change for clinical trials. Experimental treatments for
      many of these neuromuscular disorders are currently being assessed in clinical trials with
      others in the pipeline for upcoming clinical trials in the near future. Thus, the need to
      reliably and objectively detect small, meaningful changes in daily functional activities in
      order to serve as a supportive measure of efficacy in clinical trials is of great importance.

      Functional and strength measures have been utilized as primary, secondary or exploratory
      outcomes in clinical trials studying the efficacy of drug therapies. Many of these outcome
      measures have been shown to be reliable and have been validated in neuromuscular disease.

      This longitudinal study aims to characterize the clinical progression and functional impact
      on patients with neuromuscular disorders over time by evaluating functional and
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The association between functional impairment and long-term
      outcomes, such as loss of mobility, falls, and quality of life, will be examined.
