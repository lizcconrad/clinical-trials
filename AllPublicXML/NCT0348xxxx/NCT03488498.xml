  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is typical of chronic low back pain that, after the first painful episode, is repeated at
      44-78% of patients. For acute lumbar pain, approx. 10-15% of them are converted into chronic.
      Conservative treatments are few studies done in the traction therapy. A large number of
      multicenter trials did not evaluate the effectiveness of underwater traction therapy.

      Goals are the followings:

        1. Is the beneficial effect of a weight bath comparable to a non-treated control group with
           respect to clinical parameters?

        2. How much does the quality of life change in an initial state and how much is it in
           comparison with the control group?
