  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate patient-reported outcomes during and after
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will
      be randomized to a standard 6-week radiotherapy course or a 4-week radiotherapy course using
      dose-painting based on pre-treatment PET findings.

      This study is open for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This study offers such
      patients the chance for a shorter and more personalized treatment course utilizing PET
      imaging.

      Patients will be stratified based on performance status and tumor size and randomized to one
      of two treatment plans:

        1. PET-based, dose-painted, accelerated chemoradiotherapy over 4 weeks (20 radiotherapy
           fractions)

        2. Standard chemoradiotherapy over 6 weeks (30 radiotherapy fractions)

      All patients will receive standard weekly doses of chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel)
      during radiotherapy. This may be followed by adjuvant systemic therapy, at the discretion of
      the treating physicians.

      All patients will undergo standard evaluations prior to enrollment, during treatment, and
      after treatment. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes will be assessed periodically using
      a PRO-CTCAE tool.

        following stages (according to the AJCC Staging Manual, 7th edition,

        Appendix):

          -  Stage IIIA or IIIB
