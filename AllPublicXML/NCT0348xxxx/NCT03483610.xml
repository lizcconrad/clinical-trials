  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn methods to encourage women to get recommended cervical
      cancer screening. Cervical cancer screening is an important part of cervical cancer
      prevention. The study team will determine if the patient is currently up-to-date with
      cervical cancer screening recommendations. If the patient is not up-to-date, then they will
      be randomly assigned to one of two interventions. One intervention consists only of referral
      to a women's health care provider to obtain cervical cancer screening. The other intervention
      consists of receiving a total of 3 text messages at 30-day intervals encouraging follow-up
      for cervical cancer screening.
