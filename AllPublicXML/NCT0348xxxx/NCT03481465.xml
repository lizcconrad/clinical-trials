  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate, at long-term, the occurrence of liver disease and
      cardio-vascular risk, in a sample of patients diagnosed with first episode of non-affective
      psychosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder with an excess mortality and reduced life
      expectancy. It has been proposed that around 60% of this excess mortality is due to physical
      pathology, mostly cardio-metabolic disorders. In addition to the deleterious effects of
      hypercaloric diet and sedentary lifestyle, the use of antipsychotic medication has itself a
      significant effect on metabolism. The metabolic disturbances described related to
      antipsychotic exposure include weight gain and obesity, dyslipemia, and insulin-resistance or
      new onset diabetes mellitus, representing cardio-metabolic risk factors leading to
      cardio-vascular events at the long-run. Some of these metabolic disturbances have been
      described as relevant factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development.
      NAFLD is accepted to be the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome, and it has been
      described as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. A recent study by our group found a
      significant increase in the prevalence of hepatic steatosis after 3 years of antipsychotic
      treatment in a sample of patients with psychosis. Other studies proposed that there is a link
      between NAFLD and severe cardio-vascular disease that may be early predicted through
      peripheral microvascular system signs (endothelial dysfunction). Interestingly, recent
      studies have shown the presence of endothelial dysfunction in psychosis, probably related to
      antipsychotic-exposure. In summary, the investigators consider of relevance the study of a
      possible interrelation between metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, and endothelial dysfunction, at
      long-term, and their probable correlation with antipsychotic exposure.

      Based on the available scientific evidence, the investigators hypothesize that the long-term
      exposure to antipsychotic medication would be related to liver disease and endothelial
      dysfunction.

      The research project would be implemented as part of a larger prospective longitudinal study
      on first episode non-affective psychosis, in the First Episode Psychosis Clinical Program
      (PAFIP). In particular, the project would be part of the &quot;10 PAFIP study&quot;, in which those
      patients that had been included in the PAFIP program 10 years ago will be extensively
      evaluated (e.g.: clinical, neuroimaging, neuro-psychological, and metabolic evaluations) in
      order to analyse the long-term progress of the psychosis.

      Steatosis and fibrosis indexes would be determined for 10-years time point. For those
      patients with scores predicting hepatic fibrosis, a full hepatic examination, including
      elastometry assessment (FibroScan®) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and abdominal
      ultrasound would be carried out. Moreover, endothelial function would be examined, using
      EndoPAT2000® and carotid ultrasound evaluation, for those patients turning 10 years since
      their antipsychotic treatment was firstly prescribed.
