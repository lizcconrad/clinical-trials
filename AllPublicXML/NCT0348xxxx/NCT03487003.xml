  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is increasing in pediatric anesthesia because it
      provides lesser direct mechanical stimulation of the airway due to being placed above the
      larynx. However, LMA insertion can be more difficult in children than in adults due to their
      unique characteristics of pediatric airway. Neuromuscular blocking agents, so-called, muscle
      relaxants have long been used to facilitate insertion of airway devices. But there are pros
      and cons for the efficacy of muscle relaxants in LMA insertion, and most studies were
      investigated in adults.
