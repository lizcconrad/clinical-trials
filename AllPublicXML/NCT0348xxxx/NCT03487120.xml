  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single blinded RCT for adult patients with spine pain. One group had a lumbar laminectomy
      with denervation of the facet joint at the level decompressed. The other group had a lumbar
      laminectomy without facet joint denervation. Both groups had their back pain and functional
      limitations measured using a 10 cm visual analogue scale and the Oswestry disability index
      (ODI). All measures were taken before surgery and at patients' 6, 12 and 24 week follow-up
      clinic visit.

    <measure>Change in Modified Oswestry Disability score (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is divided into ten sections designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section is scored on a 0-5 scale. The range of scores is 0 to a maximum of 60. The total score is multiplied by 2 and expressed as a percentage. A score of 0 to 20 points indicates minimal disability; 20 to 40 points, moderate disability; and 40 to 60 points, severe disability.</description>
