  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will explore the feasibility of doing a randomized controlled trial in our
      Intensive care department, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh which will test a two-step
      approach to protein intake in which moderate amount is given in the first 5 days followed by
      a step-up to higher protein (with supplementation of whey protein) compared to continuation
      on moderate protein.

      The study will use a modified version of the enteral feeding protocol which was developed by
      KAMC ICU team and has been studied and published 20. For reference the protocol used at adult
      ICU at KAMC is displayed in the attached appendix and the summary of the latest SCCM
      guidelines is outlined below for reference purposes. After confirmation of the tube tip
      placement in the stomach or in post-pyloric location by plain x-ray, feeding will be started
      at 30 cc/hour and advanced by 10 cc/h every four hours. For tubes of gastric placement,
      residuals are checked every 4 hours. Residuals are not checked for post-pyloric tubes unless
      there are signs of feeding intolerance such as vomiting, abdominal distention or ileus. In
      such cases, an attempt to aspirate is made through the feeding tube. If unable to aspirate
      because of the small size, a second larger size tube could- at the discretion of the treating
      physician- be placed into the stomach to aspirate the gastric residual. The protocol gives
      instructions to the nurses on how to handle residuals exceeding 200 ml. Of note that the
      protocol does not include the routine use of prokinetic agents or post-pyloric tubes and
      these options are left to the treating physicians to consider when the patient continues to
      demonstrate evidence of feeding intolerance. The type of feeding tube (large-bore nasogastric
      tube or small-bore nasogastric tube with or without guide wire) is left entirely to the
      treating physician. In addition, the protocol includes keeping the patient in a
      semi-recumbent position to reduce the risk of aspiration. The protocol also discourages
      discontinuation of enteral feeding during diagnostic tests, usual nursing care or routine
      bedside procedures because of its significant negative impact on feeding delivery and the
      lack of significant aspiration risk of briefly placing the patient in supine position.

      The goal of caloric intake in patients in study group is 40-60% of the estimated need
      throughout the study period (permissive underfeeding group). These goals will be achieved by
      daily assessments of the caloric intake for the previous increasing the intake according to
      the nutrition sliding scale provided with the feeding protocol. Calculation of caloric intake
      will take into account IV infusions of dextrose and propofol. Protein requirement will be
      calculated as 0.8-1.0g/kg based on the patient condition and underlying diseases in the first
      5 days in both groups17. For patients who are randomized to the Replenish Protocol group,
      Beneprotein formula will be used to supplement protein to receive 2 g/kg/day protein
      requirement. Patients in the control group will continue to receive 0.8-1 g/kg/day. All
      patients included in the study in both arms will receive multivitamins (containing vitamin E,
      vitamin C and trace elements like Selenium, Zinc and Copper) daily.
