  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cancer diagnosis affects not only patients but also their caregivers. The purpose of this
      study is to test the feasibility of using a mobile app suite, IntelliCare, to improve the
      mental health of cancer patients and caregivers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients and/or their caregivers will receive access to the mobile app suite,
      IntelliCare, as well as phone coaching that will focus on how to use the apps. IntlliCare is
      composed of separate apps that each target a specific aspect of mental health (e.g., reducing
      worry). The apps are interactive and designed for users to engage in short time bursts (e.g.,
      less than a minute). IntelliCare was originally designed to be paired with phone coaching
      that focuses on how to use the apps and overcome barriers to usage.

    <description>IntelliCare is composed of 13 separate, native apps. Each app targets a specific aspect of mental health (e.g., reducing worry, increasing social support, tracking negative thoughts). The apps are available to the public in both Android and iPhone stores. Participants will be asked to try two new IntelliCare apps every week, for 7 weeks. Phone coaching will occur at Day 0, before using any of the apps, and the third week of app usage.</description>
