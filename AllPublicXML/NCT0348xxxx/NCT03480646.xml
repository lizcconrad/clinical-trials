  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, open label phase 1b/2 with an oral administration of CPI-1205 in
      combination with either enzalutamide or abiraterone/prednisone in male patients with
      metastatic Castration This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and
      efficacy profiles of CPI-1205 in combination with either enzalutamide or
      abiraterone/prednisone.

      Following determination of MTD and RP2D will proceed to phase 2. Patients in phase 2 will
      receive CPI-1205 at the RP2D in combination with either enzalutamide or
      abiraterone/prednisone.
