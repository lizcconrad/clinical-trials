    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how fast LY3298176 gets into the blood stream and how
      long it takes the body to remove it in participants with impaired kidney function compared to
      healthy participants.

                  infertile due to surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                  tubal ligation), congenital anomaly such as mullerian agenesis; or postmenopausal

               -  Are between the body mass index (BMI) of 19.0 and 40.0 kilograms per meter
                  squared (kg/m²), inclusive, at screening

          -  Healthy Participants:

             -- Healthy males or females as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             and other screening procedures, with normal renal function, assessed by estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥90 milliliters per minute (mL/min) at screening

          -  Participants with Renal Impairment or ESRD:

             -- Males or females with stable mild to severe renal impairment, assessed by eGFR or
             with ESRD (having received hemodialysis for at least 3 months)

          -  Participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Renal Impairment or ESRD:

               -  Have T2DM controlled with diet or exercise alone or stable on metformin for at
                  least 8 weeks

               -  Taking stable doses of over-the-counter or prescription medications (eg,

                  concurrent medical conditions are permitted to participate providing they have
                  been stable on their treatment regimen for at least 4 weeks

               -  Have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.0% and ≤11.0% at screening

                  stenosis, with the exception of appendectomy) or could be aggravated by
                  glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs or dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)
                  inhibitors

          -  Participants with Renal Impairment or ESRD:

               -  Have hemoglobin &lt;8.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or significant active
                  hematological disease from causes other than underlying renal disease.

               -  Have used any drug indicated for medical care of the participant's renal
                  impairment, which is not established in dose and administered for at least 7 days
                  before LY3298176 administration

          -  Participants with T2DM and Renal Impairment or ESRD:

               -  Have taken any glucose-lowering medications other than metformin, including
                  insulin, in the past 3 months before screening

                  Diabetes Association criteria, within 6 months before entry into the study or has
                  a history of hypoglycemia unawareness or poor recognition of hypoglycemic
                  symptoms
