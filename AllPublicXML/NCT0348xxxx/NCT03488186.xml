  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open Label, parallel, single and multiple doses designed clinical
      trial. This study will determine the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynaimcs (PD) and safety
      after oral administration of an investigational Lansoprazole Capsules in healthy Chinese
      volunteers.

      This study will enroll 24 healthy adults with 12 cases in each group (male : female=1:1).
