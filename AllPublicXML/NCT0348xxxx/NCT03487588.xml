          2. Male or female between the ages of 30 and 65 years old.

          3. Subject has 3 eligible Seborrheic Keratoses; 2 target SKs must be on the face, and the
             additional 1 target SK must be on the neck or decolletage.

          4. Subjects must have had cryosurgery for SK removal within the last 3 months and prior
             to first treatment with A-101 Topical Solution.

          5. Target and non-target SKs must not have been previously treated.

          6. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical
             condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair the evaluation of any
             target or non-target SK or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study
             participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has clinically atypical and /or rapidly growing Seborrheic Keratoses.

          2. Subject has current systemic malignancy.

          3. Subject would require the use of any topical treatment (e.g., moisturizers,

             damage), or condition (e.g., sunburn, excessive hair, open wounds) that, in the
