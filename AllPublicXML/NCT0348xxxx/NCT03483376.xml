  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In today's society cosmetic dentistry plays an important role in social relationships and in
      important aspects of life such as job applications and recruitment processes.

      Currently, the only available treatment option for patients suffering from black dental
      pigmentation of bacterial origin is repetitive professional dental cleanings every two or
      three months, which involve a significant financial outlay, and have been found to be
      psychologically detrimental due to the lack of a perceived cure.

      These pigmentations are of unknown etiology, although there has been reported the presence of
      black-pigment producing bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and
      Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in such black plaque. These bacteria are found in a
      group known as periodontopathogens, bacteria responsible for the appearance of periodontitis,
      an oral chronic disease with high prevalence.

      In this context, photodynamic therapy, which uses the application of diode light with a
      wavelength between 400-500 nm for the elimination of periodontal pathogenic bacteria, has
      demonstrated effectiveness and absence of adverse effects on the management of patients with
      periodontitis.

      The proposed study seeks to evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy on teeth with
      extrinsic black pigment, in order achieve an eradication of the stains. The investigators
      will also proceed to analyze in depth the bacterial composition of these stains before the
      application of photodynamic therapy, in order to stablish the aetiological agents of this
      black plaque.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common problems facing the dentist in daily practice is the treatment of the
      chromatic alterations of the teeth, both of extrinsic origin and of intrinsic origin. The
      former, caused by the incorporation of chromogenic materials into enamel and dentin, either
      before or after the tooth eruption, require more complex and usually more aggressive
      treatments in order to eliminate them. On the other hand, the latter, caused by the
      deposition of pigments or detritus on the tooth surface, are usually removed more easily,
      causing little or no damage to the enamel.

      However, among the latter, black extrinsic dental stains caused by pigmented bacteria
      represent a clear exception to the rule. These deposits, which manifest in the form of points
      or lines of black color located parallel to the gingival margin of the teeth in the cervical
      third, are firmly attached to the enamel, making them very difficult to remove.

      Although the exact etiology of the formation of dental black stain due to pigmented bacteria
      is not clear, it has been suggested that it arises due to the production of a pigment with
      characteristics similar to protohemin and protoporphyrin by black-pigmented bacteria. The
      application of light to inactivate and disinfect intraoral sites is gaining interest in the
      field of dentistry. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy is defined as the inactivation of
      cells, microorganisms or molecules induced by light. The mechanism of action of photodynamic
      therapy is defined as the process by which a photosensitizer (photoactivable substance) is
      captured by microorganisms and, after exposure to light at an appropriate wavelength, remains
      in an excited state. The photosensitizer then transfers energy from light to oxygen molecules
      to generate singlet oxygen and free radicals that are cytotoxic to the cells.

      Published studies suggest that antimicrobial photodynamic therapy can effectively reduce the
      population of microbial pathogens, also presenting the following advantages: absence of
      phototoxic effect for human cells, possible clinical, microbiological and immunological
      benefits, rapid and painless application of light, penetration of light into tissues and
      plaque and, thereby, elimination of bacteria present in gingival epithelial cells, and
      finally, selectivity towards pathogenic microorganisms.

      The main objective of this research is the application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy
      in the control of dental black stain caused by pigmented bacteria.

    <description>Dental sensitivity and/or pain following the final treatment step for each study arm, measured by Wong-Baker faces scale. This is a graphic-numeric scale used to allow the patient to describe the sensitivity or pain they are experiencing. It consists of a row of 6 faces arrayed from left to right displaying a range of expressions denoting increased pain. This is accompanied by a numerical scale 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 where 0 is no pain (smiley face) to 10 being the worst pain imaginable (crying, extremely sad face). Below the numerical description, patients may read the descriptions of pain related to each face, ranging from 0 (No Hurt) to 10 (Hurts Worst). Higher scores (right hand side of the scale; sad crying face) indicate higher discomfort or pain, whilst lower scores (left hand side of the scale, happier face) indicate less discomfort or pain. The scale may be applied rapidly and easily facilitating the follow up of patients in a simple, reproducible manner.</description>

    <description>Study volunteers with black plaque stained teeth will receive standard dental prophylactic cleaning, followed by antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to remove the stain. The prophylaxis will be carried out using an ultrasonic scaler, prophylaxis brush and abrasive paste. The aPDT protocol is as follows:
Patient will rinse the oral cavity with 20 ml of an aqueous solution of curcumin (photosensitizer; 1.5 g/L) for 30 seconds.
Blue light from a Bluephase 20i curing lamp will be applied perpendicularly for 1 min per tooth (30 seconds on the vestibular side and 30 seconds on the palatal side).
Remaining photosensitizer will be removed using the prophylaxis brush. The aPDT protocol is repeated following a rest period of 10 days.</description>
