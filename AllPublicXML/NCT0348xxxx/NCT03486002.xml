    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of a closed suction system with an
      inflatable balloon on the catheter (Cleansweep system) to that of a standard closed suction
      system in terms of reducing the interior resistance of endotracheal tubes. Subjects who
      require frequent suctioning ( &gt; every 2.5 hours) and who have stable cardiovascular systems
      will be randomized to receive suctioning either through the Cleansweep system or standard
      system initially followed by the corresponding system. The subjects will be suctioned every
      two hours for eight hours ( the first 2 suction procedures with one system followed by 2 with
      the other system). After each suction procedure measurements of resistance will be made using
      peak and plateau pressures.

      Analysis: For each patient, data for both procedures on each catheter system will be pooled
      and mean differences between the standard system and the Cleansweep system will be
      calculated. For all 20 patients the mean (+/- SD) of these differences will be calculated and
      significance will be sought using appropriate statistical tests. The study will be unblinded
      and randomization determines merely which system will used initially for the first 2
      procedures.
