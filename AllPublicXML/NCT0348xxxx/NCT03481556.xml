  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1/2a study which will enroll patients that have relapsed or
      relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma following 1-4 lines of prior therapy. Patients will
      receive either melflufen+dexamethasone+bortezomib or melflufen+dexamethasone+daratumumab and
      are required to be PI refractory to be enrolled to the bortezomib regimen, and to not have
      any prior exposure to daratumumab or other antiCD-38 mAb to be enrolled to the daratumumab
      regimen.
