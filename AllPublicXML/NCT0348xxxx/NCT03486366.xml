  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy affects 1% of the world's population and 6 million people in Europe. The estimated
      total cost of €20 billion in Europe in 2014 makes epilepsy a significant socioeconomic
      burden. Despite great progress in the management of epilepsy and increasing numbers of
      antiepileptic drugs, 30-40% of epilepsy patients are refractory to all available medications.
      Moreover, in childhood epilepsy is a causative factor of psychiatric and behavioral
      comorbidities, including developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. In spite of
      multiple trials no reliable biomarker of epilepsy development has been identified. There are
      no studies on biomarkers of drug-resistance or epilepsy recurrence after the drug withdrawal.
      EPIMARKER is a first project, carried out in humans, which is going to examine in prospective
      way clinical, electroencephalographic and molecular biomarkers to produce an integrative tool
      useful in everyday diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy in children to prevent the development
      of drug-resistant epilepsy and its behavioral comorbidities as mental retardation and autism.
      The set of molecular biomarkers will be determined by quantitative transcriptomic and
      proteomic studies and validated in reprogrammed cellular models.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical part of EPIMARKER is composed of 2 prospective studies (WP1 and WP2) of epilepsy
      progress in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex -TSC children, performed in 2 sites: Medical
      University of Warsaw -WUM and Children's Memoroal Health Institute - IPCZD, Poland.

      WP1 and WP2 are designed to conduct the studies, but the resulting data and samples will be
      analyzed and used in Workpackage 3-12 (WP3-12).

      CLINICAL STUDY in WP1 Inclusion criteria: male or female children with a definite diagnosis
      of TSC (Roach 1998), aged up to 4 years, diagnosis of epilepsy established on the basis of
      clinical seizures or epileptiform changes on EEG within 1-7 days prior to baseline , written
      informed consent of caregivers.

      Study overview: Each subject will be followed for 12 month. Epilepsy will be tracked with
      serial video EEG (vEEG) recordings and clinical investigations performed every 3 months.
      Apart from medical history of the patients, data from seizure diary, neuroimaging studies,
      and neuropsychological examinations will be collected. Blood samples for biomarkers studies
      will be collected at study entry, at the onset of drug- resistant seizures or after 6 months,
      whichever is applicable, and at the end of follow-up in all patients participating in the
      project. The data obtained in children responding, to standard and with drug- resistant
      seizures will be compare.

      Sample size: We plan to enroll 60 TSC patients into WP1 of Epimarker in 12 months. Based upon
      our preliminary results and extensive experience with TSC, we predict that about 50% of
      patients will develop drug- resistant seizures, while 50% will respond to standard treatment
      (Jozwiak 2011) Study endpoints: the primary clinical endpoint of this study is a collection
      of a set of clinical, molecular, and EEG source data in all subjects.

      CLINICAL STUDY in WP2 Inclusion criteria: male or female children with a definite diagnosis
      of TSC (Roach criteria: Roach 1998) and epilepsy, aged up to 16 years, seizure free, in whom
      a decision to withdraw antiepileptic drugs was made, written informed consent of caregivers.

      Study overview: Each subject will be followed for 12 months. Antiepileptic drugs will be
      withdrawn within 3 months in all subjects starting, at study entry. Epilepsy will be tracked
      by means of serial video EEG recordings and clinical investigations performed every 3 months.
      Apart from medical history of the patients, data from seizures diary, neuroimaging studies
      and neuropsychological examinations will be collected. Patients with recurrent seizures will
      receive antiepileptic treatment according to current standards. Blood samples for biomarkers
      study will be collected at study entry, at the end of drugs withdrawal, at the onset
      recurrent seizures and at the end of follow-up in all patient participating in the project.
      The data obtained in children seizure free at the end of follow-up and patients with
      recurrent seizures will be compare.

      Sample size: We plan to enroll 60 TSC patients into WP2 of Epimarker in 12 months. Based upon
      our preliminary results and extensive experience with TSC, we predict that about 50% of
      patients will develop recurrent seizures, while 50% remain seizure free (unpublished data).

      Study endpoints: the primary clinical endpoint of this study is a collection of a set of
      clinical, molecular, and EEG source data in all subjects.

    <intervention_model_description>With EPIMARKER we aim to develop clinically useful tools enabling accurate and early detection of risk of drug resistant or recurrent seizures and stablish the new therapeutic and preventative possibilities for epilepsy.
The Epimarker algorithms will include selected data obtained in 3 unique models of epilepsy in developing brain.
EEG recordings and clinical data from a prospective study of drug-resistant epilepsy development in young children with TSC,
EEG recording and clinical data from a prospective study of epilepsy after antiepileptic drug withdrawal in children with TSC
Molecular biomarkers in both above clinical setting, established by means of a broad range of molecular analyses, including a diverse set of cutting edge analyses of blood samples, that will be obtained at study entry, at the onset of drug- resistance or recurrent epilepsy, and after 12-month follow-up and the verified in a Epimarker cellular model.</intervention_model_description>
