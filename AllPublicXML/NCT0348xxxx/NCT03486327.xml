  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, single center, open label, parallel-dose, and prospective study of
      BR55 CEUS for characterization of solid pancreatic lesions in subjects with suspected PDAC
      using transabdominal US.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately twenty-four (24) subjects with suspected PDAC and scheduled to undergo surgical
      resection within 30 days (but not before 24 hours) after the transabdominal BR55 CEUS
      examination will be enrolled into 3 dose groups, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08 mL/kg, with a maximum
      of 8 patients in each dose group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Enroll a subject in this study if the subject meets the following inclusion criteria:

          -  Is at least 18 years of age;

          -  Has at least one solid pancreatic lesion;

          -  Is scheduled to undergo surgical resection for suspected PDAC not earlier than 24
             hours and not later than 30 days following BR55 administration;

          -  Provides written Informed Consent and is willing to comply with protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclude a subject from this study if the subject does not fulfill the inclusion criteria,
        or if any of the following conditions are observed:

          -  Is a pregnant or lactating female. Exclude the possibility of pregnancy:

               -  by testing on site at the institution (serum Î²HCG) within 24 hours prior to the
                  start of IP administration,

               -  by surgical history (e.g., tubal ligation or hysterectomy),

               -  by post-menopausal status with a minimum 1 year without menses;

          -  Has undergone prior systemic therapy for pancreatic cancer;

          -  Has history of any concurrent malignancy;

          -  Has history of any clinically unstable cardiac condition including class III/IV
             congestive heart failure;

          -  Has had any severe cardiac rhythm disorders within 7 days prior to enrolment;

          -  Has severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 90mmHg) or uncontrolled
             systemic hypertension and/or respiratory distress syndrome;

          -  Has open and/or non-healing wounds in the chest, abdomen and pelvis;

          -  Has other systemic vascular abnormalities associated with neovascularization, such as
             macular degeneration, that in the opinion of the investigator could significantly
             affect the ability to evaluate the effects of BR55;

          -  Is participating in a clinical trial or has participated in another trial with an
             investigational compound within the past 30 days prior to enrolment;

          -  Has previously been enrolled in and completed this study;

          -  Has any known allergy to one or more of the ingredients of the IP or to any other
             contrast media;

          -  Is determined by the Investigator that the subject is clinically unsuitable for the
             study;

          -  Has had major surgery, including laparoscopic surgery within 3 months prior to
             enrolment;

          -  Has history of pancreatic surgery (e.g., cyst removal);

          -  Has acute pancreatic abnormalities (acute pancreatitis or trauma).
