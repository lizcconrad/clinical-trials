  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma or Biliary Tract Cancer.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Durvalumab

        -  Tremelimumab

        -  Radiation Therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The FDA has not approved tremelimumab as a treatment for any disease.

      Both durvalumab and tremelimumab are antibodies (proteins that work with the immune system)
      that target proteins produced by the cancer cells. These cancerous proteins suppress the
      immune system which allows the cancer cells to grow. The study drugs may target these
      cancerous proteins and stop the cancer cells from suppressing the immune system.

      The investigators hope that the combination of these study drugs with radiation therapy will
      help stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading.

    <time_frame>Start of cycle 3, start of cycle 5, and then the start of every subsequent cycle for the remainder of treatment. One cycle is 4 weeks. (approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants that achieve either a complete response or partial response. Response rate (ORR) is assessed using irRECIST (Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors). Response is evaluated with the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants are evaluated for response for the duration of treatment.Treatment continues until disease progression, treatment is considered a safety risk, physicians decision, withdrawal from the study, or until the participant is lost to follow up. The best overall response recorded for each participant is reported.
Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm (the sum may not be &quot;0&quot; if there are target nodes)
Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters</description>

Participants are evaluated for response for the duration of treatment. Treatment continues until disease progression, treatment is considered a safety risk, physicians decision, withdrawal from the study, or until the participant is lost to follow up.
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm (the sum may not be &quot;0&quot; if there are target nodes)
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters

â€¢ Prior Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
