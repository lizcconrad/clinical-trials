  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent brain tumor. Currently survival is poor and few
      treatments are available. Recent data show that there is no immune privilege of the central
      nervous system (CNS) and that GBM are invaded by effector CD8 T cells, letting us hypothesis
      that GBM growth is dependent of immunosurveillance.

      The aim of this study is to better understand the antitumor immune response against GBM to
      unravel new effectors and immunosuppressive pathways important for the regulation of
      anticancer immunity and to discover new immune activating strategies with the objectives to
      isolate subgroups of GBMs that could benefit from an immunotherapy approach. To achieve this
      goal, GBM tumor samples and a blood sample will be collected during the initial tumor
      resection.

      The sites involved in the recruitment of the patients will be the neurosurgical teams in
      Brussel, Dijon, Nantes and Padova.

      Primary objective :

      The primary objective is to determine for each of the 3 molecular subtypes of glioblastoma
      the predictive performance on 1-year overall survival of in situ immune parameters

      Secondary objectives :

      To identify the best combination of in vivo immune parameters that is predictive of 1-year
      overall survival To determine the impact of immune parameters on overall survival

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with newly diagnosed, brain tumor

          2. Gross or near total resection of the contrast-enhancing tumor mass decides by the
             neurosurgeron.

          3. Subjects ≥18 and ≤75 years of age at surgery

          4. Patients must be able to understand and sign the informed consent documents indicating
             that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.

          5. Confirmation of the diagnosis of grade IV GBM by the local pathologist with an
             independent neuropathologist who will review this diagnosis

          6. Primary therapy must consist of surgical resection with the intent for a gross or near
             total resection of the contrast-enhancing tumor mass, followed by conventional
             external beam radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy.

          7. Tumor biopsy for biological analysis has to be performed before using ultrasonic
             surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with other type of primary brain tumor or metastases

          2. Patients with only biopsy performed for the diagnosis

          3. Subjects under guardianship, curatorship or judicial protection

          4. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding
