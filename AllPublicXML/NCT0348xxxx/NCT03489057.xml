  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of a couple-focused, web-based
      tailored prostate cancer symptom management program, Prostate Cancer Education and Resources
      for Couples (PERC) in a randomized clinical trial. A two-group (PERC versus National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) website plus treatment as usual) randomized controlled design will be used,
      and data will be collected at baseline (T1), 4 (T2), 8 (T3), and 12 months (T4) among 250
      patients completing initial treatment for localized prostate cancer and their intimate
      partners.

    <measure>Change in quality of life over time as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment (FACT-G) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, month 12</time_frame>

Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value. Functional assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) is a 27 item survey which assesses physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well being on a 5 point likert scale, with 0 indicating &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 indicating &quot;very much&quot; in response to item questions.
