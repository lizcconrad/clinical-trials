    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent

          -  Diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory
             Society guidelines characterized by progressive airflow limitation associated with
             abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases primarily
             caused by cigarette smoking.

          -  Have an established COPD clinical history, symptomatic with dyspnea, chronic cough,
             chronic sputum production or wheezing. At Visit 1, FEV1/FVC ratio must be less than
             0.70 or at least 10% less than the FEV1/FVC ratio determined by the predicted normal
             value. FEV1 must be less than 70% of the predicted normal value and greater than 25%
             of the predicted normal value.

          -  Must be using one or more inhaled bronchodilators for treatment of COPD at the time of
             Visit 1.

          -  Current or former smokers, with a history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking. Number of pack-years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) X (number of years
             smoked).

          -  Willing, and in the opinion of the investigator, able to adjust current COPD therapy
             as required by the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of other respiratory disorder(s) including, but not limited to:
             alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency; lung cancer; cystic fibrosis; tuberculosis;
             sarcoidosis; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; primary pulmonary hypertension; or
             pulmonary thromboembolic disease. Patients with concomitant COPD and asthma will be
             allowed to participate.

          -  Diagnosis of non-respiratory disorder(s) that are currently affecting lung function,
             as determined by he principal investigator including, but not limited to: congestive
             heart failure; symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia; symptomatic seizure disorder; dementia;
             lupus; rheumatoid arthritis; or liver cirrhosis.

          -  Unable to abstain from protocol defined prohibited medications during the screening
             and testing period.

          -  Unable to withhold short acting bronchodilators for 6 hours prior to spirometry
             testing at the study visit.

          -  Unable to perform acceptable or repeatable spirometry or comply with other study
             procedures.

          -  Known allergic reaction to albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide.

          -  Diagnosis of cancer that is not presumed to be in remission or cured.

          -  Active alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnancy confirmed by a positive hCG test.

          -  Treatment with another investigational study drug in another clinical study within the
             last 30 days or five half-lives, whichever is longer.
