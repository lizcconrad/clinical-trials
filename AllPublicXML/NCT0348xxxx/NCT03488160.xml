  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and feasibility of CAR-T cells (CD19.CAR-T) targeted at CD19 in the treatment of
      relapsed / refractory CD19 positive lymphoma were determined, and the proliferation and
      survival time of CD19.CAR-T cells in patients were determined.

    <textblock>
      The sponsors of this research also studied CD19.CAR-T cells for the treatment of leukemia and
      lymphoma, two courses of three transfusion 14 days after infection process standard training
      program , the safety and effectiveness have accumulated some of the data. In this study, the
      investigators will regenerate the cultured cells for 2 times in a course of treatment, and
      enter the patient's body . The investigators observed the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell
      therapy.
