      The study is to assess skin attributes of female subjects following 16 weeks of dietary
      supplement consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16 week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Approximately 105
      Caucasian and Asian (Korean, Japanese, or Chinese) female subjects will be enrolled. The
      following clinical assessments will be performed: (1)VISIA-CR™ digital photography; (2)AGE
      Reader SU measurements on the left cheek and left inner forearm; (3) Visual Analog Grading
      (VAS); (4) Corneometer measurements; and (5) Cutometer measurements. Subjects will return to
      the clinic at approximately 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 16 weeks from the baseline visit for similar
      measurements. A self-perception questionnaire will be administered at the conclusion of the
      study.
