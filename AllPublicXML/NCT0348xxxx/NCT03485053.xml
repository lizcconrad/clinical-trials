      The Phase II study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose of i.v. IOP Injection in Part 1
      and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the maximally tolerated dose of IOP Injection with
      different infusions schemes in Part 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject ≥ 18 years.

          2. Subject with IDA but not secondary to any malignancy or renal failure requiring
             dialysis.

          3. Hb levels &lt;11.0 g/dL, Ferritin levels &lt;100 ng/dL, Transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt; 20%
             at the Screening Visit.

          4. Subject must have the ability to provide written, personally signed, and dated
             informed consent to participate in the study.

          5. Subject must have an understanding, ability, and willingness to comply fully with
             study procedures and restrictions and to be available for clinic visits and follow-up
             procedures.

          6. Female subject of child-bearing potential who is sexually active must use an effective
             method of birth control for at least one month prior to screening and agree to use an
             effective method of birth control until completion of participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with known hemochromatosis, thalassemia, hemolytic anemia, receive red blood
             cell or whole blood transfusions within 90 days prior to enrollment.

          2. Subject with a history of intravascular hemolysis.

          3. Subject receiving any erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy within 4 weeks
