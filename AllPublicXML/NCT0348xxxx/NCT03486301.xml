      Phase 1 Open-Label Dose Escalation Study of BDB001 as a Single Agent and in combination with
      Pembrolizumab in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a study of an experimental drug called BDB001. BDB001 is a Toll-like
      receptor (TLR) agonist that activates the immune system.

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BDB001 as
      a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab and to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) when given in combination with
      pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1 study of BDB001 as
      a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with
      histologically-confirmed, incurable, unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have
      relapsed or are refractory to standard therapies or for whom there is no approved therapy.

      The study will be conducted in two separate but independent dose escalation arms: a single
      agent arm (BDB001 alone) and a combination arm (BDB001 in combination with pembrolizumab).

      Participants will be allowed to continue treatment beyond study termination until occurrence
      of significant treatment-related toxicity, progressive disease or discontinuation criteria
      are met.

    <description>A single subject will be enrolled at each dose level in the single agent arm until any ≥ Grade 2 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is observed in the first cycle. Then dose escalation will follow a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design. Each successive group of patients will be enrolled at an incrementally higher dosage until the Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of single agent BDB001 is reached.</description>

When the MTD or RP2D of single agent BDB001 is reached, the first dose level cohort of the combination arm will begin. Once the MTD or RP2D in combination has been determined, twenty additional subjects will be enrolled in the expansion phase of the study.</description>
