      -  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the accumulation of fat (&gt;5%) in liver
           cells in the absence of excessive alcohol intake or other causes of liver disease. The
           histologic spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic
           steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. This disease affects up to 30% of
           the general population in Western countries, especially in patients with metabolic
           syndrome, obesity, and type II diabetes.

        -  Accumulating epidemiologic evidence indicates that NAFLD not only affects the liver but
           also increases the risk of extra-hepatic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus,
           metabolic syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, and
           chronic kidney disease.

        -  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by decreased estimated glomerular filtration
           rate (eGFR) and/or the presence of significant proteinuria. Its prevalence is ~ 4.3 -
           13% in general population, but it is expected to increase and ~ 50% of these patients
           develop end-stage renal disease. Recently, CKD is significantly higher in patients with
           NAFLD than patients without.

        -  Several studies have demonstrated that NAFLD independently contributes to increasing the
           risk of CKD where NAFLD and CKD may share many common cardio-metabolic risk factors e.g.
           insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and obesity.

        -  The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms linking NAFLD to CKD are not completely
           understood, however, there is increased production of various proinflammatory cytokines,
           reactive oxygen species, TNF-α, C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 by hepatocytes and
           non-parenchymal cells (Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells) that can link NAFLD and
           CKD. In addition, altered rennin-angiotensin system activation can be involved.

        -  Several western studies had evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and CKD and shown
           the prevalence of CKD in NAFLD patients between 4 - 40%.

        -  An analysis of the United Network Organ Sharing (UNOS) data base during the years
           (2002-2011) revealed that 35% of the patients transplanted for NAFLD-related cirrhosis
           progressed to stage 3-4 CKD within 2 years after liver transplantation in comparison to
           10% of patients transplanted for other etiologies.

        -  Despite these findings CKDs often goes unrecognized and The Third National Health and
           Nutrition survey (NHANESIII), among all individuals with moderately decreased GFR (less
           than 60ml/min; stage 3) reported the awareness was approximately 8%.

        -  There is still very little prospective studies and data linking NAFLD to CKD, and it is
           lacking in the middle east region.

    <description>The Fibroscan device (Echosens) works by measuring shear wave velocity. In this technique, a 50-MHz wave is passed into the liver from a small transducer on the end of an ultrasound probe. The probe also has a transducer on the end that can measure the velocity of the shear wave (in meters per second) as this wave passes through the liver. The shear wave velocity can then be converted into liver stiffness, which is expressed in kilopascals. Essentially, the technology measures the velocity of the sound wave passing through the liver and then converts that measurement into a liver stiffness measurement; the entire process is often referred to as liver ultrasonographic elastography.</description>
