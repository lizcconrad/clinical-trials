      Introduction: Pterygium is a wing shape degenerative and hyperplastic growth of the bulbar
      conjunctiva extending onto the cornea, most commonly on the nasal side. Management of
      pterygium can be medical, surgical or combined. Alternative treatments as photocoagulation of
      blood vessels of the pterygium, have been described, especially in recurrent pterygia.

      Objectives: To determine whether Argon laser treatment reduces the symptoms and pterygium
      size in primary type I pterygia patients when compared with medical treatment. Subjects and
      Methods: Prospective, comparative and interventional study. Patients with type I pterygia in
      both eyes were included. The eyes were randomly divided to receive either Argon laser
      treatment or only topical medical treatment

    <description>Measurements were performed according to Welch et al. modified technique as following: the distance in millimeters from the limbus to the apex of the lesion on the cornea (horizontal length) was performed using the slit-lamp beam (BQ 900, Haag-Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland). A standard magnification of 16 was used and the variable aperture was focused from the limbus to the apex.</description>
