  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
      (PE), is a common post-operative complication. The necessity for anticoagulant therapy after
      orthopedic surgeries is widely understood, but treatment administration patterns in the
      prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after orthopedic surgeries during the hospital
      stay have yet to be examined.

      The main objective of this study is to perform a comparative effectiveness review examining
      the benefits and harms associated with venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients
      undergoing orthopedic surgeries.

      It is around efficacy and safety evaluation of using anticoagulant for thromboprophylaxis in
      patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries taking into the account the reliable selection of
      patients most benefit.

      The aims of this study is to analyze patient records in teaching hospitals database of our
      country (including: Hanoi Medical University, Bach Mai Hospital, Cho Ray Hospital, Viet Duc
      University Hospital) and compare the outcomes and costs between different types of
      anticoagulant medications that were prescribed for the prevention of VTE following orthopedic
      surgeries. This analysis will assess and quantify the outcomes, resource utilization, and
      cost of care for patients receiving rivaroxaban or enoxaparin. The outcomes of interest
      include the occurence of DVT and PE, rates of major bleeds, medical resource utilization, and
      total costs (medical plus pharmacy).

    <description>The frequency of Deep-vein thrombosis
Symptoms and signs of DVT may include unilateral leg swelling, pain in the affected leg, calf tenderness in affected leg, increased leg warmth, erythema of affected leg, or a &quot;palpable cord&quot; may be felt in the affected leg.</description>

    <description>Frequency of pulmonary embolism (non-fatal)
Regarding Pulmonary Embolism (PE), diagnosis is suspected in patients with dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, and/or fever. Diagnosis begins with initial risk stratification &quot;Wells Clinical Model for Evaluating the Pretest Probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) &quot; based on presence of shock or persistent hypotension to identify patients at high risk of early mortality.</description>

    <description>The incidence of major bleeding beginning after the first dose of the study drug and up to 2 days after the last dose of the study drug (on-treatment period). Major bleeding is defined as bleeding that is fatal, occurs in a critical organ (e.g., retroperitoneal, intracranial, intraocular, and intraspinal bleeding), or requires reoperation or extra surgical-site bleeding that was clinically overt and is associated with a fall in the hemoglobin level of at least 2 g per deciliter or that requires transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or packed cells.</description>
