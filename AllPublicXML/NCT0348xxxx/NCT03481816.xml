  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) keeps growing even when the amount of
      testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels. mCRPC is incurable. Researchers want
      to develop vaccines to teach the immune system to target and kill cancer cells. They want to
      test three of these vaccines (ETBX-071, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051) against mCRPC.

      Objective:

      To test the safety of combination ETBX-071, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051 and to study their effects
      on the immune system.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with mCRPC that has not responded to standard therapies

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      CT or MRI scans

      Bone scan

      Participants will get the vaccines as shots under the skin every 3 weeks for 3 doses. They
      may then have the shots every 8 weeks for up to 1 year.

      Participants will keep a diary to record any symptoms from the vaccines.

      Participants will have blood tests each time they get the vaccines. They will also have scans
      and other tests to measure the effect the vaccines have on their tumors.

      Participants will have a visit within 28 days after their last treatment. This includes a
      physical exam and blood and urine tests.

      Participants will then be contacted by phone every 3 months for the first year, every 6
      months for the next 2 years, and every 12 months for another 2 years.

      Participants will be asked to join a long-term follow up study.

      Background:

        -  The overall goal of the current project is to expand our immunotherapeutic approach for
           the treatment of prostate cancer employing a multi-targeted approach.

        -  Therapeutic cancer vaccines targeting overexpressed proteins offer a potential method to
           activate T cells against tumors.

        -  A novel adenovirus based vaccines targeting three (3) human tumor associated antigens
           (TAA), PSA, MUC1, and brachyury, respectively have demonstrated anti-tumor cytolytic T
           cell responses in pre-clinical animal models of cancer.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the overall safety and recommended phase 2 dose of a combination of three
      immunotherapeutic vaccines (ETBX-071, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051) when administered
      subcutaneously (SC) to subjects with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects age 18 and older with cytologically or histologically confirmed prostate cancer
           for which no curative standard approved therapy is available.

        -  Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) patients with rising PSA or
           progressive disease despite castration levels of testosterone.

        -  Chemotherapy na(SqrRoot) ve (prior docetaxel chemotherapy (as per CHAARTED data) for
           castration sensitive disease is allowed.)

        -  Prior treatment with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide is allowed

        -  ECOG performance status &lt; 1

        -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function

        -  Subjects with a history of autoimmune disease (active or past) and subjects requiring
           systemic steroids are not eligible (physiologic doses of steroids for steroid
           replacement as well as nasal, topical and inhaled steroids are allowed).
           Autoimmune-related thyroid disease, type I diabetes and vitiligo are permitted if the
           condition is well controlled.

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase I trial in subjects with mCRPC. A combination of three therapeutic
           vaccines (ETBX-071, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051) which use the same modified Adenovirus
           vector backbone, separately encoding three well studied TAA,PSA, MUC1, and brachyury,
           respectively) will be assessed. The vaccines will be tested at standard dose levels,
           with a dose de-escalation (if required) design employed. The dose level of each vaccine
           tested will be 5x10 to the eleventh power VP. This dose has been found in a prior phase
           1 testing of a similar vaccine Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-CEA(6D) (ETBX-011) to be well tolerated
           (with no DLT s or related SAE s), and be optimal for induction of immune responses.

        -  Up to six patients will be enrolled at dose level 1. If less than or equal to 1 of 6
           patients experience a DLT, an initiation of the dose expansion phase will occur. If more
           than or equal to 2 of 6 experience DLT at dose level 1, then dose de-escalation will
           occur. Up to six patients will be enrolled at the lower dose level (-1) (1x10 to the
           eleventh power VP). If less than or equal to 1 of 6 patients experience a DLT, then the
           maximum tolerated (MTD) will be declared at this dose, and initiation of the dose
           expansion phase will occur. If more than or equal to 2 of 6 experience DLT at dose level
           -1, then a further dose de-escalation will occur. Up to six patients will be enrolled at
           the lower dose level (-2) (5x10 to the tenth power VP). If less than or equal to 1 of 6
           patients experience a DLT, then the maximum tolerated (MTD) will be declared at this
           dose, and initiation of the dose expansion phase will occur. If more than or equal to 2
           of 6 experience DLT at dose level -2, then the study will be stopped.

        -  A dose expansion phase of study will be enrolled after the MTD of the vaccines have been
           determined. An additional 12 subjects will be enrolled in the dose expansion component
           of the trial, for a total of 18 subjects at the MTD.

        -  The ETBX-051, ETBX-61 and ETBX-71 vaccines will be administered subcutaneously (SC) at
           separate injection sites (proximal limb, preferably the thigh), will be administered SC
           every 3 weeks for 3 doses (dose de-escalation cohorts) followed by boosts every 8 weeks
           for 1 year (only patients enrolled in dose expansion cohort).
