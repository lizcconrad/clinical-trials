  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilonidal Disease is disease of young patients with significant morbidity and is difficult to
      treat. Currently multiple methods are practiced for the treatment of the disease, two of them
      are preferred over others and practice extensively. First one involves excision of pilonidal
      sinus and dressings while the second one is excision of the pilonidal sinus with application
      of negative pressure wound therapy. None of these approaches is considered superior to the
      other, as not enough comparison studies of the two procedures have been done. In order to
      clarify this and find the best option for our patients, investigators are taking opportunity
      to compare these two modalities. If participants choose to participate in this study they
      will be randomly selected to one of these groups and the progress of wound healing will be
      monitored after surgery with the measurement of wound weekly and photographs. Investigators
      are hoping to find out which procedure is superior. This will allow investigators to provide
      the best treatment option for their patients in future.
