  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of breastfeeding-related pain is common for postpartum women, but is not often
      anticipated as part of the postpartum experience. This feasibility randomized controlled
      trial aims to examine the effectiveness of a nurse-led educational intervention using
      anticipatory guidance among pregnant women wishing to breastfeed on breastfeeding outcomes,
      breastfeeding-related pain, and maternal satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the relative ubiquity of breastfeeding-related pain, exploratory studies suggest
      women are largely unprepared for breastfeeding-related pain in the early postpartum period
      [1-3]. In turn, postpartum women often experience an incongruence between how breastfeeding
      is idealized by Western society, and the reality of their early breastfeeding experiences.
      Furthermore, painful breastfeeding experiences serve to intensify this incongruity and may
      lead to disillusionment, feelings of negative self-worth and premature breastfeeding
      cessation [1,3]. As such, the overarching goals of this one-year project are to compare usual
      prenatal education to anticipatory guidance to: 1) examine the effectiveness of a
      breastfeeding education session using anticipatory guidance on breastfeeding outcomes and
      satisfaction during the postpartum period; and 2) test the feasibility of the methods and
      procedures needed for the successful implementation and validity of a full-scale randomized
      controlled trial (RCT). This one-year project has 5 objectives:

      To fill a knowledge gap in nursing and allied health-related literature by examining the
      effect of a one-hour, nurse-led, breastfeeding education session using anticipatory guidance
      during pregnancy on: Objective 1: breastfeeding duration and exclusivity versus those
      receiving usual prenatal education; Objective 2: overall satisfaction with the educational
      experience versus those receiving usual prenatal education; Objective 3: breastfeeding
      self-efficacy and infant feeding attitudes; Objective 4: postpartum breastfeeding-related
      pain and; Objective 5: To determine if this intervention study protocol is practical (e.g.,
      accrual rates, satisfaction, compliance, sample size) and to test the process, resources,
      management and scientific basis [4] for a future, full-scale RCT.

      Forty pregnant women enrolled in prenatal classes provided by the Middlesex London Health
      Unit (MLHU) and who are intending to breastfeed will be enrolled in this feasibility
      randomized controlled trial.

      Following ethics approval, interested pregnant women who have enrolled in/awaiting antenatal
      classes at the MLHU will contact the RA to discuss the study. Interested women will be
      screened for eligibility, and if eligible and consenting, baseline data will be collected.
      Participants will then be randomized to either intervention (n=20) or control group (n=20).
      Randomization will be achieved by using sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes
      containing randomly generated numbers, prepared by an RA external to the study. An RA will
      open the next sequentially numbered envelope and reveal the group allocation to the
      participant. The control group will receive usual antenatal education provided to all women
      who enroll in MLHU prenatal classes. The intervention group will receive an additional
      one-hour 'booster session' (by a perinatal RN) of antenatal education specifically focused on
      the postpartum experience of breastfeeding, including anticipatory guidance around
      breastfeeding-related pain, and management strategies. To control for contamination, women
      who have peers/family already in the study will be excluded. An emailed link to a follow-up
      questionnaire will be sent at 2 and 4 weeks postpartum to determine if they are breastfeeding
      or not, breastfeeding exclusivity, level of breastfeeding-related pain, breastfeeding
      self-efficacy, maternal attitudes toward infant feeding, and maternal satisfaction with
      antenatal education.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breastfeeding duration</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Breastfeeding duration will be measured by asking women if they have breastfed in the past 24 hours or not. If a participant has stopped breastfeeding, they will be asked for the last date they breastfed their infant to determine the number of days (duration) of breastfeeding.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breastfeeding exclusivity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Breastfeeding exclusivity is defined as the receipt of breast milk only with no additional food or liquid, including water. Breastfeeding exclusivity will be categorized according to the World Health Organization Infant and Young Child Feeding guidelines (2009) with the following categories: exclusive breastfeeding, predominant, complimentary feeding, breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. Among the extant breastfeeding literature, this is the most commonly utilized means to measure breastfeeding exclusivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity will be measured using an 11-point numeric rating scale, where zero represents no pain, and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>maternal satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Women's self-report of satisfaction with the education they received will be measured by asking women: &quot;were you satisfied receiving additional breastfeeding education&quot;, &quot;how effective was the breastfeeding education session in helping you to breastfeed your baby&quot;, &quot;how effective was the additional breastfeeding education session in helping you to anticipate the possibility of breastfeeding pain&quot;. Responses will include descriptions on a 5 point Likert scale. For example, &quot;1&quot; for &quot;very satisfied&quot;, and &quot;5 for &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;. There are no reliable, validated measurement tools measuring maternal satisfaction in this context.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>breastfeeding self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy will be measured using the Breastfeeding self-efficacy scale short form (Dennis, 2003. The breastfeeding self-efficacy scale: psychometric assessment of the short form. J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs, 32(6), 734-44)</description>

    <description>Both the experimental and control groups will receive usual prenatal education offered through our regional public health program. In addition to usual prenatal education, the experimental group will also receive a one-hour, nurse led (a Registered Nurse specially trained in perinatal care), small group-based education session with specific focus on breastfeeding pain. The goals of this educational intervention are to provide pregnant women with anticipatory guidance around pain which is commonly experienced while breastfeeding in the first two weeks postpartum. Education will include the prevalence, etiology and management of various types of breastfeeding-related pain experienced postpartum.</description>

    <description>Women allocated to the usual prenatal education group will receive prenatal classes through their local public health unit. Women enrolled in classes will receive approximately 12 hours of combined in-class and online prenatal content. Topics include: discomforts of pregnancy, labor and birth, medical interventions, adjustment to parenting, breastfeeding, and caring for the newborn. Breastfeeding-related material includes basic mechanisms of milk production, benefits of breastfeeding, benefits of skin-to-skin, correct breastfeeding latch, breastfeeding positions, timing of feeds, responding to infant cues, and caring for nipples. Women in the usual prenatal education group will not receive education on the prevalence and etiology of nipple pain, nor specific pain management strategies.</description>
