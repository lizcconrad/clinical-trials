  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is being investigated if the association between high frequency repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation associated with motor physical therapy reduces spasticity,
      increases upper limb motor function, and quality of life of post-chronic stroke patients than
      motor physical therapy alone. For this purpose, patients included will be submitted to ten
      sessions with active or sham hf-rTMS followed by a protocol of physical therapy.

    <time_frame>before and after 10 daily sessions and after 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Motor Activity Log 30 (MAL-30) is a standardized instrument that was developed specifically to evaluate the function and use of the upper limb most affected post-stroke in the real-life environment (uncontrolled) through two scales: qualitative and quantitative. The total score is obtained by calculating the mean for each of the scales. The higher the mean obtained in the scales, the better the quality and quantity of use of the upper limb more affected in the accomplishment of the daily activities of life.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>High frequency TMS will be applied with an eight shaped coil angled at 45 degrees from the sagittal axis and positioned at the C3 or C4 in accordance with the international 10-20 marking system (JASPER, 1958), which corresponds to the right or left primary motor cortex (M1) injured. Forty stimulus trains will be provide at 10Hz over the injured hemisphere, at 10 Hz for five seconds each. The interval between the trains will be 25 seconds, totaling 2000 pulses for approximately 20 minutes, with 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT). After TMS, patients will be submitted to 50 minutes of physical therapy protocol.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Control: Sham hf rTMS and Physical theraphy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this group, the volunteer will start with sham TMS, will be the same parameters was used in experimental group, however, it will be performed using two coils, one connected to the magnetic stimulator, away from the patient's scalp and another uncoupled from the stimulator and positioned in the same way as in real stimulation. After, the volunteer will be submitted to 50 minutes of physical therapy protocol.</description>

    <intervention_name>TMS</intervention_name>
    <description>Repetitive TMS involves application of electric currents in the patient's cortex by a magnetic field applied to the scalp of the patient through an eight-coil connected to a magnetic stimulator (MagStim RapidÂ² magnetic stimulator-UK). In a small percentage of patients, it may cause some discomfort with a mild headache sensation or nausea. Depending on the parameters, rTMS can increase or decrease corticomotor excitability and by the connection of the motor cortex with the thalamus, influencing spasticity inhibition. The patients will respond to an adverse effects questionnaire and will report the perception of real or sham stimulation.</description>
