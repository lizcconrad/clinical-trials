  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the health benefits of a recently developed
      multimineral/multivitamin/phytochemical (MVM/phytochemical) nutritional supplement. This
      newly developed supplement - an advancement of a previous formula designed to enhance human
      health by providing RDA-levels of essential vitamins and minerals - contains eight
      phytochemicals selected to address fruit and vegetable undernutrition, and chosen on the
      basis that: 1) published research from cell culture, animal model and, when available, human
      clinical work, suggests that it may benefit human health, and 2) it is considered safe for
      human ingestion at proposed levels of consumption.

      This study will be an eight-week, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel arm clinical trial
      to compare markers of nutritional, inflammatory and oxidative status, cardiovascular and
      neurological health as well as microbial status in subjects consuming a novel
      multivitamin/multimineral/phytochemical (MVM/phytochemical) supplement compared to subjects
      consuming a placebo tablet. In addition, this study will evaluate whether the
      MVM/phytochemical supplement improves subjects sense of well-being as evaluated by a
      quality-of-life survey. The study will aim to enroll 112 consenting men and women
      characterized as having metabolic syndrome. Potential subjects will be recruited through
      flyers, newspapers and advertisements placed throughout the community. Consented subjects
      will undergo a 28-day washout, followed by a 56-day trial period. Biological samples (blood,
      urine, stool, saliva) will be collected at baseline (day 0) and at day 56. Diet and exercise
      history, as well as a quality of life survey, will be collected at these time points as well.
      Risk to participants is expected to be minimal and will be outlined through an informed
      consent.
