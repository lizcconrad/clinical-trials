  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Neuronal plasticity is the brain's ability to continuously adapt to experiences
      and learning of new skills. Although this affects multiple characteristics of the brain such
      as structure, function and metabolism, direct interactions between these aspects are largely
      missing.

      Aim: Using recent advancements in neuroimaging we aim to identify novel relationships how
      neuronal plasticity is related across these characteristics.

      Design: 40 healthy subjects will undergo two simultaneous PET/MR measurements at baseline and
      after 4 weeks. During the measurements a cognitively challenging task will be performed and
      the training group (20 subjects) will practice during the 4-week period.

      Implications: We combine simultaneous PET/MR and novel task-specific PET imaging to study
      brain metabolism, structure and function in a single measurement session. This provides
      optimal sensitivity for assessment of multimodal neuroplasticity associations. Knowledge how
      cognitive training affects multiple characteristics of the brain will also increase our
      understanding of disorders like depression, dementia and brain injuries, since these are
      diagnosed with cognitive evaluations. Considering the vast usage of the applied imaging
      procedures in diagnosis and therapy monitoring, the thorough investigation of multimodal
      associations offers benefit for the interpretability of neuroimaging in clinical routine.

      Methodological details: Each subject will undergo two PET/MR examinations. Imaging will
      include PET as well as acquisition of structural and functional MRI. Task-specific glucose
      metabolism will be quantified with the radioligand [18F]FDG. Gray matter volume and white
      matter microstructure will be assessed with T1-weighted and diffusion weighted MRI,
      respectively. Functional imaging will focus on functional connectivity during rest and task
      as well as cerebral blood flow as acquired with ASL.
