  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50,000 patients in France benefit from bariatric surgery every year. However,
      nutritional complications (protein malnutrition, hypoglycaemia) are common and primary or
      secondary weight failures (weight recovery) account for almost 20% of operated. Weight loss
      and the metabolic effects of surgery are not related only to a reduction in dietary intakes,
      but also to mechanisms independent of caloric reduction, such as eating behaviour after
      bariatric surgery (Gastric Bypass or sleeve gastrectomy). These choices are guided by
      perceived changes in the properties of the food, resulting in changes in tastes, palatability
      and more generally food preferences. Among available tools to evaluate dietary preferences we
      selected the Food Leeds Preference Questionnaire (FLPQ) to assess those modifications. During
      this test, photographs of food products classified according to predetermined characteristics
      are presented with different instructions and response design to estimate liking, wanted for
      food, implicitly or explicitly. Our main hypothesis is that the use of the Food Leeds
      Preference Questionnaire will highlight differences in dietary preferences according to the
      type of bariatric surgery performed.

      We will be conducted a study observational study on three parallel groups: a control group
      composed of patients suffering from unoperated obesity, a group of patients operated for a
      sleeve gastrectomy and a group of patients operated for a gastric bypass. We will include 45
      patients per group. The patients will have to pass the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire
      (LFPQ). Our judgment criterion will be the degree of food preference assessed using the LFPQ.
      Participants will also be assessed on behavioural parameters with the Binge Eating Scale, the
      Yale Food Addiction Scale Version 2.0 and the Urgency, lack of Premeditation, lack of
      Perseverance and Sensation seeking Impulsive behavior scale (UPPS-P) short version.

    <description>The study will take place in two phases. A first phase will consist in the validation of translations and the selection of images on 20 healthy volunteers and 20 health professionals specialized in nutrition. They will have to fill a form with images of food and evaluate to what extend they think the pictures represent what we can eat in France. This step will adapt the questionnaire to our country.</description>

    <description>Phase performed with patients fasting for at least 2 hours before the different tests. The FLPQ will be compared between a group of patients suffering from unoperated obesity (OCt), a group of patients operated on a sleeve gastrectomy (OSl) and a group operated by a bypass (OBy) between 6 and 24 months post-surgery, randomized for the 6 combined tests (2 categories). The award can be made in 2 sessions of at least 3 of the 6 tests combined. Each test combines 2 of the 11 categories. The test will consist of 96 pairs of 16 food images presented on a computer screen in color. Participants will be invited to &quot;choose the food they most want to eat&quot;, by pressing the corresponding computer button (choices saved by counting the frequency scores in E-prime).
The level of hunger will be evaluated by an Analogical Visual Scale, ranging from 0 to 10.
Patients should also complete 3 self-questionnaires used routinely (Binge Eating Scale, The Yale Food Addiction Scale, The UPPS-P short version).</description>

        This study will focus on a population of patients who are or have been obese and are being
        cared for at the Lyon Sud Hospital Center. Patients will either be undergoing initial
        assessment or being assessed for follow-up after bariatric surgery (after sleeve
        gastrectomy or gastric bypass).
