  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication errors are common, life-threatening, costly but preventable. Information
      technology and automated systems are highly efficient for preventing medication errors and
      therefore widely employed in hospital settings. In this study, investigators would perform a
      cluster randomized controlled trial of a clinical reminding system that uses DNN and
      Probabilistic models to detect and notify physicians of inappropriate prescriptions, giving
      them the opportunity to correct these gaps and increase prescriptions completeness. This
      study aim is to assess whether or not this system would improve prescription notation for a
      broad array of patient conditions.

      This paper focuses on &quot;Big data&quot; in the knowledge base, using &quot;Data minig&quot; study of DM
      (Disease-Medication) and MM (Medication-Medication) of relevance to develop associated
      decision resources system-&quot;the intelligent safety system&quot; (Advanced Electronic Safety of
      Prescriptions,AESOP Model), and test the system in the clinical environment in hospital can
      assist physicians when open orders reduce medication errors, the system is named &quot;AESOP
      Model&quot;.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the acceptance rate of the reminder, defined as the number of reminders accepted divided by number of unique reminders presented. In certain instances, physicians might see the same reminder serially, so we aggregate presentations and acceptance of the same reminder for the same patients' prescriptions in our calculation of the acceptance rate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The changes in the number of reminder for each group</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>As a secondary outcome, we measure the number of inappropriate prescriptions rate documented in the two groups during the two time periods and calculate the unadjusted relative rate of inappropriateness notation in the intervention group by comparing the number of inappropriateness recorded in the intervention arm during the intervention period to all other groups. The unadjusted relative rate is defined as the ratio (errorsintervention-post/errorscontrol-post)/ (errorsintervention-pre/errorscontrol-pre).</description>

    <description>Investigators develop an electronic reminder in CPOE system which notifies physicians when there appears to be an inappropriate prescription. At the time, a physician saves a typed prescription, our system analyzes the patient's medications, diseases and uses the knowledge base to determine whether a medication is uncommonly prescribed to all diseases in a given prescription. If the system detects the common associations of medications and diseases in a given prescription, it considers an appropriate prescription, and, if not, an actionable reminder is shown onscreen. To the right of each suggested uncommon medication is a reason why the reminder is appearing. Physicians can accept the reminder or ignore the reminder.</description>
