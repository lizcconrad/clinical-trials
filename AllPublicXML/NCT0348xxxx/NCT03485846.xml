    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm that combination of Narlaprevir, Ritonavir and
      Daclatasvir is safe and highly effective regimen in treatment-naїve patients with chronic
      hepatitis C (HCV) genotype 1b infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate effectiveness and safety of treatment with Narlaprevir, Ritonavir and Daclatasvir
      combination will be selected 105 treatment-naїve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b
      without genetic variants coding for the NS5A-Y93 С/H/N/S and/or L31 F/M/V/I amino acid
      substitutions, eligible as per protocol criteria.

      Each patient will participate in the trial approximately up to 38 weeks:

        -  2 weeks are expected for screening

        -  up to 12 weeks for treatment period

        -  24 weeks for follow-up period

      During treatment period all patient will receive equal drug combination.

      Efficacy and safety parameters will be assessed as per primary and secondary endpoints. Also
      Ctrough for Narlaprevir and Daclatasvir on day 14 will be evaluated as pharmacokinetic
      objective.

      The results of this study will provide new information about treatment of patients with
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 with Narlaprevir/Ritonavir in combination with Daclatasvir
      during 12 weeks.

                  the screening visit.

          -  A female subject is eligible to enter the study if it is confirmed that she is:

               1. Not pregnant or nursing;

                       the date of screening until 6 months after the last dose of the
                       investigational drugs:

                            during the study. Female subjects using a hormone-containing
                            contraceptive prior to screening must stop their contraceptive regimen
                            use from the date of screening until 6 months after their last dose of
                            investigational drugs.
