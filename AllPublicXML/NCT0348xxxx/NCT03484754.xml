  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate in adult subjects with resistant depression the effect of
      an injection of botulinum toxin in the corrugator and procerus muscles, in comparison to the
      infiltration of the crow's feet area, in addition to the current antidepressant treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that a single injection
      of OnaBotulinum Toxin A (OnaA) into the corrugator and procerus (frowning muscles) allows for
      a significant decrease in patients with a depressive episode characterized resistant.

      However, the effectiveness of this method of treating depression can not currently be
      considered established.

      The main objective of our study is therefore to evaluate the efficacy of OnaA injections in
      the glabellar zone with a different methodology, using lateral muscle injection orbicularis
      oculi (involved in crow's feet wrinkles). ) as another injection zone in comparison.

      The efficacy will correspond to the number of responders at 6 weeks in the two groups of
      injection.

      This evaluation will be done at 6 weeks, then at 3 months (S12).

    <intervention_model_description>The main pitfall of these studies is indeed the difficulty in ensuring a double-blind when the TB is injected into the corrugator and the procerus with placebo as physiological saline, since the patient as the examiner can guess which product was administered.
The main objective of our study is therefore to evaluate the efficacy of OnaA injections in the glabellar zone , using lateral muscle injection orbicularis oculi (involved in crow's feet wrinkles) as another injection zone in comparison.</intervention_model_description>
