  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first randomized controlled trial of Comprehensive Behavior
      Modification (ComB) as a treatment of trichotillomania (TTM). ComB treatment (12 weekly
      sessions, following a manual developed in an earlier treatment development project) will be
      compared to Minimal Attention Control among adults (N = 42) with TTM.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment based on the ComB model has been influential in the field of body-focused
      repetitive behaviors (BFRB's), but there is limited empirical research on its efficacy. Our
      first project (Falkenstein et al., 2016) developed a 12-session manual for ComB and a method
      for evaluating therapist adherence to the model that can be used reliably and provided
      encouraging (uncontrolled) data on the effects of ComB through 3-month follow-up.

      The proposed project extends the earlier work in two main ways: (a) using random assignment
      to ComB vs. comparison condition to test whether ComB works better than the passage of time +
      demand characteristics of being in a TTM study alone; and (b) gathering initial evidence on
      how ComB works.

      Treatment will be conducted at two sites -- Washington, DC (American University and the
      Behavior Therapy Center of Greater Washington) and Chicago (University of Chicago).
      Participants in the Minimal Attention Control condition will receive ComB therapy after the
      post-treatment [week 12] assessment is conducted. Uncontrolled follow-up data will be
      collected through 3 (MAC condition) or 6 (immediate ComB condition) months after the end of
      ComB treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Immediate ComB and MAC participants will each be assessed at baseline (week 0). ComB will begin weekly therapy sessions, and MAC will receive weekly phone check-ins. All will be assessed at week 6 [mid-treatment] and week 12 [end of controlled phase]. After week 12, ComB enters maintenance and MAC participants start to receive delayed ComB. There is another assessment at week 25 (3-month followup for immediate ComB, post-ComB for MAC) and a final assessment at week 38 (6-month followup for immediate ComB, 3-month followup for MAC).</intervention_model_description>
