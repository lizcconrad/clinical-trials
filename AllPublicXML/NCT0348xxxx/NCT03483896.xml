  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that an intervention increasing exposure to
      daylight indoors will reduce depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms among people
      living with dementia in long term care facilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to sufficient daylight indoors is a novel and potentially effective
      nonpharmocological treatment option for reducing depression and other neuropsychiatric
      symptoms for people living with dementia in long term care facilities. However, there are
      currently no minimum requirements for daylight access in care facilities. In urban settings,
      it is common for residents to spend the majority of the day indoors, illuminated by
      electrical light sources that deliver light with significantly lower intensities and reduced
      spectrum compared with daylight.

      A 12-week pilot study was conducted in 8 dementia care facilities involving (n = 83)
      participants addressing the hypothesis that an intervention increasing indoor exposure to
      daylight will reduce depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. At 4 facilities, staff
      was enlisted to increase daylight exposure by taking participants to a perimeter room with
      daylight exposure for socialization in the morning (8:00 - 10:00 AM) each day. At the other 4
      facilities, a control group were taken to a similar sized area without daylight for
      socialization under typical electrical lighting conditions. Outcome measures for depression
      and other neuropsychiatric symptoms were taken at the beginning and end of the 12-week study.

    <time_frame>A CSDD score was taken at the beginning of the 12-week study and once again at the end of the 12-week study.</time_frame>
    <description>The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) was used to measure depression. The CSDD is designed for the assessment of depression in older people with dementia who can at least communicate basic needs. The CSDD scale ranges from 0 to 38, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression. Scores above 10 indicate a probable major depression. Scores above 18 indicate a definite major depression. Scores below 6 are associated with absence of significant depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>A NPI-NH score was taken at the beginning of the 12-week study and once again at the end of the 12-week study.</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH) was used to measure neuropsychiatric symptomatology. The NPI-NH is a scale designed for assessment of people with dementia residing in extended care facilities. The NPI-NH includes ten behavioral areas (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior) and two types of neurovegetative changes (sleep and nighttime behavior disorders, appetite and eating disorders). Each of the 12 areas is scored on a subscale ranging from 0-12, where higher scores indicate greater neuropsychiatric symptomatology. A summary score is obtained from summing all 12 subscale scores. The summary score ranges from 0 - 144, where higher scores indicate greater neuropsychiatric symptomatology.</description>

    <description>At the 4 facilities in the active light intervention arm, staff increased the daylight exposure of participants by taking them to the perimeter zone of a daylit room from 8:00 to 10:00 AM for socialization over a period of 12 weeks. The perimeter zone was defined to be the region of the room within 3 meters from windows. The intervention was administered each day (7 days / week) over the duration of the study.</description>
