  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While pulmonary rehabilitation provides benefits to people with COPD, only 1.5% have access
      to pulmonary rehabilitation each year. The main barriers are related to travel and
      transportation. This protocol will evaluate the effect of a home-based rehabilitation system
      on quality of life and steps. The system allows for monitoring by a health care system. A
      health coach will review the data and provide coaching to facilitate behavioral change and
      self-efficacy.

      Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be stratified by whether the participant has poor lung function (forced expiratory volume [FEV1] &lt;50% predicted) and whether the participant has severe dyspnea (recorded modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale [mMRC] score, 3-4; scale, 0-4); critical factors that can make the study arms unbalanced regarding risk factors.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will complete quality of life questionnaires at enrollment and at 3 months. The Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) will be utilized to measure quality of life. The intervention participants will have a change in quality of life.</description>

    <description>Actigraph GT3X is the validated tool to measure physical activity. The Actigraph will be worn for one week to measures sedentary time. Sedentary time will be higher in the controlled group after the intervention</description>
