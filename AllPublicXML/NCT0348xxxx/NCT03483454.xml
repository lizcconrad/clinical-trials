      This study observes fitness level and health parameters in children ages 6-12 years old with
      obesity using an exercise class intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve physical fitness and health parameters in
      elementary-aged children who participate in an academic weight loss clinic. Patients and
      their parents are randomly assigned to either take exercise classes or to continue standard
      care (control group). Exercise classes are run at a local church 3 times a week for 8 weeks
      and children and parents are expected to participate. Parents are expected to follow similar
      dietary and exercise recommendations which are given to their children. Vitals, lab work and
      fitness testing are done on children at beginning, middle and end of the 6- month study.
      Vitals are done on parents at the beginning, middle and end of the study. Children are given
      Fitbits to record sleep patterns and daily physical activity.
