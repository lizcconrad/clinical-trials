  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality analgesia (VRA) for pediatric patients undergoing
      Botulinum toxin injections (BTI) for spasticity management. Patients will be assigned to one
      of three groups; one group of subjects will randomly be assigned to VRA intervention using
      Google Cardboard Virtual reality head- mounted display powered by a iPod touch, a second
      group of subjects will receive VRA with Oculus Rift, and a third group of subjects will
      receive no intervention beyond standard sedation, anesthetic, and/or restraint—this group
      will serve as the control group.

    <measure>Severity of Pain Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>About 20 minutes per patient.</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of pain using the Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability scale (FLACC scale) which is a Behavioral Pain Assessment Scale. Each category is scored on the 0-2 scale, that results in total score of 0-10.
0= Relaxed and comfortable , 1-3 = Mild discomfort, 4-6=Moderate pain, 7-10= Severe discomfort or pain or both. Lower score is a good outcome and higher score is a bad outcome. The assessment is for all the subjects in the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of severity of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>About 20 minutes per patient</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of anxiety using Short State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Anxiety scale which is a self-evaluation questionnaire completed by the patient's parent or guardian about how they feel and how the child feels at that moment.
It consists of 6 questions each having scale 1-4. 1 being Not at all and 4 being Very much. The questions are as follows:
I feel calm
I am tense
I feel upset
I am relaxed
I feel content
I am worried</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with spasticity requiring BTI

          -  Children ages 5 - 18

          -  Children who have contraindications for sedation for BTI

          -  Children with intact vision who can attend VR intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who have uncontrolled seizures &gt; than 4 per year

          -  Children who are not attentive to VR secondary to poor concentration, poor cognition
             to external stimuli

          -  Children on different treatments for spasticity such as baclofen pump, phenol block.
             For patients who receive phenol block, phenol block will be held during the visits
             with VR intervention to avoid confounding results

          -  Children with poor bleeding control

          -  Children who request general anesthesia/IV sedation.
