  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the leading cause of cancer related death in China. Lung cancer
      screening with low-dose computed tomography was considered as a better approach than
      radiography. However, the role of Lung cancer screening with Low-dose CT (LDCT) among Chinese
      people remains unclear. With rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI),the
      application of AI in detection and diagnosis of diseases has become research focus. Moreover,
      patients' psychological status also plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment.

      This study focuses on detection and natural history management of lung nodule and lung cancer
      with AI assisted chest CT among people living in North China, and aims to investigate
      epidemiological results, patients' medical records and social psychological status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lu'an Municipal Hospital and North China Petroleum Bureau General Hospital initialed the lung
      cancer screening by LDCT a few years ago. People living in North China who are administrated
      by these hospitals routinely took a chest CT every year. This study is to the best of our
      knowledge the first one designed to combine lung nodule and lung cancer screening with the
      application of artificial intelligence in China.

      Methods: Firstly, the study acquires epidemiological, medical information and psychological
      status of people recruited, and investigates the data acquired from past several years of CT
      scans using AI to develop a model for lung nodule detection. Secondly, evaluating the
      performance of models and apply it to analyse the CT scans from the North China population
      recruited. Thirdly, improving the model and adding function for lung nodule prediction of
      natural history and probability of malignancy.

      Aims: To depict the epidemiological results about the incidence of lung nodules and lung
      cancer in North China population; To evaluate association between people 's epidemiological,
      medical and psychological profiles and incidence, diagnosis and treatment of lung nodule; To
      develop an artificial intelligence assisted lung nodule diagnosis and management software to
      assist strategies of CT screening.

    <description>Study participants undergo baseline LDCT. Images are reviewed via AI software independently to identify lung nodules with diameters greater than 4mm. The software is developed by our computer technology collaborator. A radiologist then reviews the images, reports lung nodules with diameters greater than 4mm and any other abnormalities. The radiologist's findings will be conveyed to the study participants or their primary care physicians within 3 weeks. The process was conducted via double-blind method and detection rates of AI and radiologist will be recorded respectively.
