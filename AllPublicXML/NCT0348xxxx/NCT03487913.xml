    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, parallel-group, multiple dose study designed to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of lixivaptan
      in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease subjects with chronic kidney disease in
      stages CKD1, CKD2 or CKD3.

      Therapeutic interventions aimed at counterbalancing the effect of vasopressin and/or
      normalizing intracellular levels of cAMP may be effective in delaying disease progression in
      autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

      The primary objectives of this study in subjects with ADPKD are:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of lixivaptan following multiple doses in
           ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function (chronic kidney disease CKD1
           and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal function (CKD3).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To characterize the PK profile of lixivaptan and its major metabolites following
           multiple doses of lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function
           (CKD1 and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal function (CKD3).

        -  To characterize the pharmacodynamic effect of lixivaptan on urine output, urine
           osmolality, total kidney volume, serum vasopressin, and serum creatinine following
           multiple doses of lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function
           (CKD1 and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal function (CKD3).
