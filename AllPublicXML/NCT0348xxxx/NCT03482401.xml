      The objective of this exploratory trial is to determine the disposition and characterise the
      metabolic profiling of dietary polyphenols in normal and malignant glandular breast tissues
      from newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.

      The patients consumed a polyphenol-rich dietary supplement containing 37 different phenolics
      and 2 methylxanthines (theobromine and caffeine) from the diagnosis to the surgery. The
      metabolic profiling was characterized in normal and malignant breast tissues as well as
      plasma and urine using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS.

    <description>Patients consumed a polyphenol-rich dietary supplement (commercial lemon, orange, pomegranate, olive, grape, cocoa, curcuma and broccoli extracts), mainly rich in simple phenolics such as hydroxytyrosol and the polyphenols procyanidins, hesperidin, eriocitrin, curcumin, resveratrol, punicalagin and ellagic acid. Cocoa extract also contains the methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine.</description>
