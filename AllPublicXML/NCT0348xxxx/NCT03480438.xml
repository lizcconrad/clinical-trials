  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial proposed here attempts to reduce induction chemotherapy to phase I of standard
      induction in patients with B-precursor ALL. Induction phase II will be replaced by
      blinatumomab.

      The initial treatment phase is followed by sequential chemotherapy and further blinatumomab
      cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blinatumomab is a bispecific single-chain antibody construct designed to link B cells and T
      cells resulting in T-cell activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response against CD19 expressing
      cells. In Phase II-III clinical trials 43-69 % of the patients treated with blinatumomab in
      relapsed/refractory ALL with poor prognostic features, achieved a complete hematologic
      remission and around 80 % of these obtained a molecular remission as well. Blinatumomab thus
      has demonstrated significant antileukemic activity in relapsed/refractory adult ALL. The
      ultimate goal for optimised management of adult ALL is to integrate targeted compounds with
      known single-drug activity into first-line treatment.
