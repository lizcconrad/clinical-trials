  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogen inactivation (PI) system for Whole Blood (WB) using Amustaline (S-303) and
      Glutathione (GSH) has a potential to decrease transfusion-transmitted infection. There is
      scientific basis to hypothesize, that cells containing DNA and RNA such as bacteria, viruses
      and parasites that could be present in blood collected from asymptomatic infected donors are
      inactivated in the treated whole blood and therefore reduce the risk of
      transfusion-transmitted infections. The aim of the study is to gather data to support the
      safety of whole blood products that underwent treatment with amustaline and glutathione and
      data to support a larger sufficiently powered efficacy study. This study will evaluate the
      safety of the system for whole blood in adult cancer patients with anemia.

      This study has a two-stage design. Stage 1 is designed as a randomized, double-blind stage,
      followed by Stage 2, an open-label, single arm treatment escalation stage. The aim is to
      explore the safety of the whole blood product treated with a PI system using amustaline and
      glutathione.

      The study will enroll 30 patients with anemia due to underlying cancer. In stage1, 20
      patients will be randomized either to treated WB (Test) or conventional WB (Control).

      After safety assessment in Stage 1, Stage 2, a dose escalation stage will follow and enroll
      additional 10 patients in need of 2 WB products administered successively to correct anemia.

      Screening:

      All potentially eligible patients at the participating institution will be approached for
      study consent prior to whole blood transfusion. Patients who consent to the study will be
      assigned a screening study number (study ID) and undergo screening. Screening will include
      demographics (age, sex), clinical physical examination, concomitant medication, laboratory
      parameters including immuno-hematological tests as well as a pregnancy test. Blood samples
      will be drawn and archived for future research.

      Randomization and Blinding:

      Stage 1:

      After successful screening, eligible patients will be assigned to a treatment arm by
      sequentially selecting a randomization envelope starting with the lowest number. If a
      randomized patient withdraws or is withdrawn from the study prior to administration of any
      study transfusion, the patient will be replaced. The replacement strategy in our phase 1
      clinical trial is based on the aim to reach a minimum of twenty patients in Stage 1. All
      patients that have been randomized and have received at least one study transfusion are
      followed for 28 (+/- 3) days for a final safety assessment.

      Prepared PI whole blood whether treated or untreated will be of identical appearance when
      released to the clinical site.

      The patient, the investigator and sponsor personnel or delegate(s) who are involved in the
      treatment or clinical evaluation of the patients will be blinded to the treatment assignment.

      Stage 2 :

      No randomization or blinding will be needed for Stage 2 as it is designed as open-label and
      single-arm.

      Treatment:

      Stage 1 Patients will be transfused with test or control study whole blood on Day 1.

      Stage 2 Patients will be transfused with two treated units of whole blood on Day 1.

      Treatment common to both stages:

      In case of confirmed active antibodies associated with clinical hemolysis or any presumed or
      documented antibodies that preclude further transfusion of study whole blood, patients will
      be discontinued/withdrawn from the study and supported with locally sourced whole blood.

      Patients who do not receive any WB transfusion within 7 days of planned treatment will be
      withdrawn from the study and replaced. Enrolled or randomized patients who receive a blood
      transfusion prior to study transfusion will be withdrawn from the study and replaced.
      Additional data of discontinued / withdrawn patients will not be collected.

      Study Assessments: Monitoring and Follow-up

      The Monitoring period will comprise 28 days (+/-3 days) from the day of the first study
      transfusion. All adverse events (AEs), severe adverse events (SAEs), transfusion reactions
      (TRs) and unanticipated adverse device effects will be collected. The Investigators will
      assess each AE/SAE/TR and unanticipated adverse effect for relation to the study transfusion.
      Transfusion reactions will be classified by the definitions of Swissmedic grading scale
      adapted to Ugandan environment.

      Assessements will be performed at the Pre-transfusion visit,during transfusion treatment at
      Post-transfusion visits and at a follow-up safety visit (28 days after study transfusion):
