      Background and Aims: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) infection in Punjab,
      India is 3.29%, with an estimated burden of around 650,000 viremic chronic HCV (CHC)
      patients. The Mukh Mantri Punjab Hepatitis C Relief Fund (MMPHCRF) was launched in June 2016
      to provide free treatment to all CHC aiming to eliminate HCV from Punjab. The study assessed
      the feasibility of decentralized care and efficacy and safety of 12 or 24 weeks of sofosbuvir
      (SOF) + ledipasvir (LDV) or SOF + daclatasvir (DCV) ± ribavirin (RBV) in the treatment of CHC
      patients in a public health care setting.

      An algorithm was developed using SOF-based regimens to treat all patients (RKD). Genotyping
      is not recommended for patients without cirrhosis of liver and they are being treated with
      SOF+DCV for 12-weeks, while genotyping is recommended for patients with cirrhosis of liver
      (Figure 1). Patients with liver cirrhosis and genotype 3 are being treated with SOF+DCV+RBV
      for 24 weeks, while non-genotype 3 patients are being treated with SOF+LDV+RBV for 12-weeks
      or with SOF+LDV for 24-weeks (in RBV intolerant patients). SVR-12 is mandatory in all
      patients. Methods: Decentralized care: All patients are being evaluated and treated at 3
      Government Medical Colleges and 22 District Hospitals; they were followed up to 12 weeks
      post-treatment to look for sustained viral response (SVR-12). Health care worker capacity
      building: 90 medical specialists were trained in a 4-hr predefined course, followed by online
      continued medical education sessions by regular Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes
      (ECHO) Clinic are being conducted fortnightly. 50 pharmacists, 2 from each of the 25 centres,
      dispense medicine as per specialist prescription. Data Management: 25 trained data entry
      operators and Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) are managing epidemiological data on
      CHC hotspots, high-risk groups, local service providers, etc. Monitoring: Medical alerts are
      being used for compliance monitoring. Study design: A cost-effective algorithm has been
      developed using SOF-based regimens to treat all patients. The diagnosis of cirrhosis is based
      on clinical evidence including Aspartate Transaminase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI ≥
      2.0) and FIB-4 score (&gt;3.25) or on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥12.5 kilopascal (kPa)
      on fibroscan. The study aims to validate the efficacy and safety of generic all oral Direct
      Acting Antiviral (DAA) regimens in a decentralized algorithm based public health model in
      Punjab, India regardless of genotype/presence of cirrhosis.
