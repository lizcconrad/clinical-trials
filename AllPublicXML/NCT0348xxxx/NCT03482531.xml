    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is a common obstetric procedure that is routinely performed worldwide.
      However, when cervical conditions are not favorable (bishop &lt;6), induction of labor is
      preceded by cervical ripening, usually with prostaglandins. The method of ripening most
      commonly used in France (89% of maternity wards) is the dinoprostone vaginal insert. In the
      majority of hospitals in France, dinoprostone vaginal inserts are usually placed in the
      morning, because of the higher availability of personnel (midwives and nurses). However,
      morning placement might increase the likelihood of the delivery occurring at night, since the
      mean interval between the insert placement and delivery is about 13 to 20 hours. Many studies
      have now shown that the risk of obstetrical complications, as well as neonatal morbidity and
      mortality is increased when deliveries occur at night. Several factors have been suggested
      behind the increased morbidity at night, including the lower number of personnel working, the
      fatigue associated with night work and the disruption of the circadian rhythm, and the
      insufficient supervision of residents.

      Very few studies have evaluated the importance of the timing of placement of the intravaginal
      dinoprostone insert, and its influence on the occurrence of night deliveries. Some
      investigators have recently performed a retrospective study at Angers university hospital
      that assessed the time interval between placing the dinoprostone vaginal insert and delivery,
      as well as the factors impacting the time to delivery, and found that nulliparity, obesity, a
      closed cervix on initial examination, and intact membranes at the time of insertion increased
      the time to delivery. Moreover, the investigators proposed a regression equation that allows
      to calculate the mean time from insert placement to delivery for each patient, and have
      decided to incorporate it in the routine practice.

      The investigators have decided to analyze whether a more personalized timing for placement of
      dinoprostone vaginal insert, based on every patient's characteristics (parity, BMI, cervical
      dilation and state of membranes), would decrease the number of deliveries occurring between
      12 p.m. and 6 a.m.

      This is a before-after, retrospective and prospective monocentric study. Patients in the
      &quot;before&quot; group were part of another study which are currently in the process of publishing
      and were retrospectively included, whereas patients in the &quot;after&quot; group will be
      prospectively included.

      In the &quot;before&quot; group, the investigators retrospectively included 405 patients who had a
      dinoprostone vaginal insert for cervical ripening before induction of labor, between January
      2015 and September 2016. The main outcome of the previous study was to evaluate the time
      interval between placing the dinoprostone vaginal insert and delivery. One of the secondary
      objectives was to determine the factors that would impact the time to delivery. Multivariate
      and regression analysis showed that the factors significantly increasing the time to delivery
      were: Nulliparity, obesity, a closed cervix on initial examination, and intact membranes at
      the time of insertion. The investigators also described a regression equation that allows to
      calculate the mean time from insert placement to delivery for each patient:

      Y = 961,188 - 80,346 x parity + 21,437 x Body Mass Index (BMI) - 165,263 x cervical dilation-
      241,759 x Premature rupture of membranes.

      Following this study, the investigators decided to modify the routine procedures on the
      maternity ward and incorporate the equation when scheduling patients for cervical ripening
      with vaginal dinoprostone insert. The aim is to have a more personalized insertion schedule
      that would lower the number of deliveries occurring between midnight and 6 a.m., since it has
      been proven that there is a higher risk of obstetrical morbidity with night-time labor and
      delivery.

      The main objective of this study is to analyze whether the use of the personalized scheduling
      based on the mathematical model they described would decrease the rate of nocturnal
      deliveries (between midnight and 6 a.m.). The investigators will prospectively include all
      eligible patients with a vaginal dinoprostone insert for cervical ripening during the next
      two years, starting on April 1st, 2018. At Angers hospital, there are around 600 cases of
      dinoprostone vaginal inserts per year, so 400 to 500 patients will be included during the
      study's duration. The investigators will then compare the outcomes in these patients that
      will comprise the &quot;after&quot; group, to the outcomes of patients in the &quot;before&quot; group, who
      delivered before the implementation of the new scheduling process. The investigators will
      thus be able to assess whether the mathematic model they suggested to estimate time to
      delivery and the personalized insertion timings have led to a decrease in deliveries between
      midnight and 6 a.m.

      The research project has been approved by the ethics committee of Angers university hospital
      on January 31st, 2018.
