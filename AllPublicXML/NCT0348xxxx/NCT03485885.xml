  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to describe the bioavailability for the proprietary
      standardized maqui berry extracts Delphinol® and MaquiBright® enriched in anthocyanins and in
      particular delphinidins. The analyses are based on two selected key substances namely
      delphinidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside and their metabolism to phenolic acids.

      The bioavailability of anthocyanins specific for Delphinol®/MaquiBright® was analyzed in
      plasma sample kinetics (at 0h, 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h and 8h after intake of 1000mg
      standardized maqui berry extract in capsules) in 12 healthy subjects.

    <measure>Quantification of two specific maqui berry anthocyanins: namely Delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and Cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside in a kinetics, evaluating the change between baseline and selected time points (see below).</measure>
    <time_frame>Kinetics: baseline to 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours after intake</time_frame>
    <description>Specific anthocyanins related to maqui berry extract (Delphinol® / MaquiBright®) were measured in plasma samples of healthy subjects and assessed as change to baseline. Method: LC-MS/MS (unit [nmol/L]).</description>

    <measure>Quantification of two specific maqui berry anthocyanin derived metabolites: namely gallic acid and protocatechuic acid in a kinetics, evaluating the change between baseline and selected time points (see below).</measure>
    <time_frame>Kinetics: baseline to 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours after intake</time_frame>
    <description>Specific anthocyanin derived metabolites related to maqui berry extract (Delphinol® / MaquiBright®) were measured in plasma samples of healthy subjects and assessed as change to baseline. Method: LC-MS/MS. Results will most probably be assessed as &quot;AUC&quot; (area under the curve).</description>

    <measure>Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) measurement in a kinetics, evaluating the change between baseline and selected time points (see below).</measure>
    <time_frame>Kinetics: baseline to 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours after intake</time_frame>
    <description>The FRAP assay was performed to assess the &quot;antioxidant power&quot; / &quot;antioxidant capacity&quot; of the plasma after intake of maqui berry extract (Delphinol® / MaquiBright®). Method: photometric / absorption maximum at 593 nm (unit [µmol/l])</description>
