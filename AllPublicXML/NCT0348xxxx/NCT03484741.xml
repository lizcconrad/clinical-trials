  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) transplantation for type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are collected from autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells and
      allogeneic umbilical cord tissue (UC-MSC).

      15 patients with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus will be enrolled and will receive MSCs by
      intravenous infusion. They were followed up for 6 months after transplantation.

      Safety is to assess the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during either stem cells infusion
      or by physician assessments.

      The primary endpoint is to assess the improvement of patients' Fasting blood glucose, HbA1C,
      C-peptide, and blood insulin level.
