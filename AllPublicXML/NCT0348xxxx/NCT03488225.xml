      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this study is to learn if inotuzumab ozogamicin given in combination with
      hyper-CVAD can help to control newly diagnosed B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The
      safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      Hyper-CVAD is a drug combination and schedule that is described below under Intensive
      Chemotherapy.

      This is an investigational study. Inotuzumab ozogamicin and hyper-CVAD when given alone are
      FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of ALL. Combining inotuzumab
      ozogamicin with hyper-CVAD is investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration Each cycle is 21 days (+/- 7 days).

      Intensive Chemotherapy (Cycles 1 and 3):

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive hyper-CVAD
      during Cycles 1 and 3 as follows:

        -  On Days 1-3, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours every 12 hours, for
           a total of 6 doses per cycle.

        -  On Days 1-3, you will receive mesna as a non-stop infusion starting about 1 hour before
           the cyclophosphamide infusion and ending about 12 hours after the last dose of
           cyclophosphamide.

        -  On Days 1-4 and 11-14, you will receive dexamethasone by vein or taken as a tablet by
           mouth.

        -  The doctor will decide if you will receive ofatumumab or rituximab. If you receive
           ofatumumab, you will receive it by vein over about 2 hours (or longer if the doctor
           thinks it is needed) on Days 1, 2, and 11 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 and 11 of Cycle 3. If
           you receive rituximab, you will receive it by vein over about 2 hours (or longer if the
           doctor thinks it is needed) on Days 1 and 11 of Cycles 1 and 3.

        -  On Day 2, you will receive methotrexate intrathecally (through a spinal tap).

        -  On Day 4, you will receive doxorubicin by vein over 24 hours through a central venous
           catheter. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while
           you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more
           detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

        -  On Days 4 and 11, you will receive vincristine by vein over 1 hour.

        -  On Day 7, you will receive cytarabine intrathecally.

        -  After you complete chemotherapy, you will either receive pegfilgrastim as a one-time
           dose or filgrastim (G-CSF) as an injection under the skin every day until your white
           blood cell counts recover.

      You will receive methotrexate and cytarabine during Cycles 2 and 4 as follows:

        -  On Day 1, you will receive methotrexate by vein over 24 hours.

        -  On Days 2 and 3, you will receive cytarabine over 2 hours by vein every 12 hours, for a
           total of 4 doses per cycle.

        -  Starting on Day 2, you will receive leucovorin by vein 4 times a day for 8 doses per
           cycle.

        -  On Days 1 and 8, you will receive ofatumumab by vein over about 2 hours (or longer if
           the doctor thinks it is needed) or rituximab by vein over about 2 hours (or longer if
           the doctor thinks it is needed).

        -  On Day 5, you will receive cytarabine intrathecally.

        -  On Day 8, you will receive methotrexate intrathecally.

        -  After you complete chemotherapy, you will either receive pegfilgrastim as a one-time
           dose or filgrastim as an injection under the skin every day until your white blood cell
           counts recover.

      During Cycles 5-8: you will receive inotuzumab ozogamicin by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1
      and Day 8 of each cycle.

      Maintenance Therapy:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      For Cycles 9-20 (12 cycles), you will receive the following drugs:

        -  Three (3) times a day, you will take mercaptopurine tablets by mouth.

        -  One (1) time a week, you will take methotrexate tablets by mouth.

        -  On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive vincristine by vein over about 1 hour.

        -  On Days 1-5 of each cycle, you will take prednisone tablets by mouth.

      Other Drugs:

      If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may also receive drugs through a spinal tap to help
      lower the risk of the disease coming back in the fluid surrounding your brain.

      You may also be given other drugs to help lower the risk of other side effects (for example,
      you may receive allopurinol, ursodiol, or rasburicase). Your doctor will tell you about these
      drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 20 cycles of study drugs. You will no longer be able to receive the
      study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you are unable
      to follow study directions, or if you receive stem cell transplant therapy.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up bone marrow
      aspirations/biopsies or after the end of the Maintenance Therapy.

      Study Visits:

      Prior to each cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      Once a week during Cycles 1-4, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy on the
      following schedule:

        -  Day 14 of Cycle 1, then 1 time a week for as long as the doctor thinks is needed based
           on the disease status

        -  3 chemotherapy cycles after a complete response in the disease and/or before you start
           inotuzumab ozogamicin

        -  Day 21 of Cycle 5, then after every cycle (exact schedule will depend on the disease
           status at the start of inotuzumab ozogamicin), then every 4 months after that. The study
           staff will let you know when the every 4 month follow-up procedures will stop, and it
           will be based on the disease status.

      Every 4 weeks during Cycles 9-20, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      At any time, if your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan, a PET scan, and/or
      a chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-up:

      Thirty (30) days after you have received your last dose of the inotuzumab ozogamicin, you
      will be called by a member of the study team and asked how you are feeling and about any
      other drugs or treatments you are receiving. The phone call should last about 10 minutes.

      Long-term Follow-up:

      After you have received your last dose of study drugs, you will be called by a member of the
      study team every 6 months. You will be asked how you are feeling and about any other drugs or
      treatments you are receiving. The phone call should last about 10 minutes.
