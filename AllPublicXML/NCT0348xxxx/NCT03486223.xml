  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibition with
      GSK2256294 affects tissue sEH activity and insulin sensitivity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are randomized to treatment with the sEH inhibitor GSK2256294 (10mg/day) or matching
      placebo for one week. On the seventh day of drug treatment, subjects will report to the CRC
      in the morning after an overnight fast to undergo a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with
      adipose tissue biopsies.

      During the Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, insulin will be infused for 2 hours at low dose
      (20 mU/m2/min) and 2 hours at high dose (80 mU/m2/min) to assess insulin sensitivity. The
      Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) will be adjusted to maintain glucose near 95 mg/dL. The average
      GIR during the final 30 minutes of the high dose period will be used as the measure of
      insulin sensitivity.

      After completion of the study day, subjects will undergo a seven-week washout from study drug
      and then receive the opposite drug for one week. On the seventh day of treatment they will
      report to the CRC after an overnight fast and repeat the study day protocol.
