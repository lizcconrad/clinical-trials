  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid therapy in trauma patients is considered one of the common challenges in daily
      practice. Both crystalloids and colloids can be used to maintain adequate blood volume and
      tissue perfusion but there is an ongoing debate as both of them could affect coagulation and
      renal function. The latest generation of the commercially available Hydroxy Ethyl Starch
      (HES) solutions was developed to improve pharmacokinetics and safety profile of HES,
      minimizing adverse effects such as impairment of blood coagulation or renal function. But
      data on early fluid resuscitation in trauma patients with these starches are limited and its
      safety on coagulation and renal function is still questioned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid resuscitation is a fundamental of the initial management and resuscitation of trauma
      patients to preserve or restore normovolemia, cardiac output, tissue perfusion, and
      correcting coagulopathy and acid-base balance during massive blood loss, yet fluid therapy in
      trauma patients is considered one of the common challenges in our daily practice with a lot
      of controversies and recommendations changing from using crystalloids, colloids, and/or
      packed red blood cells. Also, fluid availability which does not necessarily matches the best
      fluid needed for the patient impacts the physician choice of fluids especially when blood is
      not available.Both crystalloids and colloids can be used to maintain adequate blood volume
      and tissue perfusion. But both of them could affect coagulation and renal function. Both
      crystalloids and colloids decrease concentration of coagulation factors and number of
      platelets causing dilutional coagulopathy. Moreover, synthetic colloids impair polymerization
      of fibrin and platelet function, aggravating coagulopathic state. So, their use may therefore
      increase blood loss. As, all hydroxyethyl starch (HES) colloid solutions are excreted through
      the kidneys and other ways of excretion are negligible a lot of clinical trials have raised
      concerns about the renal safety of HES due to observed high frequency of acute kidney injury
      and high mortality rates in critically ill patients.These effects depend on the
      pharmacokinetic properties of the HES used, which determines the HES plasma concentrations
      over time, in vivo molecular weight (Mw), and maximum doses used. The latest generation of
      the commercially available HES solutions the medium-Mw starch, HES 130/0.4 (6%, Voluven®),
      was developed to improve pharmacokinetics and to improve the safety profile of HES,
      minimizing adverse effects such as impairment of blood coagulation or renal function.
