  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the serum IgA response of three dose levels of the
      oral RV3-BB vaccine when administered in a neonatal schedule or when administered as a high
      dose in an infant schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA
      response (defined as a ≥3 fold increase from baseline) 4 weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB
      administered in a neonatal schedule at a High, Mid or low vaccine titre. In addition the
      cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA response (defined as a ≥3 fold increase from baseline) 4
      weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB administered in an infant schedule at a high dose of vaccine
      will be assessed along with cumulative vaccine take and components of vaccine take after 3
      doses of RV3-BB administered in a neonatal or infant schedule.

      The safety and tolerability of RV3-BB when administered as an infant or as a neonatal
      schedule will be described.

             component.

          -  Neonates with a significant evolving neurological disorder.

             the investigators, or who are working on the study.

          -  Neonates who have been exposed to immunosuppressive courses of glucocorticosteroids,
             cytotoxic drugs or blood products through prenatal exposure and/or breast milk in the
             four weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Neonates with diarrhoea or vomiting in the 24 hours preceding randomisation.

          -  Neonates with any moderate or severe illness, and/or who have a temperature of ≥37.5˚C
             axillary/oral or ≥38˚C rectal/tympanic within the 48 hours preceding randomization.
