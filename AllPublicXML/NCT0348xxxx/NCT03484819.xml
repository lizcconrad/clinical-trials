    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well copanlisib and nivolumab work in treating participants
      with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma that has come
      back or does not responded to the treatment. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      copanlisib and nivolumab may work better in treating participants with diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response rate (CR) plus partial
      response rate (PR) (ORR = CR + PR) of the combination of copanlisib (copanlisib
      hydrochloride) and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the combination of nivolumab and copanlisib hydrochloride in
      patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

      II. To determine the progression free survival, duration of response, complete response rate
      and overall survival of the combination of copanlisib hydrochloride and nivolumab in patients
      with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

      CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the effects of the copanlisib hydrochloride and nivolumab combination
      regimen on tumor cells, tumor microenvironment and the immune response in relapsed/refractory
      DLBCL and PMBCL.

      II. To assess predictors of response of the combination in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and
      PMBCL.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15.
      Participants also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of courses 1 to 8 and
      on day 1 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 100 days.
