  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with sickle cell disease experience both a poor quality of life and stigma.
      Individuals with SCD often experience high levels of stigma which can be a barrier to good
      self-management and hinder quality of life. The purpose of this research is to improve
      understanding of the relationships between stigma, self-management, and quality of life in
      SCD in the United States and Jamaica. The findings from this project will contribute to the
      development of a tool to measure self-management strategies and will also guide the
      development of interventions to improve SCD self-management.

      The goal of the proposed study is to explore the complex relationships between perceived
      stigma, demographic and clinical characteristics, sickle cell disease (SCD) self-management
      strategies, and quality of life (QoL) in adults with SCD in the United States (US) and
      Jamaica, countries with important differences relevant to this study. Proposed is a cross
      sectional study that will use a convergent parallel mixed methods design (individual
      interviews and self-report surveys). Participants will be interviewed about SCD
      self-management strategies and how sources of stigma influence these strategies. Quantitative
      measures will be used to assess perceived stigma [SCD Health-Related Stigma Scale (SCD-HRSS)]
      and QoL [Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measures (ASCQ-Me): emotional impact, pain
      episodes, pain impact, sleep impact, social functioning impact, and stiffness impact; disease
      severity]. The primary outcome of the study is stigma and the secondary outcome is
      QoL(emotional impact, pain episodes, pain impact, sleep impact, social functioning impact,
      and stiffness impact; disease severity).

      The specific aims of this study are to:

      Aim 1: Determine the influences of perceived stigma and demographic and clinical
      characteristics on SCD self-management and QoL in adults with SCD in the US and Jamaica.

      Question 1: What are the influences of perceived stigma and demographic and clinical
      characteristics on SCD self-management? Question 2: What are the influences of perceived
      stigma and demographic and clinical characteristics on QoL? Aim 2: Describe the relationship
      between SCD self-management strategies and QoL.

    <description>The Sickle Cell Disease Health-Related Stigma Scale (SCD-HRSS) will assess stigma. SCD-HRSS has 4 subscales that measure stigma from the public, doctors, nurses, and family; and consists of 40 items on a 6 point Likert scale. It is scored by obtaining the sum of the mean score of the four subscales (subscales: 10-60; total scale: 40-240). Higher scores indicate higher perceived stigma.</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Measure of Sickle Cell Stigma (MoSCS) will assess stigma. MoSCS consists of 11-items with 4 subscales assessing social exclusion, internalized stigma, disclosure concerns, and expected discrimination. It is measured on a 6 point Likert scale; scores range from 6-36 and are obtained by summing and averaging the total scale. Higher scores indicate higher perceived stigma.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>14-21 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using Adult Sickle Cell Quality of life Measures (ASCQ-Me) subscales for emotional impact, pain episodes, pain impact, sleep impact, social functioning impact, and stiffness impact. For pain episodes separate composite scores are calculated for pain frequency (0-11) and severity (0-22). Higher scores indicate worse health status. Raw scores for the remaining scales range 5-25 and are developed by using T-Score transformation to standardize raw scores to have a mean of 50 (indicates an average health score on the scale) and standard deviation of 10 (represents one SD). Higher scores indicate healthier status.</description>
