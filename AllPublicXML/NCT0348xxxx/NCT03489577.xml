  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after severe injury are prone to suffer from
      infectious complications and even sepsis. Despite tremendous efforts the etiology of this
      increased susceptibility to infectious pathogens is incompletely understood. Clinical signs
      and symptoms as well as current diagnostic clinical tests (WBC, CRP, cytokines,
      interleukines) lack sensitivity or specificity for adequate prediction of the development of
      infectious complications or sepsis.

      Neutrophil granulocytes, cells of the innate immune system, play an important role in the
      defence against invading bacterial pathogens and are crucial in preventing fulminant
      infections. For successful eradication of a bacterium neutrophils need to exert specific
      functions: chemotaxis, migration, phagocytosis, degranulation and production of radical
      oxygen species. Much research has focused on the effect of trauma on neutrophil's individual
      capacities to kill bacteria with conflicting interpretations as a result. For adequate
      determination of the neutrophil's capacity to eradicate bacteria from tissue of trauma
      patients we developed novel in-vitro assays in which neutrophils are tested for all of these
      functions combined. This assay allows us to identify dysfunctional neutrophils adequately.

      The main focus of this study is the determination of the functionality of aberrant
      neutrophils circulating in the peripheral blood of severly injured following trauma.
