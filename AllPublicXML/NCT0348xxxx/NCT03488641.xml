      This observational study evaluates if drug response testing can be performed within 7 days
      and analyzes the value of ex-vivo drug screening for hematological malignancies as a
      biomarker to predict outcome, clinical course and response to treatment.

    <textblock>
      Targeted treatments have revolutionized care of individual diseases. While a new generation
      of targeted drugs is emerging in leukemia and lymphoma it remains clinical reality that most
      genetic information is not used for therapeutic stratification. This is in part based on the
      shortcomings of traditional biomarker discovery within clinical trials, where throughput is
      limited in both, drug number and sample size. If it were possible to map the variable pathway
      dependencies and drug sensitivity patterns in individual patients it is likely to become an
      asset to identify genotype-phenotype associations, understand the underlying complexities of
      molecular networks and further precision medicine stratification.

      To link clinical outcome and ex-vivo drug response assays, we systematically measure pathway
      sensitivity and resistance of primary tumor cells ex-vivo using a diverse compound library
      for individual patients in need of treatment. By systematically analyzing ex-vivo drug
      response patterns, we group tumors functionally, by response phenotype. While for the purpose
      of this study selection of a specific treatment will not be based on ex-vivo drug response
      assays, we will prospectively collect clinical response- and follow-up data of patients in
      parallel.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of a hematological malignancy: patients with leukemia, myeloma or lymphoma
             (e.g. ALL, AML, CLL, T-PLL, MCL, MM) who are in need of treatment and are willing to
             donate sufficient tumor material for ex-vivo drug sensitivity testing.

          2. The treating physician needs to indicate treatment.

          3. Measurable disease burden according to criteria as mention in section 3.

          4. Treatment must be scheduled and the patient must be eligible for the planed treatment
             as judged by the treating physician.

          5. Availability of 5x10e7 cells from peripheral blood draws, bone marrow aspirations or
             lymph node biopsies.

          6. Patient's written informed consent present.

          7. Ability to understand the nature of the trial and the trial related procedures and to
             comply with them.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition, which precludes initiation of treatment (e.g. breast feeding,
             pregnancy, infections, etc.) as judged by the treating physician.

          2. Any coexisting medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in
             the required study procedures, as judged by the treating physician.

          3. No systemic cancer treatment within 1 week of enrollment (except steroids equivalent
             of Prednisone less than or equal to 50 mg/day) within 2 weeks of enrollment.
