  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the availability of effective anti-retroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals are
      expected not to die of AIDS and have longer life expectancy. But at the same time,
      HIV-associated non-AIDS (HANA) conditions are becoming more important in their clinical
      management. It is currently uncertain whether patients started on different anti-retroviral
      regimens will have different incidence of HANA conditions.

      This study aims to evaluate the incidence of various HANA conditions in a cohort of newly
      diagnosed HIV-infected individuals in Hong Kong initiating anti-retroviral treatment. The
      incidence of various HANA conditions will be evaluated for those receiving INSTI versus other
      non-INSTI-based regimens.

      The HANA conditions evaluated will include 1. Hypertension 2. Diabetes and insulin resistance
      3. Dyslipidemia 4. Lipodystrophy 5. Metabolic syndrome 6. Osteopenia and osteoporosis 7.
      Vitamin D deficiency 8. Renal impairment and kidney tubular dysfunction and 9. Liver
      fibrosis. Patients will be assessed prior to initiation of anti-retroviral therapy, and 48
      weeks and 96 weeks after initiation of treatment. The incidence of development of each HANA
      condition will be determined and compared between those initiated different anti-retroviral
      regimens.

        All newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients meeting inclusion criteria, who attend the
        government HIV clinic, which is the largest HIV clinic in Hong Kong, over a 12-month
        period, will be invited to participate in this study. Subjects will also be referred by
        non-governmental organizations providing support to HIV-infected individuals at the time of
        diagnosis.
