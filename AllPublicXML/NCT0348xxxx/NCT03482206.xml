  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.7 million people in the United States each year,
      resulting in 2.5 million emergency department visits, 280,000 hospitalizations, &gt;50,000
      deaths, and more than $60 billion in economic cost. TBI also affects &gt;30,000 military
      personnel annually and almost 8% of veterans who received care between 2001 and 2011.
      Post-traumatic neurologic outcome depends on the severity of initial injuries and the extent
      of secondary cerebral damage. Ischemia is the most common and devastating secondary insult.
      Ischemic brain damage has been identified histologically in ~90% of patients who died
      following closed head injury, and several studies have associated low cerebral blood flow
      (CBF) with poor outcome. Specifically, CBF of less than 200 ml/min has been shown to be the
      critical lower threshold for survival in neurointensive care patients. In addition to
      intracranial hypertension and cerebral edema, systemic hypotension and reduced cardiac output
      contribute substantially to posttraumatic cerebral ischemia. Additionally, the carotid artery
      is the most common site of blunt cerebral vascular injury (BCVI), which may further
      compromise CBF and cause subsequent death or debilitating stroke. Specifically, high grade
      internal carotid arterial (ICA) injuries are associated with the highest mortality and stroke
      rate.

      The investigators' goal is to develop of a wearable noninvasive, continuous, automated
      ultrasound sensor to accurately measure extracranial ICA flow volume. In doing so, the
      investigators aim to enable early detection of CBF compromise, thereby preventing secondary
      ischemic injuries in TBI patients. To achieve this goal, the investigators plan to first
      build a prototype wearable ICA ultrasound senor with integrated signal processing platform,
      then test its accuracy in an in vitro system and healthy human subjects.

    <description>The investigators' goal is to develop a wearable noninvasive, continuous, automated ultrasound sensor to accurately measure arterial blood flow volume outside of the head. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture. In doing so, the investigators hope to detect CBF compromise early, preventing secondary injuries in TBI patients.</description>
