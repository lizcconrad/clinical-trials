  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in global, which accounts for 19% of the total
      and poses great hazards to male health. Unfavorable factors including prostatic specific
      antigen (PSA) &gt;20 ng/ml, Gleason score &gt;8, and T3/4 are significantly associated with
      biological recurrence, metastatic progression and poor survival in prostate cancer. In
      clinical T4(cT4) prostate cancer with bladder invasion patients, symptoms of hematuria,
      urinary urgency, bladder outlet and ureteral obstruction, and pelvic pain led to a poor
      quality of life.

      Radical prostatectomy is crucial for the multimodal treatment of prostate cancer, but limited
      proof demonstrated enough advantages of the surgery in T4 tumor with bladder invasion.
      Radical prostatectomy could hardly meet both demands of local tumor control and urinary
      function. Treatment trends suggest that patients with T4 prostate cancer be treated with
      radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, surgery enables a
      full pathological assessment of the tumor characteristics and thus a better estimation of the
      risk of recurrence. Cystoprostatectomy offers an option of surgical treatment for T4 prostate
      cancer with bladder invasion，which can well remove the bladder and urethra, decrease the risk
      of positive surgical margins and avoid urination complications.

      There is no consensus regarding optimal treatment of T4 prostate cancer and no evidence of
      oncological outcomes of cystoprostatectomy from clinical trials. A randomized clinical trial
      comparing two multimodal treatment regimens of cystoprostatectomy and radiotherapy for T4
      prostate cancer with bladder invasion is therefore warranted.
