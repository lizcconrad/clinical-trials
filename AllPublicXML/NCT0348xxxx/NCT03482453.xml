  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and to identify a tolerable
      single oral dose of TAK-788, and to characterize the effects of a low-fat meal on the PK of
      the TAK-788, administered as oral formulation in healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. The study will assess the safety,
      tolerability and will identify a tolerable single oral dose of TAK-788 and will evaluate the
      effect of a low-fat meal on TAK-788 PK.

      The study will enroll approximately 56 participants. The study is designed to consist of 2
      parts: Part 1- dose escalation phase and Part 2- food effect phase. The study population of
      Part 1 will consist of 40 participants enrolled into 5 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8
      randomized participants with 6 receiving a single dose of TAK-788, and 2 receiving matching
      placebo under fasted conditions. In Cohorts 1 to 5, safety of single-dose TAK-788 will be
      evaluated. For Part 2, a tolerable single dose is to be determined following review of safety
      and tolerability data from the previous cohorts in Part 1. The study population of Part 2
      will consist of 16 participants enrolled into 1 cohort, where participants will be randomized
      to a cross-over sequence of:

        -  TAK-788 Fed + TAK-788 Fasted

        -  TAK-788 Fasted + TAK-788 Fed

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 4 months. Participants will be contacted by
      telephone 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
