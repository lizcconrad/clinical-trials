      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to
      assess the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of
      Major Depressive Disorder. A total of approximately 1100 subjects will be enrolled into the
      single-blind treatment for 6 weeks, and 480 incomplete responders will be randomized to
      brexpiprazole (2~3 mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 240 subjects in each group),
      for treatment of 6 weeks.

      Screening phase: It can last up to 28 days and will begin when informed consent is signed.
      The screening phase will serve the following purposes: 1) To review the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria; 2) To allow for appropriate washout of prohibited medications; 3) To
      establish a pretreatment baseline of critical outcome measures.

      Single-blind Prospective Treatment Phase (Phase A): It lasts 8 weeks; the purpose of the
      Phase A is to select the MDD subjects with incomplete response to ADT.

      Randomized Double-blind Treatment Phase (Phase B): It lasts 6 weeks; the purpose of Phase B
      is to compare the efficacy and safety of Brexpiprazole as adjunctive therapy in the treatment
      of MDD patients with incomplete response to ADT.

      Continued Treatment Phase after Phase A (Phase A+): It lasts 6 weeks; the purpose of Phase A+
      is to continue treatment for subjects with complete response to ADT and not satisfying the
      criteria for Phase B.

      Follow-up Phase: It lasts 4 weeks and only applies to the subjects from Phase B; the purpose
      of Follow-up Phase is to collect the safety information after the last dose of IMP.
