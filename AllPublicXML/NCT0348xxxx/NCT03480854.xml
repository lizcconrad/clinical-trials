  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the first systems level continuous quality improvement (CQI) collaborative for
      multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, to conduct benchmarking analyses and
      assessments of geographic variation in MS care quality and value, and study the effect of CQI
      interventions on improvement of selected performance (quality) indicators.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three year study which will employ a step-wedge randomized design which will expose
      three of four participating centers to a healthcare QI intervention during the 3 year period.
      Each of the centers exposed to an intervention will serve as its own control during a
      baseline pre-intervention period during the first year of the study. The fourth site will
      serve as a longitudinal control for comparison to the other three centers exposed to a QI
      intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a two-part prospective study to be conducted over 3 years with option to extend to 5 years. In Year 1, we will gather baseline performance data from participating MS clinics (microsystems), create a combined MSCQI systems-level database, and conduct analyses of performance variation and benchmarking. In the second part of the study (Years 2-3), we will investigate the effect of Continuous Quality Improvement interventions on primary endpoints and selected secondary measures.</intervention_model_description>
