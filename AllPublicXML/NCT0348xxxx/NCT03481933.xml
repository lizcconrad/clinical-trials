  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the spectrum of fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) semantic dementia (SD)
      causes profound language dysfunction. SD damages semantic processing typically in the
      temporal poles (anterior temporal lobes, ATL). It is an early onset disease (often before 65
      years of age) affecting about 4000 patients in France and for which no validated treatment is
      available.

      For several years a growing number of studies have explored the effects of transcranial
      stimulation (TCS) on aphasic patients following stroke. Several studies have targeted
      left-sided language areas and/or homotopical right-sided regions with excitatory or
      inhibitory TCS, respectively, according to the principle of inter-hemispheric inhibition. In
      addition, repetitive multi-day TCS has provided evidence for long-lasting language effects
      (&gt;6 months) presumably linked to stimulation-induced neuroplasticity. Such investigations
      have provided promising results and have demonstrated that the stimulation site is a
      determining factor by showing that stimulation of cortical areas belonging to the language
      network usually results in more convincing effects than stimulating areas outside that
      network. Despite these findings the use of TCS in degenerative language diseases, such as
      primary progressive aphasias including SD, has only been explored in few small cohort studies
      and, surprisingly, they have not targeted language-related cortices.

      This project proposes the application of multi-day repetitive TCS with direct current (tDCS)
      in a large population of SD patients (N=60). It is built on a exploratory investigation of
      our team which has used three single tDCS sessions in a double-blind sham-controlled study.
      Excitatory and inhibitory tDCS to the left and right temporal pole, respectively,
      demonstrated highly significant transient effects (20 min) on semantic processing in 12 SD
      patients, providing 'proof of concept' and the rationale for this project. The aim here
      consists of using repetitive multi-day tDCS for a potential therapeutic outcome leading to
      long-lasting semantic improvement via neuroplasticity. The project is grounded on 2
      hypotheses: i) tDCS to temporal poles (left-excitatory, right-inhibitory) reactivates
      semantic processing in SD, ii) repetitive tDCS during ten days could induce neuroplasticity
      and therapeutic language improvement.

      Main objective and evaluation criteria:

      To evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of repetitive tDCS during 10 days on
      language/semantic impairment in SD via a double-blind sham-controlled study design. The
      evaluation criteria will be a significant improvement of language/semantic performances two
      weeks after tDCS as compared to base-line (before tDCS), contrasting subgroups receiving
      left-excitatory or right-inhibitory tDCS vs. sham tDCS

      Secondary objectives and evaluation criteria:

        1. Assess the time course of potential language/semantic improvement through the
           application of four follow-up time-points: base-line (max one week before tDCS), three
           days, two weeks and four months after tDCS. The evaluation criteria will be significant
           improvement/modulation of language/semantic performances, comparing performances at the
           four time-points.

        2. Assess brain markers which could reflect stimulation-induced neuroplasticity. Evaluation
           criteria will be significant modulation of cortical metabolism (FDG-PET) and functional
           connectivity (fMRI resting-state) comparing base-line and the 'two-week' time-point.

        3. Compare left-excitatory and right-inhibitory tDCS to reveal the most efficient
           stimulation modality. Evaluation criteria will be a detection of a potential outcome
           difference between left-excitatory and right-inhibitory tDCS on the performance within
           the different language/semantic tasks.

        4. Improve the understanding of the semantic roles of the left and right temporal pole, and
           their potential anatomical connectivity, by comparing left and right temporal pole
           stimulation and using MRI-based fiber tracking. 4) Improve the understanding of the
           semantic roles of the left and right temporal pole, and their potential anatomical
           connectivity, by comparing left and right temporal pole stimulation and using MRI-based
           fiber tracking.

      Experimental design :

      10 days of stimulation (20min, 2mA). Four language/semantic evaluations: base-line; 3 days; 2
      weeks; 4 months post-tDCS. Two MRI/PET acquisitions: pre-stimulation (base-line); 2 weeks
      post-tDCS

      Population :

      Patients with semantic dementia (SD). Healthy controls for normative measures (no tDCS for
      controls)

      Testing treatment :

      tDCS (specific device) : NE STARSTIM-ENOBIO 8 channels.

      Practical procedure :

      The duration of the study will be 41 months; 36 months being dedicated to patient inclusion.
      Participation duration of a patient will be of 4 months and 1 week to 4 months and 3 weeks
      maximum. First, patients will undergo a series of standardized neuropsychological and
      language tests that are included in routine care and inclusion criteria will be checked.
      After inclusion, the base-line visit will comprehend 1) MRI/PET in the Nuclear Medicine
      Service (CHU Pitié Salpêtrière), and 2) language/semantic tasks at the Department of
      Neurology (CHU Pitié Salpêtrière). Subsequently the ten stimulation sessions will be
      scheduled. They will take place in the Institute of Memory and Alzheimer's disease
      (Department of Neurology, CHU Pitié Salpêtrière) during two consecutive weeks (20 minutes of
      tDCS). The tDCS sessions will be followed by three time-point visits: 3 days (time-point 2)
      and two weeks (time-point 3) after the last stimulation session patients will undergo the
      language/semantic tasks. At time point 3 the second MRI/PET acquisition will take place.
      Finally, the visit of time-point 4 will be at four months after the last tDCS session,
      dedicated to a last application of language/semantic tasks.

      Selected number of subjects:

      80 SD patients selected in order to have 60 randomized into three arms (20 patients/arm).Two
      arms receiving active tDCS versus one receiving sham tDCS.

      20 healthy volunteers will be included (participants will provide normative language/semantic
      scores and MRI/PET measures; they will not undergotDCS).

      Number of centers: 3 centers in France (Paris)

      Research duration:

      Inclusion period: 36 months Participation period (Selection/inclusion, tDCS sessions and
      evaluation at 4 time-points): 4 months and 1 week to 4 months and 3 weeks Total duration: 41
      months
