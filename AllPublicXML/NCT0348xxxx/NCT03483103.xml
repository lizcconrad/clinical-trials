  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      lisocabtagene maraleucel (JCAR017) in adult subjects who have relapsed from, or are
      refractory to, a single line of immunochemotherapy for aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL) and are ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (based on age, performance
      status, and/or comorbidities). Subjects will receive treatment with lisocabtagene maraleucel
      and will be followed for 2 years for safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers, disease status,
      quality of life, and survival.

    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 is a validated quality of life measure applicable to subjects with any cancer diagnosis. It is composed of 30 items that address general physical symptoms, physical functioning, fatigue and malaise, and social and emotional functioning. Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher scores on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. A 10 point change in the scoring is considered to be a meaningful change in HRQoL.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). The VAS rating scale is a vertical 20 cm visual analogue scale with the end points labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom having numeric values of 100 and 0 respectively. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.</description>
