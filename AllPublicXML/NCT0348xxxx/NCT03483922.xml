  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer world-wide. It is particularly
      prevalent in Asia, and its occurrence is highest in areas where hepatitis B is prevalent,
      indicating a possible causal relationship. Follow up of high-risk populations such as chronic
      hepatitis patients and early diagnosis of transitions from chronic hepatitis to HCC would
      improve cure rates. In most cases HCC is detected late resulting in increased mortality and
      morbidity.

      The purpose of this study is to develop and test non-invasive biomarkers based on methylation
      changes in PBMC, T-cells and circulated tumor DNA in hepatocellular carcinomas patients.

    <description>We will develop the linear model and a threshold value differentiating breast cancer from control based on the 100 patient training set. The model will be provided to the researchers:
Methylation score=CG1*b1+CG2*b2+ CG3*b3 + e
CG1 is the methylation value of the first CG b1 is the regression coefficient for the first CG and e equals the intercept.
We will develop the regression coefficient and intercept as well as the DNA methylation values for each patient for each CG. We will first compute the polygenic methylation score for each patient. Then based on the computer threshold based on the training cohort will call the samples as liver cancer or not.</description>

    <description>Blood sample from patients with HCC, healthy individuals and individuals with hepatitis B will be collected, and DNA will extracted from PBMC and circulated tumor DNA will be subjected to bisulfite conversion. DNA from PBMC DNA will be analyzed with primers developed for the AHNAK-STAP1 genes. Plasma samples will be subjected to EZ direct DNA extraction and bisulfite conversion kit and will be amplified with primers developed to amplify the target regions. DNA will be used for the subsequent PCR amplification with specific primer to generate PCR amplicon for sequencing using a double PCR procedure. The product of PCR reaction will be subjected to indexed MiSeq Next-Generation sequencing that will allow us quantify DNA methylation level.</description>

        HCC staging will be diagnosed according to EASL-EORTC Clinical Practice Guidelines:
        Management of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patients will be divided into four groups,
        including Stage 0 (1) (n=100), stage A (2) (n=100), stage B (3) (n=100) and stage C+D (4)
        (n=100). As controls we will recruit chronic hepatitis B (n=100), which diagnose will be
        confirmed using AASLD practice guideline for chronic Hepatitis B, and healthy sex and age
        matched controls (n=100).
