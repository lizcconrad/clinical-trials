  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness and results of orthopedic patients
      having access to a cell phone App called HealthLoop to utilize during the postoperative time
      period, compared to patients who have the usual postoperative management. The researchers
      want to investigate whether there any differences in outcomes and satisfaction in patients
      and providers.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness and results of orthopedic patients
      having access to a cell phone App called HealthLoop to utilize during the postoperative time
      period, compared to patients who have the usual postoperative management. The researchers
      want to investigate whether there any differences in outcomes and satisfaction in patients
      and providers.

      HealthLoop is a mobile-device application (cell phone App) that allows physicians to monitor
      for signs and symptoms of potential adverse events, and communicate with patients during the
      postoperative recovery process. The platform enables doctors to identify patients at risk of
      decline in the follow up period. Patients are engaged through mobile and web-based surveys,
      reminders, and information personalized to the patient's specific condition or treatment
      plan. Alerts are sent to physicians about patients who are at risk of treatment failures,
      complications, or hospital readmissions. Physicians are informed if patients are trending
      toward an adverse outcome based on the patient's responses.

      Patients who choose to participate in this Research Study will be randomly assigned (like a
      flip of a coin) to one of two groups. Group A will receive standard, routine medical care.
      Group B will be asked to use the HealthLoop application on their mobile device during the
      post-operative period in addition to standard, routine medical care. Patients will not be
      able to choose which group they will be in.
