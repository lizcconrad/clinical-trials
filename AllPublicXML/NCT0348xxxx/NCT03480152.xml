      Background:

      Exome sequencing can identify certain gene mutations in a person s tumor. This can then be
      used to create cancer treatments. In this study, researchers will make a treatment called an
      mRNA vaccine. The vaccine might cause certain tumors to shrink.

      Objective:

      To see if the mRNA vaccine is safe and can cause metastatic melanoma or epithelial tumors to
      shrink.

      Eligibility:

      People 18 70 years old with metastatic melanoma or epithelial cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under protocol 99-C-0128.

      Participants will provide samples under protocol 03-C-0277:

      Participants will provide a piece of their tumor from a previous surgery or biopsy.

      Participants will have leukapheresis: Blood is removed through a needle in one arm and
      circulated through a machine that takes out the white blood cells. The blood is then returned
      through a needle in the other arm.

      Participants will have many tests:

      Scans and x-rays

      Heart and lung function tests

      Blood and urine tests

      Participants will receive the mRNA vaccine every 2 weeks for up to 8 weeks. They will get the
      vaccine as an injection into the upper arm or thigh. They may receive a second course of
      vaccines if the study doctor determines it is needed.

      Participants will have follow-up visits approximately 2 weeks after their final vaccine, then
      1 month later, then every 1 2 months for the first year, and then once a year for up to 5
      years. Each visit may take up to 2 days and include:

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Scans

      Leukapheresis at the first visit

      Background:

        -  Therapeutic vaccination against cancer has proven very challenging with little clinical
           benefit.

        -  Vaccines against non-viral tumors have mainly targeted differentiation antigens, cancer
           testis antigens, and overexpressed antigens. However negative selection in the thymus
           against these normal nonmutated antigens severely limits the ability to generate high
           avidity anti-cancer T cells. Such depletion can impair their antitumor activity and
           limit tumor elimination.

        -  The National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI SB) has developed a pipeline for the
           identification of immunogenic T cell epitopes derived from neoantigens.

        -  In recent studies, we identified the neoantigens recognized by TIL that mediated
           regression in patients with metastatic melanoma. Using whole exome sequencing of a
           resected metastatic nodule followed by high throughput immunologic screening, we were
           able to demonstrate that tumor regressions were associated with the recognition by the
           administered TIL of unique somatic mutations that occurred in the cancer.

        -  We also found that TILs from 29 of 32 patients with a wide variety of metastatic
           gastrointestinal cancers contained lymphocytes that recognized unique mutations
           presented in that patient s cancer.

        -  We, therefore, aim to use this pipeline to identify immunogenic neoantigens and to
           predict for neoantigens binding the patient HLA molecules from melanoma or epithelial
           cancer patients and to use these epitopes for a personalized therapeutic messenger RNA
           (mRNA) vaccine.

      Objectives

      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the clinical response rate in patients with metastatic melanoma,
           gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers who receive NCI-4650

        -  To determine the safety of NCI-4650 in patients with metastatic melanoma,
           gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers

      Eligibility

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary cancers refractory to
           standard of care treatment

        -  Metastatic cancer lesions suitable for surgical resection to perform whole exome
           sequencing and preparation of TIL

      Design:

        -  Patients with metastatic cancer will undergo surgical resection of tumor followed by
           exome and RNA sequencing to identify expressed mutations (conducted under the NCI SB
           companion protocol 03-C-0277).

        -  Immunogenic neoantigens will be identified from TIL by high throughput immunologic
           screening using long peptides and tandem minigenes covering all mutated epitopes.

        -  Up to 15 predicted neoantigens will be selected based on exome and RNA sequencing and
           their binding affinity to the patient HLA molecules.

        -  mRNA vaccine will be manufactured and supplied as cGMP product by Moderna Therapeutics,
           Inc.

        -  The patient will be vaccinated with mRNA containing epitopes from immunogenic
           neoantigens, predicted neoantigens and mutations in tumor suppressor or driver genes.

        -  mRNA vaccine will be administered intramuscularly (IM) for four cycles every two weeks.
           A patient may receive a second course for a total of eight cycles given.

        -  Blood samples will be taken every two weeks (during vaccination period) and at each
           follow up visit, and patients will be monitored for the quantity and quality of
           circulating neoantigen-specific T cells.

                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
