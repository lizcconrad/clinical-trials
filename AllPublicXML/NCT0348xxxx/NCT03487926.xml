    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor microglial activation in participants with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and investigate the relationship that exists between these
      patients and their risk of acquiring major depressive episodes (MDE). Patients with both IBD
      and MDE will be subsequently approached to participate in the study.

      Detailed Description:

      Participants may undergo up to 3 PET Scans : [18F]FEPPA PET (for TSPO) before and 3 to 6
      months later and [11C]SL25.1188 PET (for MAO-B) as well as 1 MRI scan.

      The primary hypothesis is that :

        1. The neuroinflammation (TSPO VT) will be increased in PFC, ACC, and insula regions in
           those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients compared to healthy people.

        2. The neuroinflammation (TSPO VT) in PFC, ACC, and insula regions will be reduced after
           treatment for IBD.

      The Secondary Hypothesis:

        1. Elevations in neuroinflammation (TSPO VT) will be similar in those with ulcerative
           colitis and Crohn's disease.

        2. Neuroinflammation (TSPO VT) will be greater in IBD with depression than in depression
           without IBD.

        3. Biologics (TNFalpha antibody treatments), and fecal transplantation will be associated
           with greater reduction in neuroinflammation in brain than
           Sulfasalazine/5-Aminosalicylates.

        4. MAO-B VT will be elevated in in the PFC, ACC, and insula in IBD compared to healthy
           controls.

      There will be no alterations to standard care of patients due to participation in the study.
