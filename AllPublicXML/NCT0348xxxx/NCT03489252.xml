  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies remote activity monitored by Fitbit Charge 2 in investigating daily
      step and sleep data in participants with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation
      therapy. A wearable remote activity tracking device, such as the Fitbit Charge 2, may help to
      detect early signs of treatment or disease-related symptoms, improve quality of life,
      decrease emergency room visits, and decrease hospitalizations in participants with head and
      neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine compliance with remote activity monitoring (RAM) in patients receiving
      radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for head and neck cancer (HNC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate feasibility of recruitment to the Remote Activity Monitoring Pilot (RAMP).

      II. Investigate patient acceptability of RAM. III. Evaluate compliance with electronic
      patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in this patient population.

      IV. Estimate the change in average daily steps associated with a one-unit change in health
      score as collected on ePRO analysis (analyze associations between RAM data and ePROs).

      V. Investigate correlations among step data, quality of life (QOL), and emergency room (ER)
      visits/hospitalizations.

    <description>Daily compliance with remote activity monitoring (RAM) will be defined as wearing the device for 19/24 hours daily (80% daily use). Overall study period compliance will be defined as usage of the device for at least 70% of the days under observation where it should have been worn. The overall study period compliance rate along with a one-sided exact 95% confidence interval will be estimated.</description>
