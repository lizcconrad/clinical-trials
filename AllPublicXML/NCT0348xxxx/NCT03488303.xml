    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of signals recorded and analysed
      with VenticaÂ® LFTS in infants and preschoolers during acute airway obstruction/asthma
      exacerbation and recovery thereof for changes in the IP-derived TBFV curves within and
      between nights.
