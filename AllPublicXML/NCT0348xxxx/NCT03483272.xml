  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HRS is divided into two types. A chronic kidney failure (HRS-2), which is predominantly
      related to end-stage disease and a more acute kidney failure (HRS-AKI). HRS-AKI is
      potentially reversible and develops subsequent to aggravation of a systemic circulatory
      vasodilatation, that triggers renal vasoconstriction and deteriorates renal perfusion and
      function. The albumin and terlipressin response is evaluated clinically, routinely for a week
      and reduces mortality with 23% compared to no treatment. Only 40-50% of the patients with
      HRS-AKI respond to the treatment with terlipressin.

      The treatment of hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-AKI) is aimed at improving blood flow to
      the kidneys. Flow changes associated to development of HRS have only sparsely been studied
      and not previously by MR technique and no previous studies have evaluated changes in flow
      induced by terlipressin. It has been hypothesized that development of HRS is associated to a
      deterioration in heart function with development of cardiomyopathy, which together with renal
      vasoconstriction leads to renal failure. Simultaneous MR-assessments of cardiac function and
      flows (especially the renal flow) in HRS-AKI have not previously been performed.

      The aim of the project is to develop new, fast and non-invasive methods to evaluate
      hemodynamic changes and individual pharmacological terlipressin response in patients with
      acute hepatorenal syndrome (type HRS-AKI)

      We expect a higher increase in renal blood flow in terlipressin-responders compared to
      terlipressin-non-responders and non-responders will generally have a lower basic renal flow
      and a decreased cardiac output.

      Study design and patients The study design is experimental and includes 30 cirrhotic patients
      with HRS-AKI. Patients with HRS-AKI are MR scanned before and 17 minutes after their first
      dose of terlipressin. ECHO is performed before first dose of Terlipressin and is repeated
      after one of the first doses of terlipressin. Clinically efficacy is defined in accordance to
      international guidelines at day-7 and 90 days mortality is registered. The screening period
      and treatments follow international and national guidelines for acute renal failure in
      patients with cirrhosis.
