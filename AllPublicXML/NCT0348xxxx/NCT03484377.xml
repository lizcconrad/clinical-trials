  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use concurrent Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG) with measures of impulsivity to examine the neurobiological
      underpinnings of rapid response impulsivity (RRI) and how these can be modified using tDCS in
      healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent tDCS-MEG parallel arms single-blinded experimental design (right anodal v sham
      tDCS) will be employed in this study. The study will be conducted at the University of
      Nottingham, using a sample of student volunteers. This study aims to examine the influence of
      anodal tDCS on beta-band and alpha-band oscillatory activities, using an anti-saccade task
      administered before, during and after tDCS stimulation. It can potentially help understand
      the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning rapid response impulsivity and how these can be
      influenced by tDCS.

      The research hypotheses are that (i) a generalised mechanism for top-down inhibitory control
      will play a vital role, whereby prefrontal beta-band activity initiates alpha-band activity
      for functional inhibition over the frontal eye fields and other areas in the neurocircuitry
      involved in RRI; (ii) anodal tDCS (as opposed to sham) delivered over the right DLPFC will
      enhance this mechanism; and (iii) there will be no significant correlations between measures
      of self-report impulsivity and performance on the anti-saccade task and measures of
      oscillatory activity.
