  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Human Cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) vaccine V160 administered in a 2-dose or 3-dose regimen in healthy seronegative women
      16 to 35 years of age. Participants will receive blinded V160 on Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6
      (3-dose regimen), V160 on Day 1 and Month 6 and placebo at Month 2 (2-dose regimen), or
      placebo on Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6, and will be followed to approximately Month 36. The
      primary hypothesis of the study is that administration of a 3-dose regimen of V160 will
      reduce the incidence of primary CMV infection compared to placebo.
