    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, single arm, multi-center clinical study in China. The primary
      objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the PERCEVAL S
      heart valve when used to replace a diseased native or malfunctioning prosthetic aortic valve
      in the indicated Chinese population for tissue heart valve replacement and suitable to the
      PERCEVAL S valve.

      The secondary objectives are to collect all relevant device and subject demographics,
      procedural and hospital discharge, short and long-term data, as described in the secondary
      endpoints section.

    <description>The PERCEVAL S heart valve (PERCEVAL S valve) is a bioprosthesis manufactured with bovine pericardium and assembled on a Nitinol stent. The PERCEVAL S valve is designed to offer an alternative to surgically implanted flexible prostheses (stented and stentless biological valves). A special feature of the device is that it is self-anchoring and does not require sutures to be fixed to the implant site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject of age &gt; 60 years.

          2. Subject with aortic valve stenosis or steno-insufficiency.

          3. Subject has signed the informed consent.

          4. Subject in which preoperative evaluation is indicated for the need of native or
             prosthetic aortic valve replacement via open heart surgery

          5. Subject is located in a geographic location that will enable the subject to return to
             the study site for follow-up examinations (i.e. geographically stable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has preexisting valve prosthesis or annuloplasty rings in the mitral, pulmonic
             or tricuspid position.

          2. Subject requires a double or multiple valve replacement or repair of the mitral,
             tricuspid, or pulmonic valve.

          3. Subject requiring simultaneous cardiac procedures, apart from septal myectomy and/or
             coronary by-pass graft (CABG).

          4. Subject has active endocarditis.

          5. Subject has active myocarditis

          6. Subject has aneurysmal dilation or dissection of the ascending aortic wall.

          7. Subject is drug abuser, alcohol abuser, prison inmate, institutionalized, or is unable
             to give informed consent.

          8. Subject has a major or progressive non-cardiac disease that, in the investigator's
             experience, results in a life expectancy of less than 1 year, or the implant of the
             device produces an unacceptable increased risk to the subject.

          9. Subject with known hypersensitivity to nickel alloys.

         10. Subject is undergoing renal dialysis for chronic renal failure or has
             hyperparathyroidism.

         11. Subject has had an acute preoperative neurological deficit, myocardial infarction, or
             cardiac event that has not returned to baseline or stabilized for â‰¥30 days prior to
             the planned valve implant surgery.

         12. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to complete the study.

         13. Subject with an aortic root enlargement, where the ratio between the diameter of the
             STJ and the annulus diameter, assessed by TEE, is &gt; 1.3. Or for other anatomical
             reasons that not suitable for PERCEVAL S per IB.
