  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The findings of previous experiments suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) has
      been linked to anti-hyperlipidemia, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.This is a
      randomized double-blind trial, aims to study the effect of PUFAs on blood lipids and human
      metabolism. Firstly, the investigators will investigate the efficacy of mixed plant
      oil(echium oil, camelina oil, safflower oil) and pure echium oil on improving the levels of
      blood lipids. Secondly, next generation sequencing (NGS), ultra-high performance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry detection will be conducted to explore the role of PUFAs on gut microbiota as
      well as metabolites. Thirdly, single nucleotide polymorphism will be genotyped by
      Time-of-flight mass spectrometry to find the gene-environment interaction effect.

    <masking_description>The all details of groups assignment are arranged and controlled by the research designers. The color, shape, and external packaging of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid and placebo are consistent (faint yellow to yellow oil in transparent soft capsules). Each bottle of capsules will be marked with the name (or identify number) of the participants by research designers. Thus, the grouping of participants is blind to the rest of the researchers (like outcomes assessors).</masking_description>
