      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of moderate to severe IBD
      participants with active disease at Day 1.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, and non-interventional study of participants with
      IBD. The study will have a cross-sectional evaluation on Day 1 to provide the real-world data
      of disease activity, treatment patterns, burden of disease and quality of life in
      participants with moderate to severe CD or UC.

      The study will involve an additional retrospective review of medical charts of participants
      of previous 3 years to describe the IBD treatments and use of other healthcare resources
      related with management of IBD.

      The study will enroll approximately 246 participants. All participants will be enrolled in
      one observational cohort.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina. The overall time for data collection
      in the study will be approximately 3 years before the start of the study (Day 1).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Active Crohn's Disease (CD) at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with active CD were observed, where active CD is defined as Harvey Bradshaw index (HBI) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 8 or Crohn's disease active index (CDAI) &gt;= 220 to total CD participants multiplied by 100. CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs and symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general wellbeing, presence of comorbid conditions, use of antidiarrheal, physical examination and laboratory findings. Total score ranges from 0 to 600 points. Higher score indicates more severe disease. HBI consists of 5 clinical parameters: general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass, and complications. Total score is sum of individual parameters. Score ranges from a minimum score of 0 to no pre-specified maximum score as it depends on number of liquid stools, where higher scores indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Active Ulcerative Colitis (UC) at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with active UC will be calculated as the ratio of UC participants with Mayo score &gt;=5 to the total UC participants multiplied by 100. Mayo score is an instrument used to measure disease activity. It consists of 3 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician global assessment of disease severity, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score of 5-dimensional EuroQoL Measure (EQ-5D) in CD or UC Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>From initial diagnosis until date of data collection (approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, that is, mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five possible levels: 1 (no problems); 2 (slight problems); 3 (moderate problems); 4 (severe problems), and; 5 (extreme problems). EQ-5D also include an additional visual analogic scale (EQ-VAS), which ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates worst imaginable health state and 100 is best imaginable health state.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score of Different Components of 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) in CD or UC Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>From initial diagnosis until date of data collection (approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 evaluates 8 health dimensions: physical functioning, bodily pain, role physical (limitations due to physical problems), role emotional (limitations due to personal or emotional problems), mental health, social functioning, vitality, and general health perceptions. Based on these 8 scales, two weighted scores are generated: the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) score. Scores range between 0 and 100, where higher scores indicates a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Mean Total Score of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initial diagnosis until date of data collection (approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire that measures 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function. Within dimensions, each question presents seven possible answers/points. Each domain score is the sum of 8 responses each ranging from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates worst function and 7 the best. The sub-score ranges from 8 to 56 and thus the total score ranges from 32 to 224, where higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Mean Total Percentage of Work Impairment by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initial diagnosis until date of data collection (approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI assess the impact of IBD on work productivity and daily activities during the previous 7 days. The WPAI includes 6 questions: 1 (if currently employed); 2 (hours missed due to disease); 3 (hours missed other reasons); 4 (hours actually worked); 5 (degree disease affected productivity while working); 6 (degree disease affected regular activities). WPAI generates four component scores: percentage of work time missed (absenteeism); percentage of impairment while working (presentisms); percentage of overall work impairment (absenteeism and presentisms combined); and percentage of activity impairment. Unemployed participants only answer questions related to employment status and activity impairment. Scores for WPAI range from 0% to 100%, where 0 % indicates no impairment and 100% is total loss of work productivity/activity.</description>
