  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the combination of a drug called atezolizumab and a radiation
      procedure called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a possible treatment for triple-negative
      breast cancer that has spread to the brain.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Atezolizumab

        -  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved atezolizumab for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Atezolizumab is a protein that affects the immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway. The
      PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but tumors can interrupt this
      pathway and partially resist or escape the immune system. By blocking the PD-L1 pathway,
      Atezolizumab may help the immune system identify and catch tumor cells.

      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a standard procedure used to treat patients with cancer in
      the brain. SRS uses many precisely focused radiation beams to treat tumors. It is not surgery
      in the traditional sense because there's no incision. Instead, SRS uses 3-D imaging to target
      high doses of radiation to the affected area with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy
      tissue. Like other forms of radiation, SRS works by damaging the DNA of the targeted (tumor)
      cells. The affected cells then lose the ability to reproduce, which causes tumors to shrink.

      When given separately, atezolizumab and SRS, work in different ways to help stop cancer cells
      from growing and spreading. However, it is not known if giving atezolizumab and SRS at the
      same time will have a better effect than giving each treatment on its own. It is hoped that
      SRS treatment will damage cancer cells and make them more visible to the immune system.

      The researchers conducting this study are testing to see whether giving SRS with atezolizumab
      may boost the body's immune response to cancer, and therefore improve upon the effects of
      either SRS or atezolizumab given alone.

      In this research study, the investigators will measure the length of time that the
      participant receive this study intervention without the disease getting worse. The
      investigators will also look at how well the disease responds to atezolizumab and SRS as well
      as the safety of the combination.

               -  Participants must have discontinued systemic therapy at least 14 days prior to
                  initiating protocol therapy.

               -  There is no limit to the number of prior lines of systemic therapy. Participants
                  who have not received any systemic therapy for metastatic disease are also

             brain progression is amenable to SRS treatment.

          -  Resolution of all chemotherapy-related or radiation-related toxicities to Grade 1
             severity or lower, except for stable sensory neuropathy (≤ Grade 2 allowed) and

          -  Stable dose of dexamethasone 2mg or less for at least 7 days prior to initiation of
             treatment

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/μl

               -  platelets ≥75,000/μl

               -  hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL

               -  total bilirubin ≤1.5mg/dL (≤2.0 in patients with known Gilberts syndrome)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN. ≤5.0 × institutional ULN for
                  patients with documented liver metastases.

               -  albumin &gt;2.5mg/dL

               -  serum creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL or calculated GFR ≥60 mL/min

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 8 days of initiating protocol therapy.

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate
             of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last
             dose of study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she
             is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male
             sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit
             ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.
             The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. The effects of atezolizumab on
             the developing human fetus are unknown and radiotherapy has known teratogenic effects
             so women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation and 4 months after completion of atezolizumab
             administration.

          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed
             the informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CNS complications for whom urgent neurosurgical intervention is indicated (e.g.,
             resection, shunt placement).

          -  Known leptomeningeal or brainstem metastases. The presence of leptomeningeal
             enhancement alone, without associated clinical manifestations and/or positive CSF
             cytology, will not be constituted as known leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroids defined as dexamethasone &gt;2mg/day or
             bioequivalent within 7 days of initiating therapy.

          -  Patients unable to undergo gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI or receive IV contrast for
             any reason (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme
             obesity, hypersensitity).

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Previous treatment with any anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 agent.

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic
             composition to atezolizumab or any constituent of the product

          -  The participant has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited
             to uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association Class III or IV,
             active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months,
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric or duodenal ulceration diagnosed within the
             previous 6 months, severe malnutrition or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or
             on any other form of immunosuppressive medication. For example, patients with
             autoimmune disease that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppression agents should
             be excluded. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis that requires treatment with
             steroids.

          -  Has a history of interstitial lung disease.

          -  The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy
             are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             atezolizumab.

          -  Individuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the principal
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  The participant is pregnant or breast-feeding.
