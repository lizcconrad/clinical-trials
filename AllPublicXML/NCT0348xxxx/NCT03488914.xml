  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct an effectiveness trial of the 4-session evidence-based YMHP
      intervention for YMSM of color ages 15-29 at two CBOs in New York City, compared to usual
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a comparative effectiveness trial (CET) with two intensities of treatment to
      be offered following field-based HIV counseling and testing (C&amp;T) - the YMHP intervention and
      an enhanced &quot;treatment as usual&quot; (eTAU) condition involving HIV prevention services provided
      at two community based organizations (CBOs) to test their relative effectiveness in reducing
      substance use and sexual risk behavior among HIV-negative MYMSM. In collaboration with two
      CBOs, our goals are to better understand substance use and sexual health-related outcomes
      among HIV-negative MYMSM who are unlikely to be treatment seeking and to implement the YMHP
      intervention in a way that will maximize portability and scalability. Working together with
      our collaborators will help to address practical problems at the frontline of service
      provision to pave the way for a comprehensive program to reduce substance use and HIV
      infection among MYMSM.
