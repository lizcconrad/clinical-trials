  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the feasibility and impact of integrated
      psychological care in outpatient gynecologic oncology clinics with the goal of creating a new
      standard of care. The investigators propose an intervention study comparing patient-centered
      outcomes (assessed by surveys) between women who receive usual care versus integrated
      psychological care. The investigators' objectives are to learn about the process of
      integration of psychological care directly into outpatient gynecologic oncology clinics and
      the impact of such integration on patients' well-being, presentation of symptoms,
      psychological functioning, coping mechanisms, awareness of support services offered, and
      perception of quality of care. As this is a feasibility study, aims are focused on assessing
      patient willingness for psychological intervention in the medical office, provider
      willingness to have psychologist present in clinic, and impact of psychological intervention.
      With such data to warrant further integration and time of psychologists in medical clinics,
      next steps for immediate and long-term projects may include focus on high risk populations,
      specific disease sites, additional provider clinics, more psychologist time spent in
      gynecological oncology clinics, and effectiveness of interventions with higher power. The
      investigators hope the results will serve as preliminary data for an integrated psychosocial
      care model that can be implemented in other oncology clinics.

    <description>PROMIS Depression &amp; Anxiety - asks participant in the last 7 days if they have felt worthless, helpless, depressed, hopeless, fearful, lack of focus, worrying, and uneasy. Check box choices are never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always
