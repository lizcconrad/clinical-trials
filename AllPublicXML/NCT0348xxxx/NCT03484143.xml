  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The active Neuro RX Gamma device uses non-invasive near-infrared energy delivered to the
      brain with the intention to improve cognitive functioning and quality of life in patients
      with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease. Treatment will occur at home-based treatment
      sessions with the device.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A potential participant will undergo pre-screening and screening assessments to assess
      eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will undergo a baseline visit in which they
      will be randomized to either active or sham Neuro RX Gamma device.

      The Vielight Neuro RX Gamma is a non-invasive device that administers low-energy
      near-infrared LED light to the brain transcranially and intranasally.

      There are two treatment phases in the trial, each with a duration of 12 weeks. The patient
      along with the caregiver will perform home (or living facility) - based treatments with the
      device and document the sessions in a patient diary. The device will be applied to the
      patient participant by a dedicated caregiver for a 20 minute daily session, 6 days a week for
      a total of 12 weeks. The study participant and caregiver will be required to return to the
      clinic for follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 weeks post randomization, between treatment
      phases.

      228 patients will be enrolled across 8 sites in Canada and the United States.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12 and Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes. It includes measures of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

    <description>The QOL-AD is a series of questions designed to be administered to individuals with dementia, to obtain a rating of a patient's quality of life from both the patient and the caregiver. It includes assessments of the individual's relationship with friends and family, concerns about finances, physical condition, mood, and an overall assessment of life quality. There are 13 items with a score range from 13 to 52.</description>

          3. Stable dosage of AD medication for 24 weeks prior to trial enrolment with no changes
             anticipated for the duration of the trial.

          4. Age 50 and older at the time of enrolment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a relevant abnormality other than Alzheimer's disease on MRI or CT scan
             obtained within previous 24 months of enrolment into the trial, as listed below:

               1. Single hemorrhage or infarct with longest diameter of more than 1.5 cm
                  irrespective of the location

               2. Detection of 2 or more subcortical lacunar infarcts of less than 1.5 cm in
                  diameter (small cortical infarcts of less than 1.5 cm in diameter are acceptable)

               3. Any hemorrhage or infarct in the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (including
                  dorso-medial nucleus)

               4. Space-occupying lesions compressing or compromising brain structures. (Note small

             If any hemorrhage or infarct is detected on an MRI or CT scan older than 1 year, and
             the hemorrhage or infarct does not per se lead to exclusion of the patient, an MRI or
             CT scan has to be repeated before definite inclusion.

             medication.

          6. History of epistaxis or currently taking major anti-coagulants, such as warfarin.

          7. Increased skin sensitivity at the treatment site including active herpes simplex in
             the treatment area, history of keloid formation, or history of retinoid use in the
             past month.

          8. Pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant.

          9. Currently undergoing light therapy treatment.

         10. Current participation in another interventional clinical trial.

         11. Any reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, might place a participant at
             unacceptable risk for participation in the trial.
