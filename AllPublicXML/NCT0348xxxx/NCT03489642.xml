    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Changes will be measured using the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS). The tool is composed of two sections - (a) amount of physical activity/exercise performed during a typical week in the past month and (b) activities performed in the past month. The final index score is the sum of five individual indices (vigorous, leisurely walking, moving, standing and sitting). Scores on the scale range from 0 to 137. The higher the score the more active a person.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) will be used to measure the health status of the subjects. The test has eight questions. Each question has a range from 0-5. The total score for the test ranges from 0 to 40. The higher the score the more severe a person's COPD.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to physical activity requirements</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
