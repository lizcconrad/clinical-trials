    <textblock>
      To provide a fine-grained description of the brain network dysfunctions induced by severe
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) or anoxic encephalopathy, that are responsible for the acute
      state of unarousable unawareness, named coma, this trial wants to explore the usefulness in
      this setting of a combined neuroimaging approaches encompassing several up-to-date techniques
      as structural MRI, fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET) scan (neuroinflammation
      ligands).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      So far, the gold standard for neuroprognostication of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) or
      anoxic encephalopathy is the bedside behavioural evaluation. Nevertheless, the predictive
      value of such an exclusive clinical approach has been consistently reported as limited and
      insufficient in this challenging clinical setting. Recent theoretical and experimental data
      converge towards the idea of the critical implication of long-range brain connection in
      consciousness access and maintain. Nevertheless, previous studies have focused on the
      specific analysis of some targeted connections (regions of interest), and have used
      exclusively a single approach in neuroimaging (structural or functional imaging), with no
      interest in the neuro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms likely associated with
      these disconnection phenomena. So, cerebral disconnection characterization at the level of
      the whole brain, at different stages of pathological abolition of consciousness must be made,
      on an anatomical, functional and metabolic scale. This descriptive study represents a first
      step in the identification of relevant multimodal imaging biomarkers. This will then lead to
      a larger study to identify the prognostic impact of these different biomarkers obtained in
      the acute phase of patient management.

    <description>The Glasgow Coma Scale is divided into three components : ocular response (assessment 1-4 points), motor response (assessment 1-6 points) verbal response (evaluation of 1-5 points).
Scores for each component are added together to get the total that will range between a minimum of 3 points (which corresponds to a patient who does not open his eyes and no motor response to stimulation or verbal response) and a maximum value of 15 points (corresponding to a patient with open eyes, obeying orders and maintaining a consistent language).
It has been considered that the GCS score between 15 and 13 points corresponds to a slight alteration of consciousness, a score of 12-9 points with moderate impairment and 8 points or less with a serious deterioration in level of consciousness.</description>

    <measure>Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months +/- 3 days after the primary brain insult</time_frame>
    <description>The Coma Recovery Scale Revised is divided into three components : return to consciousness (RECUP), vegetative neurological state (ENV) or minimal state of consciousness (ECM).
This scale has been validated in French, with a value of Cronbach's Alpha estimated at 0.8.
It is a score whose values are between 100 (normal level of consciousness) and 10 (coma). ENV and ECM have intermediate values (approximately 30 and 60, respectively).</description>
