      This is a registry database. Consented subjects will have their medical data collected via a
      patient questionnaire in either paper or web based application form. Data will be collected
      prospectively and retrospectively and will be entered into the database generated by Memorial
      Bone and Joint Research Foundation. Collection of data will start during the initial clinic
      visit as part of standard of care. Subjects will be asked to fill out a 4-page &quot;pre-operative
      hip questionnaire&quot; or &quot;pre-operative knee questionnaire&quot;, which includes questions for
      self-assessment from the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Knee
      disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), EQ-5D and University of California, Los
      Angeles Activity (UCLA) questionnaires. Demographic, intra-operative and additional data will
      also be collected to correctly identify the subject's specific disease process and treatment
      plan. Subjects will be asked to fill out a post-operative hip and knee questionnaire that is
      similar to the pre-operative questionnaire to evaluate the improvement in their clinical
      outcomes. The subjects will be requested to complete the post-operative questionnaires at 6
      months and annually thereafter.

    <description>The purpose of this study is to follow the patient's short term and long term clinical outcome after undergoing knee replacement surgery.
These clinical outcomes will be assessed by using the KSS along with the KOOS survey for knee replacement cases. The scores obtained at each time point will be compared to the baseline. Therefore the outcome is the change of scores over time.</description>
