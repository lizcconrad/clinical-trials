  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A myriad of sexual problems affect men and women with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including
      decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Menstrual
      abnormalities are common in CKD and many women are an-ovulatory.

      Sexual dysfunction in CKD is multifactorial including hormonal alterations along with
      vascular, neurologic, psychogenic, and other factors, such as medications, contribute to the
      development of sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction in females is mainly due to hormonal
      factors and manifests mainly as menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea, lack of vaginal
      lubrication, and failure to conceive.

      The study will be conducted on 100 female patients divided in to two equal group:

        1. Group A: The patient group include 50 female patients with chronic renal failure (eGFR
           &lt;15ml/min/1.7m2 )

        2. Group B: The control group including 50 healthy females age matched with the patient
           group.

      The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) will be used to assess sexual function. This index
      includes 19 questions related to 6 parameters: sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication,
      orgasm, sexual satisfaction and dyspareunia. A face-to-face inter-view with each participant
      in which the FSFI questions will be verbally asked and answered and compare between both
      groups in sexual activity and effect of chronic kidney disease on sexuality.

      Duration of chronic kidney disease, duration of dialysis ,number of sessions of dialysis per
      week, medical treatment, haemoglobin,creatinine level will be fulfilled.
