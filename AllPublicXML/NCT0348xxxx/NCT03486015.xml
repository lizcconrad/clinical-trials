      This study evaluates the pain relieving effect of oral glucose during hip examinations on
      healthy, fullterm infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All healthy, fullterm infants undergoes a medical examination after birth where 21 different
      components are assessed. One of the components is the hip examination which appears to be
      painful. Since painful experiences early in life can cause longterm negative effects it is
      important to treat pain during painful procedures.

      One hundred healthy, fullterm infants were randomized to either glucose or sterile water
      orally before the routine medical examination before discharge from the maternity ward.

    <measure>Pain will be measured with ALPS-Neo (Astrid Lindgren and Lund children's hospitals pain and stress assessment scale for preterm and sick newborn infants, range 0-10 where higher number means a higher intensity of rated pain) by a nurse</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment is made by the nurse when the physician starts with the hip examination, approximately 60 seconds after the study solution has been given.</time_frame>

    <measure>Pain will be measured by VAS (Visual analogue scale, range 0-10 where higher number means a higher intensity of rated pain) assessed by physician</measure>
    <time_frame>The physician will make the VAS assessment directly after the physical examination is done, approximately 10 minutes after the study solution has been given.</time_frame>

    <measure>Crying time during hip examination</measure>
