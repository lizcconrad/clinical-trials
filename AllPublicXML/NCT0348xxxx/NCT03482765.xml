  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the current study, the primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of IP on abdominal pain.

      The secondary outcome is to assess the effect of IP on IBS-Symptom Severity, IBS-related
      quality of life, stool form and consistency and on mental status.

      Thus providing an effective objective in improving the gut health and symptomatic relief in
      IBS patients.

      This study aims to determine the effect of probiotics, as the investigational products (IPs)
      in subjects satisfying the Rome IV criteria for IBS. Three hundred and sixty six subjects
      between 18 to 70 years of age and with a positive diagnosis of Rome IV IBS criteria (IBS-C,
      D, M and U types) and moderate to severe abdominal pain intensity will be recruited in a
      multi-center, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled randomized trial.
