  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of haemodynamic changes is still challenging in clinically relevant situations
      (e.g. in bleeding, septic and postoperative patients) with the conventional monitoring
      routinely used including heart rate and mean arterial pressure. If the arterial pressure
      drops and the heart increases, the haemodynamic state is already decompensated and a therapy
      is at risk being indicated too late.

      Prior to decompensation - still in the state of compensated shock - it would be desirable to
      detect the shock already. The compensated shock is characterized by an occult drop of cardiac
      output and a hypoperfusion of vital organs like e.g. the splanchnic region. Due to these
      pathophysiological characteristics, a therapy would be indicated already in this stadium of
      shock progression.

      The available monitoring tools to detect compensated shock are on the one hand side invasive
      (intravascular catheter), cost-intensive (cost of the catheter systems), or need extensive
      training (echocardiography). Consequently, the implementation of advanced haemodynamic
      monitoring is still low despite the high clinical relevance for the patients.

      It is the goal of this project to evaluate in healthy volunteers the routinely implemented
      technology of photo-plethysmography in its ability to detect haemodynamic changes by extended
      signal analysis of the pulse-contour and the pulse-wave-transit-times in relation to the
      gold-standard echocardiography.

      Secondary goal of this study is to analyse the physiological and haemodynamic changes during
      progressive central hypovolaemia displayed by non-invasive or minimal-invasive monitoring
      devices and associate the changes to each other.
