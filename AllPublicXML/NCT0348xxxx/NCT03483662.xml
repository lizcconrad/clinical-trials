      The IMPACTS study utilizes an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 design to achieve
      two primary goals simultaneously: 1). to test the effectiveness of a multifaceted
      implementation strategy for intensive BP control among underserved hypertensive patients at
      high risk for CVD, and 2). to assess the acceptability, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and
      sustainability of the multifaceted implementation strategy in patients, providers, and
      healthcare systems.

    <textblock>
      Recently, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that more
      intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment (target systolic BP&lt;120 mm Hg) reduced major
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) by about 25% and all-cause mortality by about 27% compared to
      standard BP treatment (target systolic BP&lt;140 mm Hg) among hypertensive patients aged ≥50
      years. SPRINT clearly answered the question - Will lowering BP more than the currently
      recommended goal further reduce the risk of CVD and mortality? The next important question is
      how to implement a more intensive BP treatment program in real-world clinical practice,
      especially in underserved patients. The IMPACTS trial is an effectiveness-implementation
      hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention
      program for more intensive BP treatment and the feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of
      implementing the program in underserved patients with hypertension in Louisiana, Alabama, and
      Mississippi. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research has been used to guide
      the development of the multicomponent intervention, including dissemination of SPRINT study
      findings among patients, providers and policymakers; team-based collaborative care using a
      stepped-care protocol adapted from the SPRINT intensive-treatment algorithm, BP audit and
      feedback, and home BP monitoring; and health coaching on antihypertensive medication
      adherence and lifestyle modification. The investigators will collaborate with 36 federally
      qualified health center clinics that serve low-income populations in Louisiana, Alabama, and
      Mississippi to recruit 1,260 trial participants and conduct the IMPACTS trial. The primary
      clinical outcome is the difference in mean change of systolic BP from baseline to 18 months.
      The fidelity of the intervention, measured by intensification of treatment by providers and
      adherence to medications in patients, will be the primary implementation outcome. This study
      will generate urgently needed data on effective, adoptable, and sustainable intervention
      strategies aimed at eliminating health disparities and reducing the BP-related disease burden
      in underserved populations in the US.
