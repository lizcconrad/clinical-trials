      Rationale:

      Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) mutations (del19 or L858R) show an impressive progression-free survival
      between 9 and 11 months when treated with gefitinib. Combination of gefitinib and berberine
      could improve efficacy in lung cancer with EGFR mutation in vivo and vitro. The investigators
      hypothesize that progression-free survival could be improved by combination of gefitinib and
      berberine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strong lipogenic activity and high expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1
      (SREBP-1) were found in gefitinib-resistance NSCLC cells. Berberine, an effective suppressor
      of SREBP1 and lipogenesis regulated through ROS/AMPK pathway, selectively inhibited the
      growth of gefitinib-resistance NSCLC cells but not that of normal cells. It effectively
      caused mitochondrial dysfunction, activated reactive oxygen species (ROS)/AMPK pathway and
      finally suppressed cellular lipogenesis and cell proliferation. Addition of ROS blocker, AMPK
      inhibitor and palmitic acid significantly reduced the effect of Berberine. In in vivo study,
      treatment of Berberine led to significant inhibition of mouse tumor xenograft growth.
