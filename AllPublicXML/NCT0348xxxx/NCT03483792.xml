  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of ovulation disorders and affects
      10 to 15% of women. Despite its frequency, its physiopathology remains unknown.

      In women, Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is secreted by granulosa cells located in the ovaries
      within the follicles. Compared to control women, serum AMH level is higher in PCOS women and
      could play a role in its pathophysiology. The severity of the PCOS phenotype is correlated
      with the production of AMH.

      It is currently described in the literature that daughters of women with PCOS have a 50% risk
      of developing PCOS, but no genetic cause of transmission is known. In mice (article in
      press), pregnant females injected with AMH give birth to offspring with PCOS symptoms. The
      AMH could thus also play a role in the heritability of PCOS in women. Our team demonstrated
      that AMH, in its active cleaved form, had a direct central action on the hypothalamus by
      increasing the pulsatility of GnRH, inducing LH hypersecretion. The hypothesis is that AMH
      remains higher in pregnant women with PCOS and may affect the fetus by altering fetal and
      maternal hypothalamic secretions or by modifying placental steroid production.

      Leptin has a role in reproduction, through its receptors located at the central
      (hypothalamus) and peripheral (granulosa cells) levels. In excessively high serum
      concentration, as observed in obesity, it would lead to a dysregulation of GnRH secretion, an
      alteration of ovarian steroidogenesis and a dysregulation of folliculogenesis.

      Will be compare leptin levels in first trimester patients with and without PCOS to look for
      possible correlations between AMH and leptin and eliminate possible bias.

        Patients having a pre-conceptionnal infertility assessment in the gynecology-Endocrinology
        department of the CHRU of Lille, in the first trimester of monofetal pregnancy (between 5
        and 10 weeks of gestation), obtained spontaneously, after induction of ovulation or
        Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART)

             department of University Hospital of Lille

          -  in the first trimester of mono fetal pregnancy (between 5 and 10 weeks of gestation),
