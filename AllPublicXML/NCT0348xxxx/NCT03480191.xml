  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcal meningitis is an infection of the membrane that covers the brain. It is a
      serious infection which is currently treated with a combination of corticosteroids
      (dexamethasone) and 3rd generation cephalosporins. Nevertheless, complications associated
      with meningitis are relatively frequent and severe. Recent animal studies have shown that
      another antibiotic, daptomycin, can reduce the mortality and long-term effects of
      pneumococcal meningitis. Daptomycin is widely used worldwide in humans for other diseases,
      with few side effects.

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of daptomycin on the proliferation of the bacterial
      infection, and therefore on inflammation. Daptomycin will be added to the currently
      recommended treatment with the same dosage used for other diseases.

      Roughly 130 patients with suspected pneumococcal meningitis admitted to the emergency
      departments of hospitals throughout France will be asked to participate in this study.

      The participation period will last approximately 3 months.
