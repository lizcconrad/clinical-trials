    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. Self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:
Pain (5 items)
Stiffness (2 items)
Physical Function (17 items)
The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. A sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score.
Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>
