    <description>Ranolazine inhibits sodium and potassium ion channel currents. Inhibition of the late phase of the inward sodium current during cardiac repolarization has been well studied4. In disease states, enhanced sodium-calcium exchange due to augmented late phase of the inward sodium current activity leads to increased cytosolic calcium concentration. Intracellular calcium overload is believed to be critical to the mechanism of decreased left ventricular relaxation caused by ischemia and reperfusion. Elevated left ventricular diastolic wall tension compromises myocardial blood flow even further.</description>
