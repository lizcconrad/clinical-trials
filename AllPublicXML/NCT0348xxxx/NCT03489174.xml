  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who take opioid substitution therapy have higher rates of unintended pregnancy, more
      pregnancies, and a higher risk of pregnancy complications than the general population.
      Current practice is to test for pregnancy only at patient request or if the clinician
      suspects pregnancy. This study will compare monthly pregnancy testing to current practice in
      a double blind randomized control trial. As many women of childbearing age as possible will
      be recruited from the Hamilton Clinic for Opioid Substitutional Therapy. Women assigned to
      the intervention will have monthly testing at the same time as their monthly urine drug
      testing at the clinic. The primary objective is to assess if there is a significant
      difference is early pregnancy detection and the secondary objectives are to assess
      differences in pregnancy disposition and gestational age at entry to prenatal or abortion
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Routine Pregnancy Screening in Women on Opioid Substitutional Therapy study involves
      screening women from the The Hamilton Clinic for OST regularly for pregnancy to determine if
      this results in earlier prenatal care and improved pregnancy disposition. All eligible women
      at the Hamilton clinic will be approached for recruitment. The study phase last for one year.

      The investigators will assess for any significant difference in the rates of early pregnancy
      diagnosis, pregnancy disposition, and associated outcome measurements. Study results could
      inform best practices in the care of child-bearing women on OST and will provide baseline
      information and feasibility data to inform design of a larger RCT to assess the effect on
      pregnancy and birth outcomes.

      This pilot study will serve to demonstrate whether routine pregnancy screening is effective
      for earlier pregnancy diagnosis and whether it has any impact on pregnancy disposition and
      entry into pregnancy-related care for women on OST. In addition, the investigators will also
      be seeking to address whether routine pregnancy testing is logistically and financially
      feasible for patients receiving OST at a primary care-run addiction setting. If this
      intervention is found to be both effective and feasible, it would be possible to apply this
      study methodology to larger-scale RCTs across multiple clinical sites with the power to
      assess maternal and fetal outcomes.

    <masking_description>Participants will not know if they are assigned to the intervention or control group. Their weekly urine test that is collected by the opioid substitution therapy clinic will be tested monthly for pregnancy. Pregnancy will then be reported to the patient's attending physician on the day of testing, who would then communicate the result to the patient. The physician will continue with standard pregnancy care. The investigators will remain blind throughout data analysis and will not know if the pregnancy was discovered via monthly testing or standard practice.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients at the Hamilton Clinic present to the clinic most often on a weekly basis to provide a urine sample for urine drug screening and to meet with their MRP. This same urine sample can be tested for pregnancy in the intervention group once per month. Positive pregnancy test rates will be recorded for the intervention and control groups over the 1 year study period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in pregnancy disposition</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy disposition will be measured by the woman's choice to either continue with the pregnancy and enter care or enter into induced abortion care. Participants will either give the researchers access to their medical records and outcomes will be recorded from that information or participants can complete a self-report on pregnancy outcomes.</description>

    <description>Gestational age at entry into pregnancy related care will be obtained from ultrasounds and/or dates estimated from last menstrual period if access is granted to medical records. Otherwise researchers will depend on self-report. Pregnancy related care includes prenatal care or induced abortion services.</description>
