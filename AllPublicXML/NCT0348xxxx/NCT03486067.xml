  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study CC-93269-MM-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation (Part A) and expansion (Part
      B), first-in-human clinical study of CC-93269 in subjects with relapsed and refractory
      multiple myeloma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of CC-93269, administered intravenously (IV), to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and non-tolerated dose (NTD) of both the first dose and subsequent doses
      of CC-93269. The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      CC-93269 administered at or below the MTD in selected expansion cohorts in order to determine
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). One or more dosing regimens may be selected for cohort
      expansion. All treatments will be administered in 28-day cycles for up to 2 years until
      confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject/Investigator decision to
      withdraw.
