      Purpose: The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether a microfluidics assay can detect
      trace amounts of residual leukemia and predict relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      patients in remission who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or
      Induction and Consolidation Chemotherapy (ICC) at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital (NCCH).

      Procedures (methods): A total of 40 eligible subjects will be treated per standard of care
      with either SCT or induction and consolidation chemotherapy (ICC) based on the appropriate
      AML treatment paradigm for their disease. Peripheral blood (10 ml) for microfluidic chip
      analysis and possible Immune Monitoring Core Facility analysis will be collected along with
      routine lab draws prior to SCT. Patients in remission after SCT or those with confirmed
      remission by bone marrow biopsy after induction chemotherapy will be followed for 1 year; and
      peripheral blood (20 ml) will be collected to assess MRD by standard methods or by
      microfluidic chip analysis on a monthly basis. In addition, bone marrow biopsies will be
      performed at the end of consolidation (typically 5 months from remission), and at 1-year post
      remission in non-transplant patients. In transplanted patients, bone marrow biopsies will be
      collected at + 30 days, + 90 days, +180 days, and +360 days after SCT.

    <textblock>
      An unmet need in the treatment of AML is earlier detection of potential relapse by monitoring
      MRD. The hope is that if clinicians can pinpoint when a patient's MRD starts towards a rapid
      expansion to relapse, preemptive therapies can be instituted earlier with the hope of
      eliciting improved outcomes. Current methods fall short of the ability to properly monitor
      MRD in individual patients. An ideal MRD assay would be easy to conduct, sensitive to low MRD
      levels and suitable for frequent analysis. A significant challenge for achieving this in AML
      is that unlike other leukemias, AML's interpatient heterogeneity is immense; and there is no
      characteristic genetic mutation or aberrant protein expression pattern for AML patients ,
      thus hindering the broad applicability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence
      in-situ hypbridization (FISH) or multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) testing for MRD.
      Furthermore, AML relapse is rapid and it's been calculated that 42 day sampling intervals
      would be a minimum frequency needed to predict 75% of relapses during follow up after
      chemotherapy or SCT.

      The microfluidics assay being evaluated in this study is relatively inexpensive, broadly
      applicable, as it identifies almost all (&gt;90%) of AML cells, and easy to use. The
      microfluidic chip device is constructed with antibodies immobilized within the chip that can
      detect cell surface antigens commonly expressed on leukemic cells (ie, CD33, CD34, CD117, and
      CD123) directly in the peripheral blood without requiring preprocessing. The captured cells
      are then exposed to fluorescent antibodies targeting surface proteins that are aberrantly
      expressed on AML blasts (eg CD7, CD56 etc.), and fluorescence microscopy is used to identify
      captured cells that express an aberrant surface protein. We have already completed a pilot
      study using this technology to monitor 5 AML patients after SCT. Because this assay required
      peripheral blood and not a bone marrow biopsy, 39 microfluidic tests could be carried out
      compared to only 8 PCR, MFC, FISH, and/or microscopy tests. Moreover, the frequent testing
      allowed us to observe signs of impending relapse earlier than the bone marrow biopsy-based
      test. We plan to build on our findings in this trial and test the applicability of using the
      microfluidic assay for early signs of AML relapse. If successful, the microfluidic chip assay
      could be employed for serial MRD evaluations both in the post-SCT setting and in patients
      with AML undergoing conventional chemotherapy while providing a venue for the detailed
      management of a particular patient's AML including response to therapy and risk for disease
      recurrence.

        Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with newly diagnosed or suspected AML who are going to
        undergo stem cell transplant (SCT) or are being treated with induction and consolidation
        chemotherapy (ICC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with newly diagnosed or suspected AML who are going
             to undergo stem cell transplant (SCT) or are being treated with induction and
             consolidation chemotherapy (ICC) at the NCCH are eligible. These subjects must provide
             written informed consent to participate.

             --For the purposes of this study, induction chemotherapy is any therapy intended to
             induce remission in AML patients that combines anthracycline/anthracenedione with
             cytarabine; or combinations of cytarabine at a dose of ≥1 g/m2/dose x ≥ 5 doses with a
             purine analogue. Liposomal combinations of anthracycline and cytarabine are also
             considered induction therapy. Subjects receiving investigational induction therapies
             will be eligible as long as the standard-of-care agents within the induction therapy
             fulfills criteria above.

             For the purposes of this study, specific choice of consolidation chemotherapy, or
             decision to pursue SCT in remission are not mandated prior to enrollment, as these
             decisions are not typically made until after induction chemotherapy has been given.

          2. Subjects scheduled for SCT or ICC must have confirmed CD33-, CD34-, CD117- or
             CD123-positive disease to qualify for enrollment to undergo serial blood draws for
             assessment of MRD by microfluidic chip analysis.

          3. Subjects may be enrolled after beginning induction chemotherapy, provided that
             sufficient AML blasts are available in the pre-treatment peripheral blood or bone
             marrow sample to confirm that the blasts express CD33, CD34, CD117 or CD123.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with newly diagnosed or suspected AML who are
             scheduled to undergo SCT or ICC at the NCCH who do not provide written informed
             consent to participate are ineligible.

          2. Patients who are receiving non-intense therapies for AML that do not contain
             anthracycline/anthracenedione or dual analog therapies. Such non-intense therapies
             include: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine/decitabine), combinations
             including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, cytarabine monotherapy at doses below 1
             g/m2 x 5, purine analog monotherapy or investigational therapies that are not combined
             with standard induction agents.

          3. Subjects who test negative for the leukemic blasts surface antigens CD33, CD34, CD117,
             and CD123 are ineligible for inclusion to undergo serial blood draws for assessment of
             MRD by microfluidic chip analysis.
