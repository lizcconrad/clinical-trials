  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of sustained oral
      administration of inorganic nitrate in patients with severe aortic stenosis and to assess the
      mechanisms by which inorganic nitrate enhances oxygen uptake and exercise capacity in this
      population.

      This is a randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial, in which 22 subjects who
      underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) three
      or more months prior to enrollment will receive the following 2 interventions, in randomized
      order: (1) Potassium nitrate (KNO3), at a dose of 12-18 mmol/d by mouth for 4 weeks, or; (2)
      Potassium chloride (KCl), at a dose of 12-18 mmol/d by mouth for 4 weeks. A 1-week washout
      period will be introduced between the 2 interventions. The purpose of the trial is to test
      the safety of KNO3 and its efficacy on a number of clinical and physiologic endpoints in
      subjects who underwent TAVR for severe AS.

    <intervention_model_description>In this phase IIb, double-blind, cross-over trial, we will assign 22 subjects who are post-TAVR for severe AS to: (A) Potassium nitrate administered by mouth at a dose of 6 mEq three times daily for 4 weeks, or (B) Potassium chloride (KCl) at identical doses. The order of the interventions (AB-BA design) will be randomized, with a 1-week washout period separating each intervention. A crossover design will enable each subject to receive both treatments.</intervention_model_description>
