  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss; for the greatest
      impact, it should be made available in the primary care setting where it can reach the many
      patients with overweight/obesity. The investigators developed a 3-month automated online
      behavioral weight loss program, Rx Weight Loss (RxWL), and showed that it produces clinically
      significant weight losses among primary care patients. The investigators' early efforts at
      pragmatic implementation of RxWL have been promising, and have shed light on challenges
      associated with implementation, and the need to study longer-term effectiveness. The
      investigators will therefore conduct a pragmatic study to improve the implementation and
      effectiveness of this behavioral obesity intervention delivered in routine and representative
      healthcare settings. The investigators are partnering with the Rhode Island Primary Care
      Physicians Corporation (RIPCPC), a large primary care network of 58 practices with 100
      physicians and 16 nurse care managers. Using the framework for Effectiveness-Implementation
      Hybrid Designs, the investigators will simultaneously target effectiveness and implementation
      to maximize the public health impact of the research. Half of the 16 nurse care managers, and
      the practices they serve, will be randomized to either Basic Implementation (alerts generated
      using the electronic medical record [EMR] to direct eligible patients to RxWL), or to the
      Enhanced Implementation (alerts, clinician skills training to motivate and support weight
      loss, clinician dashboard with reports on patient progress and tools to facilitate patient
      engagement and behavior change). The investigators will test the hypothesis that the Enhanced
      Implementation will increase the proportion of patients directed to, enrolling, and
      completing the weight loss program. Because maintenance of weight loss is a critical problem,
      this project will also involve randomization of 600 patients with overweight/obesity and type
      2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or hypercholesterolemia to the 3 month RxWL intervention
      followed by one of three maintenance conditions: (a) Control- 9 monthly online education
      sessions; (b) Monthly Lessons and Feedback- 9 monthly online video lessons teaching
      self-regulation with automated feedback on the self-monitoring record; (c) Refresher
      Campaigns- 9 monthly on-line video sessions, teaching self-regulation and providing two
      4-week courses with novel strategies and behavioral challenges to improve long-term outcomes.
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that 12-month weight losses are better with
      Refresher Campaigns than Monthly Lessons and Feedback, and both are better than Control.
      Secondary outcomes include changes in weight, CVD risk factors, and medication use over a
      full 24 months. The project is significant and innovative because: it uses an empirically
      validated approach to obesity treatment that is integrated into the primary care setting,
      leveraging existing staff and EMR capabilities; it has a dual focus on improving
      effectiveness and implementation; it has a pragmatic design in partnership with a large
      primary care network that treats a diverse patient population; and it has potential to it
      provides a scalable, sustainable approach that can serve as a model for broader dissemination
      of obesity treatment intervention.
