      This study investigates the clinical practices, safety and effectiveness of Cerebrolysin in
      routine treatment of patients with moderate to severe neurological deficits after acute
      ischemic stroke.

      Patients registered: Acute Ischemic Stroke patients with moderate to severe neurological
      deficits

      All patients receive acute stroke care according to local treatment standards, not amended or
      influenced by the study:

      Cerebrolysin Group:

      Patients who are treated with Cerebrolysin; dosage, frequency and duration follows local
      clinical practice in accordance with terms of the local marketing authorization

      Control group:

      Patients who are not treated with Cerebrolysin

      Observation criteria:

        -  Signed Informed Consent

        -  Clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke confirmed by imaging

        -  Moderate to severe neurological deficits with NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 8 to 15, both
           inclusive

        -  No prior stroke

        -  No prior disability

        -  Patient's independence prior to stroke onset (pre-morbid mRS of 0 or 1)

        -  Reasonable expectation of successful follow-up (max. 100 days)

      The study follows the recommendations of the Principles for Good Research on Comparative
      Effectiveness (GRACE).

      In order to comply with recent calls for high-quality non-interventional comparative
      effectiveness research, a risk-based centralized statistical approach to monitoring is
      introduced in combination with targeted on-site monitoring for ongoing surveillance of study
      conduct, thus ensuring highest standards of data quality and integrity according to the most
      recent requirements of the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP, Amendment R2,
      July 2015), the FDA Guidance for Industry on a Risk-based Approach to Monitoring, and the EMA
      reflection-paper on risk-based quality management in clinical trials.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale scale is used for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ordinal NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 21 days and 3 months after stroke onset</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

The MoCA test is a one-page 30-point test administered in approximately 10 minutes. MoCA scores range between 0 and 30. A score of 26 or over is considered to be normal.</description>
