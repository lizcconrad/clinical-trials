  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (TE) is the most common abnormal movement of the adult. His diagnosis is
      based on a bundle of clinical arguments (Movement Disorders Society, 1998). Well
      characterized in the adult, little data is available concerning child. The objective of this
      work is (1) to define the demographic and clinical characteristics of the TE of children and
      adolescents, (2) to determine the electrophysiological characteristics in the child, (3)
      evaluate the functional impact of TE, and assess the functional impact of TE, and assess the
      current management modalities of TE in children and adolescent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, descriptive cross-sectional study will include children and adolescents whose
      diagnosis of TE has been retained by an abnormal movement specialist before the age of 18
      years.

      Each child will benefit from an examination and a neurological and general clinical
      examination, a functional questionnaire, an electromyogram with accelerometer.

      Will be determined: demographic characteristics (age, sex and ethnicity), family history of
      essential tremor, age of onset of tremor, tremor characteristics (location, occurrence
      conditions, aggravating or precipitating factors, scalability); additional examinations
      carried out and the treatments proposed or taken by the child as well as the functional
      repercussions of TE in the child.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject whose age is between 3 and 18 years

          -  Subject affiliated to a social security scheme

          -  Parents or subjects who have been informed of the progress and consequences of the
             study by an investigator and have signed the informed consent form

          -  Diagnosis of essential tremor established according to the diagnostic criteria of the
             Movement Disorders Society (1998), by a neuropediatrician or a neurologist, specialist
             in abnormal movements. The diagnosis is based on the presence of the following
             criteria: bilateral action tremor of the hands and forearms, absence of other
             neurological signs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abnormal neurological examination outside tremor

          -  Family history or personal dysthyroidism

          -  Existence of a global psychomotor or motor developmental delay

          -  Taking medication that may induce tremor

          -  known poisoning by heavy metals, bismuth, mercury, methyl bromide

          -  Severe appearance of the tremor

          -  Tremor suggestive of a psychogenic origin

          -  Abnormal or non-existent brain MRI if family case
