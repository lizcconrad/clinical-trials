  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic examination evaluates storage and empting phases of the urinary bladder. It
      enables the clinician to correlate physiologic findings to patients' complains. The data
      gathered during the examination divided to storage and empting.

      During the storage phase, bladder sensation is measured while the bladder is filled with
      sterile water. During years of practice, we noticed that early sensation (bladder
      over-sensitivity) is occasionally associated with bladder outlet obstruction (as demonstrated
      in the emptying phase of the examination.

      The study includes patients who were referred to Urodynamics examination due to lower urinary
      tract symptoms. There is no actual intervention during the examination. Though, patients are
      asked to fill an International prostate symptom score (IPSS-questionnaires).

    <description>Bladder oversensitivity (early sensation), a diagnosis made by symptoms and urodynamic investigations. Defined as an increased perceived bladder sensation during bladder filling with specific cystometric findings of: (i) an early first desire to void; (ii) an early strong desire to void, which occurs at low bladder volume; (iii) a low maximum cystometric bladder capacity; no abnormal increases in detrusor pressure.</description>
