  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to fill the gap between the current state of clinical trial readiness
      and the optimal one for SCA1 and SCA3, which are fatal rare diseases with no treatments.
      Through US-European collaborations, the investigators will establish the world's largest
      cohorts of subjects at the earliest disease stages, who will benefit most from treatments,
      validate an ability to detect disease onset and early progression by imaging markers, even
      prior to ataxia onset, and identify clinical trial designs that will generate the most
      conclusive results on treatment efficacy with small populations of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1 (SCA1) and 3 (SCA3) are rare, inherited neurodegenerative
      disorders that relentlessly progress to total disability and death. SCA1 is the fastest
      progressing SCA while SCA3 is the most common SCA in US and Europe. Expanded (CAG)n repeats
      encoding polyglutamines (polyQ) in the respective genes, ATXN1 and ATXN3, cause SCA1 and
      SCA3. Disease-modifying therapies that target the pathway upstream of the complex pathogenic
      cascade will offer ultimate treatment. Scientific premise and preclinical animal data
      strongly support MSK1 inhibitors for SCA1, citalopram for SCA3, and nucleotide-based gene
      silencing for both SCAs as drugs to be examined in clinical trials in five years. However,
      the challenge that investigators face in current clinical trial readiness for such
      disease-modifying therapies is that the modest effect size of candidate drugs as measured by
      the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA; the most robust and well-validated
      clinical outcome assessment measure) requires large cohorts of study subjects to achieve
      sufficient statistical power. To accomplish the goal of establishing clinical trial
      readiness, the investigators propose to launch an international, multi-site effort focusing
      on premanifest mutation carriers and patients in an early disease stage, who are likely
      responders to the disease-modifying interventions prior to irreversible brain damage. Based
      on the investigators' studies funded by NIH and the National Ataxia Foundation (NAF), the US
      ataxia consortium has developed an unprecedented opportunity for tight collaborations with
      the European Ataxia Study Group to jointly address this challenge and establish clinical
      trial readiness for SCA1 and SCA3. To achieve this goal, the investigators propose the
      following specific aims:

      Aim 1. Establish the world's largest cohorts of premanifest/early SCA1 and SCA3 by combining
      cohorts, clinical outcome assessment data and biofluid samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid)
      from US and Europe Aim 2. Validate MR morphological, biochemical and functional biomarkers in
      premanifest and early SCA1 and SCA3 Aim 3. Adapt recent developments on statistical design
      and analysis of small population trials to SCAs.
