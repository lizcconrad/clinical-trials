  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study explores the ability of dermatologists to influence patients' behavior
      using a novel and brief (3 minute) behavioral intervention in the context of naturally
      occurring patient interactions and shows promise for long term sustainability. The incidence
      of invasive skin cancers, cutaneous melanoma in particular, has nearly tripled in the U.S.
      between 1975 and 2004, making it the fastest rising incidence rate for all cancers in the
      United States. Dermatologists are in an ideal position to effect change in their patients.
      The present study will assess whether a brief intervention (The ABCâ€”Addressing Behavior
      Change method) delivered to patients by dermatologists during a skin examination will
      increase the use of sun protection and reduce risk behaviors compared to patients who receive
      treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the U.S. and the incidence and mortality from
      skin cancer is on the rise. Individuals can decrease their risk of skin cancer by engaging in
      protective behaviors such as limiting intentional and unintentional UV exposure, and wearing
      broad-spectrum sunscreens and protective clothing. Despite knowing the risks and receiving
      dermatological care, many patients with and without a history of skin cancer frequently
      forget to use UV protection or fail to use it in an optimal manner to reduce their UV risk.
      To address these concerns, Mallett and colleagues developed a 3-minute brief ABC intervention
      - Addressing Behavior Change. The ABC intervention is designed to be delivered by
      dermatologists in the context of a routine office visit involving a skin examination.
      Previous work by Mallett and colleagues showed dermatologists were highly motivated to
      deliver the intervention, quickly learned the requisite skills, delivered the intervention
      with fidelity, and showed minimal decay in knowledge, motivation, and skills over a 6-month
      period. This study builds on a previous study by conducting an examination of the efficacy of
      the ABC intervention on patients' motivations and behaviors utilizing a prospective
      longitudinal design.

    <description>The ABC is a 3-minute brief, dermatologist delivered intervention for dermatological patients that takes place during a skin examination. During the ABC intervention, dermatologists specifically assess patients' UV risk behaviors, discuss patients' motivation to use UV protection, and explore solutions to patient-reported barriers interfering with effective sunscreen use. Based on our previous research, the ABC intervention does not add additional time to the visit, but rather replaces treatment as usual conversations about sun protection.</description>
