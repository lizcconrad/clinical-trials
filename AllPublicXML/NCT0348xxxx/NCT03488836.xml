  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      extrusion of infected dentin into the periapical tissue has been suggested as a major source
      of pain after endodontic treatment. Although debris extrusion is an inevitable finding even
      when instrumentation is limited to the confines of the canal, different armamentarium seem to
      be associated with different amounts of debris extrusion. Studies on the effect of various
      rotary files on post-endodontic pain are very few and have yielded conflicting results with
      some favoring full-sequence and others leaning towards reciprocal rotary systems. This study
      aims at assessing the intensity of post-endodontic pain following two different rotary
      systems, Reciproc and race.

      Methods: in this single-blind, parallel-grouped randomized clinical trial a total of 150
      otherwise healthy patients aged between 20 to 50 years old with a pulpal status of
      irreversible pulpitis for one tooth in the upper or lower molar region were analyzed. A
      clinician performed the endodontic treatment in two groups, a group instrumented using race
      and a third group with instrumentation performed using Reciproc rotary systems.
