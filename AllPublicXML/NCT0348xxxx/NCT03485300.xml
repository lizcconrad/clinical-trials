  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify the prevalence of warfarin resistance among patients of
      prosthetic cardiac valves although it is given with normally therapeutic prescribed doses and
      the identification of the causes of its resistance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Besides the risk of infective endocarditis, thromboembolism from the foreign body structures
      of the prosthesis remains a major problem, which can be effectively reduced, but not
      inhibited by the use of oral anticoagulants in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves.

      Warfarin as a vitamin k antagonist is widely used to decrease risk of thromboembolism but
      need strict monitoring for INR to avoid warfarin failure or haemorrhage.

      It acts through inhibiting an enzyme called the vitamin K1 2,3 epoxide reductase complex,
      subunit1 (VKORC1).

      All patients with mechanical heart valves need the oral anticoagulation to keep the INR
      between 2.5:3.5 according to valve type, position and other comorbid conditions.

      However some patients need higher-than-expected doses of warfarin to get their (INR) into the
      target therapeutic range.

      Resistance to warfarin has been described as the inability to prolong the prothrombin time or
      raise the international normalized ratio (INR) into the therapeutic range when the drug is
      given at normally prescribed doses.

      Resistance is different than warfarin failure ,which is defined as a new thrombotic event
      despite a therapeutic prothrombin time and INR .

      The causes of warfarin resistance can be either acquired from patient noncompliance, high
      consumption of vitamin K or C ,decreased absorption or increased clearance of the drug
      ,dietary or drug interactions or hereditary by genetic factors that result either in faster
      metabolism of the drug (a form of pharmacokinetic resistance) or in lower activity of the
      drug (pharmacodynamic resistance).
