  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized control trial is to examine the effects of a Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on women with posttraumatic stress disorder related to
      intimate partner violence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent, chronic, and debilitating disorder
      characterized by a reduced capacity to adapt to stressors, marked by poor regulation in the
      following domains: emotion, attentional function, and physiological stress. Mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR) holds promise for treating symptoms of trauma and PTSD as evidence
      suggests it targets these domains. The central hypothesis is that MBSR, which teaches
      non-judgmental awareness, can improve emotion regulation and attentional function, and
      diminish physiological stress dysregulation, which in turn will improve PTSD symptoms. We
      will examine changes in stress capacity and PTSD symptom severity among women survivors of
      intimate partner violence with PTSD after participation in an MBSR program.

    <measure>PTSD Symptoms Checklist (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Symptoms Checklist (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. The PCL-5 asks respondents to rate how much they have been bothered by particular PTSD symptoms in the past month on a 0-4 scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a 36-item self-report measure that assesses emotion dysregulation in six domains: nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior, impulse control difficulties, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess cardiovascular measures, ECG, basal thoracic impedance (Z0), the first derivative of the impedance signal (dZ/dt), and continuous strain gauge signal, will be obtained (BioNex Mainframe, Mindware Technologies, Gahanna, OH). Three disposable ECG electrodes will be placed in a lead II configuration to record the ECG signal. Four additional disposable patient ECG spot electrodes (2 current and 2 recording electrodes) will be used to obtain the Z0 and dZ/dt signals. A strain gauge will be secured around the lower chest to record respiration rate. The BioNex will be connected to a laptop: signals will be conditioned and collected (1000 Hz sampling; 5 Hz for strain gauge) through an integrated A/D board, and written to disk and later scored (with Mindware software).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Useful Field of View Test (UFOV)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Useful Field of View Test (UFOV) is a computerized test with 3 assessments: speed of processing; selective attention; divided attention. The test determines the minimum display duration at which participants can process information for increasingly difficult subtests and is the primary outcome for prior studies of speed of processing training.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire assesses five factors that represent mindfulness as it is currently conceptualized: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience.</description>

          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD

          -  No or stable use of medications (including, for example, beta blockers).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There is suspicion or evidence of dementia or cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State
             Examination score &lt; 24) or inability to provide informed consent

          -  They have ever been a perpetrator of IPV

          -  History of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder; current suicidality with either plan,
             intent, or a suicide attempt in the past 6 months

          -  Active substance dependence or in remission &lt; 3 months

             infarction)

          -  The age range was chosen to reduce heterogeneity in this pilot study, as aging is
             associated with changes in emotion regulation, attention, and PNS tone.
