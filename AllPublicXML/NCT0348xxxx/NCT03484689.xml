  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Diabetes-related distress (DRD) is very common among people with type II diabetes
      mellitus (DM). DRD led to poorer DM control and may led to adverse prognosis. Yet, there is
      no widely accepted or recommended DRD treatment.

      Mindfulness was shown to relieve psychological distress in various physical and mental
      conditions.

      Aim: as a pilot project, we aim to determine if mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT),
      which is one of the widely used mindfulness program, is feasible and acceptable and may
      improve DRD in our Chinese population.

      Method: 20 Chinese participants with suboptimally controlled DM and high DRD will be
      recruited to a 8- week MBCT group. Pre-group and post-group (immediate and 2-month
      post-group) data including DRD score, quality-of life measures will be compared.

    <description>A measure of Diabetes specific quality of life. The possible score for each domain is from -9(most negative impact of diabetes) to +3 (most positive impact of diabetes). Domains include leisure work, journey, holiday, physical, family life, friendships and social life, personal relationship, sex life, physical appearance, self-confidence, motivation, reactions of other people, feelings about future, financial situation, living conditions, depend on others, freedom to eat, and freedom to drink. The total score is the weighted average of all the domain, so the total score also ranged from -9 to +3.</description>
