  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      15 patients with PRP will be treated with ixekizumab for 24 weeks to determine safety and
      efficacy. Participants are required to travel to Portland, OR only for the first visit and
      week-24 visit. 5 visits in between these times and one follow up visit may be performed by
      secure videoconferencing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare and poorly understood severe inflammatory skin
      disease characterized by widespread (often full-body) redness and flaking of the skin,
      painful thickening and cracking of the palms and soles, hair loss, crumbling nails, and
      severe skin itching and burning.

      There is no FDA-approved therapy for this rare disease and the commonly used medications do
      not work for many patients. There is some evidence that IL-17 may be too high in the skin of
      PRP patients. Ixekizumab is an injectable medication that blocks IL-17 and is FDA-approved
      for psoriasis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical improvement in PRP severity and body surface area</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical improvement will be measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. PASI is a scale that measures the severity (redness, scale, and elevation) of each body surface area of skin involved in psoriasis (a disease that has some similarities with PRP). Redness, scale, and elevation are each scored on a 0-4 point scale, added together, and multiplied by each body surface area involved (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, lower limbs). The maximum score is 72 which would indicate the worst disease over every surface of someone's body. A scale of zero would indicate normal skin.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). There are 10 questions covering symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment. Each question refers to the impact of PRP on the patient's life over the previous week. The highest score is 30 and would indicate a maximum (negative) impact on quality of life. A score of zero would indicate no impact on quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in itch</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Itch will be measured using a numeric rating scale from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable).</description>
