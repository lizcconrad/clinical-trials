  <brief_title>This Study in Healthy Volunteers Compares the Amount of BI 730460 in the Blood When Taken as Tablet or as Liquid. It Looks at How Different Doses of BI 730460 Are Taken up in the Body and How Well They Are Tolerated. The Study Also Tests How Food Influences the Amount of BI 730460 in the Blood.</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Partially Randomised, Single-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Rising Doses of BI 730460 Administered as Oral Solution and Tablets to Healthy Subjects, and a Randomised, Open-label, Single-dose, Three-way Cross-over Bioavailability Comparison of BI 730460 as Tablet Versus Oral Solution and Tablet With and Without Food</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the single-rising dose (SRD) part (trial part 1) is to investigate
      the safety and tolerability of BI 730460 in healthy subjects following oral administration of
      single rising doses. The secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      including dose proportionality, and pharmacodynamics of BI 730460 after single dosing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males) or any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG)
             finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

        - Male subjects with women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) partner who are unwilling to
        use male contraception (condom or sexual abstinence) from the first administration of trial
        medication until 30 days after last administration of trial medication
