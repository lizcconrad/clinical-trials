  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Community Health Assessment Program in
      the Philippines (CHAP-P), looking at the differences between communities implementing CHAP-P
      versus communities not implementing CHAP-P.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of the CHAP-P intervention
      in communities of the Zamboanga Peninsula, Philippines. Specifically, the investigators are
      looking at the difference between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in randomly selected
      residents of control communities versus those in communities implementing the CHAP-P
      intervention. The investigators are also looking at the differences between control and
      intervention communities in modifiable lifestyle risk factors for diabetes, screening rates
      for diabetes, rates of newly diagnosed cases of diabetes, general diabetes management, and
      hospital admission rates, as well as the cost effectiveness of CHAP-P.

      The CHAP-P intervention consists of initial and follow-up sessions where trained local
      volunteers (Barangay Health Workers, or BHWs) take physical measurements (blood pressure,
      height, weight, waist circumference) and facilitate a diabetes risk survey; based on these
      findings, they provide education, materials, and referrals to local health resources as
      needed.

      The participant groups in this evaluation include those that attend CHAP-P sessions, randomly
      selected community members that provide consent for a survey and HbA1c testing, and community
      members and BHWs/other Lead Local Organization staff who provide consent for focus groups and
      interviews.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a parallel 26-community cluster randomized controlled trial. A community cluster design was chosen as CHAP-P is intended as a community-level intervention. Thirteen communities (barangays) will receive the CHAP-P sessions and will be considered intervention, while the other 13 communities will receive care as usual and will be considered control. Measures of individual participants will be taken as a repeated cross-sectional sample at baseline and at six months. A community process evaluation and cost-effectiveness evaluation will also be undertaken.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Residents of intervention communities (barangays) aged 40+ are openly invited to attend CHAP-P sessions. At CHAP-P sessions, trained local volunteers (Barangay Health Workers, or BHWs) collect consent, measure blood pressure, collect other physical measurements, and conduct a survey to determine clients' risk of diabetes. Based on the findings, BHWs provide education and/or referrals. CHAP-P sessions are held twice a month, and clients are encouraged to continuing attending for ongoing follow-up and monitoring.</description>
