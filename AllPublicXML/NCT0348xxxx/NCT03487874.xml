  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of selective 8th cervical nerve root block during
      interscalene brachial plexus block on the relief of pain intensity upon the introduction of a
      posterior portal during arthroscopic shoulder surgery. The 5th to 7th cervical nerve roots
      will be blocked in half of participants, while the 5th to 8th cervical nerve roots will be
      blocked in the other half.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By blocking only the 5th to 7th cervical nerve blocks, conventional interscalene brachial
      plexus block spares the 8th cervical and 1st thoracic dermatomes which innervate the
      posterior aspect of the shoulder. To visualize the shoulder joint space during shoulder
      arthroscopic surgery, the introduction of a posterior portal is essential. However,
      conventional interscalene brachial plexus block cannot effectively relieve the pain caused by
      its insertion due to sparing of the 8th cervical and 1st thoracic dermatomes. The addition of
      the 8th cervical nerve root block to conventional interscalene brachial plexus block
      decreases pain intensity upon the introduction of a posterior portal.
