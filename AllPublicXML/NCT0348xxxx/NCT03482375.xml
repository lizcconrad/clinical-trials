  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gallstone disease affects over 20 million Americans. Among patients with gallbladder disease,
      the prevalence of choledocholithiasis (stones in the bile duct) is estimated to be 10-20%.
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is considered the standard of care for
      removing stones in the bile duct utilizing a variety of conventional methods including
      biliary sphincterotomy, sphincteroplasty, extraction balloon, retrieval basket, and
      mechanical lithotripsy. After removal of stones from the bile duct, an occlusion
      cholangiogram is usually performed to confirm complete bile duct clearance. However,
      cholangiogram can miss residual stones in 11- 30% of cases - especially in the setting of a
      dilated bile duct, large stones, severe pneumobilia, juxtapapillary diverticulum, primary
      sclerosing cholangitis, and after lithotripsy (mechanical, electrohydraulic, or laser). The
      approach to patients with choledocholithiasis requires careful attention because missed bile
      duct stones can cause recurrent biliary symptoms, pancreatitis, cholangitis, and has
      significant cost implication with the need for repeat imaging and/or procedures.

    <textblock>
      Peroral cholangioscopy (POC) provides direct visualization of the bile duct during ERCP and
      its benefits are well documented in numerous published studies. POC has been described for
      therapy of difficult to remove biliary stones utilizing electrohydraulic lithotripsy or laser
      lithotripsy with success rates of &gt;90%. POC has also been used for evaluation of
      indeterminate filling defects and to assess for residual stones missed with cholangiogram. In
      a multicenter study evaluating POC for a variety of indications, 11% (7/66) of patients had
      bile duct stones identified only by POC that were missed on ERCP. In a study of patients with
      primary sclerosing cholangitis, 30% (7/23) of patients were found to have stones with POC
      that were missed with cholangiography. Takao et al. assessed residual bile duct stones found
      with POC in comparison to balloon-cholangiography; they found that 24% (26/108) of patients
      had residual stones seen with POC that were missed with balloon-cholangiography.

      Although POC has been available for over thirty years, it has not become a widespread
      technique due to the fact that traditional cholangioscopes are fragile, cumbersome to use,
      and usually require two endoscopists to perform the procedure. A recent single operator
      semi-disposable cholangioscope, SpyGlass (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts), has
      addressed those concerns and has been shown in a studies to be a useful tool in visualizing
      the bile ducts and performing therapeutic maneuvers for biliary stones. Both ERCP and
      Cholangioscopy are standard of care procedures to treat gall stones.

      The primary goal of the study is to assess if POC will enhance the diagnostic yield in the
      detection of residual biliary stones that are missed during conventional ERCP. Residual bile
      duct stones can especially be seen in the setting of bile duct dilation, history of recurrent
      abnormal liver function tests, and after lithotripsy (mechanical, electrohydraulic, or
      laser). Missed biliary stones can lead to recurrent biliary symptoms, pancreatitis, and
      cholangitis. POC after conventional ERCP can be a useful diagnostic tool to confirm complete
      extraction of bile duct stones, and thus lead to decreased morbidity and decreased cost by
      avoiding unnecessary tests and repeat procedures.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is to assess if digital peroral cholangioscopy (POC) will enhance the diagnostic yield in the detection of residual biliary stones that are missed during conventional ERCP. The primary outcome will be assessed at the time of the procedure (i.e. residual stone seen with POC vs. no residual stone seen with POC). We will enroll approximately 100 patients over a 2-year period. At study completion, the primary outcome measure for all patients will be analyzed and data will be reported.</description>
