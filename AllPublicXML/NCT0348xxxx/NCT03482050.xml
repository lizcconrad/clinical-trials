  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of transplantation of Astrocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells, in
      patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

      There will be no change in the routine ALS treatment of the patients enrolled into the study.
      Treatment will be administered in addition to the appropriate standard of care treatment.

      The study hypothesis is that transplantation of Astrocyte(AstroRx) cells can compensate for
      the malfunctioning of patients' own astrocytes by restoring physiological capabilities like
      the reuptake of excessive glutamate, reducing oxidative stress, reducing other toxic
      compounds, as well as by secreting different neuroprotective factors
