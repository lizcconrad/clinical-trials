  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea
      (OSA) and cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in patients with T1D.

      The secondary aims of this study are to assess: (1) the prevalence of OSA in patients with
      T1D; (2) the relationship between OSA and metabolic parameters (such as glycaemic control,
      blood pressure, lipids and weight) in patients with T1D; (3) the relationship between OSA and
      diabetes-related microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral
      neuropathy) in patients with T1D; and (4) the potential mechanisms for the relationship
      between OSA and diabetic-related complications if such a relationship is found.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has been reported to be very common in patient with type 2
      diabetes (T2D), and this relation is expected as both conditions share obesity as a common
      risk factor. Despite that several articles have stated that OSA is an independent risk factor
      for abnormal glucose metabolism, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.

      In contrast, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are leaner and younger than patients with
      T2D, so it was expected that OSA might be less common in patients with T1D. However, few
      studies have reported the prevalence of OSA in T1D with a range between 8 and 46%. The
      relationship between OSA and diabetes-related vascular disease is poorly explored in patients
      with T1D. This suggests a mechanism other than obesity may be responsible for OSA in patients
      with T1D. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that (1) OSA is related to CAN rather
      than obesity in patients with T1D. (2) OSA is common in patients with T1D. (3) OSA is
      associated with worse metabolic profile and microvascular complications in T1D. (4) Oxidative
      and nitrosative stress are possible mechanisms relating OSA to T1D complication.

    <measure>The relationship between OSA and cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in patients with T1D.</measure>
    <time_frame>Single time point measurement (20- 30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>CAN will be assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) and spectral analysis. During this test blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) and will be recorded while resting in a sitting down position and during certain manoeuvres that include deep breathing and Valsalva, and standing up. The Result of this outcome will be categorized into normal, borderline, or abnormal.
This study is one visit only, and the total duration of the visit is 2-4 hours. The time frame below is the approximate time needed to collect each outcome data.</description>
