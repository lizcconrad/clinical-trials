  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the basic psychological and neural mechanisms
      underlying the social regulation of emotion - that is, how one person's actions can impact,
      or regulate - the emotions of another person - and how this ability changes with practice. As
      such, this study is not designed to directly address clinical health outcomes and provide no
      treatment or intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has demonstrated that helping others regulate their emotions has benefits for
      the support provider. But little is known about the basic brain mechanisms underlying this
      ability or how this ability can change with practice. To address these questions, this study
      has two parts. In the first, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to gain
      insight into the brain systems involved in helping others regulate negative emotions by
      comparing them to the brain systems involved in regulating the participants' own negative
      emotions. In the second part, participants engage in three weeks of structured practice, or
      training, in either socially regulating others' emotions or in self-regulating their own
      emotions. The investigators predict that helping others regulate their emotions will involve
      many of the same brain regions implicated in regulating one's own emotions, in addition to
      regions involved in perspective taking and the reward of helping others. Further, when
      relating the brain data from part 1 to the regulation practice data from part 2, the
      investigators expect that individuals who in part 1 show greater activity in brain regions
      supporting either social or self-regulation may be more likely in part 2 to show
      corresponding improvements in regulation performance. The results of these studies are
      intended to lay the groundwork for future studies investigating the social regulation of
      emotion in older adults and clinical populations for whom social support can be beneficial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (10 items) has 2 subscales - suppression and reappraisal. Participants rate their response on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree). The total score is calculated from the sum of the items in each subscale. Higher scores indicate higher tendency to use the emotion regulation strategy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Ruminative Response Scale (22 items) has 3 subscales - brooding, reflection and depression. Participants rate their response on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Almost never) to 4 (Almost always). The total score is calculated from the sum of the items in each subscale. Higher scores indicate higher tendency to engage in ruminative thoughts.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mood rating (Likert scale score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate their response indicating their current emotions (e.g., angry, happy, sad) on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 9 (completely agree). The total score for positive mood is calculated from the sum of 4 positive emotion items. The total score for negative mood is calculated from the sum of 4 negative emotion items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI) (Likert scale score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate their response indicating their ruminative thought (e.g., &quot;Right now, I wonder why I react the way I do&quot;) on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 9 (completely agree). The total score is calculated from the sum of all 13 items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) - Trait Scale (Likert scale score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait scale (20 items) measures trait anxiety. Participants rate their response on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Almost never) to 4 (Almost always). The total score is calculated from the sum of all items. Higher scores indicate higher anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Likert scale score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (20 items) measures depression. Participants rate their response on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)) to 3 (All of the time (5-7 days)). The total score is calculated from the sum of all items. Higher scores indicate higher depression level.</description>

    <description>Following the fMRI session, participants in the social regulation group will be asked to rate their mood twice a day for 3 weeks. Furthermore, every other day, they will receive one event written by another participant. They will be asked to help the other person use emotion regulation strategies to feel less negative. The participant will answer brief questions related to his/her feelings after receiving the event and after providing social emotion regulation.</description>

    <description>Following the fMRI session, participants in the self regulation group will be asked to rate their mood twice a day for 3 weeks. Furthermore, every other day, they will write an event that caused them negative emotions. They will be asked to use emotion regulation strategies to decrease their negative emotions. The participant will answer brief questions related to his/her feelings after writing the event and after implementing the emotion regulation strategy.</description>
