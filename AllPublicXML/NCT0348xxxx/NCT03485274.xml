  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the recent availability of vortioxetine, and the surging phenomenon of cannabis misuses
      amongst young abusers, it is a timely opportunity to conduct an early pharmacotherapy
      intervention study to offer an evidence-based strategy aiming to stop individuals with
      cannabis use disorders with depressive or anxiety symptoms, to develop into a more chronic
      disabling dependence or co-morbid state.
