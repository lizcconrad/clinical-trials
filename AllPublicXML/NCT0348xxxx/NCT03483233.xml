  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective exploration of the environment, check for information to improve one's own
      performance, are fundamental abilities of human cognition. These abilities are dependent on
      the process of cognitive control.

      However, they are clearly impaired and uncontrollable in certain behavioral disorders such as
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Compulsive checks of these patients, spontaneously
      associated with a feeling of intense uncertainty, suggest disturbances of evaluative and
      metacognitive functions. However, no biological observations have yet been able to feed these
      hypotheses.

      The evaluation of decisions and actions involves the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) (which
      belongs to a cortico-subcortical network structurally and functionally altered in OCD
      patients). Cingulotomy has long been used as a therapy in severe OCD, with However, the
      precise part of the cingulate cortex that contributes to check (and its pathological forms)
      remains to be discovered.

      The purpose of this research campaign is to determine, through functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy human subjects:

        1. the location and role of the MCC region involved in normal check decision processes,

        2. determine the identity of the entire network involved
