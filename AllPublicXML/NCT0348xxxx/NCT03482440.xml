  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are more likely to develop cardiovascular
      disease later in life, even if they are otherwise healthy. The reason why this occurs is
      unclear but may be related to blood vessel damage and increased inflammation that occurs
      during the preeclamptic pregnancy and persists postpartum. The purpose of this investigation
      is to 1) determine the mechanisms contributing to this lasting blood vessel damage and
      chronic inflammation, and to 2) identify factors (both physiological and pharmacological)
      that mitigate these negative effects in order to inform better clinical management of
      cardiovascular disease risk in women who have had preeclampsia.
