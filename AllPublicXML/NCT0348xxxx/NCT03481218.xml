    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to examine the differences in the quality of life among
      individuals with type 1 diabetes and individuals without chronic diseases, differences in the
      quality of life among men and women with type 1 diabetes and the differences in the quality
      of life among individuals with good and poor glycaemic control. The relationship between
      personality traits and the management of disease in patients with type 1 diabetes will also
      be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes affects the daily life of patients, chronic diseases have a major impact on the
      quality of life of individuals. Chronic illness affects family life of an individual, his
      professional life, as well as leisure activities, chronic illness can also increase worries,
      fears, feelings of sadness and helplessness.

      Past studies examining the quality of life construct in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
      showed that patients achieved lower levels of life quality, compared to individuals without
      T1D. Studies show that women with T1D achieve lower scores on the quality of life scales than
      men with T1D and differences in gender are already present in adolescence.

      Patients with poor glycaemic control achieve lower results on the quality of life scales, the
      effect of hemoglobin on the quality of life is direct, as well as indirect.

      The studies in which they examined the attitudes of personality traits with diabetes
      management show that two personality traits are associated with the management of the
      disease, the successful management of the disease is primarily associated with the
      conscientiousness. Concerning the effect of neuroticism on the management of the disease,
      research results are contradictory.
