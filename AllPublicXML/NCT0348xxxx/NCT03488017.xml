  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants in Each Response Category of Subject Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subject comfort is assessed via a custom-made questionnaire. This questionnaire includes several questions related to eye comfort (itchy feeling, foreign feeling, etc.) and uses a 5-point scale (from agree to do not agree) and a 4-point scale (from always to never). The percentage of participants in each response category is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of ocular adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of ocular adverse events related to the Ocular Coil or the associated procedures (placement and removal) is evaluated.</description>
