  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the results of three standard of care surgical methods
      [stapling versus selective suture ligation (cut, then sew) versus single suture ligation
      (sew, then cut) of the dorsal venous complex (DVC)] during robotic prostate surgery to see
      which is better for the patient's recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dorsal venous complex (DVC) lies on top of the prostate gland, and carries blood away
      from the penis. It has to be tied off, or ligated, to remove the prostate gland. The DVC lies
      very close to nerves that help men get and maintain erections. In addition, the DVC is close
      to muscles that control passing urine. How the DVC is handled during prostate surgery may
      result in cancer being left behind to grow and spread in the body. The purpose of this study
      is to compare the results of stapling versus selective suture ligation (cut, then sew) versus
      single suture ligation (sew, then cut) of the DVC during robotic prostate surgery to see
      which is better for the patient's recovery.

      This research is being done because doctors do not know which of these three commonly-used
      methods is better to reduce blood loss and reduce the chance of cancer left behind during
      surgery, and regain urine control and improve erectile function after surgery. Doctors also
      do not know if these methods affect the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in the blood
      after surgery.
