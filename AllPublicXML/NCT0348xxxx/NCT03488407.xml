  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred treatment for patients with
      ST-segment acute coronary syndrome. The radial access is an established approach, associated
      with a reduction in vascular access related complications after primary percutaneous coronary
      interventions. The purpose of this study is to examine the baseline characteristics, risk
      factors, procedural parameters and complications in patients with STEMI taken for primary
      angioplasty by radial access.

      Data of all patients with acute STEMI with primary PCI through radial access is to be
      evaluated for baseline characteristics and procedural parameters and complications. Patients
      in the prospective study are followed up till discharge and any in-hospital complication
      noted.

      This was a prospective, observational and descriptive study. Three hundred fifteen
      consecutive patients with an ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated
      with primary angioplasty by radial access, admitted between March 2016 and Feb 2017 were
      analyzed for their baseline characteristics, risk factors, and procedural parameters,
      complications and outcomes. High risk sub-groups analysis was also done. High risk groups
      includes patients with age &gt;75yrs, cardiogenic shock, severe LV systolic dysfunction, acute
      left ventricular failure, high degree AV block, right ventricular infarction and low BMI. The
      study is conducted among patients with acute STEMI, considered for primary PCI through radial
      artery access at operator discretion.

      This study analyzed the baseline characteristics of patients which includes clinical history,
      clinical examination, ECG, 2D ECHO, coronary angiogram to evaluate cardiovascular risk
      factors.
