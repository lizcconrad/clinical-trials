  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic technique that takes pictures of organs of
      the body. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves that cannot be felt. This makes specific
      organs, blood vessels, or tumors easier to see. Diffusion MRI lets us measure the motion of
      water in the tumor.

      The purpose of this study is to see if new MRI methods can give us more information about the
      tumor.

    <description>The study is designed to determine if the MRI will provide quantitative imaging biomarkers to predict or assess early treatment response in R/M head and neck cancers. The MR data will be compared with clinical follow-up data. Additional sequence parameters.</description>
