  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E is the fifth known human viral hepatitis and is probably the most common cause of
      acute viral hepatitis in the world. The incidence of acute hepatitis E is estimated at 3
      million human cases per year worldwide, with around 70,000 deaths. Most cases occur in
      endemic countries, but the number of cases in low-endemic areas has increased. HEV
      seroprevalence is high in developing countries, such as India and Southeast Asia, ranging
      from 27-80%. Acute disease mortality is 1-4%, with risk being higher in pregnant women and
      immunodeficient patients.

      The four more prevalent genotypes are allocated into two groups. Epidemic hepatitis E
      includes genotypes 1 and 2, which are considered human viruses and have caused the epidemics
      of hepatitis. These forms are transmitted mainly by contaminated water and the fecal-oral
      route. endemic hepatitis E includes genotypes 3 and 4, which are considered swine viruses
      (common in domestic and wild pigs), capable of infecting humans as an accidental host and
      therefore considered zoonotics.

      The course and clinical presentation of hepatitis E is highly variable. The detailed
      mechanisms that lead to the different clinical outcomes in hepatitis E are only partially
      understood. It is known that both viral factors (genotype and dose of inoculum) and host
      factors (presence of previous liver disease, pregnancy and distinct genetic polymorphisms)
      determine the course of infection. In most cases, hepatitis E causes self-limited illness,
      lasting from a few days to weeks, with an average of 4-6 weeks. However, in developed
      countries it can cause chronic disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis, especially in
      patients who are transplanted, have hematological malignancies requiring chemotherapy, or
      have infection with HIV.

      Hepatitis E is an underdiagnosed disease, partly due to the use of serological tests with low
      sensitivity. Diagnosis can be made indirectly by detecting antibodies against HEV in the
      serum, or directly by detecting the genome of the virus in blood or other body fluids. The
      tests for anti-hepatitis E antibody screening are commercially available, but none of them
      has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unfortunately, the sensitivity
      and specificity of these tests vary greatly and this could explain the discrepancies in rates
      of anti-hepatitis E antibodies published for the various populations studied. The tests for
      viral RNA in serum and feces are confirmatory, but still experimental.
