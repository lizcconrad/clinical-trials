      This is a Prospective, Randomized, Vehicle‐controlled, Double‐blind, Multi-center, 3-arm
      study assessing the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of B244 delivered as an intranasal
      spray for preventive treatment in subjects with episodic migraine.

      At Screening and Baseline, all subjects must experiences 4-14 migraine days per month and
      3-14 migraine attacks per month and no more than 14 headache days per month in the 3 months
      prior to screening.

      The total duration of the study will be approximately 16 weeks. Participants will report for
      a Screening visit and if all inclusion criteria are met, subjects will go through a one month
      baseline period prior to randomization. Subjects will come in for visits at Day 28 (Week 4),
      Day 56 (Week8), Day 84 (Week12), and Day 112 (Week 16).

      Efficacy will be assessed by change in migraine attacks, days, and hours. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected for standard safety laboratory testing and the effect of the drug
      on inflammatory biomarkers. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

      Investigators plan to enroll 303 total subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 so that an
      equal number of subjects will be treated in each arm of the study.
