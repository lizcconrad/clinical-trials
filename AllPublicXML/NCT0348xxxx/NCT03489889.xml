      A manipulation and an integral part of the pharmaceutical practice, where, in addition to the
      supply of medicines and personalized products, they represent an alternative to the
      therapeutic schemes, manipulating drugs of almost all of them as therapeutic categories.

      One of the products and ursodeoxycholic acid, commercially known as Ursacol, a bile acid
      physiologically present in human bile, approved by Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária
      (ANVISA), among several indications, for the treatment of the symptomatic form of primary
      biliary cholangitis, autoimmune etiology and predominant incidence in female.

      This is a prospective, cross-over, interventional and open-label study, where patients
      attending the inclusion and exclusion criteria are attended by the Instituto Central do
      Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (ICHC-FMUSP)
      Pharmacy Division in the Pharmaceutical Care sector.

      As patient information as well as the prescribed drugs, compiled by a data collection
      instrument from the ICHC-FMUSP Pharmacy Division and a semi-structured questionnaire.

      The therapeutic efficacy of Ursodeoxycholic Acid 300 mg tablet and capsules was measured
      comparing the liver enzyme parameters: alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase,
      alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin in three times:
      before treatment begins, in the middle of treatment and at the end of treatment.
