      The purpose of this study is to identify a core fMRI feature that determines migrainous brain
      and plastic fMRI features that changes with longitudinal courses of migraine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is associated with functional alterations in specific brain networks. The
      investigators aimed to identify network abnormalities which remain unchanged throughout the
      longitudinal course of migraine. The investigators also aimed to identify networks which
      change in association with changes in migraine frequency and associated psychiatric
      conditions. The investigators expect these can serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis
      of migraine brain and monitoring of disease severity.

    <description>To ensure inter-ictal fMRI, confirm that the subject has no migraine for at least 48 hours before the procedure.
Record the time difference between the date on the day of fMRI and the date of the last headache attack and record whether the headache on the day of fMRI is absent or not.
On the third day after MRI, examine whether the subject has headache or not.</description>
