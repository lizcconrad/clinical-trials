    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to
      assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability and steady-state plasma trough concentration of
      flexible-dosed aripiprazole once-daily administration in children and adolescents with
      Tourette's syndrome. A total of around 120 subjects will be randomized to aripiprazole (2~20
      mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 60 subjects in each group), for treatment of 8
      weeks.

      Screening phase: It can last up to 42 days, including the screening visit (V1), a washout
      period when applicable, additional screening visit (V1a) and baseline visit (V2). The
      screening phase will serve the following purposes: 1) To allow for appropriate washout of
      prohibited medications; 2) To review the screening data; 3) To establish a pretreatment
      baseline of critical outcome measures.

      Treatment phase: It lasts 8 weeks; the purpose of the treatment phase is to assess the
      efficacy, safety, tolerability and steady-state plasma trough concentration of aripiprazole
      in the treatment of children and adolescents with Tourette's syndrome.

      Safety follow-up phase: All subjects will be followed up for safety (adverse events) at Day
      16 after the final medication via telephone

    <description>The objective of the primary analysis is to compare the efficacy of flexible-dosed aripiprazole oral solution (2~20 mg/day) with placebo in the suppression of tics in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome. The efficacy is assessed by the changes of total tic scores (TTS) from randomization to the last visit (Week 8) on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).</description>
