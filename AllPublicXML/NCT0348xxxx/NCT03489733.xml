        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy term-born male and female infants (gestational Age ≥37+0, twins allowed)

          -  Birth weight ≥ 2500 g and ≤ 4500 g

          -  Age at enrollment: ≤ 28 days of life

          -  At risk of developing atopic diseases

          -  Free of atopy symptoms at Screening and at any time before randomization

          -  Feeding regimen at any time before Screening (V1) and Baseline (V2, infants who will
             receive Interventional Product (IP)): no infant formula feeding and solid foods
             allowed (in order to exclude prior sensitization) except amino acid formula (e.g.
             Neocate Infant), maltodextrin or glucose solution/gel; breastfeeding allowed

          -  Subject's parents/caregivers willing to comply with the feeding regimen during the
             intervention period. Subject's parents/caregivers will decide which feeding regimen
             will be used (IP or breast milk):

               -  IP regimen (intervention or control group): only IP and breast milk until at
                  least 120 days of life

               -  breastfeeding regimen (reference group): exclusively breast milk until at least
                  120 days of life.

               -  No other infant formulas or solid foods are allowed.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Triplets or quadruplets

          -  Premature delivery (gestational age ≤ 36+6)

          -  Neonatal illnesses that might have an impact on allergy development (based on
             Investigator's decision)

          -  Significant congenital abnormalities

          -  Participation in another clinical study with an IP or study method that would
             influence the outcome of this study

          -  Reason to presume that the subject's parents/caregivers are unable to meet study plan
             requirements.
