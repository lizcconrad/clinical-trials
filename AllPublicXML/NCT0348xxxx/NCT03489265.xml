  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accidental bowel leakage (fecal incontinence) increases in people who have diarrhea and
      sensations of urgency to have a bowel movement. Drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) that
      reduce diarrhea improve accidental bowel leakage, but loperamide has disadvantages: it is
      difficult to find a dose that does not cause constipation, and it does not reduce urge
      sensations. Eluxadoline is a new drug that is effective for reducing diarrhea, abdominal
      pain, and urgency in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and it may be less likely than
      loperamide to cause severe constipation. Therefore, eluxadoline may help patients manage
      accidental bowel leakage caused by diarrhea. The chemical name for Viberzi® is eluxadoline.

      The primary aims of this study are to find out if eluxadoline at a dose of 100 mg orally
      twice a day will reduce the average number of days the patient has accidental bowel leakage,
      and to see if the rate of accidental bowel leakage increases when the patient stops taking
      eluxadoline. Additional goals are to find out if eluxadoline decreases diarrhea and urge
      sensations.

      This is a small (pilot) study to show whether eluxadoline is an effective way of treating
      accidental bowel leakage. If the study shows this, a larger study will be needed. There are
      three phases to this 12-week study: (1) A two-week run-in period to see if the patient meets
      the inclusion criteria. (2) Two months for treatment including one month on eluxadoline and
      one on placebo (sugar pills) twice a day. (3) A two-week follow-up to see what happens when
      you stop taking eluxadoline.

      To participate in the study, patients should be aged 18 or older. Patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease, anal fissures, or congenital malformations will be excluded.

      The primary outcome is the average number of days per week with any solid or liquid bowel
      accidents. Additional information includes: (1) Number of days per week the patient takes
      loperamide, (2) days per week with loose or watery stools, (3) days per week with moderate to
      strong urge sensations, and (4) questionnaires to measure the severity of accidental bowel
      leakage, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. There will be up to 38 patients in the
      study.

    <description>For each visit to the clinic, compute the previous week's BSI scores for anxiety. If more than two items are not answered, the score is not valid. Scores of 0 to 4 are added across items with missing items being replaced by the average for the present items, and the summary score is transformed into a T-score in which the average score is 50 and 10 is equivalent to a standard deviation in the reference sample. A score of 60 represents one standard deviation above the population mean for severity of anxiety.</description>

The choices are -2=strongly prefer loperamide, -1=somewhat prefer loperamide, 0=no preference, 1=somewhat prefer study drug, and 2=strongly prefer study drug. The range of scores is -2 to +2, with +2 being equivalent to a strong preference for the study drug over loperamide.</description>

    <measure>Preference for eluxadoline or placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>At week 10, subjects will be asked to compare the second study drug to the first study drug for the previous 8 weeks. For subjects randomized to the &quot;Eluxadoline followed by Placebo&quot; group, the first study drug is eluxadoline; for subjects in the &quot;Placebo followed by Eluxadoline&quot; group the second study drug is eluxadoline. To estimate the preference of subjects for eluxadoline, the preference of the first group for the first study period and the preferences of the second group for the second study period will be averaged. The range of outcome scores is -2 to +2 with +2 representing a strong preference for eluxadoline over placebo. (The excluded groups are available as a way to assess whether order effects interfere with the measurement of preferences for eluxadoline vs. placebo.)</description>
