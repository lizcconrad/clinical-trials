    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to
      assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and the steady-state plasma trough concentration of
      aripiprazole flexible-dosed in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of Autistic
      Disorder. Approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive
      aripiprazole (2 to 15 mg) or placebo treatment for 8 weeks

      Screening Phase: up to 42 days (consisting of a Screening Visit (V1), a washout period and
      Interim Screening Visit (V1a) when applicable, and a Baseline Visit (V2). The Screening Phase
      will serve multiple purposes: to allow for appropriate washout of prohibited medications; to
      allow for review of screening data; to establish a pre-treatment baseline of key outcome
      measures.

      Treatment Phase: The duration of the treatment is 8 weeks. The purpose of the treatment phase
      is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and steady-state plasma trough
      concentration of aripiprazole in the treatment of serious behavioral problems in children and
      adolescents with a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder..

      Safety Follow-up Phase: All subjects will be followed up for safety (adverse events) at Day
      16 after the last medication via telephone.

    <description>The objective of the primary analysis is to compare the efficacy of aripiprazole flexible-dosed (2 ~ 15 mg/day) with placebo in reducing serious behavioral problems, specifically irritability, agitation and self-injurious behavior, in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder. The efficacy is assessed by assessed by change from baseline to endpoint on the Irritability Subscale of the ABC (ABC-I).</description>
