  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an online randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing men who have sex with men (MSM)
      exposed to a crowdsourced intervention to MSM who did not receive the intervention to
      determine the effect on Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) testing.
      Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control using a
      computer-based allocation system. Participants will be assessed for primary and secondary
      outcomes four weeks after randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      700 MSM will be recruited through social media operated by gay organizations in China.
      Eligible participants will be born biologically male, age 16 years or older, report previous
      anal sex with another man, and reside in China. Men self-reporting previous HBV vaccination,
      HBV testing, or HCV testing will be excluded. After completing a baseline online survey,
      participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control arms with a 1:1 allocation
      ratio. The intervention will include two components: (1) a multimedia component will deliver
      two videos and two images promoting HBV and HCV testing developed through a crowdsourcing
      contest in China. (2) A participatory component will invite men to submit suggestions for how
      to improve crowdsourced videos and images. The control arm will not view any images or videos
      and will not be invited to submit suggestions. All participants will be offered reimbursement
      for HBV and HCV testing costs. The primary outcome is HBV and HCV test uptake confirmed
      through electronic submission of test report photos within four weeks of enrollment.
      Secondary outcomes include self-reported HBV and HCV test uptake, HBV vaccination uptake, and
      change in stigma toward people living with HBV measured through a follow-up survey after four
      weeks. Men with primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated using intention to treat
      and as-exposed analyses and compared using two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

    <time_frame>enrollment - 4 weeks after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous variable, defined as difference between Toronto Chinese HBV Stigma Scale score assessed at follow-up and baseline. Stigma toward people living with HBV will be measured at baseline and follow-up using 20 survey items that are each on a five point Likert scale. The 20 items were originally developed as the Toronto Chinese HBV Stigma Scale (potential range of 20 - 100), which has been previously validated and correlated to HBV testing behaviors among Chinese populations. Decreased stigma toward people living with HBV will be defined as a mean composite score that is less at follow-up compared to baseline.</description>
