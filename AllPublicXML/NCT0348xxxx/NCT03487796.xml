  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test the efficacy of an online, family-based intervention
      (MySTYLE) tailored to the relevant sexual health needs of non-heterosexual adolescent males
      and their parents/caregivers compared to an online family-based intervention that addresses
      general health topics. Adolescent males and their parents will be recruited from community
      organizations, medical clinics and schools in Jackson, MS. Interviews with youth, parents,
      and relevant community leaders will inform the development of the interventions. Youth and
      their parents/caregivers in both interventions will complete three assessments in the six
      months after enrolling. This study will provide a wealth of information about the degree to
      which this intervention may be disseminated for this highly vulnerable population of young
      people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the highest rates of HIV in the U.S. have been concentrated among young men
      who have sex with men (MSM), especially those of color. Unfortunately, evidenced-based
      intervention programs for non-heterosexual Black adolescent males (nHBAM) do not exist. Drs.
      Brown and Crosby have each designed, tested (in the context of NIH-funded RCTs) behavioral
      interventions targeting young people at-risk of HIV acquisition. Also, their previous work
      demonstrates that parental involvement prevents sexual risk behavior by adolescents. They
      will adapt key elements of STYLE, an efficacious HIV prevention program for adolescents and
      their parents/caregivers, to be relevant for nHBAM. A formative phase will use in-depth
      interviews to assess and identify the needs of nHBAM and their parents/caregivers. Work
      groups, composed of youth, parents/caregivers, stakeholders, and investigators, will tailor
      and refine the content in an iterative process with a sophisticated media company (MEE
      studios). MySTYLE is proposed to be a series of eight online novella episodes designed to
      increase relevant knowledge, attitudes, and sexual protective behaviors of nHBAM. The project
      will take place in Jackson MS, which has the highest prevalence of HIV among urban MSM in the
      U.S. and the third highest rate among Black MSM under the age of 25. Adolescents and parents
      will be recruited from community organizations, medical clinics and schools. The feasibility
      and effect sizes of MySTYLE, compared to an attention-equivalent control group receiving
      general health information, will be tested with a cohort of 72 nHBAM and their parents.
      Interventions effect sizes will be determined for sexual behaviors, HIV testing, and
      psychosocial mediators (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, communication between adolescents and
      their parents/caregivers relative to sex, safer sex, and sexuality).

    <measure>HIV Knowledge (Adolescent)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3- and 6-months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of HIV knowledge that will be used comes from work conducted by Dr. Brown. Dr. Brown's brief HIV-related knowledge and attitudes scales have demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability (r =0.67 to 0.83) in a delayed education control group, and good internal consistency (Î± = 0.62 to 0.79).</description>

    <measure>Condom Attitudes Scale-Adolescent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3- and 6-months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Condoms Attitudes Scale was developed to measure adolescents' attitudes about condom use. Responses to this 23-item scale are on a 7-point Likert-style scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The CAS-A has an internal consistency of .8.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Condom Use Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3- and 6-months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Condom Use Self-Efficacy scale included in this study will be that which was previously tested by Dr. Richard Crosby with young Black males (Cronbach's alpha was .83). This 9-item scale assesses participants' confidence in their ability to properly use condoms. Scale items are rated on a Likert scale that ranges from 1 (very sure I could not) to 4 (very sure I could). Scale scores range from 9-36 with higher scores indicating greater perceived ability to properly use condoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy for HIV Prevention (Adolescent)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3- and 6-months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Efficacy for HIV Prevention scale was developed to assess adolescents' perceived self-efficacy to engage in behavior that prevents the acquisition of HIV. It uses 12 items that use assess prevention and risk-reduction behaviors such as the ability to obtain, carry, and use condoms; limit the number of sexual partners; talk with partners about safer sex and recognize dangerous drug use. The items have four response options from &quot;very sure&quot; to &quot;couldn't do it.&quot; It has been frequently used in adolescents and in Project STYLE, with 721 youth in three different cities, it demonstrated an internal consistency alpha of 0.89.</description>

    <measure>Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3- and 6-months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ARBA, currently used in Dr. Brown's other federally-funded projects is a reliable and valid structured interview assessing self-reported sexual behaviors. It assesses type of sexual behavior (i.e., anal, oral, vaginal) in the past 3 months, frequency of sex, age of sexual debut, and number and gender of partners. Additional questions cover use of barrier method contraception, sex with high-risk partners, exchanging sex for drugs, reasons for condom nonuse, frequency and quantity of substance use and having sex while using alcohol/drugs.</description>

    <measure>Parent Adolescent Sexual Communication Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3- and 6-months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Miller Sexual Communication Scale assesses the process and content of sexual communication between parents and adolescents. Youth and parents complete separate versions. Evidence supports internal consistencies between .65 and .86. Each item is rated on a Likert scale 1 (not true) to 7 (very true) with scale scores ranging from 6-42. Higher scores indicate better communication about sexual behaviors.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligibility criteria for adolescents in all phases of the project will be: 1) at least 14
        years of age but no more than 18; 2) stably-housed (have resided with the same adult
        caregiver for the past 6 months and no plans to leave the city or caregiver in the next 6
        months). We understand that this will preclude homeless youth who may be at risk for HIV
        but MySTYLE will not be designed to address the numerous structural need of chronically
        homeless youth; 3) the ability to read and speak English; 4) identify as a biological male;
        5) and identify racially as Black African American.

        Eligibility criteria for Parents/caregivers for all phases of the project will be: 1)
        parent/caregiver or trusted adult of an adolescent who is potentially eligible for
        enrollment into the study; and 2) English speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:Exclusion criteria will be: a) not able to provide meaningful assent as
        determined by research staff, b) known HIV-infection (staff will facilitate entry into care
        if needed). Although we expect that most enrolled youth with be non-heterosexual Black
        adolescent males, heterosexual youth who enroll will be able to complete all intervention
        activities.
