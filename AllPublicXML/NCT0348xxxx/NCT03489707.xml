  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find ways to screen for anal cancer among gay,
      bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). This study will try to find out if
      persons will do annual anal cancer screening, what factors are associated with repeated
      screening, and how this effects a person's decision to have high-resolution anoscopy.
