  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study to test Sym022 in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to see
      if Sym022 is safe and tolerable for patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic
      solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas that are refractory to available therapy or for which
      no standard therapy is available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) of Sym022, an anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3 (anti-LAG-3) monoclonal antibody
      (mAb). The goal is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of sequential escalating doses of Sym022 when administered once every 2 weeks
      (Q2W) by intravenous (IV) infusion to patient cohorts with locally advanced/ unresectable or
      metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas that are refractory to available therapy or
      for which no standard therapy is available. If an MTD is not identified, a maximum
      administered dose (MAD) will be determined. Sym022 will be given to patients in escalating
      dose cohorts; each patient will be given one fixed dose level.
