  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limb loss is frequently associated with postamputation pain that can be challenging to treat
      and often involves opioids. Advances in the field of neuromodulation has led to development
      of an intentionally reversible percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) system that
      has had promising results when treating chronic postamputation pain. PNS may offer sustained
      pain relief even after the treatment period has ended. Currently, there is no convincing
      evidence regarding the role of PNS in the acute postoperative period, which may be a critical
      time to control pain as those with higher pain appear to be at higher risk for developing
      persistent post-procedural pain. The investigators of this study aim to evaluate the
      feasibility and effects of PNS in the acute postoperative period and determine the
      feasibility of completing a randomized controlled treatment outcome study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      16 patients with new nontraumatic transfemoral or transtibial amputation will be enrolled in
      the study

      Having met inclusion criteria, the patients will be randomized to experimental or control
      groups

      Patients in the experimental group undergo placement of PNS leads within 7 days of amputation
      surgery

      Patients in both groups will be treated with standard pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain
      therapies and evaluated weekly for 8 weeks, then at 3, 6, and 12 months postamputation

    <description>Instrument which measures subjects' disruption in various aspects of life secondary to chronic pain, including family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and life-support activities. Each category is rated on an 11-point scale from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;10&quot; with &quot;0&quot; defined as &quot;No Disability&quot; and &quot;10&quot; defined as &quot;Worst Disability.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>13-question instrument to assess rumination (4 questions), magnification (3 questions), and helplessness (6 questions). The survey asks participants to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each question is scored on a 0-4 scale with 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;all the time&quot;. Higher scores indicate a greater tendency towards catastrophizing pain.</description>
