  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MT-3724 in
      combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in subjects with relapsed or refractory
      CD20-positive B-Cell NHL.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label two-part study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      MT-3724 in combination with GEMOX in relapsed or refractory CD20 positive B-cell Lymphoma
      patients.

      Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724 in
      combination with standard treatment of GEMOX

      Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 from
      Part 1 in the MTD Expansion Cohort, where MT-3724 will be given at the MTD in combination
      with GEMOX. In addition, the PK, PD, immunogenicity and tumor response at the MTD of MT-3724
      in combination with GEMOX will be more thoroughly evaluated in Part 2.

      It is anticipated that up to 64 patients will be enrolled. Treatment will continue for up to
      four 28 day cycles (approximately 4 months).

          -  Received radiotherapy to tumor lesions that would be chosen as target lesions
             (measurable disease) within 4 weeks before the start of treatment, unless the lesion
             exhibited objective progression between the radiotherapy and the screening according
             to the Lugano Classification for NHL.

          -  Palliative radiotherapy to non-target lesions is allowed at the investigator's
             discretion after consultation with the Medical Monitor and sponsor.

          -  Received systemic immune modulators within 2 weeks before the start of treatment
             including but not limited to systemic corticosteroids &gt;20 mg/day of prednisone
