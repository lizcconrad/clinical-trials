    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with remote ischemic conditioning
      is of sufficient promise to improve outcome before conducting a larger clinical trial to
      examine its effectiveness as a treatment for intracerebral hemorrhage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease with a high rate of severe disability and
      death, while no specific treatment has been proven to improve functional outcome. As a
      result, new approaches need to be developed to treat intracerebral hemorrhage. Animal and
      human trials showed treatment with remote ischemic conditioning was safe for intracerebral
      hemorrhage. And repetitive remote ischemic conditioning has been shown to improve
      sensorimotor and neuropathological outcomes following experimental hemorrhagic stroke.
      Therefore, we hypothesize that repetitive remote ischemic conditioning could improve
      functional outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. We design this prospective,
      multicenter, randomized controlled double-blind trial to determine whether treatment with
      remote ischemic conditioning is of sufficient promise to improve outcome before conducting a
      larger clinical trial to examine its effectiveness as a treatment for intracerebral
      hemorrhage.

    <description>Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is induced by 5 cycles of 5 min of healthy upper limb ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion. Limb ischemia was induced by inflations of a blood pressure cuff to either 200 mm Hg or 25 mm Hg above systolic blood pressure only when the systolic blood pressure of the patient is above 175 mm Hg. RIC will be conducted twice daily for 7 days. Additionally,the patients will be treated with standard medical treatment according to 2014 chinese guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage.</description>
