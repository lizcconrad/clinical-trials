  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, non-randomized, open label study of liposomal irinotecan with
      FOLFOX in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with resectable or borderline resectable
      pancreatic cancer. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and
      feasibility of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

             the results of the study or that puts the subject at high risk for treatment
             complications, in the opinion of the treating physician.
