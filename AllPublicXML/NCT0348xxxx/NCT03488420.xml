  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this registry is the characterization of patients with atrial fibrillation
      (AF) with confirmed valvular heart disease (VHD) who are prescribed edoxaban in a real-life
      clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, multicenter, edoxaban Canadian registry of adults
      (≥18) diagnosed with AF within the last 12 months with confirmed VHD, according to local
      standard procedures and judged by the investigator to be at risk of stroke and in whom
      anticoagulation with NOAC is clinically indicated and who are prescribed edoxaban. A total of
      about 300 patients will be enrolled from approximately 15 sites in Quebec. Patients will be
      treated according to standard local practices. There is no formal interventions. Treatment
      decisions are left to the physician's discretion.

      Registry data will be collected by the investigator or delegate at baseline, 6, 12 and 24
      months and recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).

      Data available in the patient's file will be collected. The only procedure to be performed in
      the context of this registry is the completion of questionnaires: the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA©) test and the Anti-Clot-Treatment Scale (ACTS-Q) questionnaire.
