  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to guidelines, when a mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia occurs (capillary blood glucose
      &lt; 4.0 mmol/L), 15-20g of rapidly absorbed carbohydrates should be ingested. Patients should
      re-test and re-ingest 15-20g carbohydrates every 15 minutes until they recover from
      hypoglycemia. These recommendations were principally based on two studies conducted in the
      80s before the introduction of intensive insulin therapy secondary to the DCCT trial and with
      insulin formulations with largely different pharmacokinetic profiles from current insulin
      analogs. Recent studies suggest that with current insulin analogs and intensive therapeutic
      approach, 15g of carbohydrates may be insufficient to rapidly correct an important proportion
      of hypoglycemic episodes. It is thus important to determine if the recommended hypoglycemia
      treatment remains the recommendation.

    <description>Participants will be admitted at the research center at 7:00 after an overnight fast. A venous catheter will be inserted into an arm vein for blood sampling purposes. A subcutaneous insulin bolus will be administered to induce hypoglycemia. Oral treatment (16g of carbohydrates or 32g of carbohydrates) will be given when plasma glucose levels are at the target threshold of &lt; 3.0 mmol/L or 3.0-3.5 mmol/L. Hypoglycemia symptoms will be assessed every 10 minutes by the participant using a validated scale starting from the time of insulin bolus until hypoglycemia recovery. One hour after hypoglycemia recovery, a standardized meal will be given.</description>
