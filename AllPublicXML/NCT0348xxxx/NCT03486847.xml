      This study evaluates the incidence of postoperative atelectasis after general anesthesia with
      prone position using lung ultrasound in children age &lt; 3 years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atelectasis is common in pediatric patients after general anesthesia. Particularly, infants
      are more likely to develop atelectasis or ventilation-perfusion imbalance after general
      anesthesia because of the immature ribs and respiratory muscles, the high compliance of the
      rib cage and a significant reduction in functional residual capacity (FRC) during general
      anesthesia. Previous studies have reported that alveolar recruitment and positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be used to reduce atelectasis in children. Also, previous
      studies have shown that the lung ultrasound can be used to evaluate the degree of atelectasis
      during general anesthesia in children.

      However, none of the previous studies investigated the incidence of atelectasis, the effect
      of alveolar recruitment, and the PEEP in pediatric patients under general anesthesia with
      prone position. The purpose of this study was to evaluate previously described parameters
      using lung ultrasound.
