  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two rehabilitation programs to improve arm function for
      patients with scleroderma. This is a Phase 2 randomized controlled trial in which
      participants will be assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 18 weeks. Participants will be
      randomized into an intensive intervention (8 individual sessions of occupational therapy plus
      a home exercise app) versus a home app treatment alone. The results of this study will be
      used to design a large multi-site trial in which optimized rehabilitation strategies can be
      used to help patients improve their arm function.

  <detailed_description>

      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Determine the short and longer-term effects of an intensive (8-week in-person
           occupational therapy treatment with prescribed home exercises) on improving arm function
           versus home exercise alone.

           This study's hypothesis is that immediately following treatment at 8 weeks and at 18
           weeks, participants randomized to the in-person occupational therapy will have
           significant improvements in the QuickDASH disability measure, PROMIS physical function
           measure, and total active hand function compared to the home exercise alone.

        2. Determine how adherence to home exercise in both groups influences treatment effects.

      This study's hypothesis is that adherence will independently predict improvement in outcomes
      at 8 and 18 weeks regardless of treatment group assignment and that higher adherence to the
      home exercise program will result in greater and more long-lasting improvements.

    <description>self-report questionnaire of physical function and symptoms. This is an 11-item questionnaire in which difficulty in several tasks involving the upper extremity are rated as well as interference and severity of symptoms. Items are averaged and converted to a 0 - 100 scale; a higher score indicates worse function.</description>

    <description>Summary score of degrees of active range of motion in hand. This is calculated by summing the total active range of motion for each finger and thumb by goniometer (260 degrees in each finger and 135 in the thumb). A total score of 1125 is possible and a higher score equals more range of motion</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo 8 sessions with an occupational therapist. Participants will meet with the occupational therapist to establish the home exercise program and set up the home exercise app. The app has videos depicting each exercise and ability to track adherence to exercises. The occupational therapy consists of the following which will be provided as appropriate:
Thermal Modalities Hot packs, focused on areas with limitations Paraffin, focused on digital limitations
Application of the Physiotouch (a low-intensity negative pressure device)
Passive Range of Motion
Active Range of Motion
