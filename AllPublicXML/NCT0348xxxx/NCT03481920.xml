  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics, safety and efficacy of PEGPH20
      in combination with Avelumab in adult patients with chemotherapy resistant advanced or
      locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This is a multi-center, open-label,
      non-randomized trial.

    <textblock>
      The reported response rate with check-point inhibitors in PDAC is 0 %. This study tests the
      hypothesis that elimination of HA in pancreas tumor microenvironment mediated by PEG PH20
      will result in increased tumor vascularization and vessel patency as well as stromal
      remodeling with increase immune infiltrate. These effects may facilitate the activity of
      check-point inhibitors like avelumab by at least two mechanisms including increase in drug
      delivery and increasing immune infiltrate.

    <description>PEGPH20, a multi-site PEGylated enzyme generated by conjugating N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-butanoic acid (MSBA30K/B or PEG) and recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20). PEGPH20 has a half-life of approximately 2 days, thereby enabling systemic activity and sustained duration of action to degrade HA. In many different tumor types tested in murine xenograft models, response to PEGPH20 has been shown to be more robust for tumors characterized by higher HA expression.</description>
