  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label non-randomized study enrolling up to 20 healthy participants and up to 30
      participants with cystic fibrosis to establish a healthy versus disease comparison. Each
      participant will receive a mixture of inert gas (perfluoropropane (PFP)) in a ratio of 79%
      PFP to 21% oxygen as a contrast agent to enhance visualization of the airway and alveolar
      spaces using magnetic resonance imaging of inert gas/oxygen mixtures. The study consists of a
      screening visit followed by up to 2 study visits.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of conventional 'thermally' polarized
      perfluorinated gases (19F) mixed with oxygen to detect changes in ventilation using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). A secondary goal is to assess the repeatability and the
      within-subject variability of these findings in CF lung disease. This is an open label pilot
      study expanding on work by other investigators currently using this technique in human
      subjects. Projection images using controlled breathing techniques will be obtained using 19F
      MRI, correlating spirometric variables with regional distribution of the gases.
