    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to incorporate multidimensional self-management programs into
      the routine care of epilepsy patients. Consenting patients will enroll in one of four
      interventions that help improve medication adherence, increase seizure awareness and
      documentation, improve memory and deal with stress and depression.

    <textblock>
      Though tremendous advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with
      epilepsy, much remains to be done when it comes to improving their psychosocial well-being.
      Many individuals with epilepsy have difficulty adhering to treatment, documenting their
      seizure types, coping with memory difficulties, dealing with stress, and suffer from
      depression. These factors limit the quality of life of epilepsy patients and prevent them
      from realizing their full potential.

      Patients will enroll in one of four interventions that help improve medication adherence,
      increase seizure awareness and documentation, improve memory and deal with stress and
      depression. Patient assessments will be conducted before and after intervention to gauge the
      efficacy of the programs.

      The specific aims of this study are to assess the feasibility and patient acceptability of
      incorporating multidimensional self-management and psychosocial interventions into routine
      epileptic care, as well as, determine whether these incorporations improve self-management,
      quality-of-life, and other measures of well-being.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be enrolled in one module of own choice. Except for Module 3 Submodule 2, every module will consist of a particular intervention, as well as, its accompanying set of assessments. Prior to being given the intervention, subjects assigned to a given module will be randomly assigned to either an Immediate Intervention (II) or a Delayed Intervention (DI) group. Although every subject will receive the intervention, the timing of the intervention and assessments will distinguish the II and DI group.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>To be administered at baseline (upon subject screening), pre-intervention (with 2 weeks prior to intervention), post-intervention (between 6 weeks to 3 months post-intervention), and delayed post-intervention (within 4&amp;1/2 to 6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a well-validated measure of quality of life for epilepsy patients. The unit of measure is a composite score ranging from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The immediate intervention group will receive the module (a 1-2 hour course on either medication adherence, seizure documentation, memory improvement or stress management) right after a baseline assessment.
