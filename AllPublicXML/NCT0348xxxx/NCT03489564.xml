  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot &amp; Feasibility study will test the hypothesis that pregnant women who are more
      active will have better functioning mitochondria in vivo (higher ATPmax, via 31P-MRS), which
      will be positively related to maternal and infant mitochondrial function in vitro (higher
      oxygen consumption rates in primary myotubes and umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem
      cells, respectively). Twenty pregnant women (10 active and 10 sedentary) will be recruited in
      the first trimester of pregnancy determined from self-reported physical activity and
      assessment by activity monitors. Placental biospecimens will be collected during delivery for
      other molecular mitochondrial analyses.
