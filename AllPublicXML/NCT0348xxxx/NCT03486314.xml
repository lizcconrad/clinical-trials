  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple-dose administration of rifampin
      on the single dose PK of pevonedistat in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll approximately 20 participants. The study will be conducted in two
      Parts: Part A and optional Part B. Part A will have a drug-drug interaction (DDI) assessment.
      In Part A, participants will be assigned to:

      • Pevonedistat 50 mg/m^2 + Rifampin

      Eligible participants from Part A will continue treatment in optional Part B with
      pevonedistat in combination with SoC chemotherapy, docetaxel or carboplatin plus paclitaxel.
      The investigator will decide which SoC combination partner a participant will receive.

        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + Docetaxel

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 18 months. Participants will make a final visit to the clinic 30
      days after receiving their last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent therapy.

    <description>Percentage of participants who achieve an overall response per investigator's assessment at end of treatment, according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 guideline. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target and non target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm).Partial Response (PR): at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum of diameter. Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression (PD), taking as reference smallest sum of diameter; PD: at least 20% increase in sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference, smallest sum on study. In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>

    <description>Pevonedistat is given intravenously at 25 mg/m^2 in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 or at 20 mg/m^2 in combination with carboplatin AUC5+paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2; pevonedistat is given in combination on Day 1 and as a single agent on Days 3 and 5 of each 21-day cycle. Participants will be treated for up to 12 cycles or symptomatic deterioration or PD, treatment is discontinued for another reason, or until the study is stopped in Part B. The choice of combination partner (docetaxel or carboplatin + paclitaxel) will be based on investigator discretion. If the sponsor and investigator determine that a participant would derive clinical benefit from continued treatment, the participant may remain on the current combination therapy or receive pevonedistat as a single agent beyond 12 cycles.</description>
