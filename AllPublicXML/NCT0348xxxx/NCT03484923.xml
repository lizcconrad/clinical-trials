    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic stage IIIB/C/D or IV melanoma
             using AJCC edition 8

          -  Previously treated for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Subjects must have at
             least received the following treatments:

               -  V600BRAF wild-type patients: must have received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 single-agent, or
                  in combination with anti-CTLA-4 therapy

               -  V600BRAF mutant patients: must have received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 single-agent,
                  or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 therapy. In addition, subjects must have
                  received prior V600BRAF inhibitor therapy, either single-agent or in combination
                  with a MEK inhibitor

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  At least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1

          -  At least one lesion, suitable for sequential mandatory tumor biopsies (screening and
             on-treatment) in accordance with the biopsy guidelines specified in protocol. The same
             lesion must be biopsied sequentially.

          -  Screening tumor biopsy must fulfill the tissue quality criteria outlined in the
             protocol, as assessed by a local pathologist

        Key exclusion criteria common to all combination arms:

          -  Subjects with uveal or mucosal melanoma

          -  Presence of clinically active or unstable brain metastasis. Note: Subjects with
             unstable brain lesions who have been definitively treated with stereotactic radiation
             therapy, surgery or gamma knife therapy are eligible.

             - Subjects with brain lesions who are untreated (i.e. newly discovered brain lesions
             during screening) or received whole brain radiation must have documented stable
             disease as assessed by two consecutive assessments ≥ 4 weeks apart and have not
             required steroids for at least ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases within 4 weeks of initiation of
             study treatment.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy.

          -  Systemic chronic steroid therapy (˃ 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or any other
             immunosuppressive therapy 7 days prior to planned date of first dose of study
             treatment. Note: Local steroids such as topical, inhaled, nasal and ophthalmic
             steroids are allowed.

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune
             disease. Note: Subjects with vitiligo, controlled type I diabetes mellitus on stable
             insulin dose, residual autoimmune-related hypothyroidism only requiring hormone
             replacement or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment are permitted.

          -  Prior allogenic bone marrow or solid organ transplant

          -  History of known hypersensitivity to any of the investigational drugs used in this
             study
