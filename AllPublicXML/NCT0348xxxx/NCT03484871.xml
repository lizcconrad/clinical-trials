    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether reduced frequency of migraine attacks are
      associated with signal alternation and connectivity of cerebral cortex.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with migraine show reduced cortical thickness in regions subserving pain processing,
      and it is related to increasing headache frequency. In the past, only one study has shown a
      reversibility consequence of chronic nociceptive transmission, which normalizes when the pain
      is adequately treated. However, little is known whether these changes predispose to migraine
      or represent the effect of repeated migraine attacks. Our region of interest is reduced
      frequency of migraine attacks are associated with reversibility of signal alternation and
      functional connectivity of cerebral cortex.

      In 30 migraineurs with 8-14days with headache per months who already performed brain magnetic
      resonance imaging will be recruited. Treatment medications such as frovatriptan and
      topiramate will be used for 6 months. After 6 months, follow-up brain magnetic resonance
      imaging will be performed.

      The primary outcome is the longitudinal changes in functional connectivity in
      pain-processing/modulating brain regions. The secondary outcome is following: 1)longitudinal
      changes in structural and morphological alterations in brain regions of pain processing;
      2)structural, morphological, and functional correlates of treatment response; 3)changes in
      monthly migraine days, migraine frequecies, headache days, and headache frequencies after
      treatment; 4)responses to acute migraine treatment.
