  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is considered the first line medication for asthma, however, the
      therapeutic effect is markedly different even in patients with almost similar clinical
      manifestations. Our study was designed to explore the clinical and genetic factors that may
      influence the effectiveness of ICS in asthmatic children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The three major common classes of asthma controller medications include inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS), beta-2-agonists and leukotriene antagonists. Among them, ICS was now
      suggested as the first-line therapy demonstrated in Global Initiative for Asthma guideline
      updated in 2017.

      The response to asthma medication is markedly different even in patients with almost similar
      clinical manifestations. Despite the wide availability of therapeutic asthma medications and
      large studies supporting their efficacy, there is significant inter-personal variability in
      the response to each of the three major classes of asthma medications with a subgroup of
      patients that have limited disease control, persistent symptoms and exacerbations even under
      controller medications use. For example, inter-individual variability in therapeutic
      effectiveness to ICS in both asthma children and adults is significant, with 22 to 60% of
      patients being classified as non-responders.

      Although many factors can contribute to variation in response to therapy effectiveness, such
      as higher exhaled nitric oxide, higher total eosinophil counts, higher immunoglobulin E,
      lower forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) predicted. and lower concentration of
      methacholine needed to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 from baseline (PC20), it is still believed
      that genetic variability can also play an important role. Hence asthma represents a major
      burden with respect to mortality, morbidity and National Health Insurance costs, searching
      for appropriate mediations for asthma control is imperative and investigating the effect of
      genetic variability on therapy response is an important step to develop personalized
      prescription.
