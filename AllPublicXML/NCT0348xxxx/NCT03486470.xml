  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the size and the depth
      of the radial artery at the access points for established radial and new distal radial
      approach for the arteries of both arms
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radial approach for coronary and peripheral procedures is now well established due to both
      patient and operator preference and carries a lower risk of bleeding and mortality. The most
      lasting consequence of transradial procedures remains radial artery occlusion, which is
      mainly influenced by the artery diameter and the size of the sheath. As a new, more distal
      approach looms on the horizon, it is plausible to determine factors that could impact its
      feasibility. Since the success rate for artery cannulation depends to a great extent on the
      size and the depth of the artery, the current study examines both parameters, as well as
      whether they are influenced by variables such as sex, body mass index, handedness, or
      comorbidities i.e. diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

    <description>Measuring diameters of the radial artery at the access points for well established radial and new distal radial approach and finding or not a significant difference could have some implications for choosing the access radial site. At the end of a routine echocardiographic evaluation, four short axis measurements (one proximal and one distal on each arm) of the radial artery diameters will be done with a vascular probe.</description>
