    <textblock>
      Initial treatment in the management of acute mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) is
      controversial. Some authors have proposed a surgical approach, whereas others have advocated
      medical therapy (anticoagulation). In this study, the investigators analyzed and compared the
      results obtained with surgical and medical treatment to determine the best initial management
      for this disease.

    <textblock>
      Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is increasingly recognized as a cause of mesenteric
      ischemia. it must be distinguished from arterial and non occlusive types of ischemia, it
      accounts for 5% to 15% of all cases of mesenteric ischemia. Patients may have evocative
      signs,such as abdominal pain that is out of proportion to physical signs, nausea, or
      vomiting. However, a clinical diagnosis is often difficult because abdominal symptoms are non
      specific and high index of suspicion is often required for diagnosis.(1) Primary MVT
      accounted for 25% to 55% of cases in early studies, but recent reports show decline in
      primary MVT because of improvements in the diagnosis of hypercoagulable states.(2) Advances
      in new imaging techniques also have enabled early recognition of this disease without or
      before laparotomy.(3-5 ) Fortunately , there is no consensus about the initial management of
      MVT; Some authors have proposed an aggressive surgical approach (6) while others have
      advocated an initial conservative management with anticoagulation and close monitoring . ( 7)
      similarly,issue of second look laparotomy,mandatory or selective is yet not resolved.

      The present study is prompted to analyze our experience in an effort to resolve these
      controversies and the results obtained will be assessed to determine the best management
      strategy for this uncommon disease.

    <description>patients with confirmed diagnosis of acute MVT on CT scan will be treated conservatively In addition to usual care such as fluid and electrolyte balance, antibiotic coverage and nasogastric intubation ,intravenous heparin will be started and the dose is adjusted to maintain APTT levels at 2-2.5 times the normal. followed by oral anticoagulation (warfarin) for 6 months or for life in the presence of coagulation abnormality. All patients will be critically followed up(Clinically.. Radiologically ) for the progress of response of therapy , failure to improve or worsening in condition( appearance of signs of peritonitis such as guarding, rigidity and fever...or radiological signs of bowel infarction) will be assessed .
Factors that may affect the response such as ( age, duration from onset of the disease till starting therapy,underlying diseases,.. )also complications (hemorrhage, failure ,..)will be assessed</description>
