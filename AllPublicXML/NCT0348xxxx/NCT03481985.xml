  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to discern how closure of Fontan fenestrations in
      patients with single ventricle heart disease will affect hepatic congestion, a major
      determinant of chronic liver disease. We will employ transient elastography (Fibroscan) to
      obtain liver stiffness measurements (LSM) before and after fenestration closure to study the
      impact of this intervention on hepatic congestion.
