  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyze a relationship between information support provided by
      an interdisciplinary team and the levels of anxiety, pain and satisfaction with postoperative
      analgesia in children and adolescents subjected to thoracic surgeries.

      The study included 112 consecutive pediatric patients qualified for lateral thoracotomy or
      Ravitch procedure. The subjects were randomized to the control group (n=56) provided with a
      routine preoperative information from a nurse, and the experimental group (n=56) offered
      additional psychological consultation.

    <description>Anxiety was determined with a Polish version of the self-inventory, either for children between 9 and 14 years of age, i.e. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C; range: 20-60 pts) or for adolescents, i.e. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; range: 20-80 pts). The instrument consisting of two separate 20-item scales measuring state and trait anxiety. In this study, the levels of anxiety were determined twice: one day prior to surgery (both trait and state anxiety) and 48 h after the procedure (only state anxiety). The results were expressed as sten scores, from 1-10 (1-4 = low level of anxiety, 5-6 = moderate level of anxiety, &gt;7 = high level of anxiety).</description>
