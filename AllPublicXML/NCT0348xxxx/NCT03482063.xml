  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate chronic supplementation with Swisse Ultiboost
      Memory + Focus over a 12 week period on memory in individuals with optimal and sub-optimal
      nutrient profiles.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome will be short term memory, as measured by the spatial working memory task
      from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to investigate whether chronic supplementation
      with Swisse Ultiboost Memory + Focus over a 12 week period will improve measures of mood,
      general wellbeing and response to stress. Through investigations of blood vitamin markers,
      biomarkers of inflammation and neuroimaging techniques, this study aims to provide insight to
      the mechanisms through which the supplement is acting.

      This study is an exploratory phase III clinical trial, which will follow a randomised,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel groups design. One hundred and twenty participants
      will complete a 12 week intervention, which will involve three testing visits to Swinburne
      University, as well as in-home mood assessments. Of these, 60 participants will also complete
      an MRI component. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups; one receiving
      active supplementation of Swisse Ultiboost Memory + Focus, and the other receiving a placebo
      formulation.

      Prior to participants being enrolled in the study a telephone screening interview will be
      completed, to reduce the likelihood of ineligible participants attending study visits.
      Eligible participants will complete three study visits; a Screening and Practice visit (V0),
      Baseline Visit (V1), and the Final Visit (V2). The participant's baseline visit (V1) will be
      scheduled within two weeks of their screening and practice visit (V0). The participant's
      final visit (V2) will be scheduled 12 weeks (± 3 days) from the baseline visit (V1).
      Therefore, it is anticipated that participation in the trial will last a maximum of 14 weeks.

      For the 12 week supplementation period between their baseline (V1) and final (V2) visits,
      participants will be instructed to consume one tablet, twice a day, of either Swisse
      Ultiboost Memory + Focus or placebo, with a meal. Participants will be requested to abstain
      from the treatment on the day of their final visit.

      Participants will also be required to complete online mood assessments in their home, twice a
      week for the duration of the 12 week supplementation period. Two laboratory assessment points
      will be measured, at baseline (V1) and at the final visit (V2). Twenty four in-home
      assessment points will be measured, twice a week during participation in the study.

    <measure>Changes in short term memory, as measured by the spatial working memory task from the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In each trial participants are presented with a 4x4 white grid on a black background, with six grid positions containing white squares. Participants are given 3 seconds to remember where the white squares are located. The grid became blank and a series of four white squares were sequentially displayed in various grid positions for 2-seconds each. Participants responded with a yes/no response to indicate whether each square matched a position that was originally filled. In total, participants complete 14 trials, each of which are separated by a blank screen displayed for 2-seconds. Each trial was set such that two out of the four locations in the response series corresponded to the original grid locations, and two did not. The task requires participants to hold spatial information in working memory.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS measures the extent to which respondents have perceived events in their life as stressful over the last month. There are 14 items, each scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 'never' to 'very often'. Seven of these items are positively stated items, and therefore they are reverse scored. Higher scores on the PSS are associated with higher levels of perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of Mood States (PROMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS requires participants to indicate the degree to which they have identified with 65 mood-related adjectives over the past week. Each item is on a 5-point scale from 'not at all' to 'extremely'. Items are summed into six factors; Tensio n-Anxiety, Confusion-Bewilderment, Anger-Hostilit y, Depressio n-Dejection, Fatigue-Inertia and Vigor-Activit y.A Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score is computed as the sum of the first 5 factors minus Vigor-Activity. High scores indicate greater mood disturbance on all scales except Vigor-Activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS measures comprises of 21 items that pertain to affect- related symptoms for three sub-factors: depression, anxiety and stress. Participants must respond to each item to reflect their experiences over the past week. Each item is on a 4-point scale fro m 0 to 3, with a total range of scores from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate a higher degree of dysfunction and less desirable affect experience. A score of zero does not indicate positive mood, but rather the lack of presence of negative mood state symptoms. The DASS is considered relevant for both clinical and non-clinical populations as some experience of such symptoms is considered normal in day to day life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Subscale (STAI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) contains two subscales; one that measures the transient experiences of anxiety (STAI-S) and the other measures the more stable personality characteristic (STAI-T). The state subscale (STAI-S) contains 20 items, asking participants about to respond with how they are feeling 'right now', ranging from 'not at all' to 'very much so'. The total range of scores is from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Scales (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This task comprises of 16 100mm lines anchored at either end by antonyms. Participants must mark their current subjective state between the antonyms on each line, bearing in mind that each end of the scale represents an extreme. Each line is scored as millimetres to the mark from the negative antonym. From the scores, a factor analysis can isolate three factors; 'alertness', 'calmness' and 'contentedness'. Scores for each factor represent the unweighted average number of millimetres from the negative antonym for the individual scales contributing to the factor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress, Anxiety, Mental Fatigue, Concentration and Mental Stamina Visual Analogue Mood Scales (VAMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
