  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal discomfort is of the most important patient interest when in an unsedated
      colonoscopy examination. Water method for colonoscopy examination has been studied widely and
      evidence showed effectiveness in reducing discomfort and increase cecal intubation time and
      increasing cecal intubation rates in unsedated patients.

      Abdominal discomfort is of the most important patient interest when in an unsedated
      colonoscopy examination. Water method for colonoscopy examination has been studied widely and
      evidence showed effectiveness in reducing discomfort and increase cecal intubation time and
      increasing cecal intubation rates in unsedated patients. Our previous studies showed that
      water immersion method reduced the VAS score, accelerated the intubation time significantly
      without different changing cecal intubation rate. Previous right-sided vs. left-sided
      starting position colonoscopy study in sedated patients with air insufflation colonoscopy
      method showed that right-sided starting position improved the abdominal discomfort score and
      faster cecal intubation time. We want postulate that the right-sided starting position can
      also maximize the water method advantages in lowering the discomfort score, faster cecal
      intubation time and higher cecal intubation rates, and it will improve patient acceptance of
      water unsedated colonoscopy and willingness to repeat.

    <description>Modified-water immersion method colonoscopy is performed to patients with right-lateral starting position (RLP). Patients will lie in the right lateral position with both hips and knees flexed at the beginning and change the position into supine and at last left-lateral position when it is needed.</description>

    <description>Modified-water immersion method of colonoscopy refers to the freely episodic suction of the infused-water during colonoscopy insertion phase at a moment to negotiate the angulated colon to facilitate cecal intubation but not suction the mucosa. The original water immersion method only suctions the water when the colon is over-distended or it is dirty and exchanges it with the new cleans water during insertion then evacuates all of the water during withdrawal</description>
