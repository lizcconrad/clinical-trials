  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this non interventional study is to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and
      safety of the newly developed Ectoin Nasal Douche END01. Within the study, END01 will be used
      as concomitant therapy in addition to the use of a Xylometazoline-containing decongestant
      nasal spray.

      It will be investigated if the dosis of the used decongestant nasal spray might be reduced,
      the development of the disease might be positively influenced and/or the potentially occuring
      side effects (e.g. dryness of the nasal mucosa, sneezing) might be alleviated by using the
      Ectoin Nasal Douche as concomitant therapy.

      The current non-interventional study aims to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and
      safety of a decongestant Xylometazoline-containing nasal spray in comparison to use of a
      decongestant Xylometazoline-containing nasal spray together with an Ectoin-containing nasal
      douche in patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis.

      Efficacy will be studied by documentation of the following symptoms:

        -  oedema, redness (assessed by rhinoscopy)

        -  nasal obstruction, nasal secretion, headache/face pain, loss of sense of smell/taste

        -  sore throat, cough

      In parallel, participating patients will document their symptoms and the their quality of
      life over the entire study duration in patient diaries.

      Patients of both genders aged 6 years and above can take part in the study if diagnosed with
      acute viral rhinosinusitis. The assignment of a patient to a particular treatment is not
      decided in advance but falls within current practice, and is clearly separated from the
      decision to include the patient into the study.

      Study therapy will be applied in accordance with the respective instructions for use.

      Study duration is 7-14 days, depending on the improvement of symptoms. At the end of the
      study, both the investigators and the patients are asked to judge the efficacy and
      tolerability of the treatments.

    <description>Both on day 0 and on day 7 (and, if necessary, depending on study duration, on day 14), the physicians will assess rhinosinusitis symptoms oedema, redness of the nose, nasal obstruction, nasal secretion, facial pain/headache, smell/taste dysfunction and the concomitant symptoms dryness of the nasal mucosa and sore throat. Assessment will be carried out based on a 5-point scale (0=none to 4=very strong). Change of symptoms will be assessed comparing symptom scores on day 7 (or day 14, if applicable) to day 0. The investigators will use rhinoscopy, physical examination and interview of the patients for the assessments.</description>
