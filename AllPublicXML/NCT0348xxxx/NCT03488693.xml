  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on low risk breast cancer receiving usual
      care that includes regional radiation therapy, with receiving no regional radiation therapy.
      Researchers want to see if not giving this type of radiation treatment works as well at
      preventing breast cancer from coming back.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with node positive breast cancer normally will receive endocrine therapy and some may
      receive chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer from coming back. Many women will also
      receive radiotherapy to the whole breast/chest area and the surrounding lymph glands (called
      regional radiotherapy). No one really knows whether patients with low risk breast cancer need
      to receive regional radiotherapy. Some women may be getting regional radiotherapy who do not
      need it. These women may be exposed to the side effects of their treatment without benefit.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.

          -  Patients that have had prior ipsilateral chestwall/thoracic radiation.

          -  Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemo or endocrine therapy for breast cancer.

          -  Patients with serious non-malignant disease (e.g. cardiovascular, scleroderma etc.)
             which would preclude RT.

          -  Patients with any serious active or co-morbid medical conditions, laboratory
             abnormality, psychiatric illness, active or uncontrolled infections, or serious
