  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a long history of antiretroviral
      therapy have more mitochondrial dysfunction- the cells that help them make energy. This
      dysfunction in mitochondria may lead to symptoms of muscle fatigue, physical function
      impairment, and impaired exercise tolerance compared to HIV-uninfected controls of a similar
      age and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the older
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with
      greater impairment in mitochondrial function than the newer agent, tenofovir alafenamide
      (TAF).
