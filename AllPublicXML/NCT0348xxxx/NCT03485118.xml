      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of recombinant human-mouse chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
      injection(HS006) with CHOP(Hi-CHOP) versus Rituximab with CHOP (R-CHOP) in patients with
      previously untreated Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma as first line treatment.

      Secondary objective:

      To evaluate the safety of recombinant human-mouse chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
      injection(HS006) with CHOP(Hi-CHOP) in patients with previously untreated Diffuse Large
      B-cell Lymphoma.

      To study the pharmacokinetics of recombinant human-mouse chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal
      antibody injection(HS006) in patients with previously untreated Diffuse Large B-cell
      Lymphoma.
