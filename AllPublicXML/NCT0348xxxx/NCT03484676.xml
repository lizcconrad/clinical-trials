  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unilateral non-comminuted zygomatic complex fracture undergo fixation of the
      complex by a customized plate at one point after 3D virtual simulation and reduction of the
      complex using Mimics software.

  <detailed_description>

      History data will be gathered including personal data, medical and surgical history, and
      family history.

      Clinical examination and photographic records will be carried out to evaluate the magnitude
      and direction of the displaced zygoma, degree of facial asymmetry, neurosensory affection and
      functional disturbances.

      Computed tomography (CT) scan:

      Patients will receive a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the facial bones [
      Axial cuts, DICOM file, Gantry tilt zero and minimal thickness of 1 mm]. The radiographic
      data will be imported into a surgical simulation software to virtually reduce the fractured
      zygoma and custom design the plate for fixation.

      General operative procedures:

        -  All cases will undergo surgery under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation.

        -  Intraoral maxillary vestibular approach will be used to gain access to the fractured
           zygomatic complex. Reduction of the fractured segment would be achieved using the
           appropriate techniques and instrumentation. One point ORIF would be accomplished using
           the customized plate.
