  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial to determine if the combination of apalutamide with 6 months
      of androgen deprivation therapy by LHRH agonists in patients with intermediate and limited
      high-risk, localized prostate cancer receiving primary radiation therapy (RT) results in an
      improvement of disease-free survival (DFS) evaluated by the treating physician, in comparison
      to the combination of radiation and androgen deprivation therapy without the addition of
      apalutamide.
