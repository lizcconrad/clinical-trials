  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthoracic lung biopsy (TLB) provides a histological diagnosis of nodule or lung mass.
      Pneumothorax is the main complication of TLB with an average of 20%. Many risk factors,
      whether clinical, computed tomography or related to TLB, are described in the literature. The
      British Thoracic Society recommends monitoring for 2 hours after the procedure with a
      possible discharge if the chest X-ray is normal. There is no French or European
      recommendation for monitoring the occurrence of pneumothorax after TLB. In the university
      center of Besan√ßon, France, a minimum supervision of 4 hours is recommended and approximately
      one in two patients is hospitalized until the following day to reach this minimum time of 4
      hours. The objective of the SPOT study is to perform a predictive score of pneumothorax from
      a retrospective cohort of patients for whom a transthoracic lung biopsy was performed and to
      validate this score on a prospective cohort. The expected goal is to select patients who can
      benefit from outpatient care by shortening the post-procedure surveillance period and to
      monitor more long-term only high-risk patients.
