      The present study will carry out a workplace health promotion via MBI to help smoking workers
      to quit smoking. The study will adopt a longitudinal research design with randomized
      quasi-experimental trial. The smoking workers will recruited and be randomly assigned to
      Group A (one lesson of health education on smoking cessation and six lessons of MBI) or Group
      B (one lesson of health education on smoking cessation and six lessons of physical fitness).
      There will be 50 participants in each group. Data will be collected five times.
