  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a sample of 120 officers from Dane County law enforcement agencies, the investigators are
      conducting a randomized controlled trial of an 8-week mindfulness-based training program for
      police officers, Madison Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training (mMBRT), and investigating the
      impact of this training on subjective responses to stress, stress-related psychological and
      physical health outcomes, and biological and behavioral correlates of perceived stress. While
      the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions have been documented in a variety of
      populations, this will be the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind of law
      enforcement personnel. In addition to self-report measures, this study assesses an array of
      objective biological and behavioral outcomes both in the laboratory and in the field that may
      speak to mechanisms of change involved in symptom reduction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      120 police officers will be recruited from Dane County law enforcement agencies to take part
      in an 8-week, group-based, mindfulness-based training program called Madison
      Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training (mMBRT). Officers will be randomized to an active
      group, which will receive mMBRT immediately after baseline assessments, and a waitlist
      control group, which will receive mMBRT after a post-intervention assessment and a subsequent
      follow-up assessment. mMBRT is similar to and inspired by MBRT, and both of these programs
      are law enforcement-specific interventions based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
      (MBSR), a commonly used mindfulness program in many healthcare settings. mMBRT is
      structurally similar to MBSR, with 8 weekly 2-hour classes involving guided meditation
      practices, gentle movement, and group-based discussion (one of these classes, toward the end
      of the course, is approximately 4 hours and integrates many of the practices and teachings
      covered throughout the training program). Participants will be provided with weekly homework
      assignments and audio recordings that provide guided instruction in various meditation and
      yoga practices.

      At three separate timepoints, officers will take part in a laboratory assessment that
      involves the following procedures:

        -  administration of computerized behavioral tasks

        -  completion of self-report questionnaires that assess trauma history and occupational
           stressors, perceived stress, sleep, physical and mental health

        -  collection of a small amount of blood via finger prick and/or venipuncture (to assess
           peripheral inflammatory markers)

        -  collection of a small amount of hair from the scalp (to assess hair cortisol
           concentration)

        -  measurement of height and weight for the assessment of body mass index, and for use with
           activity trackers data

      In conjunction with these laboratory assessments, data will be collected from officers in the
      field over the course of approximately 1 week (coinciding with a regularly scheduled work
      week), including the following procedures:

        -  officers will wear an activity monitor (e.g., Fitbit) to allow for objective monitoring
           of sleep quality and resting heart rate throughout the study

        -  officers will collect saliva samples 4 times per day over 3 days for the assessment of
           salivary cortisol

        -  officers will complete daily logs of work hours, types of events encountered during
           work, perceived stress related to these events, and self-reported mood and affect
           ratings

      These field data will be related to dispatch records, which will provide objective
      information regarding the types of incidents responded to, and the time and location of these
      incidents.

      The laboratory and field assessments will be collected at baseline (prior to randomization);
      after the active mMBRT group completes the intervention; and at a follow-up visit
      (approximately 4 months after the end of the intervention), after which the wait-list group
      will be offered the intervention.

Baseline (T1) measures will be collected prior to treatment assignment. Every effort will be taken to minimize knowledge of group assignment by the study team, in particular the PI and other individuals involved in data analysis; however, the small size of the study team and overlapping roles of team members may preclude masking of group assignment for all members of the study team.</masking_description>
