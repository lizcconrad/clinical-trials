  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned to compare the effect of ketorolac 20 mg to 300 mg of paracetamol when
      added to lidocaine 3 mg/kg for Intravenous regional anaesthesia.

      All patients were premedicated 15 minutes before the surgical procedure with I.V. 0.06mg/kg
      of midazolam. In the operating room, patients were monitored for non invasive blood pressure
      (NIBP), oxygen saturation (Spo2) and pulse rate (PR).

      Two cannulae were placed, one in a vein on the dorsum of the operative hand and the other on
      the non operative hand for i.v fluids. The operative arm was elevated for 2 min and was then
      exsanguinated with an elastic bandage. A pneumatic tourniquet was then placed around the
      upper arm, and the cuff was inflated to 100 mm Hg above systolic BP. Circulatory isolation of
      the arm was verified by inspection, absence of a radial pulse, and a loss of the pulse
      oximetry tracing in the ipsilateral index fingers. The solutions were prepared by an
      anesthesiology assistant not involved in any part of the study. The solutions were injected
      over 90 s by an anaesthesiologist. During surgery if patient reported pain during operation
      (VAS 4 or greater) inj. fentanyl 1 Î¼g/kg was given and total amount used was recorded.
      Postoperatively patients were questioned for pain and if VAS &gt; 4, 75 mg intramuscular
      diclofenac was given.Total amount used was recorded.
