  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-week randomized controlled trial involves two intervention groups (i.e.,
      single-player game group, competition game group) and one control group (i.e., conventional
      checkerboard group). The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of game-based
      training on patient motivation, exercise duration, and functional outcomes in comparison with
      the control group.

      A 12-week three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects between
      the single-player game, competitive game and a control group (i.e. conventional training) on
      the motivation, exercise duration and functional improvement in a rehabilitation program. A
      mix of quantitative method (i.e., questionnaire) and qualitative methods (i.e., interview and
      observation) were used. The outcome measurements were: (1) motivation: Intrinsic Motivation
      Inventory (IMI), (2) participation: exercise duration, (3) functional improvement: nine-hole
      peg test (NHPT) and box and block test (BBT), and (4) user feedback.
