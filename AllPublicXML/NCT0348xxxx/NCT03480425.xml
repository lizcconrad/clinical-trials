      A study of a new approach to determining if, following endotracheal intubation, the
      endotracheal tube (ETT) is in the trachea or the esophagus, and if in the trachea, it is at
      the correct depth. The test for correct placement consists of inflating the cuff to a
      pressure (to be determined by the study) and tugging the ETT gently up and out of the mouth.
      The investigators hypothesize that if it is in the esophagus, it will slide easily all the
      way out; if in the trachea, the cuff will be impeded by catching on the lower surface of the
      cricoid ring, and that this can be felt by the person tugging.

      Introduction Correct endotracheal tube (ETT) placement is important. Ideal ETT position is
      achieved when the distal tip is in mid-trachea with the head in neutral alignment.
      Unrecognized tube misplacement is an uncommon but significant cause of hypoxemia and death
      during general anesthesia and emergency intubation of critically ill patients. It is commoner
      in out-of-hospital intubations, where it is reported to occur in 1 to 15% of cases, often
      with disastrous results.

      Three types of malpositioning can occur: one outside the trachea (esophageal), and two within
      the trachea: too shallow (hypopharyngeal), or too deep (endobronchial). Esophageal intubation
      results in rapid hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and inflation of the stomach as the patient receives
      no ventilation at all. Too-shallow placement of the ETT can result in inadvertent extubation,
      especially with manipulation of head and neck. Endobronchial intubation occurs when the ETT
      is advanced into a mainstem bronchus, which results in hypoxia and the potential for
      barotrauma in the hyperventilated lung.

      Confirmation of correct ETT depth is currently performed by several methods. In the operating
      room, simple measurement of the length of the tube at the corner of the mouth is rapid but
      not reliable. One study improved on this by using additional anatomical landmarks to
      determine ETT tube length as measured at the mouth. It enabled a reduction in the incidence
      of too-deep placement of the ETT from 58.8% to 24%.

      Cuff ballottement at the level of the suprasternal notch is a technique that has been studied
      with cuffed tubes in adults. Ballottement as described in these papers involves moving the
      fingers in a direction normal to the long axis of the ETT in order to alternately compress
      and release the finger pressure on the cuff, while feeling and watching the corresponding
      movement of the pilot balloon. Ease of palpation of ballottement was inconsistent, and in one
      study 15 of 82 patients had ETT tips &lt;2.5 cm above the carina. Studies to date of
      ballottement do not comment on its ability to prevent esophageal intubation. Ultrasound
      guided intubation has been shown to provide correct placement, but requires training and
      machine availability.

      The investigators propose to refine methods of palpating the trachea that the investigators
      studied in previous experiments. The investigators found that palpation of the anterior
      trachea with the fingertips during intubation enabled us to feel the tip of the endotracheal
      tube sliding into the trachea and improve correct depth compared to measurement at the teeth.
      15 That study was undertaken to determine whether palpation of the trachea could enable
      correct position of the endotracheal tube with respect to depth. Esophageal intubation was
      studied subsequently, but the study was stopped when it became clear that the investigators
      could not determine esophageal intubation by anterior tracheal palpation (unpublished).

      However, during two instances of inadvertent esophageal intubation, the investigators
      accidentally discovered a technique that may be able to detect inadvertent esophageal
      intubation as well as ensure correct endotracheal tube depth. Following tracheal intubation,
      with the cuff inflated to 50cm water pressure in the trachea, there will be a sudden marked
      increase in the force necessary to gently tug the endotracheal tube proximally as the
      inflated cuff impinges on the rigid, encircling cricoid cartilage. When the increased force
      is sensed, then pushing the ETT down 2cm will ensure it is correctly positioned. If the cuff
      is in the esophagus, it will slide out without the sudden increased force being felt.

      A simple set of manoeuvres (Tug EndoTracheal Tube: TETT) take about ten seconds:

        1. Intubate the trachea in the usual fashion by clinically indicated techniques.

        2. Gently push the endotracheal tube down a further 2cm (to avoid inflation with the cuff
           within the larynx).

        3. Using a cuff manometer, inflate the cuff to desired water pressure.

        4. Gently tug the endotracheal tube upward until there is a sudden increase in the force
           required to tug it further.

        5. Deflate the cuff to the safe pressure of 20 to 30 cm water pressure, push the ETT
           downward 2 cm (to ensure the cuff is below the larynx), and fix it in place.

      The investigators plan a clinical pilot study of intubation of esophagus versus trachea with
      initial intubation of the esophagus flowed by intubation of the trachea.

      Hypotheses. The specific maneuvers described above (TETT) will enable detection of esophageal
      intubation; there will be an optimal cuff-inflation pressure to distinguish trachea from
      esophagus; and the technique will assure placement of the tip of the ETT within the trachea
      at correct depth (more than 2.5cm above the carina and more than 5cm below the vocal cords).

      Primary outcome. To assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine
      tracheal versus esophageal intubation.

      Secondary outcomes. To find the optimal cuff-inflation pressure to distinguish trachea from
      esophagus and to assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine depth
      of endotracheal tube in the trachea.

      Experimental design. A clinical trial with an objective measure of the difference in force of
      tugging between esophagus and trachea.

      Interventions: Intubation will be by the attending anesthesiologist, who will choose the
      intubating anesthetic and equipment on clinical grounds. The anesthesiologist will intubate
      the esophagus first, and the investigator will and inflate the ETT cuff to various pressures
      in 10cm H2O pressure steps form participant to to determine the lowest inflation pressure
      that clearly differentiates esophagus from trachea. An apparatus including a force transducer
      (LoadStar F-152217557 S-beam sensor run on LoadVue software; Loadstar Sensors Ltd., Fremont
      CA, USA) will be attached to the ETT connector and the testers will perform the gentle
      tugging while recording the force of pull until the ETT comes out of the esophagus. The
      process will be repeated with the trachea. At this point the anesthesiologist will intubate
      the trachea and the tester will carry out the manoeuvre for depth of insertion, after which
      depth of insertion will be measured by fibre-optic bronchoscopy. Only one set of intubations
      will be tested on any participant.

      For depth of insertion, the ETT will be moved carefully to the midline of the mouth without
      changing its tracheal depth, and the ETT depth marking at the upper incisors or gums noted.
      The ETT will be taped in place, and held in place at that exact depth during bronchoscopy.
      Bronchoscopy will be carried out through the ETT via a bronchoscopic elbow connector, thus
      allowing for no break in ventilation.

      Measurements: Data will be recorded on paper data sheets for later transcription to a
      computer spread sheet for analysis. Usual demographics (age, gender, height, weight, type of
      surgery) will be recorded. Whether the investigator thinks the ETT is esophageal, tracheal,
      or can't determine will be recorded. Force transducer data will be digitally recorded on a
      computer for later analysis.

      Depth of the ETT in the trachea will be determined as follows. The bronchoscope will be
      advanced to the carina, and the depth at the elbow connector marked with a spring clip. It
      will then be withdrawn to the ETT tip, and a second clip placed. The bronchoscope will be
      withdrawn further with its light turned off until a focused fibreoptic light shone through
      the cricothyroid membrane is seen, when a third clip is placed on the bronchoscope.
      Bottom-to-bottom measurement of the distance between the clips will enable accurate
      measurement of the distance from the carina to the ETT tip, and measurement of second to
      third clip will give the distance from EET tip to cricothyroid membrane, while adding the
      estimated distance from cricothyroid membrane to cords will give distance from ETT tip to
      vocal cords.
