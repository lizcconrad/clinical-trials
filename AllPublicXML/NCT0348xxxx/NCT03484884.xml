    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test Cerenkov luminescence imaging, which is a different way
      to take pictures of thyroid cancer and/or any tumors with (existing or suspected) nodal
      metastases in the neck, supraclavicular, axillary and/or inguinal region.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is 18 years of age or old

          -  Patients with thyroid cancer scheduled for thyroid ablation therapy with 131I

          -  Patients with any tumors with (existing or suspected) nodal metastases in the neck,
             supraclavicular, axillary and/or inguinal region who are scheduled to receive a
             clinical FDG PET/CT scan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients imaged for Cerenkov luminescence are going to be required to be in a darkened
             enclosure for at least 10 minutes and sit still during image acquisition. Any
             conditions that would prevent this will exclude the patients. This includes patients
             who unable to sit in a dark environment, have claustrophobic, inability to sit still
             for a few minutes

          -  Any other past medical, physiological or demographic concerns. This includes any
             patients with skin blemishes that are present at the dermis over the tumor, as these
             are of particular interest for use of this technique. This also includes open wounds
             on the area of interest.
