  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the mass balance and routes of excretion of total
      radioactivity after a single oral 200 mg dose of [14C]rogaratinib given as a solution. For
      further clinical development, human mass balance data are required to elucidate the
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of rogaratinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The written informed consent must be signed before any study specific tests or
             procedures are done

          -  Age: 21 to 65 years (inclusive) at the first screening examination visit

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) and a total body weight of
             55 to 100 kg (both inclusive)

          -  Healthy male subject, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based
             on a medical evaluation including medical history, laboratory tests, physical, cardiac
             and full ophthalmologic examination

          -  Subjects of reproductive potential with a partner of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use adequate contraception when sexually active. This applies from signing of
             the ICF until 3 months after the study drug administration. The definition of adequate
             contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator and on local
             requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not limited to, (i)
             condoms (male or female, should not be used together) with or without a spermicidal
             agent; (ii) diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device;
             (iv) hormone-based contraception. Subjects must agree to utilize two reliable and
             acceptable methods of contraception simultaneously. This is not required if safe
             contraception is achieved by a permanent method, such as vasectomy of the subject or
             bilateral fallopian tube blockage of the subject's partner; OR if the subject has no
             requirement for contraception (e.g. same sex partners).

          -  Ability to understand and follow study-related instructions

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases for which it can be assumed that the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the study drugs will
             not be normal

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to rogaratinib or to excipients in the
             formulation, or to any FGFR inhibitor

          -  Known severe allergies, non-allergic drug reactions, or multiple drug allergies

          -  Relevant diseases within the last 4 weeks prior to the first study drug administration

          -  Current diagnosis of any retinal detachment, retinal pigment epithelial detachment
             (RPED), serous retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion

          -  Presence of high myopia or pathological myopia (defined as spherical equivalent ≥
             6.00D), or any retinal abnormalities consistent with pathologic myopia

          -  Known recent use of recreational drugs (last 3 months), suspicion of drug or alcohol
             abuse, or positive results of the urine drug or alcohol screen at screening or
             baseline

          -  Use of any medication within 14 days before administration of the study drug except
             paracetamol

          -  Smoking more than 5 cigarettes daily

          -  Exposure to radiation for diagnostic reasons (except dental X rays and plain X rays of
             thorax and bony skeleton [excluding spinal column]), during work or during
             participation in a clinical study in the period of 1 year prior to screening

          -  Participation in another study with a radiation burden of &gt; 0.1 mSv and ≤ 1 mSv in the
             period of 1 year prior to screening; a radiation burden of &gt; 1.1 mSv and ≤ 2 mSv in
             the period of 2 years prior to screening; a radiation burden of &gt; 2.1 mSv and ≤ 3 mSv
             in the period of 3 years prior to screening, etc (add 1 year per 1 mSv)

          -  Previous (within the preceding 3 months; end of previous study to first treatment of
             the current study) or concomitant participation in another clinical study with
             investigational medicinal product(s)
