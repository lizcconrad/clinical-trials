  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that repeated or chronic ketamine use, as compared to acute ketamine users,
      posed a higher clinical risk of developing psychotic disorders, potentially related to the
      underlying chronic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction, and a higher risk of
      suffering from schizophrenia particularly in those genetically susceptible, or genetically
      predisposed ketamine abusers. With ketamine infusion rises as a emerging hope as an acute
      treatment for depression and suicidality under the shadow of unknown longer term
      psychotomimetic effects peculiarly amongst repeated or chronic use, the current case-control
      study aims to investigate: a) if repeated or chronic ketamine use is associated with an
      increased risk of psychosis by comparing those ketamine abusers with and without psychosis,
      and to those non-ketamine-using drug abusers with psychosis; and b) if genetic predisposition
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with risk of psychosis in ketamine
      abusers.
