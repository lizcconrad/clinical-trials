  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well neutron radiation therapy and pembrolizumab work in
      treating participants with urothelial carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body.
      Neutron radiation therapy uses high energy neutrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving radiation therapy and pembrolizumab may work better in treating
      participants with urothelial carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate to neutron radiation (with high relative biological
      effectiveness relative to standard photon radiation) to a metastatic focus in combination
      with standard of care checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), in patients with
      advanced urothelial carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival.

      II. Overall survival.

      III. Safety and tolerability as evaluated by the incidence, severity, duration, causality,
      seriousness, and type(s) of adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 22. On day 23,
      participants may undergo an optional tumor biopsy and receive 3-5 treatments of neutron
      radiation therapy over 2 weeks on days 23-42. Participants receive pembrolizumab IV on day 43
      and continue per standard of care in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months.
