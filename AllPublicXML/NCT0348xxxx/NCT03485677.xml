      old).

      Secondary Objective:

      Evaluate the efficacy of eliglustat and quality of life in pediatric patients (≥2 to &lt;18

      The study will include a screening period of up to 60 days (Day -60 to -1), a primary
      analysis treatment period (Day 1 to Week 52) and a long-term treatment period (Week 53 to
      Week 104). After study completion, patients will be encouraged to enroll in the International
      Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry.

             type 3 with documented deficiency of acid beta-glucosidase activity by enzyme assay
             and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) genotype.

          -  Postmenarchal female patients must have a documented negative pregnancy test prior to
             enrollment and throughout the study. Patients must be willing to practice true

             pre-specified treatment goals, as defined by:

             tachycardia (VT).

          -  The patient has any clinically significant disease other than GD.

             enrollment.

          -  The patient is unable to receive treatment with imiglucerase due to a known
             hypersensitivity or is unwilling to receive imiglucerase treatment every 2 weeks.

          -  The patient has a known hereditary galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or
             glucose galactose malabsorption, or is a CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer or
