  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol involves functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy acquisitions immediately before and after Low Field Magnetic Stimulation
      treatment on two separate days in a sham controlled, randomized trial, in order to assess the
      physiologic effects of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation on brain function in a geriatric
      population with bipolar depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will examine changes in brain activity from Low Field
      Magnetic Stimulation in subjects over the age of 50 with bipolar disorder who are currently
      depressed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and proton Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy. Following screening visits, study procedures include two visits, at least two
      weeks apart, during which subjects will complete brief mood scales, undergo 15 minutes of
      imaging, receive 20 minutes of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation treatment, and then return to
      the scanner to undergo another 15 minutes of imaging procedures. Due to the crossover design,
      subjects receiving active treatment during the first visit will receive sham treatment during
      the second visit; subjects receiving sham treatment during the first visit will receive
      active treatment during the second visit. A follow-up phone call will occur two days after
      each imaging/treatment visit. The main endpoint of this study is the observation of changes
      in resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activity in post-treatment
      acquisitions as compared to pre-treatment acquisitions.

    <description>Comparison of change in brain activity occurring over the time of treatment, compared between active and sham treatment visits. This is assessed by combining pre and post treatment measures made during active and sham treatment visits using the following formula: (post active treatment - pre active treatment) - ( post sham - pre sham). The brain activity is measured using blood oxygenation level dependent image of brain activity acquired in the resting state using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</description>
