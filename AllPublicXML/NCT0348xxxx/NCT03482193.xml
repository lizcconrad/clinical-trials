  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in children and adolescents has become a major public health problem in recent years.
      In Belgium, 20% of people aged between 2 and 17 are overweight and 7% suffer from obesity.
      While studies often associate this overweight with socio-economic level, other factors, such
      as health literacy (HL), may also play a role. Among adolescents, some studies have shown an
      association between the level of HL and the Body Mass Index (BMI). Our study aims to
      investigate the association between HL of adolescents and their BMI.

      This is a cross-sectional survey among 9 high schools in a medium city of Belgium, including
      254 high school students aged between 12-17 years. Health literacy was assessed by the Health
      Literacy Measure for Adolescents (HELMA). Student's age, sex, weight, size and parental
      socio-economic status are gathered in the medical file during the medical examination
      organized by the schools after obtaining the informed consent of the students and their
      parents.

    <description>The degree to which individuals can obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. It also includes the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health. It is measured by the Health Literacy Measure for Adolescents (HELMA) (Ghanbari et al., 2016), which is composed of 44 items. Health literacy was categorized into 4 categories based on the score to the questionnaire: excellent, sufficient, problematic and inadequate.</description>
