  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While ASA is not a cancer medication, research suggests that taking ASA reduces the
      probability of getting many types of cancer because of its anti-inflammatory action.
      Inflammation in the ovaries during ovulation is thought to contribute to the development of
      ovarian cancer, and, because ASA is an anti-inflammatory medication, it may help to prevent
      it.

      The standard or usual treatment for women with a high risk gene mutation, BRCA1 or BRCA2, is
      to have risk-reducing surgery to remove the fallopian tubes and ovaries (bilateral
      salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy inclusive of fimbria) after they have
      decided not to have more children naturally.

      Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) is a safe, well tolerated drug taken by mouth. ASA has been
      available for over 100 years and has been used mainly to relieve fever and pain, but also as
      an anti-inflammatory medication in order to reduce inflammation (swelling).
