  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance has been long-standing torments in most of patients with maintenance
      hemodialysis (HD). In this study, we attempted to explore whether long-term hemoperfusion
      (HP) could improve sleep disorder and increase overall survival rate in HD patients.

    <description>These patients were computer-matched into two groups, involving 100 patients with absolute HD vs. 100 cases with HD+HP.HP was performed 1-2 times/per 2 weeks, and each session lasted for two hours.Self-reported sleep disturbance was evaluated before and after observational time (two-year period), which lasted at least 7 hours based on the recommendations presented by National Institute of Health (NIH). Sleep efficiency (%) was calculated as the ratio of sleep duration to total time in bed, and was multiplied by 100.</description>
