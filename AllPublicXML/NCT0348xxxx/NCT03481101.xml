      Response evaluation with FDG-PET and free circulating DNA in patients with inoperable lung
      cancer of non small cell type during first treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventional study of patients with inoperable lung cancer of non small cell type
      undergoing 1st treatment of either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Patients are evaluated with
      FDG-PET/ct and blood analyses og circulating tumor DNA and cancer markers to determine early
      response.

      PET-CT are preceded before and after treatment is given;

        -  day 0 before treatment,

        -  day 2 after treatment and

        -  day 21 just before second treatment. At every FDG-PET/ct scan blood are examined for
           circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and potentially cancer markers by White genome sequencing.
           In total 3 PET-CT scans and 4 blood samples are performed. The result are compared with
           the standard CT scan after 2-3 cycles of treatment. Blood analyses are repeated after
           2-3 cycles to observe any changes.
