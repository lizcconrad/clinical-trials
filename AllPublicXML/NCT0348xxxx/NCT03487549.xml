      This is a Phase 2, open label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      VP-102 in subjects (2 years and older) with common warts. Subjects will be enrolled in the
      study until 20 subjects have completed the EOS visit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive study drug containing 0.7% cantharidin topical film forming
      solution. Dermatologic exams, wart counts, measurement of diameter and height of each wart
      and Evaluation of Response to Treatment (ERT) will be conducted by a qualified member of the
      research team at Treatment Visits 1, 2, 3 and 4 as well as at the End of Study (EOS) Visit.
      Evaluations are to be conducted prior to treatment application when applicable.

          -  Be healthy, immunocompetent males or females at least 2 years of age or older.

          -  Present with 1-6 common warts (verruca vulgaris) located anywhere on the body except
             for the following prohibited areas: the eye area (including eyelids), lips, oral

             area. (Warts within 10 mm of a mucosal surface should not be treated).

          -  All warts must be ≤10 mm in diameter and ≤3 mm in height. (Subjects with warts that
             are adjacent, touching or clustered may be included so long as the combined diameter
             in the longest direction does not exceed 10 mm. Individual lesions that are adjacent,
             touching or clustered should be counted as distinct lesions for the purposes of
             tracking, inclusion and clearance).

          -  All warts must be present for at least 4 weeks at baseline visit.

          -  Consent to having all warts treated (the physician must also be willing to treat all
             warts initially present).

          -  Be otherwise medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history,
             physical examination or vital signs as determined by the investigator.

          -  Are free of any systemic or dermatologic disorder, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk of AEs.

          -  Refrain from swimming, bathing or prolonged immersion in water or any liquids until
             the Study drug is removed.

          -  Have the ability, or have a guardian with the ability, to follow study instructions
             and be likely to complete all study requirements.

          -  Agree to use no wart-removing product (prescription or over-the-counter [OTC]) other
             than the Study drug during the course of the study.

          -  Provide written informed consent or assent in a manner approved by the institutional
             review board (IRB) and/or have a parent/guardian provide written informed consent as

          -  Provide written authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information.

          -  Subjects that agree to participate in the optional photos portion of the study: Agree
             to allow photographs of warts to be taken at each treatment visit by the research team
             and agree to share photos taken at home with the research team via text, email or
             in-person upload.

             (Routine use of inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids during the study is allowed.)

          -  Have any chronic or acute medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator,
             may interfere with the study results or place the subject at undue risk. (e.g., human
             immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, viral hepatitis, uncontrolled
             diabetes).

          -  Have more than 6 common warts at baseline.
