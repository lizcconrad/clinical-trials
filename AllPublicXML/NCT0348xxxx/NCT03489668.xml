      Rationale and Hypothesis We have previously reported that theca cells (TC) responses to hCG
      in women with PCOS represent a spectrum where some exhibit exaggerated increases of 17OHP
      while in others 17OHP responses resemble those of normal women (Maas KH et al, JCEM, 2015).
      The basis for this differential responsiveness is not clear. Earlier studies reported that
      17OHP responses to gonadotropin stimulation were heterogeneous among PCOS women, which was
      attributed to the degree of hyperinsulinemia (Pasquali R et al, JCEM, 2007). However,
      assessment of the ovary was omitted in the analysis. In preliminary studies, we have found
      that in women with PCOS, insulin sensitivity was strongly correlated with insulin sensitivity
      index as assessed by the method of Matsuda and DeFronzo (Diabetes Care, 1999). However, the
      study lacked sufficient numbers. Further analysis of insulin sensitivity with respect to hCG
      stimulated theca cell responses is warranted.

      We have also examined 17OHP responses to hCG in relationship to antral follicle count and
      anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in PCOS and normal women. In PCOS women, as expected, serum AMH
      correlated with antral follicle count. However, TC responses in PCOS were inversely related
      to AMH (Maas KH et al, JCEM, 2015). These novel observations suggested that in PCOS AMH
      production may reflect redistribution of the follicle population. In human ovaries maximal
      immunodetection of AMH is observed in small (&lt; 4 mm) antral follicles followed by a rapid and
      progressive decline until an absence of the protein by 8 mm (Weenen C et al, Mol Hum Reprod,
      2004). This consideration raises the issue of whether normal AMH levels represent more
      advanced follicle growth in some PCOS women compared with that of others with elevated AMH
      levels. An increased stage of follicle development would be accompanied by increased TC
      hyperplasia and may account for greater 17OHP responses to hCG stimulation. A comparison of
      TC responses to hCG with ovarian morphology has not be done in women with PCOS.

      Based on these findings, we hypothesize that in PCOS, heterogeneous TC responses to hCG
      reflect differences in morphometric development of the follicle population. In addition, the
      positive correlation between insulin sensitivity and TC responses to hCG suggest an effect of
      hyperinsulinemia. We propose to investigate the relationship between theca cell responses to
      hCG, follicle morphology, and insulin sensitivity before and following treatment with an
      insulin lowering drug, metformin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50-100 PCOS and 50-100 normal women matched for age (&lt;37 yr) and BMI (&lt;35) will be studied.
      PCOS and normal women in the mid-follicular phase (day 5-7) of the menstrual cycle will
      receive an iv injection of hCG as previously described (see Experimental Design). Basal and
      stimulated blood samples will be assessed for 17OHP, androgens, gonadotropins and AMH.
      Detailed 3-D ultrasound imaging will be done prior to hCG stimulation (see Experimental
      Design). Ovarian morphology will include volume, antral follicle number, and the size of each
      follicle visualized.

      Screening 100 women with PCOS and 100 normal women will be studied.

      PCOS will be defined according to NIH criteria:

        -  &lt;8 spontaneous menses per year

        -  hyperandrogenism clinically (Ferriman-Gallway score≥8 or total testosterone&gt;0.5ng/ml).

        -  Absence of CAH, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorder, Cushings syndrome, hypothalamic
           anovulation.

      Subjects will have a screening visit to establish eligibility and to sign the informed
      consent. They will have a history and physical examination performed which will include a
      urine pregnancy test, a transvaginal ultrasound, thyroid studies, a fasting chemistry panel,
      and a hemoglobin.

      Experimental Design Phase 1 (Pretreatment)

        1. In all subjects images of the both ovaries will be obtained using 3D technology and the
           number, size, and spatial arrangement of ovarian follicles will be noted for both
           ovaries in each subject.

        2. Normal subjects will be studied during the mid-follicular phase of the cycle (Days 5-9)
           while PCOS women will be anovulatory and will not have a cycle day parameter.

        3. On study day one, recombinant-hCG (r-hCG) will be administered intravenously at a dose
           of 25 micrograms.

        4. Blood samples will be obtained at 1 hour before (T = -1), immediately prior (T = 0), and
           24 hours after (T = +24) iv hCG injection.

        5. Sera will be assayed at all time points for steroid and peptide hormones including
           17OHP, androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, LH, FSH, and AMH.

        6. All subjects will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test. Each will be placed on a
           300-gram carbohydrate diet for three days before the study. On the day of testing each
           subject will ingest 75 gm of a glucose solution and blood samples for glucose and
           insulin will be obtained at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after the glucose load.

      Phase 2 (Posttreatment)

        1. Each PCOS subject will be administered metformin, 1500 mg/day for 3 months. All subjects
           will be encouraged to maintain same dietary and exercise activity throughout the course
           of study.

        2. After 3 months of treatment, all tests as described in Phase 1 will be repeated.
