  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth decay is one of the most common chronic infectious disease found in children worldwide
      and if left untreated, is rapidly progress. Severe tooth decay in children is not only affect
      child's health and school performance, but also has impact on the family well-being. Oral
      rehabilitation in children requires time, resources and effort of dental specialists, the
      child and parents. Caries is a destructive condition of organic and inorganic components of
      the tooth structures but reversible and most importantly, preventable. Topical fluoride
      therapy, delivered by dentists has been effectively used to speed up the repair process as
      well as to strengthen the surface of intact tooth structure. Topical fluoride is available in
      various preparations. Regular application of sodium fluoride varnish is every three months,
      by far, considered as effective method in preventing new caries, particularly in the
      high-risk children. It has the advantage of containing therapeutic concentration of fluoride
      and ability to flow over and stick to the tooth surface. Whereas silver ion and relatively
      higher fluoride concentration in Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) has been shown to be the most
      effective in harden the decay, stop the caries progress and eliminate pathogenic bacteria. It
      can be hypothesize that when use in combination in school children, both reagents might have
      synergistic effect on arresting existing caries as well as preventing new caries.

      Fluoride varnish is a good choice to consider. For caries prevention in young children, It
      has high efficacy in caries prevention.

      Fluoride varnish has a high F concentration and prolong contact time with enamel, So it can
      prevent new caries and remineralize initial enamel caries. Silver diamine fluoride solution
      is effective in arresting dentine caries. Silver diamine fluoride has high fluoride
      concentration and contain silver ion. when apply dentine caries or cavitated caries can
      increase hardness of dentine and arresting caries.

      When use in combination, it might enhance, the Efficacy in Arresting and Preventing Dental
      Caries in children
