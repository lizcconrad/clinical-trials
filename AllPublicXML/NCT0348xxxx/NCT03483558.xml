    <textblock>
      Plant-based foods have always been an important component of a healthy diet. High intake of
      plant foods may not only maintain normal bodily functions through the provision of dietary
      fiber, vitamins, and minerals but also relieve symptoms and prevent diseases. Many studies
      have pointed out that high intake of plant foods may reduce the incidence of non-communicable
      disease. Past research investigating the effect of phytochemicals has usually been limited to
      single substances or single foods. However, a number of researchers have pointed out that
      phytonutrients and dietary components are likely to act synergistically.Health effects and
      mechanisms of phytonutrients in combination have not been carefully studied in population
      settings. The technology of metabolomics has enabled the simultaneous measurement of hundreds
      of small molecules in biological samples. Exploring the change of metabolites after feeding
      can not only help us understand the role of plant foods, but may also provide opportunities
      to assess plant food intake levels.
