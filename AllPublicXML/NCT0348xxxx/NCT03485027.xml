  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, single-center prospective phase II study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of rechallenge chemotherapy in the third or later-line treatment in
      patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The primary end point is progression free survival
      (PFS). A total of 42 patients who failed with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and fluorouracil in
      previous treatment and could not receive the target therapy presently are planned for
      recruitment. For patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who met admission criteria,
      oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemo regimen could be used and evaluation was repeated
      every 6 weeks. The treatment continues until the disease progression or the untolerable
      adverse reaction.

      The treatment for reintroduction was oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemo-regimen.

      Optional chemotherapy regimen included XELOX,FOLFOX,FOLFIRI,Irinotecan single-agent

             restored, with the time interval from last dose of cytotoxic drugs, radiation or

             recovery to Grade II or less

          4. With other malignant tumor in 5 years; except for cured cervical carcinoma in situ or
             basal cell carcinoma

          5. Symptomatic intracranial or meningeal metastasis

          6. History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system dysfunction or mental
             disorder

          7. Uncontrolled pleural or peritoneal effusion
