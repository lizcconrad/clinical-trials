      Indocarditis is an endogenous infection acquired when organisms entering the blood

      stream establish on the heart valves, therefore, any bacteremia can potentially result in
      endocarditis.

      Infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease that often presents as pyrexia of unknown
      origin.

      The mortality rate in endocarditis was very high before the antibiotic era, even now a day,
      the

      mortality rate is around 20%(1).A variety of microorganisms can cause IE; staphylococci and
      streptococci account for the majority of cases. Staphylococcal IE is a common cause of
      healthcare-associated IE ; streptococcal IE is a common cause of community-acquired IE.
      Common bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus , Viridans group streptococci ,
      Enterococcus, Coagulase-negative staphylococci , Streptococcus bovis , other streptococci ,
      gram-negative bacteria, HACEK organisms in this category include a number of fastidious
      gram-negative bacilli: Haemophilus aphrophilus(subsequently called Aggregatibacter
      aphrophilus and Aggregatibacter paraphrophilus); Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans
      (subsequently called Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans); Cardiobacterium hominis;
      Eikenella corrodens; and Kingella kingae , and fungi (1,2). A variable proportion of IE
      remain blood culture- negative (1-4). Most clinically significant bacteremias are detected
      within 48 hours; common and fastidious pathogens (such as members of the HACEK group) may be
      detected within five days of incubation with modern automated blood culture detection
      systems. The optimal volume of blood for each blood culture in adults is 20 ml.

      Zoonotic agents, such as Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp., and Bartonella spp. were
      frequently detected in North Africa and identified as causes of infective endocarditis (IE)
      in Egypt (3,4).Blood culture is the most important investigation for diagnosing infective
      endocarditis

      andto know the prevalence rate of different bacteria and their antibiotic sensitivity
      pattern.Positive blood culture is the cornerstone of microbiological diagnosis of IE; three
      sets of blood cultures detect 96 to 98 percent of bacteremia. At least three sets of blood
      cultures should be obtained from separate venipuncture sites prior to initiation of
      antibiotic therapy. Patients with IE typically have continuous bacteremia; therefore, blood
      cultures may be collected at any time and need not necessarily be obtained at the time of
      fever or chills.

      MATERIAL and METHOD A total of 150 blood cultures were received from 50 clinically diagnosed
      cases of bacterial endocarditis .

      Blood sample was collected under all aseptic precautions.
