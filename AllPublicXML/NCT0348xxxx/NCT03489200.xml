  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of EH301 in patients
      with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Patients with ALS are randomized to receive either EH301
      or placebo daily and undergo active evaluation for 6 months.

    <measure>ALSFRS-r</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>ALS Functional Rating Scale - revised score is a summation of ratings across across fine and gross motor, bulbar and respiratory functional domains. The scale ranges from 0-48, with higher total score representing better outcomes. The twelve subscales are rated on a five-point scale from 0 (can't do) to 4 (normal ability) and combined to compute the total score. This outcome measures change observed from baseline to 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MRC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medical Research Council Scale measures the strength of muscles in ALS patients. This 11-step grading scale is a summation of scores for 8 different muscles, each with a subscale of 0 (no muscle contraction) to 5 (normal power). To calculate the total MRC Index a progressively increasing number from 0 (0 in the scale) to 10 (5 in the scale) is given to each step and each muscle. The total MRC index per patient corresponds to the sum of the numbers given to all 8 muscles. This outcome measures change observed in MRC Index from baseline to 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FVC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Vital Capacity is a predictor of survival and disease progression in ALS patients and is measured using a touch spirometer and expressed as the % of standard value depending on sex, weight, and age parameters. This outcome measures change observed from baseline to 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electromyogram</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A surface electromyogram (EMG) measuring device is used to measure muscle activity in the same muscles as the MRC Index. Muscle activity is expressed as the EMG amplitude (uV).
This outcome measures change in EMG amplitude observed from baseline to 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fat and skeletal muscle weights (kg) are calculated following standard anthropometric procedures. Fat and skeletal weight outcomes refer to change observed comparing baseline vs 6 months.</description>
