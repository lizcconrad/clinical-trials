  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to include both operable and inoperable patients with esophagus cancer
      in this prospective trial. Since both proton and photon treatments are biologically
      equivalent, the investigators do not expect a difference in tumor control compared to
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The investigators have a prospective experience
      of physician-reported toxicity and patient outcome using IMRT for patients with inoperable
      esophagus cancer that will serve as a comparison group. For the resectable patients receiving
      trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery), the investigators will carefully
      track toxicity and patient outcomes prospectively. The central hypothesis is that the
      biologic efficacy for tumor control should be similar between protons and photons, and
      therefore survival measures should be similar between the two groups, but that the main
      difference lies in the total severe toxicities experienced by the patients undergoing
      therapy.

    <measure>Change from baseline to 6 months following end of chemoradiation in patient-reported outcomes of PBT for esophageal cancer as measured by the MDASI-Plus</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months following chemoradiation (estimated to be 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The MDASI-plus is a reliable, validated tool for assessing cancer-related symptoms regardless of therapy or specific cancer diagnosis. Patients are asked to fill out a twenty-seven question inventory, ranking their symptoms on a 0 (no problems) to 10 (worst imaginable) scale before treatment, weekly during treatment, and in treatment follow-up.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes of PBT for esophageal cancer as measured by the EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months following chemoradiation (estimated to be 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized 2-part, patient-administered instrument used for direct and indirect assessment of health state utilities. The first part asks respondents to &quot;check the ONE box [next to the appropriate statement] that best describes your health TODAY&quot; for each of 5 health dimensions, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The second part of the EQ-5D is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state. Both the 5-item index score and the VAS score are transformed into a utility score between 0 &quot;Worst health state&quot; and 1 &quot;Best health state.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes of PBT for esophageal cancer as measured by the SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months following chemoradiation (estimated to be 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 will be measured at each of 7 interviews, and mental and physical component scores will be calculated in addition to calculating the measure's eight individual subscales (physical functioning, social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, body pain, general health, role limitations due to emotional problems general health, vitality, and mental health). Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes of PBT for esophageal cancer as measured by the MOS Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months following chemoradiation (estimated to be 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The 19-item Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey was designed for use with patients with chronic diseases and measures how often different kinds of support are available, if needed. Response choices range from &quot;none of the time&quot; (1) to &quot;all of the time&quot; (5). A mean social support score for all 19 items is computed with higher scores indicating a greater availability of social support.</description>
