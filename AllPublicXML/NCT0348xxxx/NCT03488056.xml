  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using the ICCMS
      (International Caries Classification And Management System)in reducing caries lesions
      incidence compared to a control group that use different criteria as a not systematic and
      standardized prevention strategy. The study will be performed among children attending to the
      social project of Social Service of Commerce (SESC), Sao Paulo. The sample will be composed
      of 460 children aging between 7 to 12 years old registered in CURUMIM Program from eight
      dental centers of SESC. A randomized controlled study with parallel group will be conducted.
      The centers will be randomized between the 2 strategies, defining 2 groups with 4 centers
      each. The experimental group that will follow the criteria defined by the ICCMS will evaluate
      clinical and behavioral variables, it will define: evaluation of the caries risk of the
      patient, evaluation of the intraoral risk, diagnosis of the caries lesion and its respective
      activity, plan decision individualized treatment for the patient and indication of recall
      interval according to the risk of caries. In the control group, children need will be solved
      according to rthe routinely dental practices in the center, but the determination of the
      child's general and intraoral risk of developing new caries lesions will not be performed nor
      the scheduling of specific recall intervals according to the risk.

    <intervention_model_description>The randomization was made by centers of the SESC (Social Service of the Commerce) of São Paulo state. Four centers will follow the ICCMS criteria and four other centers will follow criteria for diagnosis and treatment of SESC. The randomization will be stratified by sociodemographical conditions. The minimization will be used to equate preexisting oral health-related activities. According to allocated strategy, dentists in the center will guide their conduct with children attended to the CURUMIM project.</intervention_model_description>

After a certain time of the study, a blind investor will examine the children's centers and evaluate the outcome of the study. This researcher will not know which center is a control or experimental group.</masking_description>

The patient's caries risk assessment, Diagnosis of caries lesion and activity assessment Intraoral risk assessment, Decide on a personalized care plan for patient and clinical interventions.After asses all the factors and defining the patient's individual risk, the system presents a personalized treatment plan, indicating the appropriate home care instructions, clinical interventions and specific treatment for each caries lesion categories.

After asses all the factors and defining the patient's individual risk, the system presents a personalized treatment plan, indicating the appropriate home care instructions, clinical interventions and specific treatment for each caries lesion categories.
The treatment is divided into Non-Operative Care and Tooth-Preserving Operative Care (restorations with minimal intervention to preserve maximum dental structure).
The return intervals will be scheduled according to the risk: low risk (return of 1 year), moderate risk (6 months) and high risk (3 months)</description>
