  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary care offers a promising setting for promoting parenting practices that shape healthy
      eating and physical activity behaviors of young children. This study assessed the impact of a
      parent-based, primary care intervention on the feeding habits, health behaviors, and body
      mass index (BMI) of 2-5 year olds with elevated or rapidly-increasing BMI. Four private
      pediatric offices in West Michigan were assigned as control (n=2) or intervention (n=2) sites
      based on patient load and demographics. Treatment families were recruited at well-child
      visits to receive physician health-behavior counseling and four visits with a registered
      dietitian nutritionist (RDN) over a 6-month period. Outcomes included percent of the 95th BMI
      percentile (%BMI95), the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity survey (FNPA), and the
      Feeding Practices and Structure Questionnaire (FPSQ).

    <intervention_model_description>We Are for Children, LLC (WAFC), is a collaboration of non-profit pediatric practices in West Michigan formed to help members respond to healthcare needs. Four primary care pediatric offices from WAFC were selected to participate in the current study based on site interest and capacity. Participating pediatric offices were then matched into pairs based on similarities in office size (i.e. physician FTEs and patient load) and patient demographics characteristics, after which one of each matched pair was assigned as a treatment or control site.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The study intervention included two primary components: 1) physician-family health behavior conversations during well-child visits, and 2) four monthly visits with a RDN to evaluate, educate, and implement improved feeding habits and nutritional choices. A third optional component of the intervention included counseling sessions with a social worker to help families overcome barriers to change, such as food security, family relationships, and general parenting strategies.</description>

    <description>Control parents signed the informed consent document and then completed all baseline assessments during their child's medical visit. Control participants then received their usual medical care. Follow-up evaluations, including child anthropometry and completion of study surveys were assessed approximately 6 months later during a second office visit. For children &lt;3 years of age at baseline, follow up visits coincided with their subsequent well-child visit (i.e. 30-month or 3-year appointment) as per AAP visit frequency recommendations. For patients ≥3 years of age, families attended a separate office visit 6 months after their baseline visit in order to complete follow-up study assessments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 2 and 5 years

          -  BMI ≥85th percentile for age and sex, using the 2000 CDC growth chart, or BMI
             percentile increase within the past year equivalent to crossing at least two growth
             chart lines per year on a standard CDC growth chart, excluding the 5th percentile
             (e.g., 10th &amp; 25th, 25th &amp; 50th, 50th &amp; 75th, 75th &amp; 85th). This rate of increase is
             equivalent to ≥0.67 standard deviations per year (BMI z-score), and, when occurring in
             this age group, has been shown to increase risk of adult obesity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known disorder of the HPA axis

          -  Use of glucocorticoid medication

          -  Non-English speaking
