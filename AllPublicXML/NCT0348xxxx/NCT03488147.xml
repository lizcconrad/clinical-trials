  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers wish to investigate whether proton pump inhibitors, administered prior to or
      after surgery, can reduce the incidence and/or severity of difficulty swallowing foods and/or
      liquids,following anterior cervical surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over half of patients who underwent anterior cervical surgery may experience dysphagia in the
      month following the operation. Dysphagia, characterized as difficulty swallowing foods and/or
      liquids, is a debilitating condition that not only reduces the quality of life for our
      patients but also results in poor nutritional intake, which may lead to delays in healing and
      recovery after surgery.

      Current understanding of dysphagia following cervical surgery is very rudimentary. Many
      published reports were retrospective studies where the incidence of dysphagia was later found
      to be greatly underreported. Furthermore, many studies utilized small sample sizes producing
      varying data regarding the incidence and severity of postoperative dysphagia. Most
      importantly, a review of the medical literature failed to find any consistently proven
      recommendations or therapies that can reduce the incidence or severity of postoperative
      dysphagia.

      A recently published study shows that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also a common
      complaint following anterior cervical surgery. The study also shows a positive correlation
      between the severity of postoperative GERD and severity of postoperative dysphagia. Other
      studies also showed that patients suffering from GERD-associated dysphagia may be
      successfully treated with proton pump inhibitors. Based on these studies, along with
      anecdotal reports, the investigators hypothesize that proton pump inhibitors may reduce the
      incidence and/or severity of dysphagia following anterior cervical surgery.
