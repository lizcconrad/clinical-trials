  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether once daily treatment for up to 8 weeks of
      calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel is more effective than twice daily treatment
      of calcipotriol scalp solution in patients with scalp psoriasis. The primary outcome is
      patients with clear or minimal disease after 8 weeks treatment.

      Further the occurrence of relapse and rebound after end of treatment in patients with clear
      or minimal disease will be investigated.
